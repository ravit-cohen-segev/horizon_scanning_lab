The guideline was developed to ""minimize the risk of human DNA contamination in products used to collect, store and analyze biological material for forensic purposes."" These requirements seek to improve the quality of forensic DNA testing by minimizing the risk of human DNA contamination during the manufacturing process. ""ISO 18385 provides guidance to manufacturers on how to minimize the chance of a contamination event and sets pass/fail criteria so that manufacturers can, for the first time, test their products against the requirements of the forensic industry,"" stated Dr. Linzi Wilson-Wilde, Director of the National Institute of Forensic Science, Australia/New Zealand and co-author of the Australian Standard upon which the ISO standard is based. Two Promega scientists, Kristina Pearson, Bulk Production Manager, and Susan Wigdal, Senior Quality Assurance Scientist, were selected by the United States Technical Advisory Group to represent the U.S. on the development of ISO 18385. In addition to Dr. Wilson-Wilde, Promega scientists worked with forensic leaders such as Kermit Channel, the Executive Director of the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory and Chair of the U.S. Technical Advisory Group. Dr. Channel notes, ""Developing a specific ISO standard addressing the manufacturing of products used in forensic DNA laboratories across the globe was critical for our criminal justice stakeholders. We knew that developing this standard was going to be a difficult task requiring the right technical expertise. Fortunately for the U.S., we partnered with exceptional subject matter experts at Promega. The knowledge and expertise that Promega brought to the international table was invaluable in the creation of this ISO document that now provides DNA laboratories across the globe confidence in the products we use.""

With this decision, our two distinct businesses will remain separately managed units within Pfizer, which we believe is currently the best structure to continue to deliver on our commitments to patients, physicians, payers and governments, and to drive value for our shareholders,  stated Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer.   We believe that by operating two separate and autonomous units within Pfizer we are already accessing many of the potential benefits of a split   sharper focus, increased accountability, and a greater sense of urgency   while also retaining the operational strength, efficiency and financial flexibility of operating as a single company as compared with operating as two, separate publicly traded companies. We will continue to generate the financial information necessary to preserve our option to split our businesses should factors materially change at some point in the future.  As the company previously indicated, the process for making a decision was guided by criteria that included evaluating the performance of each business within Pfizer, determining if each business could compete as a stand-alone entity, assessing if trapped value existed in a combined entity and if any trapped value could be unlocked efficiently. In addition, the company evaluated whether key strategic and operating imperatives could best be achieved in the current structure versus two, separate publicly traded companies.  When we first explored the trapped value question several years ago, market valuations of other companies suggested that our two businesses could potentially be worth more as separate companies than they are together in a single company,  explained Frank D Amelio, executive vice president, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer.   However, over time, any potential gap between Pfizer s market valuation and an implied Sum of the Parts (SOTP) market valuation has closed. In our analysis, we concluded that splitting into two companies at this time would not enhance the cashflow generation and competitive positioning of the businesses and the operational disruption, increased costs of a split and inability to realize any incremental tax efficiencies would likely be value destructive.

Mass spectrometric imaging by MALDI-TOF (MALDI Imaging) is a technology with great potential for many applications in medicine. It is the leading mass spectrometric method for the analysis of tissues, such as Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissues. Bruker s MALDI Tissuetyper  solution makes this technology broadly applicable due to the unprecedented 10 kHz laser speed, robustness and ease of use of the underlying rapifleX  MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The MALDI Tissuetyper enables anatomical pathology research based on multiplexed proteomic profiles and the spatial distribution of proteomic biomarkers on FFPE tissue sections.  The MALDI Tissuetyper is used for the direct, label-free analysis of a wide range of analytes directly from tissue sections. It provides complementary information to currently used routine histology methods. Bruker and 3M have agreed to extend Bruker s global license for 3M s patent from research to routine use. This is an important step towards developing future product offerings for anatomical pathology laboratories, including clinically validated content libraries for specific clinical indications. The license rights now cover the acquisition of MALDI spectra from FFPE sections for research and routine applications. Prof. Dr. Dr. J rg Kriegsmann, Medical Director of the Medical Service Center for Histology, Cytology and Molecular Diagnostics in Trier, Germany, commented: ""In my laboratory we have been working with the MALDI Tissuetyper workflow for some time. Most of the samples in a routine pathology laboratory are FFPE tissues. This is why it is so important to cover the FFPE workflow in addition to the analysis of freshly frozen samples. We see that the MALDI Tissuetyper can complement classical pathology analysis methods, such as hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. As a first routine application we will start using the MALDI Tissuetyper in our laboratory to analyze degenerative changes of meniscus tissue."" Dr. Wolfgang Pusch, Executive Vice President for Clinical MALDI at Bruker Daltonics, added: ""Bruker is the only company offering suitable technology and workflow solutions for the MALDI-TOF investigation of FFPE sections.

That conclusion -- which flies in the face of conventional wisdom that eggs from backyard poultry and small local enterprises are safer to eat than ""commercially produced"" eggs -- was drawn from a first-of-its kind, six-month study done last year in Pennsylvania. Researchers collected and tested more than 6,000 eggs from more than 200 selling points across the state. Salmonella enteritidis is a leading foodborne pathogen in the United States, with many outbreaks in humans traced back to shell eggs. The FDA requires shell-egg producers from farms with more than 3,000 chickens be in compliance with the FDA Final Egg Rule, which is aimed at restricting the growth of pathogens. However, small flocks with fewer than 3,000 layer chickens currently are exempted. Eggs from these producers often are marketed via direct retail to restaurants, health-food stores and farmers markets, or sold at on-farm roadside stands. From April to September 2015, the researchers purchased two to four dozen eggs from each of 240 randomly selected farmers markets or roadside stands representing small layer flocks in 67 counties of Pennsylvania. Internal contents of the eggs and egg shells were cultured separately for Salmonella using standard protocols. Salmonella recovered were classified by serotype, and any Salmonella enteritidis isolates present were further characterized to evaluate their relatedness to isolates of the bacteria that have caused foodborne illness outbreaks. Test results revealed that of the 240 selling points included in the study, eggs from five -- 2 percent -- were positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Eggs sold at one of the positive selling points contained the bacteria in egg shells; the eggs from the other four selling points had Salmonella enteritidis in internal contents. That is a higher prevalence of the pathogen than that found in studies of eggs from large flocks, noted lead researcher Subhashinie Kariyawasam, microbiology section head at Penn State's Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. Those eggs, from flocks of more than 3,000 birds, are subject to federal regulations aimed at reducing Salmonella enteritidis contamination. These regulations require measures such as placement of Salmonella-""clean"" chicks, intensive rodent control, cleaning and disinfecting between flocks, environmental monitoring of pullet and layer houses, continuous testing of eggs from any Salmonella-positive houses, and diverting eggs from Salmonella-positive houses for pasteurization. Kariyawasam -- who presented the research findings to the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Avian Pathologists at their August meeting in San Antonio, Texas -- said the study clearly demonstrated that Salmonella enteritidis is present in the eggs produced by small flocks. ""The research highlights the potential risk posed by the consumption of eggs produced by backyard and small layer flocks. And, analysis of the Salmonella enteritidis present in the eggs from small flocks shows they are the same types commonly reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from human foodborne outbreaks,"" she said. ""These findings emphasize the importance of small-producer education on Salmonella enteritidis control measures and perhaps implementation of egg quality-assurance practices to prevent contamination of eggs produced by backyard and other small layer flocks."" Eggs from small flocks make a negligible contribution to the table egg industry in the United States, Kariyawasam noted. But the growing demand for backyard eggs and eggs from nonfarm environments -- with small egg-producing flocks managed in cage-free systems and pasture situations -- suggests these production systems deserve some scrutiny. ""We were curious about Salmonella contamination of eggs produced by these flocks because the prevalence of this pathogen in smaller flocks was not known. Now we know that the prevalence of Salmonella enteritidis in eggs produced by small flocks is higher than in eggs produced by larger flocks."" Salmonella enteritidis, like other foodborne bacteria, is destroyed by proper cooking. However, Salmonella infections can be very serious, even life-threatening, especially to the very young, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. ""The bottom line is, if you buy your eggs from the small producers, you need to worry about Salmonella just as if you bought eggs produced by large flocks,"" Kariyawasam said. ""And, beyond the consumption of eggs, birds in these flocks can have Salmonella, so people with backyard poultry need to be aware of the dangers with pet birds -- there is a risk to allowing birds to come into the house and children playing with the chickens.""","Published: September 27, 2016"

This new system weighs less than a one-tenth of a pound, making it small and light enough for a person to wear around their bicep, among other parts of their body. In the future, technology like this could be used for continuous patient monitoring at home or at point-of-care settings. The research, which was published in the journal ACS Nano, was led by Aydogan Ozcan, UCLA s Chancellor s Professor of Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering and associate director of the California NanoSystems Institute and Vasiliki Demas of Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences). Fluorescent biomarkers are routinely used for cancer detection and drug delivery and release among other medical therapies. Recently, biocompatible fluorescent dyes have emerged, creating new opportunities for noninvasive sensing and measuring of biomarkers through the skin. However, detecting artificially added fluorescent objects under the skin is challenging. Collagen, melanin and other biological structures emit natural light in a process called autofluorescence. Various methods have been tried to investigate this problem using different sensing systems. Most are quite expensive and difficult to make small and cost-effective enough to be used in a wearable imaging system. To test the mobile microscope, researchers first designed a tissue phantom   an artificially created material that mimics human skin optical properties, such as autofluorescence, absorption and scattering. The target fluorescent dye solution was injected into a micro-well with a volume of about one-hundredth of a microliter, thinner than a human hair, and subsequently implanted into the tissue phantom half a millimeter to 2 millimeters from the surface   which would be deep enough to reach blood and other tissue fluids in practice. To measure the fluorescent dye, the wearable microscope created by Ozcan and his team used a laser to hit the skin at an angle. The fluorescent image at the surface of the skin was captured via the wearable microscope. The image was then uploaded to a computer where it was processed using a custom-designed algorithm, digitally separating the target fluorescent signal from the autofluorescence of the skin, at a very sensitive parts-per-billion level of detection.  We can place various tiny bio-sensors inside the skin next to each other, and through our imaging system, we can tell them apart,  Ozcan said.  We can monitor all these embedded sensors inside the skin in parallel, even understand potential misalignments of the wearable imager and correct it to continuously quantify a panel of biomarkers.  This computational imaging framework might also be used in the future to continuously monitor various chronic diseases through the skin using an implantable or injectable fluorescent dye.

The results show that the efficacy of a therapeutic antibody used to treat breast cancer can be increased sevenfold in an intravenous injection. The study was conducted in August 2016 on an animal model of breast cancer. It involved comparing the activity of an ADC, the Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine), on its own with the activity of the Kadycla combined with ImmunoCellin. A very significant difference in tumor progression was observed - the tests revealed that the anti-tumor treatment is seven times more efficient with ImmunoCellin. The animals showed no sign of toxicity at the doses administered intravenously to achieve this level of efficacy.  ImmunoCellin has been developed and studied since 2009 and is the focus of many experiments demonstrating the internalization of an IgG antibody. A patent for this technology was filed in 2013. ""ImmunoCellin allows a complexation of the antibody which can be delivered directly to the cytosol without passing through endosomes. The antibody remains active and binds to its receptor,"" said Martine Pillot, managing director of BioCellChallenge. ""In experiments conducted in vitro, the antibody retained all of its specific features. The in vitro tests showed that the presence of ImmunoCellin increased the intracellular delivery of Kadcyla, while retaining a high affinity with the HER-2 receptor."" According to Prof. Herv  Watier, head of the immunology department at Tours University Hospital, director of the MAbImprove 'laboratory of excellence' and leader of the ARD 2020 Biomedicines program, BioCellChallenge's results are challenging: ""We hardly dare think about the intracellular penetration of antibodies. What if we could?"" Currently the development of therapeutic antibodies is mainly based on membrane approaches, while the differences between healthy cells and tumor cells primarily concern intracellular proteins.  BioCellChallenge's technology, which allows an antibody to be internalized in the heart of the cancer cell, paves the way for the development of a large number of internalizing therapeutic antibodies and for the optimization of the antibodies and ADCs under development. Several universities and biotech companies have shown great interest in ImmunoCellin and would like to collaborate with BioCellChallenge to apply this technology to their own antibodies.","Published: September 27, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gene-deletion-reveals-cell-secrets-195421,Gene Deletion Reveals Cell Secrets Researchers have deleted     genes in yeast to analyse the effect of individual gene deletion  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Proteins are the hammers and tongs of life, with fundamental roles in most of what happens in biology. But biologists still don t know what thousands of proteins do, and how their presence or absence affects the cell. The intellectual black hole extends to mitochondria, the cells  energy machines, which falter in more than 150 diseases, including cancer, diabetes, Parkinson s and numerous genetic disorders. To fill in the blanks on mitochondria, researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison deleted 174 genes, one by one, in yeast. They then subjected the yeast to high-intensity mass spectrometry to measure unprecedented detail on thousands of metabolic products, including proteins, intermediate chemicals called metabolites, and lipids. In the latest issue of Nature Biotechnology, Joshua Coon, a UW Madison professor of biomolecular chemistry, and David Pagliarini, director of metabolism research for the Morgridge Institute for Research at the UW, report a comprehensive analysis of the effect of deleting single genes. The study fingered seven genes in making coenzyme Q (CoQ), a molecule critical for mitochondrial energy metabolism. The use of multiple types of data is common in complex analyses. To understand an auto accident, for example, one might require data on weather, auto and traffic engineering, and driver impairment due to distraction or drugs. In biology, comprehensive data on cellular biochemistry emerges when Coon s specialty, high-speed mass spectrometry, is combined with innovative methods to process a cascade of data, amounting to nearly two thousand gigabytes in the new study. A gene patterns a protein.  To learn exactly what these genes and proteins do,  says Coon,  we looked at cells that fail to make proteins, using new scientific instruments that can measure compounds with astonishing speed and accuracy.  The study provided a level of detail not available even five years ago, says Coon.  Improved technology and approaches to mass spectrometry cut the time to analyze all the proteins in a yeast sample from four hours to one hour. I was excited, and I went to Dave and said,  We can analyze the protein production in 1,000 samples in 1,000 hours. Have you got something big?'  What Pagliarini s group had was a passion for the energy-processing mitochondria, and especially the mysterious proteins associated with it. The researchers started the study by removing genes that coded proteins in all the primary functional parts of mitochondria, Pagliarini says.  If we knock out, one by one, a wide range of genes of known function, and analyze proteins, metabolites and lipids, using the technology that Josh s group has developed, the data provide a  signature  for what each protein is doing. If we then repeat this on a different strain that is missing a different protein of unknown function, we can compare its signature to the others and begin to figure out what that protein is doing.  The torrent of data presented  an informatics challenge that we had to cross,  Coon says.  Study co-lead author Nicholas Kwiecien, a graduate student, created a website that presents this data in a way that makes it easier to understand.  Kwiecien and Pagliarini graduate student Jonathan Stefely, the other co-lead author, worked as partners, says Coon.  Jon would say  I d like to be able to see this,  and Nick would figure out how to make that happen. A lot of the leads that we followed up were generated by their process of figuring out how to work together.  Some of the strongest clues that emerged concerned CoQ, which is often deficient in mitochondrial disorders, causing anything from simple muscle ache to severe multi-system problems. Pagliarini s group did biochemical experiments to follow up on the suggestion that one gene-protein combination was crucial to producing CoQ.  The large-scale data gathering suggested that one strain failed to make a key metabolite needed for CoQ, so we delivered that metabolite and experimentally repaired the CoQ deficiency in the knock-out yeast,  says Pagliarini.  So we went from this large-scale, mass-spec driven analysis to the biochemistry, and got the whole story. This will be a new step in textbooks. It s locked in. Now that we understand the pathway better, maybe we can figure out how to sidestep this shortage to help certain patients.   We can t promise that,  adds Coon,  but we can promise that nobody would have looked at that gene until we uncovered it in this large-scale analysis.  Beyond the seven genes linked to CoQ,  our ongoing analysis has already led to some 20 additional predictions of protein function, and each could become a thesis project,  says Pagliarini.  We can now begin to define the function of these disease-related proteins for which we currently have little or no understanding.  Instead of exploring proteins one at a time, the study shows the efficacy of looking at them by the hundreds, Pagliarini adds.  This kind of result is a testament to the wisdom of investments in cutting-edge technology by the university and the Morgridge Institute,  says Coon.  The latest technology can accelerate biological discovery. If someone comes to us and wants to look at a dozen strains of yeast at this level of detail, two years ago that would have taken a month. Now it takes a day. Science is already benefiting, and we believe patients will benefit as well. ","Published: September 27, 2016"

This property enables it to stop the runaway inflammatory process that leads to multiple organ failure and eventual death in bacterial sepsis.  Mitochondria are the generators of cellular energy. Based on work just published, in which Marten Szibor and Howard 'Howy' Jacobs from the Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, are key contributors, it is becoming clear that mitochondria also participate in the signalling process that leads to the activation of macrophages. Macrophages are one of the front-line components of the immune system. When stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, a common chemical constituent of the outer envelope of bacteria, they undergo a reprogramming of metabolism. Mitochondria switch to the production of oxygen radicals, alerting the body to the threat. Sepsis occurs when the process spins out of control. ""The mitochondrial switch initiates a cascade of pro-inflammatory signals. But the process can be counteracted by various different treatments which limit oxygen radical production,"" says Howy Jacobs. For a number of years, Howy Jacobs' group has been studying the properties of the mitochondrial ""alternative oxidase"", AOX. AOX can buffer many pathological stresses in mitochondria, including the excessive production of oxygen radicals. Together with collaborators, they have now demonstrated its potential to combat the runaway inflammatory process that leads to multiple organ failure and eventual death, in bacterial sepsis. Alternative oxidase works as a safety valve AOX is not found naturally in mammals, so the group have turned to the sea-squirt Ciona as a source. Remarkably, the AOX gene from this species is fully functional when expressed in human cells or model organisms like fruit-flies or mice. AOX by-passes the mitochondrial energy system when it isn t fully functional due to chemical damage, toxins, genetic errors or overload. Under normal conditions, it seems to have no effect on cellular processes, yet it acts as a kind of safety valve when the mitochondria become stressed. So AOX is effective in blocking sepsis, because it relieves the build-up of metabolic intermediates that otherwise lead to excessive oxygen radical production. ""More people die of sepsis than of cancer. So anything that improves our understanding of how it develops and how to fight it, should have dramatic life-saving implications. It s obviously far too soon to say whether AOX could be used as an actual therapy for sepsis, and if so, how best to deliver it. But equally, using the knowledge obtained in this project may lead to simpler,  chemical  ways of producing a similar outcome and saving many lives,"" Howy Jacobs says.","Published: September 27, 2016"

The study, which also nuances the concept of muscle memory, is published in the journal PLOS Genetics.  Regular endurance training is very beneficial to health and wellbeing, and can be used to prevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and other such conditions. However, just how this works on a molecular level is not fully known.   Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have now analyzed RNA, the molecular copies of the DNA-sequence, in muscle tissue before and after endurance training. They found approximately 3400 RNA variants, associated with 2600 genes, that changed in response to training. One implication of the study is that training can induce the same gene to increase the production of one RNA variant and reduce that of another. According to the researchers, this can mean that genes can change function as a result of exercise and, for example, start to promote the production of certain protein variants over others.   It has not been previously shown that training changes the expression of genes in this particular way. The study also provides new basic information about how the body adapts to regular endurance training and what role many of our genes play in the adaptation,  says Dr Mal ne Lindholm at Karolinska Institutet s Department of Physiology and Pharmacology.  The study began with an exercise programme for 23 individuals that involved working one leg but not the other. Muscle samples were taken before and after the training period. After a nine months rest period, they then exercised both legs in the same way as in the initial period of exercise, with muscle samples taken from both legs.   We were looking for any residual effects of previous training, a kind of muscle memory as it were, and trying to find out if this could influence the response to repeated training.  The changed genetic activity in the previously trained leg was no longer present when exercise resumed. However, the repeated response to training was somewhat different in the trained and previously untrained legs in the second training period, which suggests that the exercise could have left other lasting impacts.  According to Dr Lindholm, the study is important above all for the fundamental understanding of how muscles operate and how we adapt to endurance training.   The results can also contribute to the future optimisation of training effects in different individuals,  she says.  In the long run, it is conceivably of some significance to the possibility of preventing cardiovascular disease and the development of new, more precise drugs for people who, for whatever reason, are unable to exercise.

The immune system is efficient at identifying and halting the emergence and spread of primary tumours but when metastatic tumours appear, the immune system is no longer able to recognize the cancer cells and stop them,  said Wilfred Jefferies, senior author of the study working in the Michael Smith Laboratories and a professor of Medical Genetics and Microbiology and Immunology at UBC.  We discovered a new mechanism that explains how metastatic tumours can outsmart the immune system and we have begun to reverse this process so tumours are revealed to the immune system once again.  Cancer cells genetically change and evolve over time. Researchers discovered that as they evolve, they may lose the ability to create a protein known as interleukein-33, or IL-33. When IL-33 disappears in the tumour, the body s immune system has no way of recognizing the cancer cells and they can begin to spread, or metastasize. The researchers found that the loss of IL-33 occurs in epithelial carcinomas, meaning cancers that begin in tissues that line the surfaces of organs. These cancers include prostate, kidney breast, lung, uterine, cervical, pancreatic, skin and many others. Working in collaboration with researchers at the Vancouver Prostate Centre, and studying several hundred patients, they found that patients with prostate or renal (kidney) cancers whose tumours have lost IL-33, had more rapid recurrence of their cancer over a five-year period. They will now begin studying whether testing for IL-33 is an effective way to monitor the progression of certain cancers.  IL-33 could be among the first immune biomarkers for prostate cancer and, in the near future, we are planning to examine this in a larger sample size of patients,  said Iryna Saranchova, a PhD student in the department of microbiology and immunology and first author on the study. Researchers have long tried to use the body s own immune system to fight cancer but only in the last few years have they identified treatments that show potential. In this study Saranchova, Jefferies and their colleagues at the Michael Smith Laboratories, found that putting IL-33 back into metastatic cancers helped revive the immune system s ability to recognize tumours. Further research will examine whether this could be an effective cancer treatment in humans.","Published: September 27, 2016"

The biomarker is a score based on the expression levels of a set of genes involved in partitioning chromosomes during cell division. This score, the researchers found, could identify tumors that would likely not respond to certain treatments and those that would be sensitive. The score could also predict patients  outcomes with or without treatment. The study was published August 31 in Nature Communications. Cellular Machinery Gone Awry In a dividing cell, the centromere and kinetochore are parts of the cellular machinery that pull the duplicated chromosomes apart into two new daughter cells. If something goes awry during this process, a cell can end up with too many chromosomes, with too few chromosomes, or with rearranged chromosomes. Any of these outcomes known collectively as chromosomal instability have the potential to drive cancer. Researchers in the lab of Gary Karpen, Ph.D., wanted to know whether changes in the expression of genes associated with normal centromere and kinetochore function contribute to chromosomal instability, and, if so, whether these changes might provide important information about the behavior of a tumor. So a research team led by Weiguo Zhang, Ph.D., and Jian-Hua Mao, Ph.D., picked 31 genes that previous studies had shown are involved in centromere and kinetochore assembly. Using large tumor gene-expression databases, they first examined the expression levels of these genes in different cancer types. Many of these genes were over- or under-expressed in many of the tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues, and these changes in expression differed substantially both across cancer types and among people with the same cancer type. Using another set of databases containing thousands of samples from breast, lung, ovarian, and gastric cancers, the researchers then determined that levels of over-expression of 14 of the original 31 genes were significantly associated with risk of disease progression and survival. Dubbing the expression of this 14-gene subset the Centromere and kinetochore gene Expression Score (CES), they measured the CES in samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other tumor sample databases. A high CES, they found, correlated significantly with elevated chromosomal instability of tumors from many cancer types, and with tumor features that are associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, such as overexpression of the HER2 protein in breast cancer. High Instability, High Sensitivity To determine if the CES could help predict outcomes and survival, the research team measured the score in several large gene-expression datasets from patients with breast or lung cancer for whom the treatment outcomes were known. They divided patients into high-, medium-, and low-CES groups, and found that patients in the high-CES group had the worst outcomes. Similarly, when they looked at another dataset from patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer or ovarian cancer, those with the highest CES had the worst outcomes. The association between CES and outcome was independent of other prognostic factors, including tumor stage and grade, breast cancer hormone-receptor status, and lung cancer subtype. Because cancer cells with a high CES have already experienced substantial disruption of their genetic material, the researchers tested whether high CES could predict increased sensitivity to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, two treatments that cause DNA damage. Indeed, in their initial studies of cancer cell lines, those with a high CES experienced more cancer cell death when exposed to chemotherapeutic agents (such as irinotecan) compared to cell lines with a low CES. Patient samples yielded similar results. In lung cancer samples taken from patients in a clinical trial that had tested chemotherapy versus no adjuvant treatment for early-stage lung cancer, patients with a high CES who had received chemotherapy had significantly improved survival compared with those who did not, whereas patients with a low CES gained no significant survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. And among patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, those with a high CES who received chemotherapy had a reduced risk of the cancer returning, similar to rates for patients with a low CES and lower than for patients with a high CES who did not receive chemotherapy. Similar results were obtained for adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer or lung cancer. Making Decisions with More Precision A low CES in a patient potentially  could be used to rule out the use of inappropriate and ineffective drugs, in favor of different treatment approaches,  commented Julia Cooper, Ph.D., head of the Telomere Biology Section in NCI s Center for Cancer Research, who was not involved in the study. Because cells with centromere factor misregulation appear to be much more sensitive to treatments that damage DNA, Dr. Cooper continued, the CES could also potentially be used to identify patients who could be treated with lower doses of these drugs, reducing the risk of side effects. The CES may also be able to identify patients who would benefit from the addition of a drug that enhances the efficacy of DNA-damaging therapies, added Dr. Karpen. Exploring such clinical uses would require a validated, easily reproducible test that can be used on fresh or stored tumor samples, explained Dr. Karpen. His team is working on developing such a test, and is partnering with clinicians in the United States and China to verify the test s predictive power in tumor samples from well-controlled clinical trials. He and his colleagues also want to test further whether the CES can distinguish early stage growths that will not become invasive or metastatic, such as indolent breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which may not benefit from first-line therapy.  We don t always know which treatments are best for which cancers,  Dr. Karpen said.  If a treatment is not going to be effective, you run the risk of serious side effects  without providing any benefit to the patient. Their goal, he said, is to develop tests  that allow both patients and physicians to make these decisions with more precision. ","Published: September 27, 2016"

C2c2 has been described as an RNA-guided RNA-cutting enzyme; however, a full understanding of how this protein acts to cleave RNA was lacking. In a paper published today in Nature titled  Two distinct RNase activities of CRISPR-C2c2 enable guide-RNA processing and RNA detection,  the researchers were able to show that C2c2 has not one, as previously thought, but two distinct RNA cutting activities that in concert can be harnessed for robust RNA detection and degradation.  This study expands our molecular understanding of C2c2 to guide RNA processing and provides the first application of this novel RNase,  said Doudna, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  C2c2 is essentially a self-arming sentinel that attacks all RNAs upon detecting its target. This activity can be harnessed as an auto-amplifying detector that may be useful as a low-cost diagnostic.  The two distinct RNA cutting activities each have their own function. The first is responsible for producing guide RNAs that enable C2c2 to find specific target RNA molecules. The second, activated once a complementary RNA target is found, serves as a general RNA cleaver that destroys all RNAs that are present.","Published: September 27, 2016"

The nanoparticles, which are commercially available as the injectable iron supplement ferumoxytol, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat iron deficiency anemia. The mouse study found that ferumoxytol prompts immune cells called tumor-associated macrophages to destroy cancer cells, suggesting that the nanoparticles could complement existing cancer treatments. The discovery, described in a paper published online Sept. 26 in Nature Nanotechnology, was made by accident while testing whether the nanoparticles could serve as Trojan horses by sneaking chemotherapy into tumors in mice.  It was really surprising to us that the nanoparticles activated macrophages so that they started to attack cancer cells in mice,  said Heike Daldrup-Link, MD, who is the study s senior author and an associate professor of radiology at the School of Medicine.  We think this concept should hold in human patients, too.  Daldrup-Link s team conducted an experiment that used three groups of mice: an experimental group that got nanoparticles loaded with chemo, a control group that got nanoparticles without chemo and a control group that got neither. The researchers made the unexpected observation that the growth of the tumors in control animals that got nanoparticles only was suppressed compared with the other controls. Getting macrophages back on track The researchers conducted a series of follow-up tests to characterize what was happening. Experimenting with cells in a dish, they showed that immune cells called tumor-associated macrophages were required for the nanoparticles  anti-cancer activity; in cell cultures without macrophages, the iron nanoparticles had no effect against cancer cells. Before this study was done, it was already known that in healthy people, tumor-associated macrophages detect and eat individual tumor cells. However, large tumors can hijack the tumor-associated macrophages, causing them to stop attacking and instead begin secreting factors that promote the cancer s growth. The study showed that the iron nanoparticles switch the macrophages back to their cancer-attacking state, as evidenced by tracking the products of the macrophages  metabolism and examining their patterns of gene expression. Furthermore, in a mouse model of breast cancer, the researchers demonstrated that the ferumoxytol inhibited tumor growth when given in doses, adjusted for body weight, similar to those approved by the FDA for anemia treatment. Prior studies had shown that the nanoparticles are metabolized over a period of about six weeks, and the new study showed that the anti-cancer effect of a single dose of nanoparticles declined over about three weeks. The scientists also tested whether the nanoparticles could stop cancer from spreading. In a mouse model of small-cell lung cancer, the nanoparticles reduced tumor formation in the liver, a common site of metastasis in both mice and humans. In a separate model of liver metastasis, pretreatment with nanoparticles before tumor cells were introduced greatly reduced the volume of liver tumors. Potential clinical applications The study s results suggest several possible applications to test in human trials, Daldrup-Link said. For instance, after surgery to remove a potentially metastatic tumor, patients often need chemotherapy but must wait until they recover from the operation to tolerate the severe side effects of conventional chemo. The iron nanoparticles lack the toxic side effects of chemotherapy, suggesting they might be given to patients during the surgical recovery period.  We think this could bridge the time when the patient is quite sick after surgery, and help keep the cancer from spreading until they are able to receive chemotherapy,  said Daldrup-Link. The nanoparticles may also help cancer patients whose tumors can t be completely removed.  If there are some tumor cells left after surgery, the situation that cancer surgeons call positive margins, we think it might work to inject iron nanoparticles there, and the smaller tumor seeds could potentially be taken care of by our immune system,  Daldrup-Link said. The fact that the nanoparticles are already FDA-approved speeds the ability to test these applications in humans, she added. The new findings will also help cancer researchers conduct more accurate evaluations of nanoparticle-drug combinations, Daldrup-Link said.  In many studies, researchers just consider nanoparticles as drug vehicles,  she said.  But they may have hidden intrinsic effects that we won t appreciate unless we look at the nanoparticles themselves. ","Published: September 27, 2016"

Three years ago, when a newborn baby at Lucile Packard Children s Hospital Stanford began going into cardiac arrest every few hours, doctors and nurses scrambled to save her life. Her parents, Sici Tsoi and Edison Li, had not even seen their new baby after the emergency C-section delivery. They waited, puzzled to hear how she was. Tsoi said she had no idea how bad things were and just hoped for the best.  All I knew was that I gave birth, and I was very happy,  she said. The doctors soon diagnosed the baby with a heart arrhythmia called long QT syndrome. But the deadly genetic mutation causing the problem was hidden away inside baby Astrea s heart. It took a huge and diverse group of researchers, and a combination of some of the fastest and most cutting-edge genome sequencing ever conducted, to uncover the mystery of her illness: a heart composed of a mosaic of cells, 92 percent healthy and 8 percent defective. Getting on the case At a regular weekly clinical meeting of Stanford Medicine s Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, Euan Ashley, FRCP, DPhil, a professor of medicine and of genetics, and James Priest, MD, an instructor in pediatric cardiology, heard about the case and knew they could help.  We realized how sick this child was,  Priest said,  and we had a new tool   rapid whole-genome sequencing   that could make a faster and more comprehensive diagnosis than the available clinical genetic testing. So that night I went and talked to the parents and the rest of the team, collected a blood sample and we started the test.  A paper describing the case was published online Sept. 26 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Priest is the lead author, and Ashley is the senior author. While Astrea Li began a six-week stay in the hospital, Priest looked in her blood cells for any of several gene variants known to cause long QT syndrome. He found a suspicious mutation, but he immediately ran up against two problems. First, he wasn t positive that the mutation was capable of causing such serious heart problems. Second, the ratio between normal and mutated gene variants was unusual. Because of that odd ratio, Priest wondered if Astrea might be a mosaic of two kinds of cells. It was possible for a mutation to have occurred when her cells were first dividing as an early embryo, within hours after conception, leaving a small lineage of related cells marked for a separate fate. Connecting the dots Connecting all the dots was a huge hurdle.  It was two to three weeks of high-intensity work and about as dramatic as it gets,  said Ashley, who directs the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease and co-directs Stanford Health Care s Clinical Genomics Service. First they had to confirm that the variant was real. They did this by turning to colleagues at a sequencing firm called Personalis that Ashley had co-founded with other Stanford faculty.  The Personalis team dropped everything, came in weekends, to carry out in-depth sequencing of Astrea and her parents,  said Ashley. The company s scientists established that the gene variant was real and present in Astrea but not her parents, indicating it was a new mutation. To find out if the particular mutation they had identified could cause long QT syndrome, Priest and Ashley gave the sequence to a team of collaborators at Gilead, a company that designs drugs to treat the disease. Gilead reported that the gene variant would cause long QT syndrome. Moreover, they said, this mutation was especially deadly. Next the Stanford team wanted to be sure that Astrea really was a mosaic individual; they needed to show that individual cells actually had different genomes, some carrying the deadly mutation, some healthy. Each cell s genome would have to be individually mapped.  That field was founded by Stephen Quake,  said Ashley,  so having him here at Stanford, I called him and asked if he could help.  Quake, PhD, a professor of bioengineering and of applied physics who is also a co-author of the paper, and his team looked at individual cells from Astrea s blood sample and showed that most of her cells had normal genes, but 8 percent carried the mutation for long QT syndrome. Astrea s blood cells were definitely mosaic. But another question remained. It wasn t yet clear if the baby s heart tissue was also a mosaic of normal and damaged cells. Despite treatment with two drugs and the implantation of defibrillator and a pacemaker, Astrea developed an enlarged heart when she was about 7 months old. To her parents, she looked healthy, but assessments showed that she was in great danger; during a visit to the hospital, her heart stopped again. Astrea needed a heart transplant, and her name was quickly added to a waiting list for a donor heart.  I thought it would be at least a year of waiting,  said Tsoi. But after just five weeks, someone from Stanford called and asked if she was driving.  Are you in a safe place?  the voice asked. It was news of a donor. On the day of Astrea s transplant, her parents took their two older daughters and picnicked on the Stanford campus, waiting patiently to hear how the surgery went. In the evening, they went to see Astrea.  The first thing I saw was the monitor,  said Tsoi.  That was the first time I d ever seen the green line   the heart beat line   so stable and regular.  The tissue from Astrea s original heart allowed researchers to determine that, indeed, 8 percent of the heart cells carried the deadly mutation they believed had been causing her long QT syndrome. The team still wondered, though, if a heart with 8 percent mutant cells could really have caused Astrea s severe long QT syndrome. The team contacted colleagues in the Computational Cardiology Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, experts in computer modeling of cardiac electrical activity. The biomedical engineers  eventual computer model of a heart with a mosaic of healthy and mutant cells in the organ s electrical tissue acted exactly the way Astrea s real heart did.  It was an important moment: a mosaic heart really could cause heart block and cardiac arrest,  said Ashley.  We d thrown everything we had at diagnosing the baby,  said Ashley,  but still we wanted to know, how common is this?  Broader analysis To find out how often mosaicism might explain undiagnosed arrhythmia, the team partnered with a genetic testing company with a database of arrhythmia cases.  We asked them,  How many cases of mosaicism have you seen when you looked at genes that cause arrhythmia?  The answer was about 0.1 percent,  Priest said. The team s work may offer a new way to finally determine the cause of arrhythmias that previously had been a mystery, said Priest. About 30 percent of heart arrhythmia patients don t have a genetic diagnosis.  Maybe,  he said,  there are additional mutations that are in the heart only. Genetic tests are nearly always done on blood or other easily acquired tissues. So it s easy to imagine a mosaic gene variant that occurs only in the heart and doesn t show up in the blood. Really, the same reasoning could apply to genetic diseases that affect other parts of the body.  And that really is a brand new phenomenon,  Priest added. Until recently, he said, no one has thought of looking for mosaic gene variants as the cause of these kinds of diseases.  What we are uncovering is a phenomenon that is much more common than we had ever anticipated,  said Ashley. In fact, he said,  I think there s enough evidence now to suggest that a large number of people have some level of mosaicism,  although the genetic differences are probably harmless in most of us.","Published: September 27, 2016"

ApoCell is a spin-out of globally recognized, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and licenses key technology used in ApoStream from MD Anderson Cancer Center. ApoCell co-developed the ApoStream technology in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) over a multi-year period, from 2010 through 2014, with initial commercial delivery in 2013. The ApoStream technology has been incorporated into over 35 clinical trials, including trials for prostate, lung, breast, colon, pancreatic and renal cancers. In a recent global, Phase III, breast cancer trial, which involved 649 women the ApoStream  technology was able to detect and analyze CTCs in over 97% of the women. In addition, ApoCell has been a pioneer in developing the technology for high volume capture of CTCs to enable precision medicine in the clinical setting. The companies will jointly work on clinical trial projects that support the liquid biopsy and CTC profiling needs in multiple trials for both targeted therapeutics and immuno-oncology. In addition, the companies will evaluate applications for patient monitoring in lung, colorectal, breast and renal cancer where drug resistance and immune system changes can significantly impact patient response and outcome. The companies have already initiated joint projects where rare cell capture coupled with CGI's downstream, disease-specific profiling is a critical component to evaluating therapeutic effectiveness. ""The partnership with CGI will broaden the footprint and applications supported by our technology, and assist both of our customers on a global basis. Using the high-performance liquid biopsy and CTC approach to deepen our understanding of resistance mechanisms is a critical area for therapeutic improvement. Gaining more information from the samples taken during the clinical trial process is a key issue for all oncology research groups - and liquid biopsies enable more frequent, less costly and less invasive procedures. Leveraging CGI's expertise in genomic and immune marker profiling will add more value to the applications that are supported and validated for ApoStream ,"" said Darren Davis, Ph.D., President and CEO of ApoCell. ""ApoCell's technology and platform is exquisitely suited for capturing and enriching for both circulating tumor cells and immune cells simultaneously, without the need of labels or antibodies, which can compromise downstream data quality.

New investors include Lee's Healthcare Industry Fund, Rosetta Capital IV and Pila AB. Dilafor s largest existing shareholder, KDev Investments (an investment fund jointly owned by Karolinska Development (Nasdaq Stockholm: KDEV) and Rosetta Capital, also participated in this round. As a result of the new financing, Karolinska Development has decreased its indirect holdings via KDev Investments in Dilafor from 53% to 35%. The financing has no impact on Karolinska Development s Fair value. Dilafor s lead candidate, tafoxiparin, a modified form of heparin, is in clinical development to decrease the incidence of protracted labor both after induction of labor and after spontaneous onset of labor. Protracted labor (i.e. labor that lasts more than 12 hours) is the main cause of emergency surgical deliveries, such as caesarian section. The condition is often associated with complications for both mother and child. Tafoxiparin has shown in a Phase II clinical trial encouraging evidence that it can shorten labor time. The successful completion of the financing round enables Dilafor to facilitate a Phase IIb dose finding trial with tafoxiparin trial in Northern Europe, which is planned to start before the year end 2016. The study will include women with slow progress of labor after a spontaneous onset. Lena Degling Wikingsson, CEO of Dilafor, said:  This planned clinical study is an important event in the clinical development program for tafoxiparin. There is no available treatment today to help these women that have high risk of fetal and maternal complications as a consequence of slow progress and protracted labor. With support of long-term investors, Dilafor has now secured the financial resources needed to reach this next crucial milestone in the development of this promising candidate, and to identify a dose to take forward into the final stages of clinical development.  Dr. Viktor Drvota, Chief Investment Officer of Karolinska Development, comments:  We are pleased that Dilafor has been successful in attracting these important new investors to support the company through its next value inflection point.

The study demonstrated that MeCP2   the protein that does not work properly in Rett syndrome   is among a group of three proteins that affect the function of a gene previously linked to obsessive compulsive disorder. Researchers were able to induce and then suppress repetitive behaviors in mice by changing the levels of these three proteins at the synapse   the communication junction between nerve cells. The research is a significant advancement in the understanding of how dysfunction in MeCP2 leads to key symptoms associated with Rett syndrome. Although MeCP2 was identified less than two decades ago as the cause of the postnatal neurological disorder, the link between the protein s dysfunction and the specific neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease remains elusive. Diagnosing Rett patients Rett syndrome affects girls almost exclusively, occurring in 1 of every 10,000 to 15,000 births and usually diagnosed by age 2. It is characterized by developmental regression, autistic traits, slow brain development, lack of speech, repetitive hand movements, seizures, and problems with walking. Many patients live beyond middle age, though not enough data exist to reliably estimate life expectancy beyond age 40. While current medications and behavioral therapy can sometimes diminish symptoms such as seizures and hand behaviors, no treatment exists to eradicate or reverse the disorder and the repetitive stereotyped behaviors, due in large part to a lack of knowledge about how MeCP2 dysfunction gives rise to these and other symptoms. Helping Naomi Naomi s doctors at UT Southwestern have prescribed a seizure medication and an antipsychotic medication to control some of her aggressive and self-injurious repetitive behaviors. Naomi is also receiving speech therapy, said her physician, Dr. Sailaja Golla, Assistant Professor in Neurology and Neurotherapeutics, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry, and Director of the Rare Autism Variants clinic at UT Southwestern/Children s Health. Dr. Golla said she is encouraged by the study in mice and hopes the findings will eventually be applied to patients.  Our goal is to make life better for these children with rare syndromes,  said Dr. Golla, who, along with Dr. Darrah Haffner, treats Naomi at the clinic. Naomi s mother beams as she describes her daughter s early speech efforts   she has called her father  Papi  and her 7-year-old sister  April    and how she loves to watch cartoons at home. Yet, Ms. Elguea understands the challenges her daughter will face in the years to come.  You have to keep that hope inside of you,  she said, explaining that a treatment that doesn t offer a cure but can eliminate the hand behaviors would greatly improve Naomi s quality of life.  She s so focused on hitting and biting instead of being with us.  Scientists have known that MeCP2 is essential for normal brain development and acts as a molecular switch that affects how other genes function. Patients with Rett syndrome and some cases of autism spectrum disorder do not produce MeCP2 or have too much of it, respectively, causing other genes to operate abnormally. But scientists have not yet identified many of the precise mechanisms by which this dysfunction occurs. Dr. Monteggia s team found that MeCP2 controls the function of a gene called SAPAP3, which has been linked to obsessive compulsive disorder in humans. Disrupting the interaction between MeCP2 and the target gene SAPAP3 caused mice to groom themselves excessively; this repetitive behavior stopped after researchers reintroduced SAPAP3 into a particular brain region that is involved in obsessive compulsive behaviors. The research group also identified that MeCP2 formed a complex with histone deacetylase proteins, HDAC1 and HDAC2, to regulate SAPAP3 s function.  It is important to take these findings to the next level and seek ways to help patients enjoy their lives as normally as they can by addressing their symptoms,  said Dr. Monteggia, holder of the Ginny and John Eulich Professorship at UT Southwestern. Other findings The four-year study s original aim was to examine how the removal of certain proteins from the brain could improve memory disorders, but the focus expanded after the study found that each of the mice lacking HDAC1 and HDAC2 began displaying Rett-like repetitive behaviors. In addition to the Rett-related finding, Dr. Monteggia s team found that the removal of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 from the brain can kill neurons. This outcome is notable because studies elsewhere, as well as previous work by Dr. Monteggia s group, demonstrated the potential for treating memory loss by selectively inhibiting the HDAC2 protein. Dr. Monteggia said this finding does not mean certain HDAC inhibitors can t be effective, but the study does demonstrate that non-specific inhibitors and certain combinations may worsen the problem.

Melissa Mahgoub, Megumi Adachi, Kanzo Suzuki, Xihui Liu, Ege Kavalali, and Maria Chahrour, all in the Department of Neuroscience at UT Southwestern.

Depending on their age, they do not allocate resources in the same way between dominant and subordinate individuals. Thus a tendency towards egalitarianism develops and becomes even stronger between the ages of 5 and 8 years. These findings by a team of scientists from the CNRS and the Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (France), Lausanne and Neuch tel (Switzerland) universities provide a clearer understanding of how the notion of equality develops in human beings, and of their sense of justice. It is published in Developmental Psychology. See Also: Signs of pure altruism converge in the brain and increase with ageHierarchical relationships are one of the characteristics of our social existence. At a very early age, children can detect the difference between dominant and subordinate individuals. But how do they behave towards this asymmetric ranking? Will they favor the dominant and thus preserve the status quo? Or will they focus more on the subordinate and thus institute a form of equality? How do these positions evolve during childhood? Scientists in the Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod (CNRS/Universit  Claude Bernard Lyon 1) and the universities of Lausanne and Neuch tel have examined the early signs of this political positioning in children aged from 3 to 8 years by means of two experiments: a resource giving task and a resource taking task. During the first experiment, the scientists asked 173 children to watch a playlet involving a series of interactions between two puppets, one of which always imposed his will on the other, so that the children recognized him as the ""boss."" The scientists then gave each child a large and a small piece of chocolate, and watched how he or she distributed these sweets to each puppet. At the ages of 3 and 4 years, a great majority of the children tended to benefit the dominant puppet, giving it the large piece of chocolate. At the age of 5, this tendency diminished and was completely reversed by the age of 8 years, when almost all the children favored the subordinate puppet. The specialists called the second experiment the ""Robin Hood paradigm."" The children (132 of them) watched a scene where three characters (one of which told the others he was the ""boss"") were playing in the park. The dominant and one of the subordinates then received three coins, while the other subordinate only received one coin. The experimenter asked the participants to take a coin from one of the richer characters and give it to the poorest. The same effect as during the first experiment was then seen: younger children protected the resources of the dominant while older ones protected those of the subordinate. The oldest children often managed to explain their choices. They gave the larger chocolate to a particular puppet ""because it never chooses the game,"" or ""because it is more unlucky than the other."" Other, frequently younger, children did not manage to explain their actions, because giving a reason required a level of abstraction that was too high for them. Learn More: Your brain might be hard-wired for altruismThe scientists suggested several factors to explain the advantage given to the dominant and to understand this reversal of trend with age. Firstly, younger children are more dependent on those with parental authority. In addition, at the creche, dominance relationships between children are common and relatively well accepted. Very young children may also want to attract the approval of the dominant, or to avoid coming into conflict with him. But the desire of children to compensate for dominance asymmetry increases as their social existence became more complex. Indeed, the older they are, and the more playfellows they have, the greater the need for the notion of equality if they are to evolve within their group. This work shows that children start to become sensitive to inequalities of status at around the age of 5 years, and this trend becomes very marked at around 8 years. However, these findings do not mean that 8 year-old children display their egalitarianism in all social situations. The scientists are now focusing on understanding the effect of gender and the influence of culture on this tendency: will a male puppet be perceived as being more dominant? Is sensitivity to inequalities less strong in countries where hierarchies are culturally the most marked? Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Now, a research group at Uppsala University has investigated how levels of endocannabinoids which target the same receptors as cannabis are affected by short sleep duration, and whether acute exercise can modulate this effect. See Also: Blocking brain s endocannabinoids may trigger early Alzheimer s deficits, study shows 'Previous studies have shown alterations in the levels of some hunger hormones after sleep loss, but the results have been mixed and hormones that drive hedonic food intake have been less investigated. Furthermore, whereas exercise has many beneficial effects, whether exercise can modulate the effects of sleep loss on various hormonal pathways is currently unknown,' says lead author of the new study Jonathan Cedernaes, MD, PhD, at Uppsala University. In the new study, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, the researchers invited healthy normal-weight participants to a sleep laboratory on two separate occasions, to be studied after three consecutive nights of normal sleep, and after three nights of only sleeping four hours each night. Meals and activity patterns were kept standardized while participants were in the lab, and blood was drawn repeatedly to assess endocannabinoid levels in blood. This was also done on the last day both before and after a short bout of intensive exercise. Learn More: Previously unknown function of cannabinoid receptor discovered The researchers found that the levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol the most abundant endocannabinoid in the brain was about 80 percent higher after the nights of short sleep compared with after the normal sleep session. When the participants exercised, the levels of 2AG still went up almost by half, regardless of whether participants had been allowed to sleep for three normal nights, or to only sleep four hours each night. 'As previously shown by us and others, sleep loss increased subjective hunger compared with the well-rested state. Given the role of endocannabinoids for promoting hunger and hedonic eating, this could offer an explanation as to why. Meanwhile, we instead saw lower stress ratings after exercise in the sleep deprivation condition, which could also possibly be attributed to the observed endocannabinoid levels following our exercise intervention,' says senior author associate professor Christian Benedict. Read Next: Mulling the marijuana munchies: How the brain flips the hunger switch 'It is noteworthy that when sleep-deprived, the participants saw the same amount of increase in endocannabinoid levels following the acute exercise. Endocannabinoids are thought to confer both the ""runner's high"" as well as at least some of the neuroprotective effects of exercise. Therefore, this may suggest that even under conditions of chronic sleep loss, exercise may exert similar centrally active, and possibly neuroprotective, properties as under conditions of sufficient sleep. This is an important area for future research as we and others have found that short sleep duration by itself may be harmful to the brain, and in the long run increase the risk of e.g. Alzheimer's disease', says Jonathan Cedernaes.

Usually the patients affected survive for only a few months. In addition, every tumor is quite different, which makes treatment very difficult. Researchers at the University of Bonn have now developed a completely new method as the basis for creating custom-tailored, two-stage therapies. Using tumor samples from a patient, they do lab tests to determine which substances can first make the different types of cancer cells uniform and then effectively kill them. The study is published in Clinical Cancer Research. See Also: New combination treatment strategy to 'checkmate' glioblastoma Glioblastomas are among the most common and malignant of brain tumors. ""The tumor cells characteristically display great variety,"" says Professor Dr. Bj rn Scheffler of the Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology at the University of Bonn, who recently began doing research at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg and is a Professor at the Essen University Hospital. The cells in such a brain tumor can display very different characteristics, such as varying cell size or number of cell nuclei. Because the different cancer cells within a tumorous tissue also develop different modes of defense against therapeutic measures, the treatment of patients is extraordinarily difficult. After surgical removal, radiation, and chemotherapy, this type of tumor often returns; drugs are then usually no longer effective. A team under Professor Scheffler, consisting of researchers from the Bonn University Hospital, the Life & Brain Center, The German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, Tufts University Boston/Massachusetts, and other institutes in the USA, has now developed a new method that is expected to combat such complex brain tumors better. From tissue and cell samples from five glioblastoma patients, the scientists obtained 33 individual cancer cells capable of reproduction, which grew into very different tumors in the lab. For each patient, multiple representative test systems were thus available to study the different facets of a tumor representatively and individuallyseparately. Learn More: Epigenetic driver of glioblastoma provides new therapeutic target To find the best therapy for each one of these 33 tumor facets, the researchers tested about 180 different active substances. In doing so, the scientists made a surprising observation: ""One and the same active ingredient caused most of the tumor facets to die,"" reports lead author Roman Reinartz of Professor Scheffler's Team. However, the cancer cells of individual other tumor facets of the same patient survived the treatment and were even able to reproduce much more intensively. ""These initially resistant tumor facets could then be combated much more effectively with other active ingredients."" The different nature of the tumor cells requires the use of combined therapeutic measures. How many drugs were then needed to combat all the facets of a tumor effectively? ""In the best case scenario two,"" explains Reinartz. Instead of using the combined chemotherapies simultaneously, as was previously the case, the researchers want to proceed step by step in the future. This is how the therapy of the future could look like: In order to prevent the further spread of the tumor in the brain, parts will be removed surgically, as is the current procedure. In the future, the tissue samples obtained could be subjected to lab tests, in order to catalogue the response behavior of the various tumor facets. For each patient, the suitable combination treatment could then be designed, which, in the first step, would turn the variety of different tumor cells into a mass of cancer cells of the same type. In the second step, the precise substance would be found selected from the catalog that would be the most effective weapon against the specially particularly enriched tumor facet. Until now, the differences in the types of cancer cells in a glioblastoma have prevented successful treatment, because some of the resistant tumor facets might reproduce more intensively under the chemotherapy. With their method, the scientists are creating order from this seeming chaos. Professor Scheffler provides a comparison for the procedure: ""Like a car that is disassembled into its individual parts to check for damage, we examine the different cancer cells."" Once the characteristics of the cells of the tumor are known, this knowledge can be used to steer the complex system in the right direction.

Glandt Faculty Fellow and associate professor of bioengineering in the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science. The research was performed in collaboration with cognitive neuroscientist Jean Vettel, PhD, of the Army Research Laboratory; control theorist Fabio Pasqualetti of the University of California, Riverside; Scott Grafton, MD, and Matthew Cieslak of the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Shi Gu of the University of Pennsylvania Department of Psychiatry. The study is published in PLOS Computational Biology. Learn More: Study shows vagus nerve stimulation significantly reduces rheumatoid arthritis symptomsThe study used a computational model to simulate brain activity in eight individuals whose brain architecture was mapped using data derived from diffusion spectrum imaging, a type of brain image taken by an MRI scanner. The research examined the impact of stimulating each of 83 regions within each subject's brain. While results varied by person, common trends emerged. Network hubs areas of the brain that are strongly connected to other parts of the brain via the brain's white matter displayed what researchers call a ""high functional effect"": Stimulating these regions resulted in the global activation of many brain regions. This effect was particularly notable in two sub-networks of the brain that are known to contain multiple regional hubs: the subcortical network (which is composed of regions that evolved relatively early on and are critical for emotion processing) and the default mode network (which is composed of regions that evolved later and are critical for self-referential processing when a person is at rest, or not completing any task). Stimulating regions in the subcortical network culminated in global changes, in which a diversity of areas within a subject's brain lit up. Stimulating regions in the default mode network also led easily to a plethora of new brain states, though the patterns of activation were constrained by the brain's underlying architecture by the white matter links between the nodes of the network and other parts of the brain. Despite this limitation, the network's agility supports the idea that the brain at ""rest"" is well suited for shifting quickly into an array of new states geared toward completing specific tasks. In contrast to regions within the default mode network and subcortical networks, more weakly connected areas, such as in the sensory and association cortex, had a more limited effect on brain activity when activated. Read Next: Spinal cord stimulation is a safe, effective drug-free treatment for chronic painThese patterns suggest that doctors could pursue two classes of therapies when it comes to brain stimulation: a ""broad reset"" that alters global brain dynamics, or a more targeted approach that focuses on the dynamics of just a few regions.

Schwartz led two recently published studies that advance knowledge of the underlying biology of cardiovascular diseases, which are among the most common causes of chronic illness and death worldwide. The studies highlight how basic science research insights are the key to future breakthroughs in treatment. The first study, published in Nature Cell Biology, examined the process that leads to formation of the atherosclerotic plaques that clog arteries and cause heart attacks and strokes. Atherosclerosis research and therapies have focused mainly on lipids and inflammation as causing disease. Schwartz and colleagues instead asked whether it might be considered as a form of  remodelling,  in which the cells reorganize the structure of the tissue.  In the study, the Yale-led research team focused on the link between remodelling of the extracellular matrix   the fibrous tissue around the cells   and inflammation. They found that in mice, altering the signals from the receptors that bind extracellular matrix reduced inflammation and atherosclerosis. By revealing how matrix remodelling controls inflammation, the work identifies a possible new target for atherosclerosis. The second study was a collaboration with the lab of Anne Eichmann, also in cardiology. The Eichmann lab studies a condition called hereditary hemorraghic telangiectasia (HHT) in which blood vessels are malformed, leading to bleeding in the skin, nose, and other organs. HHT is due to mutations in two cell receptors for proteins in the blood called BMPs.  This research team found that how these receptors signal strongly depends on both the BMPs and the force from flowing blood. HHT patient blood vessels are poorly formed because they do not respond properly to blood flow. The results deepen our general understanding of how blood vessel structure is regulated, and point to potential therapeutic targets for HHT and other common vascular diseases, they said.","Published: September 26, 2016"

The researchers hope to replace unhealthy, trans and saturated fats with better non-saturated versions   all without compromising texture. That swap could have great implications for the food industry, says Maria Fernanda Peyronel-Svaikauskas, a research associate working with food scientist Prof. Alejandro Marangoni. To conduct their studies, Peyronel-Svaikauskas and the other U of G researchers use the DOE s Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Illinois. X-rays generated at that facility enable scientists to study and characterize the structure of edible fats at meso and micro levels (hundreds of nanometres to a few micrometres in size). Edible fats are made of triglycerides that clump to form crystalline nanoplatelets (CNPs), which in turn form larger masses of particles. The researchers use the APS to study those larger structures inside and out. Unlike using conventional microscopy, using X-rays means researchers need not condition or manipulate samples for in-situ measurement. Peyronel-Svaikauskas says trans and saturated fats are important because they provide structure for semi-solid edible fats such as shortening or butter-like spreads. But  as soon as the healthier unsaturated fats are used to replace the trans and saturated ones, the solid structure is lost,  she says.  The key problem is the food industry trying to do this with much trial and error. We are trying to help them with our research by removing the trial and error.  Researchers have looked at fats using other sophisticated imaging techniques for decades. The Guelph team uses new technology at the APS called ultra-small angle X-ray scattering for the first such structural analysis of fats and oils. The researchers model CNPs in computer simulations to guide experiments and predict outcomes. Researchers need to propose experiments and book APS time through the DOE. Peyronel-Svaikauskas says they need to be ready to go to Illinois and squeeze a lot of work into eight-hour shifts, all in a high-security facility.  You feel like you don t want to touch anything, and every step you take, there is someone telling you what or what not to do. You re always concerned that you re going to press the wrong button or that the alarm will sound. It s tense.  Radiation is a concern when working with X-rays, but she says researchers can accomplish a lot using the high-flux, high-energy X-ray beams at the APS.  You re looking at X-ray scattering at really tiny angles. The smaller the angle, the larger the feature you look at in your sample. That s important if you want to understand how the meso to micro structure gets formed.  They found characteristic patterns normally missed by conventional wide- or small-angle scattering. Their computer models and predictions helped them understand what was happening to fat structures. Food scientists may use this information to decide whether they have the desired product for a particular purpose, such as a spreading or a fat to make cookies or to get the best chocolate.  When you think about the amount of applications for fat, it s tremendous,  says Peyronel-Svaikauskas.  It s hard to say that what you see in one system can be translated to another system because you are talking about different molecules, and each one has to be processed according to the functionality you want at the end.

Polytechnicers use a method based on polymer optodes - very small plastic matrices that can be made sensitive to specific substances by means of special reagents. The matrices change colour and its intensity depending on the concentration of the substance. Being portable, the device can carry out analysis in situ even at low temperatures, and its cost is many times less than the price of a spectrophotometer - the most used device for chemical analysis.  The device is based on polymethacrylate sensors - transparent pieces of plastic with thickness of 1 mm and a size of 3x3 mm. The pores of matrices serve as receptacles, where various chemical reactions can undergo. If a matrix is handled with a special reagent it becomes an optode sensitive to a particular substance. We plunge this optode into the water to test it or simply drip a few drops on it, and it changes its colour. Hence, there is a required element. The more intense the colour is, the higher is the concentration of the substance,  said Sergey Muravyov, the scientific head of the project, head of the TPU International Laboratory of Advanced Measurements. For example, if water contains silver optode turns purple-red. According to the scientist, such a method can detect substances even at very low concentrations in water.  You dip optode into the water and then load it into the device analyzer. There a special electronic device receives optical signal and converts it into an electric three-channel RGB-signal. After this signal processing the device outputs the data in digital form on the concentration of the searched substance. The analysis takes place immediately,  the project manager said. This method allows the detection of almost all metals, organic materials and various pharmacological agents in water.  Our method works with those substances with which interaction leads to colour change. Indeed, this is not the whole range of substances. But universal methods do not exist. Today, the most widely used method for chemical analysis is spectrophotometry. A modern spectrophotometer costs about 500 thousand rubles, and it is a bulky stationary device. Our device can achieve the same quality of measurements, but it is compact and can cost about 30 thousand rubles at the market placement,  - he says. Such a device for rapid analysis is useful for environmental and related services personnel of industrial enterprises. For example, oil companies can use the device for the determination of the tracers in the drilling fluid.  To date, we have prepared a prototype device, - says Sergey Muravyov. - Now we have set ourselves the task to use this method for a multi-component analysis. The fact is that the reagents that configure optode to a definite substance are sensitive to a few substances. ","Published: September 26, 2016"

Science magazine published the finding this week.  This research represents a breakthrough for addressing a major challenge in agriculture,  said Neal Gutterson, vice president, Research & Development, DuPont Pioneer.  We have discovered a non-Bt protein that demonstrates insecticidal control of western corn rootworm with a new and different mode of action than Bt proteins currently used in transgenic products. This protein could be a critical component for managing corn rootworm in future corn seed product offerings. The work also suggests that bacteria other than Bt are alternative sources of insecticidal proteins for insect control trait development.  An extremely destructive corn pest, corn rootworm larvae and adults can cause significant economic loss for growers. The current biotech approach for insect control sources proteins from Bt soil bacteria. Field-evolved insect resistance to certain Bt proteins has been observed in some geographies. Another Pioneer study related to non-Bt insect control, recently published in Scientific Reports, shows how RNA interference (RNAi) can be applied to control corn rootworm feeding damage. RNAi is a biologically occurring process that happens in the cells of plants, animals and people. By employing the RNAi process, a plant can protect itself by carrying instructions that precisely target specific proteins in pests.  Growers need a next generation of solutions to help protect their crops. Our researchers are developing innovative, new modes for insect control to help meet future demands. Non-Bt proteins and RNA-based products highlight our efforts to identify alternative methods for effective control of insect feeding damage in agriculture,  Gutterson said.","Published: September 26, 2016"

The technique, developed at the University of Michigan, could one day help screen potential cancer treatments based on an individual patient's tumor and help researchers better understand so-called cancer stem cells. It also sheds light on a controversy: are large cells or small cells more likely to be cancer stem cells? Cancer cells are not all the same, and one theory holds that no more than 5 percent of the cells in a tumor are cancer stem cells. These few may be the only cells capable of causing a relapse or metastasis. ""Most normal cells will die if they are not anchored to something, but cancer stem cells can survive. They can become circulating tumor cells and come to another area of the body,"" said Euisik Yoon, professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and biomedical engineering. The team led by Yoon designed and made a device that takes advantage of this ability in hopes of understanding cancer stem cells better: how to identify them, what causes them to grow or die, and how to target them with cancer treatments. Their chip contains up to 12,800 wells for catching individual cancer cells. The team tested the chip with breast cancer cells, donated by researchers in the U-M Comprehensive Cancer Center. They mixed the cells into a solution and ran the liquid through tiny channels in a plastic chip. Each channel was lined with chambers for trapping single cells. The chambers have small openings to a parallel channel, which creates a draft that draws cells in sort of like the drain in a sink. Once a cell is trapped, it blocks that opening and stops the draft. This ensures that, most of the time, only one cell is pulled into each chamber. The walls of the chamber are coated so that the cell can't latch on. As a result, normal cells that can't cause metastases die over the course of a few days, leaving behind just the cancer stem cells. These cells reproduce in their chambers, forming tiny floating colonies, or tumorspheres. While the ability to isolate 10,000 individual cells is impressive, it wouldn't be useful if the team had to manually record every one, as required by most devices that capture cancer cells. The key is their computer algorithm, capable of combing through the microscope images and assessing the size and number of cells in each well. The algorithm's particular talent is identifying cells no matter whether they show up dimly or brightly in the microscope image. ""Our method is special because we really want to enable the study of many cells at once,"" said Yu-Heng Cheng, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer science. ""Cancer cells have many different appearances, and our algorithm recognizes them."" The team tested cancer cells that originated from four different women, measuring the cells immediately, after one week and after the second week. The computer program tracked which cells grew into spheres and which self-destructed. The team then looked for the answer to the puzzle of what size cell is most likely to be a stem cell. They compared the proportion of cells that went on to form tumorspheres, setting the smallest 30 percent of trapped single cells against the largest 30 percent. Like most answers in cancer, it wasn't simple. For one cell line, the small cells were twice as likely to grow, while the opposite was true for another. For the third, size didn't matter at all, and for the fourth, large cells were several times more likely to grow. But the team anticipates future studies to clarify the stem cell size question further. ""With this tool, experiments will be faster and easier, so we could screen many, many cell lines and potentially resolve the controversy here,"" said Yu-Chih Chen, assistant research professor in electrical engineering and computer science and in the Comprehensive Cancer Center.","Published: September 26, 2016"

The research team targeted the switch that allows the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus to survive in iron-deficient conditions like the human body. Specifically, they targeted an enzyme known as SidA, which is essential for the synthesis of molecules called siderophores that are made during infection to steal iron from human proteins. Furthermore, by performing high-throughput screening in the center s Drug Discovery Screening Laboratory, they found a compound called Celastrol that blocks the growth of iron-producing organelles in the fungus. The results were published in the journal ACS Chemical Biology.  This project shows what an asset the screening lab is to the community,  said Pablo Sobrado, a professor of biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and director of the screening laboratory.  Without the robots and chemical libraries available at the screening lab, this work would not have been possible. We are very fortunate at Virginia Tech to have this facility.  Aspergillus fumigatus is common and is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter. Most people are exposed to it daily with little consequence, but it can cause lung damage in people with compromised immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients and people with AIDS or leukemia. The mortality rate of this population, when exposed to the fungus, is more than 50 percent, according to the authors. ""Growing antibiotic resistance is demanding the development of target-directed therapies,"" said Julia S. Martin del Campo, a postdoctoral research scientist in Sobrado's lab. ""This approach requires the discovery of enzyme inhibitors that block essential pathogen pathways. The discovery of Celastrol as a SidA inhibitor represents the first building block in the development of drugs against A. fumigatus and related pathogens. ","Published: September 26, 2016"

Its burden is felt around the world and that burden is growing in many countries. According to the most recent estimates, worldwide, there were approximately 14 million new cancer cases in 2012. And that number is expected to swell by an additional 10 million cases over the next two decades. In April, while speaking alongside Pope Francis at a Vatican event, Vice President Biden stressed the role that biomedical research can, and must, play in addressing the impact of cancer and other diseases on global health.  We stand on the cusp of unprecedented scientific and technological changes that were once unimaginable breakthroughs,  he said.  But we cannot forget that real lives and real people are at the heart of and the reason for all that we do.  On that day, the Vice President called on the international community to build on the momentum of the Cancer Moonshot effort, asking leaders from across the globe to commit to making renewed and focused investments in cancer research, including increasing patient access to the latest treatment opportunities provided through research studies and increasing researchers  access to patient data. Earlier this week, in conjunction with the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, we took concrete steps toward establishing international collaborations that can help bring us closer to achieving this goal. Taking Advantage of Unparalleled Opportunities National investment in biomedical research and advanced technologies has created an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly increase our understanding of this collection of disease we call cancer and, importantly, develop innovative ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat them. By expanding outreach and finding new and innovative ways to take advantage of relationships that span borders among researchers, industry, governmental and non-governmental health organizations it is possible to accelerate progress in a way that, at one time, many might have considered to be impossible. In doing so, we can continue to transform how we think about cancer, approaching it not as something to be feared, but something we understand well and know how to prevent and treat effectively not just in wealthier nations, but in all nations.","Published: September 26, 2016"

Mutations in the gene caused the two to have movement and balance problems and the loss of some forms of touch. Despite their difficulties, they both appeared to cope with these challenges by relying heavily on vision and other senses.  Our study highlights the critical importance of PIEZO2 and the senses it controls in our daily lives,  said Carsten G. B nnemann, M.D., senior investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and a co-leader of the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The results establish that PIEZO2 is a touch and proprioception gene in humans. Understanding its role in these senses may provide clues to a variety of neurological disorders.  Dr. B nnemann s team uses cutting edge genetic techniques to help diagnose children around the world who have disorders that are difficult to characterize. The two patients in this study are unrelated, one nine and the other 19 years old. They have difficulties walking; hip, finger and foot deformities; and abnormally curved spines diagnosed as progressive scoliosis. Working with the laboratory of Alexander T. Chesler, Ph.D., investigator at NIH s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), the researchers discovered that the patients have mutations in the PIEZO2 gene that appear to block the normal production or activity of Piezo2 proteins in their cells. Piezo2 is what scientists call a mechanosensitive protein because it generates electrical nerve signals in response to changes in cell shape, such as when skin cells and neurons of the hand are pressed against a table. Studies in mice suggest that Piezo2 is found in the neurons that control touch and proprioception.  As someone who studies Piezo2 in mice, working with these patients was humbling,  said Dr. Chesler.  Our results suggest they are touch-blind. The patient s version of Piezo2 may not work, so their neurons cannot detect touch or limb movements.  Further examinations at the NIH Clinical Center suggested the young patients lack body awareness. Blindfolding them made walking extremely difficult, causing them to stagger and stumble from side to side while assistants prevented them from falling. When the researchers compared the two patients with unaffected volunteers, they found that blindfolding the young patients made it harder for them to reliably reach for an object in front of their faces than it was for the volunteers. Without looking, the patients could not guess the direction their joints were being moved as well as the control subjects could. The patients were also less sensitive to certain forms of touch. They could not feel vibrations from a buzzing tuning fork as well as the control subjects could. Nor could they tell the difference between one or two small ends of a caliper pressed firmly against their palms. Brain scans of one patient showed no response when the palm of her hand was brushed. Nevertheless, the patients could feel other forms of touch. Stroking or brushing hairy skin is normally perceived as pleasant. Although they both felt the brushing of hairy skin, one claimed it felt prickly instead of the pleasant sensation reported by unaffected volunteers. Brain scans showed different activity patterns in response to brushing between unaffected volunteers and the patient who felt prickliness. Despite these differences, the patients  nervous systems appeared to be developing normally. They were able to feel pain, itch, and temperature normally; the nerves in their limbs conducted electricity rapidly; and their brains and cognitive abilities were similar to the control subjects of their age.  What s remarkable about these patients is how much their nervous systems compensate for their lack of touch and body awareness,  said Dr. B nnemann.  It suggests the nervous system may have several alternate pathways that we can tap into when designing new therapies.  Previous studies found that mutations in PIEZO2 may have various effects on the Piezo2 protein that may result in genetic musculoskeletal disorders, including distal arthrogryposis type 5, Gordon Syndrome, and Marden-Walker Syndrome. Drs. B nnemann and Chesler concluded that the scoliosis and joint problems of the patients in this study suggest that Piezo2 is either directly required for the normal growth and alignment of the skeletal system or that touch and proprioception indirectly guide skeletal development.  Our study demonstrates that bench and bedside research are connected by a two-way street,  said Dr. Chesler.  Results from basic laboratory research guided our examination of the children. Now we can take that knowledge back to the lab and use it to design future experiments investigating the role of PIEZO2 in nervous system and musculoskeletal development.

Tardigrades, or water bears, are tiny aquatic creatures that can survive through incredible conditions including temperatures up to 100 degrees Celsius and as cold as absolute zero at minus 273 degrees Celsius, the vacuum of outer space, and extremely high pressures and intense radiation,  explains co-author Takekazu Kunieda, Assistant Professor at the University of Tokyo s Graduate School of Science.  While researchers have long been fascinated by their resilience, we still don t really know how it s possible. We need to find the molecules that allow tardigrades to tolerate such conditions.  Now, the scientists have found a new tardigrade protein that may explain why the tiny animals are resilient to extremely high amounts of radiation. They decoded, with high precision, the entire genome of the tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus that is known to survive exposure to high doses of radiation. Using this full genome, they found a new protein they have named Dsup (Damage Suppressor) that protects the DNA when it is irradiated. When human cultured cells were exposed to X-rays their DNA was damaged. However, when those same human cells were given the ability to create the Dsup protein, they showed approximately half the DNA damage. Further, and most surprisingly, the cultured cells that could create Dsup were still capable of reproducing.  What s astonishing is that previously, molecules that repair damaged DNA were thought to be important for tolerating radiation. On the contrary, Dsup works to minimize the harm inflicted on the DNA,  notes one of the lead authors Takuma Hashimoto, Project Researcher at the University of Tokyo s Graduate School of Science, who performed the tolerance experiments. He adds,  After exposing the cultured cells to X-rays, initially, we found only a small difference between those with and without Dsup; however, we left them in the incubator for a while in the hope that a key property of Dsup lay hidden somewhere in that miniscule difference, and that the difference would eventually become quite distinct. To our great surprise, when we checked the cells under the microscope some time later, their shape and number had changed significantly, far beyond our expectations.  The scientists believe that their precise tardigrade genome sequence is a treasure trove of other Dsup-like proteins and that more of these molecules that increase the creature s resilience will be found in future research.","Published: September 26, 2016"

Researchers at Kansas State University's Biosecurity Research Institute studied Culex species mosquitoes from across the country, including Vero Beach in Florida, which is near Miami-Dade County where mosquitoes are spreading Zika virus.  The research, ""Culex species mosquitoes and Zika virus,"" appears in the journal Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases and involves researchers from Rutgers University, the University of Florida and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The findings are important for controlling Zika virus in Florida and preventing its spread to other parts of the country, said Dana Vanlandingham, lead author and assistant professor of virology in the College of Veterinary Medicine.  ""It's very important to know that Culex mosquitoes are not able to transmit Zika,"" Vanlandingham said. ""It enables people to target their control strategies so that they aren't wasting time and effort on a mosquito that isn't transmitting Zika virus.""  It is the first Zika virus research publication from the Biosecurity Research Institute. Before this study, Culex mosquitoes' role in Zika virus was unclear. By studying Culex mosquitoes over a period of time, the researchers found that Zika virus did not multiply and instead disappeared in the species.  ""This is great news,"" said Stephen Higgs, co-author and director of the Biosecurity Research Institute. ""We can check this particular group of mosquitoes off the list here in the U.S. and focus efforts of control on the mosquitoes that we know can infect, like Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified Aedes aegypti, or yellow fever mosquito, and Aedes albopictus, or Asian tiger mosquito, as two species that transmit Zika virus. Both mosquitoes are widely distributed in the U.S. and are present in Kansas.  Culex mosquitoes are brown mosquitoes, while Aedes aegypti are black and Aedes albopictus are black and white. Culex mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis and live outside. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus can live in and around houses in plant trays, spare containers or gutters.  ""We need to know which mosquitoes to target and which mosquitoes not to target because mosquitoes live in different environments,"" said Vanlandingham, whose research focuses on zoonotic viruses   such as Japanese encephalitis and chikungunya. ""Some mosquitoes are found outside and some are more in people's homes. You need to know this in order to target your efforts."" Both Vanlandingham and Higgs emphasize the importance of personal responsibility in stopping the spread of Zika virus. Homeowners can get rid of small pools of water where mosquitoes breed and should use mosquito repellent as personal protection.   While a startup fund from the university's College of Veterinary Medicine provided funding for this Biosecurity Research Institute study, there is still a need for additional national funding to support research that stops Zika virus, said Higgs, who also has studied chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that has a similar transmission cycle to that of Zika virus. ""We thought that this research is so important with what is going on that we were able to use startup funding,"" Higgs said. ""This research is basic research because we don't know some of the most fundamental information about mosquitoes. Applied research   such as vaccines and diagnostics   are obviously very important, but there is a need for funding basic research as well.""

EI has selected Verne Global s data centre campus in Iceland to investigate the efficiencies of distributing large-scale genomics and computational biology data analysis. The research institute is renowned for its contribution to the analysis and data-sharing of the highly complex wheat genome that is critical to securing future global food supplies. In this project, a first for a UK academic institution, EI will examine the benefits of migrating a strategic collaborative bioinformatics analysis platform to Iceland via existing academic network providers JANET and NORDUnet. EI, through Verne Global, will have access to one of the world s most reliable power grids producing 100% geothermal and hydroelectric renewable energy. As EI s HPC analysis requirements continue to grow, Verne Global will enable the institute to save up to 70% in energy costs (based on 14p to 4p KWH rate) and with no additional power for cooling, significantly benefiting the organisation in their advanced genomics and bioinformatics research of living systems. As a leader in the Life Sciences HPC community, EI aims to better understand complex scientific issues and their impact to society by categorising, processing, and analysing the DNA of various crops, animals, insects and microbes. This includes their flagship project, bread wheat, which is one of the most perplexing genomes to study, with a genome sequence five times bigger and more complex than the human genome. One of EI s primary goals is to understand crop genomes so new varieties can be developed to secure food supply in the face of a growing population and environmental change. The cutting-edge high-throughput DNA sequencing instruments generate large amounts of data, from a few hundred gigabytes to several terabytes per run. The output requires significant computational effort making the storage, processing, analysis and sharing of the data extremely challenging.  Modern bioinformatics is driven by the generation of ever increasing volumes of genomic data requiring large and collaborative computing resources to help process it quickly and at scale. At EI, we have some of the largest computational platforms for the Life Sciences in Europe and the demand for our computing capability is only increasing, putting pressure on the capacity and operational costs of our existing data centres,  said Dr Tim Stitt, Head of Scientific Computing at EI.  We are, therefore, very excited to be partnering with Verne Global in Iceland, who not only can supply medium and high power computing density at significantly lower energy costs but who can also deliver excellent global network communications and data centre security,  said Stitt.  We are planning to publish a paper on our study, and I hope the impact of our collaboration with Verne Global will be the catalyst for many more academic institutions in the UK and Europe to consider migrating their computing infrastructures to Iceland and benefit from one of the world s most reliable and cost-effective green energy resources. I m very proud that EI is at the forefront of this shift,  Stitt concluded.  As more organisations turn to high-performance computing to process large data sets, demand is growing for scalable and secure data centre solutions. The source, availability and reliability of the power grid infrastructure is becoming a critical factor in a data centre site selection decision,  said Jeff Monroe, CEO at Verne Global.  Verne Global is able to deliver EI a forward-thinking path for growth with a solution that combines unparalleled costs savings with operational efficiencies to support their data-intensive research,  explained Monroe.","Published: September 26, 2016"

The study, published in Cell Reports, also indicates that another protein, protein kinase C (PKC)  / , may serve as a biomarker of IBD severity.  The intestine is protected by specialized cells, called Paneth cells, that secrete antimicrobial peptides,  said Jorge Moscat, Ph.D., deputy director and professor in the NCI-designated Cancer Center and senior author of the paper.  We found that maintaining normal numbers of Paneth cells requires PKC  / , and that the amount of PKC  /  decreases as IBD gets worse. We also discovered a way to prevent Paneth cell loss inhibiting a protein called EZH2, which could be a new therapeutic strategy for IBD.  IBD, which includes Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis, affects 1.4 million people in the U.S. These chronic conditions are often debilitating, as they cause unpredictable abdominal pain and diarrhea. Because current medications only help control symptoms and not the underlying disease, 70% of Crohn s patients and 30% of those with colitis must eventually undergo surgery. In addition, IBD increases risk of intestinal cancer by as much as 60%.  We also examined the effect of PKC  /  on tumor formation,  said Maria Diaz-Meco, Ph.D., also a professor in the Cancer Center and co-author of the paper.  In contrast to some previous studies indicating that it might promote cancer development, we demonstrate that in the intestine, PKC  /  is protective.   We inactivated the PKC  /  gene in the intestine of mice, which caused them to have very few Paneth cells,  added Diaz-Meco.  Without Paneth cells, the intestine is more susceptible to bacterial infiltration, which leads to inflammation. Since inflammation favors cancer, it makes sense that PKC  /  is a tumor suppressor in this setting.  To find a way to boost Paneth cell numbers and possibly treat IBD, the team looked for what drives the deficit in these protector cells. The key link was overactive EZH2, which turns off genes needed to generate Paneth cells.  We used an in vitro model mini guts  in a dish to show that blocking EZH2 helps return the number of Paneth cells to normal,  said Yuki Nakanishi, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Moscat/ Diaz-Meco lab and lead author of the work.  This demonstrates that inhibiting EZH2 could be a new way to slow the progression of IBD.  Importantly, the team verified the relevance of their findings in intestinal biopsy samples from 30 patients with Crohn s disease. Disease progression correlated with lower levels of PKC  / .

The STAG group will run across all service offerings of Envigo   including Pharmaceutical Development, Research Models and Services as well as Crop Protection and Chemicals Testing.  The key goal behind the new group is to advance Envigo s commitment to developing the next generation of research services, technology and science. As such, the group will sponsor internal programmes designed to develop new or improve existing capabilities. Selected external partnerships will also be explored   including collaborations with academia through postdoctoral sponsorship, placement and combined research   along with offering science and technology development services to customers.  Brian Burlinson, Deputy Chair of the STAG, commented:  We are encouraging our scientists to put forward new projects for funding, acting as an internal innovation incubator, but also, we are going out to market and asking our customers if they have research problems they would like us to develop into commercial solutions. However, it s not just about today s problems, as we are also partnering with universities, both on developing new science and offering work placements to graduates  our ethos is to instil a culture of new science that permeates all areas of the business.  Since its inception the group has already reviewed 16 internal applications and spoken with several external partners. One area that is showing a number of promising projects is non animal testing (NAT) for toxicology   in vitro or silico   as these solutions have the dual benefits of de-risking drug development and meeting the desire for reduced animal use.   The aim is to generate a balanced portfolio of projects into an annualised programme. Five projects have already been preliminarily approved for development   with more in the pipeline  added Burlinson. Another central goal of STAG is to work closely with Envigo s customers to develop new screening assays   utilising the company's advanced science and technology to meet on-going R&D demands.  One recent example is the development of in vitro assays that enables the testing of 100 or so compounds per month for potential endocrine disrupting effects. A key benefit of these assays is the capability to put fairly large numbers of compounds through the screens with very little material needed for use.  Beyond customer contracts the group is also planning to independently develop new assays and technologies that Envigo can potentially sell to customers in the future. STAG will also take on a longer term role in the process of attracting talented scientists, particularly high calibre university graduates, including PHDs, who possess specific, specialised skill sets that mirror scientific and technological projects planned or in development at Envigo. This will be achieved through the Science and Technology Advisory Group forming close collaborations with academic institutions and arranging for five or six selected students each year to take up work placements at the company. Envigo has already entered into such an arrangement with Kings College London for students with cardiovascular and pharmacology expertise.   The STAG will have a core membership of 6-8 representatives for the first 3-years from a range of technical disciplines across the company. However, after this period the STAG committee membership will rotate on 2-year cycles to ensure a regular impetus of new ideas and thinking. ","Published: September 26, 2016"

The results come from studies of the Greenland ice sheet and are published in the scientific journal, Environmental Science and Technology.  The Greenland ice sheet is a unique archive of the climate and atmospheric composition far back in time. The ice sheet is made up of snow that falls and never melts, but rather remains year after year and is gradually compressed into ice. By drilling ice cores down through the kilometre-thick ice sheet, the researchers can analyse every single annual layer, which can tell us about past climate change and concentration of greenhouse gases and pollutants in the atmosphere.   Acid in the atmosphere can come from large volcanic eruptions and manmade emissions from industry. You can measure acidity in the ice by simply passing an instrument that can measure conductivity over the ice core. If there is a high level of acidity, the measurement turns out and it works great for measuring the climate of the past all the way back to the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago. But if you want to measure atmospheric acidity for the last 100 years, it is more difficult as the annual layers are located in the uppermost 60 metres and there the ice is more porous as it has not yet been compressed into hard ice. Measures pollution from year to year But the last 100 years are interesting for climate researchers as it is the period where we have had massive pollution of the atmosphere from industrialisation, vehicle use and people s energy consuming lifestyles.  We have therefore developed a new method that can directly measure the acidity of the ice using a spectrometer. We have an ice rod that is cut along the length of the ice core. This ice core rod is slowly melted and the meltwater runs into a laboratory where they take a lot of chemical measurements. With our new method you can also measure the acidity, that is to say, we measure the pH value and this is seen when the water changes colour after the addition of a pH dye. We can directly see the fluctuations from year to year,  explains Helle Astrid Kj r, postdoc in the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen. For many years, there has been a quest to solve the problem of measuring acidity in the porous annual layers of the ice and now scientists from the Niels Bohr Institute have succeeded. The method is a Continuous Flow Analyses or CFA method and it was originally invented in Switzerland, but Helle Astrid Kj r has spearheaded the further development of the system so it can also measure acid. Distinguishes between natural and manmade sources In addition to being able to measure the pH value more accurately using the new method, the CFA system can also distinguish whether the emissions come from volcanic eruptions, large forest fires or industry. The researchers can therefore filter out both volcanic eruptions and forest fires in the assessment of industrial pollution and the new results are revolutionary.   We can see that the acid pollution in the atmosphere from industry has fallen dramatically since manmade acid pollution took off in the 1930s and peaked in the 1960s and 70s. In the 1970s, both Europe and the United States adopted the  The clean air act amendments , which required filters in factories, thus reducing acid emissions and this is what we can now see the results of. The pollution of acid in the atmosphere is now almost down to the level it was before the pollution really took off in the 1930s, explains Helle Astrid Kj r.   The new pH method has already been used on ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica by research teams from New Zealand, the United States and Denmark.","Published: September 26, 2016"

Glioblastoma is one of the most common types of malignant brain tumors in adults. They are fast growing and can spread easily. The tumor has threadlike tendrils that extend into other parts of the brain making it difficult to remove it all. See Also: New combination treatment strategy to 'checkmate' glioblastoma Although there have been great advances made in the treatment of leukemias and other cancers, little is known about how glioblastomas are formed and how these tumors infiltrate the brain tissue.

The findings suggest that if you are able to block specific enzymes called ADAM10 and ADAM17 the tumor stops growing and spreading. It also moves the cancer cells away from the place where they were growing which could allow them to be removed through traditional cancer treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery.

Patients who are diagnosed with these metastases have an expected median survival of only 4 to 5 months. Moffitt Cancer Center researchers hope to improve these survival rates following a new study in Annals of Oncology that shows novel immune and targeted therapies with radiation therapy improves the outcomes of patients with melanoma brain metastases over conventional chemotherapy. See Also: Cancer genes turned off in deadly brain cancer Common treatment options for patients with melanoma brain metastases are surgery, whole brain radiation therapy, and focused radiation therapy called stereotactic radiation. These treatments may also be combined with conventional chemotherapy. However, according to Kamran Ahmed, MD, lead study author and resident in the Department of Radiation Oncology at Moffitt, ""conventional chemotherapy has failed to improve outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastases."" Recent advances in therapies that target specific proteins have changed the standard-of-care for melanoma patients without brain metastases, suggesting that immune and targeted therapies may also be beneficial in patients with melanoma brain metastases. This is supported by past studies from the Moffitt researchers showing the immunotherapy agent, nivolumab, which targets the protein PD-1, combined with stereotactic radiation therapy, is effective and safe in patients with melanoma brain metastases. In their most recent Annals of Oncology publication, Moffitt researchers sought to determine if patients with melanoma brain metastases treated with immune and targeted therapies had improved outcomes over patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. They retrospectively analyzed data from 96 patients with melanoma brain metastases who were treated with stereotactic radiation therapy within 3 months of different targeted therapies (anti-PD-1 therapy, anti-CTLA-4 therapy, BRAF inhibitor plus a MEK inhibitor, or a BRAF inhibitor alone) or conventional chemotherapy. The researchers found that targeted treatments were better able to control tumor growth outside the irradiated field in the brain than standard conventional chemotherapy. Patients who were treated with radiation therapy after anti-PD-1 therapy or BRAF/MEK inhibitors had the best tumor control out of all treatment groups analyzed. Patients treated with stereotactic radiation and either anti-PD-1 therapy or BRAF/MEK inhibitors also had improved survival when compared to the survival of other treatment groups. Forty-one percent of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy and 39 percent of patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors survived 12 months without systemic disease progression, while only 5 percent of conventional chemotherapy patients survived 12 months without systemic disease progression. Similarly, the 12-month overall survival rates were 48 percent for anti-PD-1 therapy, 65 percent for BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and 10 percent for conventional chemotherapy.

But many such children one study estimates 60 percent go undiagnosed until kindergarten or even later. Researchers at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute of Health Professions hope to change that, with a computer system that can automatically screen young children for speech and language disorders and, potentially, even provide specific diagnoses. See Also: Study suggests more effective speech therapy approach for children with Down syndromeThis month, at the Interspeech conference on speech processing, the researchers reported on an initial set of experiments with their system, which yielded promising results. ""We're nowhere near finished with this work,"" says John Guttag, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor in Electrical Engineering and senior author on the new paper. ""This is sort of a preliminary study. But I think it's a pretty convincing feasibility study."" The system analyzes audio recordings of children's performances on a standardized storytelling test, in which they are presented with a series of images and an accompanying narrative, and then asked to retell the story in their own words. ""The really exciting idea here is to be able to do screening in a fully automated way using very simplistic tools,"" Guttag says. ""You could imagine the storytelling task being totally done with a tablet or a phone. I think this opens up the possibility of low-cost screening for large numbers of children, and I think that if we could do that, it would be a great boon to society."" The researchers evaluated the system's performance using a standard measure called area under the curve, which describes the tradeoff between exhaustively identifying members of a population who have a particular disorder, and limiting false positives. (Modifying the system to limit false positives generally results in limiting true positives, too). In the medical literature, a diagnostic test with an area under the curve of about 0.7 is generally considered accurate enough to be useful; on three distinct clinically useful tasks, the researchers' system ranged between 0.74 and 0.86. Related: Brain area that integrates speech s rhythms found To build the new system, Guttag and Jen Gong, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the new paper, used machine learning, in which a computer searches large sets of training data for patterns that correspond to particular classifications in this case, diagnoses of speech and language disorders. The training data had been amassed by Jordan Green and Tiffany Hogan, researchers at the MGH Institute of Health Professions, who were interested in developing more objective methods for assessing results of the storytelling test. ""Better diagnostic tools are needed to help clinicians with their assessments,"" says Green, himself a speech-language pathologist. ""Assessing children's speech is particularly challenging because of high levels of variation even among typically developing children. You get five clinicians in the room and you might get five different answers."" Unlike speech impediments that result from anatomical characteristics such as cleft palates, speech disorders and language disorders both have neurological bases. But, Green explains, they affect different neural pathways: Speech disorders affect the motor pathways, while language disorders affect the cognitive and linguistic pathways. Green and Hogan had hypothesized that pauses in children's speech, as they struggled to either find a word or string together the motor controls required to produce it, were a source of useful diagnostic data. So that's what Gong and Guttag concentrated on. They identified a set of 13 acoustic features of children's speech that their machine-learning system could search, seeking patterns that correlated with particular diagnoses. These were things like the number of short and long pauses, the average length of the pauses, the variability of their length, and similar statistics on uninterrupted utterances. Learn More: Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism The children whose performances on the storytelling task were recorded in the data set had been classified as typically developing, as suffering from a language impairment, or as suffering from a speech impairment. The machine-learning system was trained on three different tasks: identifying any impairment, whether speech or language; identifying language impairments; and identifying speech impairments. One obstacle the researchers had to confront was that the age range of the typically developing children in the data set was narrower than that of the children with impairments: Because impairments are comparatively rare, the researchers had to venture outside their target age range to collect data. Gong addressed this problem using a statistical technique called residual analysis. First, she identified correlations between subjects' age and gender and the acoustic features of their speech; then, for every feature, she corrected for those correlations before feeding the data to the machine-learning algorithm.

""These results offer the first significant window into the mechanisms driving HIV-related brain damage and how to track the disease,"" said Dr. Ndhlovu, Associate Professor in JABSOM's Department of Tropical Medicine. Combination antiretroviral therapies have improved HIV survival. If started early and taken daily for life, antiretroviral therapies can result in fewer non-AIDS related complications. However, HIV still impacts the brain. Around 40% of individuals even on antiretroviral therapy still suffer HIV-related neurocognitive disorders that can affect living activities. It has long been suspected that changes to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, a type of immune cell, influence the development of cognitive impairment in HIV. Since HIV infection itself alters epigenetic processes in the immune system, the research team wondered whether a distinct DNA methylation profile, a major epigenetic modification where methyl groups are added to DNA, occurs in those with HIV associated-cognitive impairment and whether it exists in distinct immune cell populations from the blood.

The technology, a genome-editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9, revolutionized the life sciences when it appeared on the market in 2012. It is proving useful in the plant science community as a powerful tool for the improvement of agricultural crops. The ability to alter several genes at once promises to advance researchers  understanding of how genes interact to shape plant development and responses to environmental changes.  However, a challenge of this technology has been identifying the impact of editing on genomic regions that were not targeted. David Haak, an assistant professor of plant pathology, physiology, and weed science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, developed a bioinformatics program using deep sequencing data to test whether the team s editing of the genome of the Arabidopsis plant was both efficient and specific in its targeting. The team's finding that CRISPR-Cas9 is a reliable method for multi-gene editing of this particular plant species was published in PLOS ONE.  We were surprised to see that we had targeted gene editing efficiencies ranging from 30-85 percent with no detectable off-target editing,  said Haak, who is also affiliated with the university s Fralin Life Science Institute and the Global Change Center. ""The ability to edit gene function in a specific manner using CRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to really change how we study plants in the lab and improve crop efficiency,  said co-author Zachary Nimchuk, an assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina.  But, there have been concerns about the potential for undesired off-target effects. We tested this in plants, targeting 14 sites at once, and found no off-target events in a large population of plants. Our data expands on previous work to suggest that, at least in Arabidopsis, off-target events are going to be extremely rare with Cas9.""

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/biomolecular-manufacturing-onthego-188584,Biomolecular Manufacturing  On the Go  Wyss Institute team unveils a low cost  portable method to manufacture biomolecules for a wide range of vaccines  other therapies as well as diagnostics  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Even amidst all the celebrated advances of modern medicine, basic life-saving interventions are still not reaching massive numbers of people who live in our planet s most remote and non-industrialized locations. The World Health Organization states that one half of the global population lives in rural areas. And according to UNICEF, last year nearly 20 million infants globally did not receive what we would consider to be basic vaccinations required for a child s health. These daunting statistics are largely due to the logistical challenge of transporting vaccines and other biomolecules used in diagnostics and therapy, which conventionally require a ""cold chain"" of refrigeration from the time of synthesis to the time of administration. In remote areas lacking power or established transport routes, modern medicine often cannot reach those who may need it urgently. A team of researchers at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering has been working toward a paradigm-shifting goal: a molecular manufacturing method that can produce a broad range of biomolecules, including vaccines, antimicrobial peptides and antibody conjugates, anywhere in the world, without power or refrigeration. Now the team has unveiled what they set out to deliver, a ""just add water"" portable method that affordably, rapidly, and precisely generates compounds that could be administered as therapies or used in experiments and diagnostics. ""The ability to synthesize and administer biomolecular compounds, anywhere, could undoubtedly shift the reach of medicine and science across the world,"" said Wyss Core Faculty member James Collins, Ph.D., senior author on the study, who is also Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) s Department of Biological Engineering. ""Our goal is make biomolecular manufacturing accessible wherever it could improve lives."" The approach, called ""portable biomolecular manufacturing"" by Collins  team, which also included Neel Joshi, Ph.D., a Wyss Core Faculty member and Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Harvard s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), hinges on the idea that freeze-dried pellets containing ""molecular machinery"" can be mixed and matched to achieve a wide variety of end-products. By simply adding water, this molecular machinery can be set in motion. Compounds manufactured using the method could be administered in several ways to a patient, including injection, oral doses or topical applications. As described in the study, a vaccine against diphtheria was synthesized using the method and shown to successfully induce an antibody response against the pathogen in mice. Subsequently, the team envisions that the method could be employed to create batches of tetanus or flu shots routinely manufactured in remote clinics. Vaccines against emerging infectious disease outbreaks could quickly be mobilized in the field to contain spiraling epidemics. Episodes of food poisoning could be dosed orally with the production of neutralizing antibodies produced on the spot. Flesh wounds susceptible to infection could be applied with topical antimicrobial peptides generated on demand. In these manners, the team s approach could be leveraged to design a vast number of different lifesaving measures. The approach is built upon work described in a seminal 2014 paper also published in Cell, when the team demonstrated that transcription and translation machinery could function in vitro, without being inside living cells, inside freeze-dried slips of ordinary paper embedded with synthetic gene networks. Building off that work, the novel manufacturing method employs two types of freeze-dried pellets containing different kinds of components. The first kind of pellet contains the cell-free ""machinery"" that will synthesize the end product. The second kind contains DNA instructions that will tell the ""machinery"" what compound to manufacture. When the two types of pellets are combined and rehydrated with water, the biomolecular manufacturing process is triggered. The second type of pellet can be customized to produce a wide range of final products. Since they are freeze-dried, the pellets are extremely stable and safe for long-term storage at room temperature for up to and potentially beyond one year. ""This approach could   with very little training   put therapeutics and diagnostic tools in the hands of clinicians working in remote areas without power,"" said Keith Pardee, Ph.D., a co-first author on the study who was a Wyss Research Scientist and is now an Assistant Professor in the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto. ""Currently, distribution of life-saving doses of protein-based preventative and interventional medicines are often restricted by access to an uninterrupted chain of cold refrigeration, which many areas of the world lack."" The cost of the approach, at roughly three cents per microliter, could also give access to biomolecular manufacturing to researchers and educators who lack access to wet labs and other sophisticated equipment, impacting basic science beyond the immediately apparent promise in clinical applications. ""Synthetic biology has been harnessed to increase efficiency of manufacturing of biological products for medical and energy applications in the past, however, this new breakthrough utterly changes the application landscape,"" said Wyss Core Faculty member Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard s SEAS. ""It s really exciting because this new biomolecular manufacturing technology potentially offers a way to solve the cold chain problem that still restricts delivery of vaccines and other important medical treatments to patients in the most far-flung corners of the world who need them the most.""","Published: September 23, 2016"

Female mosquitoes bite to get blood for egg production and are the prime carriers of the pathogens that cause malaria, Zika, and dengue fever. In this case, Zhijian  Jake  Tu and colleagues found that placing a particular Y chromosome gene on the autosomes of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes   a species responsible for transmitting malaria   killed off 100 percent of all female embryos that inherited this gene. The extra copy of this gene, which the researchers call Guy1, is passed on to both sexes but only males survive. Furthermore, these male mosquitoes do not appear to have any detectable reproductive disadvantages in the laboratory.  The Guy1 protein is a strong candidate of the male determining factor in Anopheles stephensi,  said Tu, a professor of biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a member of the Fralin Life Science Institute Vector-borne Disease Research Group. The Guy1 gene is not related to Nix, a male determining factor recently discovered in the Aedes aegypti mosquito by Tu s lab and collaborators.  The extra copy of the Guy1 gene is only passed down to half of the progeny, leaving some females among the mosquitoes that did not inherit the gene in the next generation,  said Frank Criscione, who is the first author of the paper and worked on the project when he was a graduate student in the Tu laboratory. In order to produce all male offspring, all progeny needs to inherit this extra copy of Guy1. This is one of the group s future objectives and can potentially be achieved by using genome-editing.","Published: September 23, 2016"

The work will determine if large scale RNA profiling from peripheral blood and other patient-derived sample sources cultured in the Avatar System and correlated to clinical outcomes can predict a patient s response to first or second line treatments in prostate, bladder and kidney cancers.  Charles J. Ryan, MD, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Urology and the Clinical Program Leader for Genitourinary Medical Oncology at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, has been collaborating with Xcell for several years on a number of projects. The latest involves studying the relationship between genomic variation in prostate cancer patient samples and response to treatment, including in patients who have developed resistance to standard of care therapies.  We are particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity to use the Avatar system to compare results from liquid biopsies to actual tissue biopsies,  said Dr. Ryan.  We also are optimistic about the ability to use the system to look at broad-scale genomic alterations in cancer patients without the necessity for looking at circulating tumor cells, cell free DNA or tissue biopsies. Xcell s system offers the opportunity to look at different types of analysis all with one blood draw   for example, potential relationships between immunology, androgen receptors, and DNA repair in prostate cancer.  Terry Friedlander, MD, Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at UCSF, is collaborating on studies involving prostate and bladder cancer.  We are excited about this collaboration and the potential ability to use the Avatar system as an immunologic springboard,  he said.  Predicting treatment response is a huge unanswered question in oncology in general. If the Avatar system can keep the cells in the same state that they were in the body, we may get a more accurate read on the activation status of the immune system and determine markers that might help predict response to treatment.  UCSF medical oncologist Won Kim, MD, who is leading a study in kidney cancer, added:  Kidney cancer is a disease where we have a real shortage of predictive and prognostic biomarkers. For this pilot study, we re hopeful that we will show that the data generated from Xcell s platform will help us identify which patients with renal cell cancer are more likely to respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immunotherapy. We all want these feasibility studies to succeed because there are so many cancers where tissue is just not easy to access.  James Lim, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Xcell Biosciences, commented,  We are delighted to continue our collaborative work with UCSF, a leading center for cancer clinical research, on these new studies. We believe our RNA-based whole transcriptome approach to liquid biopsy will enable us to generate unique gene expression signatures that will predict a patient s response to a given therapeutic. Our goal is to ultimately demonstrate evidence that the Avatar system s physiologically relevant microenvironments can provide unparalleled and previously unavailable diagnostic insights enabling oncologists to treat patients more effectively and also at the right time.

Mutations in the gene caused the two to have movement and balance problems and the loss of some forms of touch. Despite their difficulties, they both appeared to cope with these challenges by relying heavily on vision and other senses.  Our study highlights the critical importance of PIEZO2 and the senses it controls in our daily lives,  said Carsten G. B nnemann, M.D., senior investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and a co-leader of the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The results establish that PIEZO2 is a touch and proprioception gene in humans. Understanding its role in these senses may provide clues to a variety of neurological disorders.  Dr. B nnemann s team uses cutting edge genetic techniques to help diagnose children around the world who have disorders that are difficult to characterize. The two patients in this study are unrelated, one nine and the other 19 years old. They have difficulties walking; hip, finger and foot deformities; and abnormally curved spines diagnosed as progressive scoliosis. An NIH Study shows that two young patients with a mutation in the PIEZ02 have problems with touch and proprioception, or body awareness. Working with the laboratory of Alexander T. Chesler, Ph.D., investigator at NIH s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), the researchers discovered that the patients have mutations in the PIEZO2 gene that appear to block the normal production or activity of Piezo2 proteins in their cells. Piezo2 is what scientists call a mechanosensitive protein because it generates electrical nerve signals in response to changes in cell shape, such as when skin cells and neurons of the hand are pressed against a table. Studies in mice suggest that Piezo2 is found in the neurons that control touch and proprioception.  As someone who studies Piezo2 in mice, working with these patients was humbling,  said Dr. Chesler.  Our results suggest they are touch-blind. The patient s version of Piezo2 may not work, so their neurons cannot detect touch or limb movements.  Further examinations at the NIH Clinical Center suggested the young patients lack body awareness. Blindfolding them made walking extremely difficult, causing them to stagger and stumble from side to side while assistants prevented them from falling. When the researchers compared the two patients with unaffected volunteers, they found that blindfolding the young patients made it harder for them to reliably reach for an object in front of their faces than it was for the volunteers. Without looking, the patients could not guess the direction their joints were being moved as well as the control subjects could. The patients were also less sensitive to certain forms of touch. They could not feel vibrations from a buzzing tuning fork as well as the control subjects could. Nor could they tell the difference between one or two small ends of a caliper pressed firmly against their palms. Brain scans of one patient showed no response when the palm of her hand was brushed. Nevertheless, the patients could feel other forms of touch. Stroking or brushing hairy skin is normally perceived as pleasant. Although they both felt the brushing of hairy skin, one claimed it felt prickly instead of the pleasant sensation reported by unaffected volunteers. Brain scans showed different activity patterns in response to brushing between unaffected volunteers and the patient who felt prickliness. Despite these differences, the patients  nervous systems appeared to be developing normally. They were able to feel pain, itch, and temperature normally; the nerves in their limbs conducted electricity rapidly; and their brains and cognitive abilities were similar to the control subjects of their age.  What s remarkable about these patients is how much their nervous systems compensate for their lack of touch and body awareness,  said Dr. B nnemann.  It suggests the nervous system may have several alternate pathways that we can tap into when designing new therapies.  Previous studies found that mutations in PIEZO2 may have various effects on the Piezo2 protein that may result in genetic musculoskeletal disorders, including distal arthrogryposis type 5, Gordon Syndrome, and Marden-Walker Syndrome. Drs. B nnemann and Chesler concluded that the scoliosis and joint problems of the patients in this study suggest that Piezo2 is either directly required for the normal growth and alignment of the skeletal system or that touch and proprioception indirectly guide skeletal development.  Our study demonstrates that bench and bedside research are connected by a two-way street,  said Dr. Chesler.  Results from basic laboratory research guided our examination of the children. Now we can take that knowledge back to the lab and use it to design future experiments investigating the role of PIEZO2 in nervous system and musculoskeletal development.  This work was supported by the NCCIH and NINDS intramural research programs.","Published: September 23, 2016"

The multinational research effort, led by Harvard Medical School geneticists and published Sept. 21 in Nature, also suggests that no single genetic change or small group of changes is likely to explain the substantial transformations in human culture and cognition seen in the last 50,000 years. The study represents the largest data set yet of high-quality genome sequences from understudied populations, adding nearly 6 million DNA base pairs to the  canonical  human genome sequence published in 2001. The data identify millions of previously unknown mutations that may help scientists develop precision-targeted diagnostics and treatments and improve health care for the world s underserved populations. Most genome-wide population sequencing studies to date have focused on a handful of populations of large census size. The HMS-led study, by comparison, sequenced samples from 142 smaller populations, most of which were previously unstudied.  As humans, we are not just the people who live in industrialized countries, and we are not just the people who live in numerically large groups,  said David Reich, professor of genetics at HMS and senior author of the study.  If we want to understand who we really are, we have to realize that some of the most interesting aspects of human variation are only present in underrepresented, small populations.   We wanted to go out into the world and pull together as many of the ethnically, linguistically and anthropologically diverse samples as we possibly could,  said Swapan Mallick, bioinformatic systems director in the Reich lab and first author of the study. The team s analyses are already answering questions about various populations  genetic origins, but, the researchers note, these insights are only a milestone on a longer journey.  Of course, there are thousands of ethnically distinct populations in the world, and much more work needs to be done,  said Mallick. Clarifying history Reich, Mallick and their international team of colleagues began by selecting two genomes each from 51 populations represented in a collection called the Human Genome Diversity Project. Next, they assembled samples from members of 91 other groups, including diverse Native American, South Asian and African populations not previously included in genome-wide studies, and sent the DNA for sequencing. In all, the project analyzed the genomes of 300 people. A key conclusion that the vast majority of modern human ancestry in non-Africans derives from a single population that migrated out of Africa is also supported by two other whole-genome sequencing studies appearing simultaneously in Nature. One, led by an Estonian group, focused on 379 whole genome sequences; the other, led by a Danish group, analyzed 108 Australians and New Guineans. Together, the three studies put to rest a lingering question about whether indigenous peoples of Australia, New Guinea and the Andaman Islands descend in large part from a second group that left Africa earlier and skirted the coast of the Indian Ocean. They do not, the HMS researchers say.  Our best estimate for the proportion of ancestry from an early-exit population is zero,  said Reich, who is also an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and associate member of the Broad Institute.  Taken together, all three studies leave wiggle room for, at most, around two percent.  The HMS-led study further revealed that the common ancestors of modern humans began to differentiate at least 200,000 years ago, long before the out-of-Africa dispersal occurred.  It had been unclear whether the group that expanded out of Africa represented a large subset of the populations within Africa,  said Mallick.  This really shows that there was a lot of substructure prior to the expansion.  The additional discovery that genetics alone can t account for the acceleration of cultural, economic and intellectual progress in the last 50,000 years runs contrary to a popular hypothesis in the field.  There does not seem to have been one or a few enabling mutations that suddenly appeared among our ancestors and allowed them to think in profoundly different ways,  said Reich. Instead, the researchers say, a constellation of factors, including environment, lifestyle and possibly genetics, likely drove the great changes that occurred.  Geneticists often search for examples where genetics is the explanation. Here, paradoxically, genetic data are showing that there will be no clear genetic answers,  Reich said. Overcoming hurdles Mallick and colleagues overcame significant logistical hurdles posed by sharing and processing an enormous amount of data. Often, in studies of this size, data are collected in many laboratories that use different sequencing machines and different experimental protocols. This can create so-called batch effects that make it difficult to distinguish true differences among samples. The current study minimized batch effects by sending all of the samples to a single center to be sequenced at the same time. The team made much of the data set publicly available in 2014; multiple research groups have already used it for their studies. In a way, the authors say, the findings reported thus far are just the tip of the iceberg.  It s impossible for our group to analyze even a tiny fraction of what the data represents,  said Mallick.  Our goal is to push the data out and let people use it to consider their own questions.   A project of this magnitude is a combination of considerable efforts from multiple groups and creates an important resource for researchers worldwide,  Mallick added.  Such work is only possible in the environment and with the remarkable support from administration and computing groups here at HMS. ","Published: September 23, 2016"

""The study is exploratory,"" Maguire said. ""We are the only site in the world conducting this trial; ecopipam has never been tested for stuttering. It has been tested for treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome, a neurological disease, with some encouraging results. Stuttering shares some similarities to the vocal changes seen in subjects with Tourette syndrome. We are hopeful ecopipam will yield beneficial effects in stuttering."" Ecopipam is a first-in-class drug that selectively blocks the actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine at its receptor. Dopamine receptors can be broadly classified into two families based on their structures: D1 receptors and D2 receptors. Ecopipam blocks dopamine only at D1 receptors, and thus acts differently than other commercially available medications. This mechanism explains why ecopipam is being tested as a potential treatment for stuttering. Don't Miss: Brain s iconic seat of speech goes silent when we actually talk The 10 patients selected for the clinical trial next month will undergo a physical examination and their medical history will be recorded. To ensure that their stuttering symptoms are sufficiently severe, their speech patterns will be analyzed by Professor Lisa LaSalle, a speech pathologist at the University of Redlands, and co-investigator on the study. Each patient will receive ecopipam for a limited time. ""We believe we could have results from our analysis in as soon as nine months,"" Maguire said. ""A placebo-controlled clinical trial may then follow, pending approval. If ecopipam is found to be effective in controlling stuttering, we may have a viable solution for a disorder that can be traced back centuries."" The study is being funded through philanthropic donations given to UC Riverside specifically to study stuttering. Psyadon, a pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for neurology and psychiatry, will donate ecopipam. Earlier this year, Maguire was elected chair of the board of directors of the National Stuttering Association (NSA, US), a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing hope and empowerment to children and adults who stutter. A professor of psychiatry and neuroscience and a stutterer himself, Maguire earned his medical degree from St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1991 and his residency in psychiatry in 1995 from UC Irvine. His research interests include the medical treatments of stuttering and the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's dementia.

The drug is the most widely prescribed pill-based therapy for MS, but its biological mechanism remains mysterious. Using a new TSRI technology that can quickly reveal a drug's protein targets, the scientists showed that Tecfidera interacts with multiple T-cell proteins, in some cases inhibiting their activity, and helping to suppress the T-cell activation that is a key feature of MS flare-ups. See Also: New MRI technique offers faster diagnosis of multiple sclerosis ""This new technology has given us insights into the therapeutic modulation of the immune system that we could not have obtained with standard approaches,"" said co-senior author John Teijaro, an assistant professor at TSRI. The study is reported in Science Signaling. MS is an autoimmune disease of the brain featuring damage to nerve fibers and producing a range of symptoms, including tingling in the extremities, muscle weakness, muscle spasms, visual problems and mood instability. About 400,000 people in the United States and about 2.5 million worldwide have MS, mostly in a form with intermittent flare-ups of symptoms which can start to worsen inexorably. Two large clinical trials published in 2012 found that Tecfidera is almost twice as effective as an older standard MS drug at reducing the rate of flare-ups. It also appears to slow the disease's progression. But how the drug works has never been clear. Despite its recent (2013) US Food and Drug Administration approval for MS, the drug is neither new nor high-tech. It is a relatively simple organic compound, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), that has been in the biomedical literature for decades. It was once used in Europe to prevent mold growth in sofas during storage and shipping, although the European Union banned it from consumer products in 2009 after it was linked to severe allergic skin reactions. It has proved more useful as a pharmaceutical: since the 1990s it has been an effective treatment as the main ingredient in the drug Fumaderm for the autoimmune skin disease psoriasis. Success against psoriasis led to its investigation as a potential MS drug. Learn More: Researcher finds link between gut bacteria and multiple sclerosis Until recently, the leading theory was that DMF works against MS primarily by unleashing the activity of a protein called Nrf2, which helps protect the brain from autoimmune damage by marshaling a powerful anti-oxidant response and which may also reduce immune system activation. Studies published in the past year have suggested, however, that DMF works principally by reducing immune system activity and does so independently of Nrf2. In recent years, there have also have been several reports among patients taking Fumaderm or Tecfidera of a potentially fatal viral brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which normally occurs only in people whose immune systems have been seriously weakened. To get a clearer picture of the pathways through which DMF works against MS, co-senior author Benjamin Cravatt, chair of the Department of Chemical Physiology at TSRI, and first author Megan Blewett, a PhD candidate at TSRI, teamed up with Teijaro to show that DMF inhibits the activation of human T-cells. To identify the proteins targeted by DMF in these cells, the team then used a new research tool developed in the Cravatt laboratory. Described in a paper in Nature Methods in 2014, the tool enables researchers to globally map targets of a given drug compound in a complex sample of proteins, even the many thousands of proteins contained in live cells in a lab dish. The process specifically reveals where a compound makes very strong ""covalent"" bonds with cysteine amino acids on the proteins, cysteines being common targets of reactive drug molecules such as DMF. Don't Miss: Researcher finds link between gut bacteria and multiple sclerosis In this way, the team found that within activated human T-cells, DMF reacts with about 50 different cysteines, in about as many proteins. The affected proteins include enzymes and regulators of gene activity. ""Several are known as members of the NF- B signaling pathway, a critical pathway for T-cell activation,"" said Blewett. The team confirmed that DMF blocks the activation of T-cells, and that it does so, at least in part, by targeting two cysteine residues on the immune cell signaling enzyme PKC , thereby preventing PKC  from associating with CD28, another protein needed for proper T-cell activation. Even in T-cells lacking PKC , DMF was able to reduce signs of activation further. That and other evidence strongly suggest that DMF's full immune-damping impact results from its interactions with multiple proteins. ""People often assume that a given drug works by hitting one target, but DMF likely produces its immunomodulatory effects by hitting multiple targets,"" Blewett said. ""This study shows the value of applying large-scale chemical profiling methods to primary human cells to gain insights into the mechanism of action of an important immunomodulatory drug,"" Cravatt said. Cravatt, Teijaro, Blewett and their colleagues are now using the ""target map"" generated by this study to pursue the development of other compounds that might modulate immune activity in a more precise manner hitting only the most important cysteine targets, for example on PKC with fewer side-effects. ""We're interested ultimately in making more selective, site-specific drugs, both to reduce immune activity and to boost it,"" said Teijaro. Read Next: Pathological progression of multiple sclerosis documented for the first time He credits the strong multidisciplinary environment of TSRI for the successful collaboration. ""It really shows the strength of this place that chemical biologists can work with an immunologist like me to produce such valuable insights into drug therapy and the immune response,"" Teijaro said.

And now a team of researchers at Duke University say they can see those various emotional states flickering across the human brain. ""It's getting to be a bit like mind-reading,"" said Kevin LaBar, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke. ""Earlier studies have shown that functional MRI can identify whether a person is thinking about a face or a house. Our study is the first to show that specific emotions like fear and anger can be decoded from these scans as well."" See Also: Emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder: Too much drive and too little control? The data produced by a functional MRI hasn't changed, but the group is applying new multivariate statistics to the scans of brain activity to see different emotions as networks of activity distributed across areas of the conscious and unconscious brain. These networks were first mapped by the team in a March 2015 paper in the journal Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. They identified seven different patterns of brain activity reflecting contentment, amusement, surprise, fear, anger, sadness and neutrality. To build these maps, they had put 32 research subjects into the scanner and exposed them to two music clips and two film clips that had been shown to induce each of the seven emotions. The subjects also completed self-report questionnaires on their mood states for further validation. Analytical software called a machine learning algorithm was then presented with some of the subjects' data and tasked with finding a pattern that concurred with each emotional stimulus. Having learned what each of the seven states ought to look like, the algorithm was then presented with the scans of the rest of the study group and asked to identify their emotional states without knowing which emotion prompt they received. LaBar said the model performed better than chance at this task, despite differences in brain shapes and arousal levels between subjects. ""And it proved fairly sensitive,"" he said. The latest study, appearing in PLoS Biology, followed up by scanning 21 subjects who were not offered stimuli, but were encouraged to let their minds wander. Every thirty seconds, they responded to a questionnaire about their current emotional state. ""We tested whether these seven brain maps of emotions occurred spontaneously while participants were resting in the fMRI scanner without any emotional stimuli being presented,"" LaBar said. Read Next: 2-D or 3-D? Research shows no difference in emotional reactions between film formats when used for studies Data for the whole brain was collected every 2 seconds and each of these individual scans was compared to the seven patterns. The team examined the scanner data for the ten seconds previous to each self-report of mood, and found that the algorithm accurately predicted the moods the subjects self-reported. LaBar said another source of validation is the indication that there's a significant signal of anxiety at the beginning of each subjects' data as they enter the confined, noisy MRI for the first time. ""That's what you'd expect to see for most people when they first enter the machine."" In a second group of 499 subjects being scanned for the Duke Neurogenetics Study, the researchers had them rest in the scanner for nearly 9 minutes, and then asked them how depressed and anxious they felt after the scanning session. ""We found that the cumulative presence of our 'sad' emotion map, summed over time, predicted their depression scores, and the cumulative presence of our 'fear' emotion map predicted their anxiety scores,"" LaBar said. This larger group was also tested for personality measures of depression, anxiety, and angry hostility. Again, the maps for depression and anxiety closely mirrored these measures. ""We also showed that the cumulative presence of our 'angry' emotion map predicted individuals' angry hostility traits,"" LaBar said. Aside from being an interesting proof of concept, LaBar thinks these new maps of emotional states could be useful in studying people who have poor insight into their emotional status, and might be used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatments to regulate emotions. Learn More: Learning to turn down your amygdala can modify your emotionsLaBar says their conclusions about characteristic networks of brain areas governing emotional states also challenges prevailing theories about how emotions are formed. He adds that a Finnish team led by Lauri Nummenmaa has made similar maps of emotional networks from their brain scanning studies. In further research, the Duke group will be pursuing a better understanding of the timing of emotional states and the transitions between them, as these may be relevant for understanding affective disorders.

It seems obvious that speaking and understanding language draw upon our memories of words, context, people, etc. but psychologists have typically studied language and memory as separate functions of the brain, essentially ignoring any interconnection. See Also: The brain watched during language learningA new experiment conducted by University of California (UC), Berkeley psychologists shows that memory and language are in fact deeply linked, via the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory associations. The hippocampus, nestled in the center of the brain, acts like a router to link related memories the color, shape, feel, scent and taste of an orange, for example so that we are able to make associations. The brain region's new role in relating incoming words to stored semantic knowledge is necessary in understanding and generating sentence meaning, the researchers say. Interestingly, researchers recently reported patients with hippocampal damage who had exactly the sort of symptoms one would expect if the hippocampus were involved in language associations: problems relating word meanings to each other and extracting contextual information from sentences and discourse. ""The link between language and the hippocampus could be an explanation for some of the language deficits we see in patients who don't have damage to the language areas of the brain,"" said former UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Vit ria Piai, now a senior researcher at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. ""I think that once we start studying language as it happens in real life, we will find that the hippocampus is doing more in the service of language than we thought before."" The researchers recorded neuronal activity using electrodes inserted into the hippocampus of 12 people as they heard fill-in-the-blank sentences with an obvious answer: ""He swept the floor with a ________,"" for example. In most of the subjects, the hippocampus showed highly synchronized activity as they homed in on the right answer while hearing the sentences but before a picture of the answer was displayed, a sign that the region was making associations throughout the brain to come up with the right word: in this case, broom. Learn More: First language wires brain for later language-learningAccording to Piai, deep-brain recording captures millisecond by millisecond neuron firings, showing precisely how the brain deals with language in real time. Language studies most often employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures oxgyen flow in the brain, a slow process that doesn't allow researchers to measure activities that take place in a fraction of a second. ""Studies with fMRI show where things could be connected but it doesn't tell you how the brain is putting these things together,"" Piai said. ""I think you can only get to the 'how' question once you start using electrophysiology, which has a more direct relationship to neural activity in the signal than deoxygenated blood has. This experiment is so exciting because of the possibility that we will start to understand language and memory in a more integrated way, start examining it as it really happens."" The study, co-authored with Robert Knight, a UC Berkeley professor of psychology and former head of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, in published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""Language is something that has classically been viewed as evolving and occurring in the cortex, which is why we have language and rats don't,"" Knight said. ""Despite the fact that the hippocampal area of the medial part of the temporal lobe is well known to be linked to spatial and verbal memory in humans, the two fields have been like ships running in the fog, unaware that the other ship is there."" Read Next: Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism In the new study, conducted in epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial electrode studies at the UC Irvine Medical Center and Stanford University Medical Center to locate the source of their abnormal brain activity, Piai took advantage of a well-known behavioral effect to explore the involvement of the hippocampus in language. She recorded only from the non-epileptic hemisphere of the brain. Previous studies of language have shown that people fill in the blank more quickly when a sentence has only one obvious answer ""She locked the door with the ________,"" for example than when the sentence has many possible answers, such as ""She came in here with the ________."" In the new study, subjects heard six-syllable sentences, followed by a pause and then a brief flash of a picture of the answer. Subjects were asked to name the picture. In 10 of the 12 subjects, only constrained sentences those with a single obvious answer caused a burst of synchronized theta waves in the hippocampus, activity characteristic of the hippocampus when it makes a memory association. ""Vit ria showed that when you record directly from the human hippocampal region, as the sentence becomes more constraining, the hippocampus becomes more active, basically predicting what is going to happen,"" Knight said. ""The hippocampus started building up rhythmic theta activity that is linked to memory access and memory processing."" Over the years, Knight and others have studied brain activity using electrodes on the brain surface, so-called electrocortiocography, or inserted into the brain, called intracranial recording, and shown that memory neurons vibrate between 1 and 80 cycles per second. Neurons representing associated memories, however, vibrate with a ""theta"" rhythm in the range of 4-8 cycles per second. One theory is that when one of these associated neurons is triggered, all those vibrating with the same frequency fire simultaneously, giving us recall of related memories. The smell of an orange triggers a picture in the mind, the taste and smell of an orange, and any positive or negative emotions connected with oranges. Similarly, a constrained sentence would gradually build up synchronized vibrations among related memories. For the sentence ""He swept the floor with a ________,"" ""swept"" and ""floor"" trigger synchronized vibrations in different sets of neurons encoding related memories, overlapping with the only word tightly related to both: ""broom."" Piai suspects that when we hear unconstrained sentences, the words do not bring up any related or overlapping associations. Don't Miss: Predicting language deficits after stroke with connectome-based imagingThe new findings could open up a whole new area of study with intracranial recordings to probe details of the connection between language and memory, Knight said. ""This study shows that memory contributes as a sentence is evolving in time; it is a real-time part of our language system, not a slave to the language system,"" he said.

His major goal is to understand when, where and how mechanical signals, such as forces and local tissue stiffness, are involved in controlling cell development and function in the nervous system. With their JPK systems, they particularly want to figure out how the mechanical environment of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) looks like in the developing embryo as well as in regenerating spinal cord and brain tissue.  Using AFM and CellHesion  techniques among other microscopies, both commercial and custom-made, Dr Franze and others have shown that nervous tissue is mechanically heterogeneous. Furthermore, they found that neurons constantly exert forces on their environment and that both neurons and glial cells respond to mechanical cues. Understanding how and when CNS cells actively exert forces and respond to their mechanical environment will shed new light on CNS development and could eventually lead to novel biomedical approaches to treat or circumvent pathologies that involve mechanical signaling.  While AFM is well-accepted, the addition of a CellHesion  module greatly increases the force measurement capabilities. It provides the quantification of single cell-cell and cell-surface interactions under physiological conditions. In parallel to these forces, cytomechanical characteristics including stiffness and elasticity can be determined. In Dr Franze's group, the CellHesion  setup enables the measurement, for example, of brain tissue stiffness in living frog embryos with cellular resolution and the simultaneous observation of how fluorescently labelled neurons grow in that region.  Dr Franze has been using NanoWizard  AFMs from JPK since 2002 when he bought his first system as a PhD student. He has continued to select systems from JPK ever since. Discussing his reasons for choosing systems from JPK, he says,  I very much appreciate the long working distance in z of 100  m. This is key for the raster measurements of whole tissues in living embryos. I also like the ability of the Experiment PlannerTM which allows us to easily design our own experiments. The support we get from JPK's Alex Winkel is quite superb and underscores why we have such a great relationship with the company. ","Published: September 22, 2016"

Two parallel in-vivo pre-clinical studies have been completed. The first, a pharmacokinetics study looking at both human and mouse PD-L1 Affimer inhibitors1engineered as Fc fusions2, showed that Affimer molecules have good in-vivo serum half-lives and are well tolerated at the clinically relevant doses used in the study.  The second was an efficacy study using a mouse PD-L1 specific Affimer molecule in a syngeneic tumour model3. In this study the Affimer PD-L1 inhibitor produced a statistically significant reduction in tumour growth demonstrating the bioavailability and functionality of the Affimer molecule in tumours in-vivo. No adverse effects were observed. Alastair Smith, Avacta Group Chief Executive commented:  These results demonstrate that Affimer molecules possess good in-vivo drug-like properties in terms of efficacy, serum half-life and tolerability which is a hugely important milestone in the development and de-risking of the technology as a therapeutic platform. From the initial screening process for the Affimer binders we have been able to rapidly progress to evaluating them in in-vivo models, highlighting another major advantage of the technology. We are very encouraged by these initial positive results and will continue to focus on developing both our internal and partnered therapeutic programs towards clinical validation.

The study, originally funded by the Small Business Research Initiative for Healthcare (SBRI Healthcare), an NHS England funded initiative, aims to save 10,000 lives and save the NHS  245 million by 2020 with a quick, easy to use, non-invasive, high-compliance breath test to detect lung cancer. The study will recruit up to 3,000 patients across 21 sites in the UK and Europe, making it the world s largest breath-based study ever undertaken for early cancer detection. If detected at stage 1, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is 54%, but this drops to just 4% if the cancer is detected at stage 4. Current lung cancer screening tests, such as low dose computed tomography (CT screening), have been shown to result in a high number of false-positives and therefore unnecessary, invasive follow-up procedures on healthy patients.  The mutations that drive the development of lung cancer have downstream effects on the metabolites we exhale, even in the very early stages of lung cancer. Owlstone Medical uses the Respiration Collector for In Vitro Analysis (ReCIVA), in combination with the Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer (FAIMS) sensor platform, to accurately and selectively detect lung cancer volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath.  The trial is moving to the next phase as a consequence of positive interim sensitivity and specificity data, when compared to other available tests, with over 97% of patients reporting the breath test to be comfortable to perform.  The study is being led by Dr Robert Rintoul, lead clinician for Thoracic Oncology and Director of the Clinical Trials Unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK, and will recruit patients in order to validate breath biomarkers for the early detection of cancer and differentiation between benign and malignant tumors, which is a major problem in current screening approaches. The trial will compare Owlstone Medical s platform with current CT and PET screening tests, with the aim of demonstrating its ability to reduce the number of false-positive results and complications seen from invasive biopsy follow-ups. Patient recruitment is on target with twelve sites in the UK and elsewhere in Europe currently recruiting with nine more sites to come on board shortly. Commenting on the study, Dr Robert Rintoul said:  The need to explore novel approaches for the early detection in lung cancer has never been greater. I am particularly excited about the opportunity that the Owlstone LuCID project brings to study the role of VOCs for the early detection of lung cancer. If VOCs work, then it may be possible to use a simple breath test to help identify whether someone has lung cancer or not.  Billy Boyle, co-founder and CEO at Owlstone Medical, said:  Early detection through improved screening is the greatest opportunity for improving patient outcomes. Owlstone Medical was created specifically to advance our breathalyzer for very early stage diagnosis of disease, to enable more effective treatment and better patient outcomes.  At the European Respiratory Society International Congress in London earlier this month, the academic steering committee for Owlstone s LuCID clinical trial Phase II project met, and Owlstone held a workshop for its Stratification of Asthma Treatment by Breath Analysis (STRATA) SBRI Healthcare Phase I project, to combine input of a wide range of stakeholders into the project and report initial trial progress. This project aims to allow patients suffering from difficult-to-treat severe asthma to quickly find the treatment that will work best for them, increasing quality of life for patients and reducing health care costs.","Published: September 22, 2016"

The researchers, also from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology and in collaboration with the University s School of Medicine, have discovered that a protein known to control salt balance in animals works the same way in plants. The research, published in the journal Plant Cell and Environment, found that in plants, as in animals, a group of proteins, a type of  aquaporin , can transport salt ions as well as water. Aquaporins have long been known to act as pores by transporting water across membranes in plants and animals, and they play critical roles in controlling the water content of cells. But, until now, it was not known they could do the same with sodium ions (salt).  In animals, aquaporins are extremely important in water filtration in the kidney,  says project leader Professor Steve Tyerman.  In plants they can do the same thing   filter the water that goes through the plant. But under certain conditions some aquaporins can also let sodium ions through.  This may explain a lot of unsolved problems in plant biology, for instance how salt gets into the plants in the first place.  The researchers believe these  double-barrelled  aquaporins may be the elusive proteins that let sodium ions   the toxic component of salt   in and out of plant roots. Since the early 1990s researchers have known that salt enters plant roots in saline conditions via pores in the membrane, but the identity of these pores has remained a mystery. This particular aquaporin is abundant on the surface of roots.  We discovered that it has characteristics similar to the properties previously identified for the pores responsible for sodium ion transport,  says co-lead author Dr Caitlin Byrt, Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Agriculture, Food and Wine.  This finding opens new possibilities for modifying how plants respond to high salt and low water conditions.  The researchers say that this discovery will help them target ways of blocking the pathway of salt into plants. And plant breeders may be able to select varieties which have differences in the aquaporin protein. There are also exciting implications for understanding how plants function. The discovery will help plant scientists dissect the role these  double barreled  aquaporins play in how roots respond to osmotic shock and salt stress, how long distance water transport in plants occurs, and how leaves control the entry of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.","Published: September 22, 2016"

Published on-line in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease , the study describes the application of the workflow, TMTcalibrator, for high-sensitivity detection of phosphorylated tau and other disease-relevant biomarkers of Alzheimer s disease (AD) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The TMTcalibrator workflow combines analysis of diseased tissue and body fluids to enhance mass spectrometric detection of tissue-derived biomarkers at unparalleled levels of sensitivity. Demonstrating this, the study, the first to be published using TMTcalibrator, reports the detection of 47 tau phosphopeptides covering 31 clinically-relevant phosphorylation sites. In total 76.8% coverage of human tau in CSF was obtained.Previous attempts to profile phosphorylated tau in CSF using mass spectrometry have been limited to very few sites and based on a prior selection of targets. Using this workflow it was possible to detect different phosphopeptides in an unbiased manner. Commenting on the study, Dr Ian Pike, Chief Scientific Officer at Proteome Sciences said: This study clearly demonstrates the potential of combined tissue and fluid proteomics to discover and validate low abundant, tissue-derived biomarkers in peripheral fluids, which in this case resulted in the widest coverage of both tau and phosphorylated tau in human cerebrospinal fluid.  Many of the tau peptides showed strong regulation in the three Alzheimer s patients relative to three controls, and these may offer a means to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease in the future.  In addition to the most detailed profiling of CSF tau this study has provided over 100 other regulated proteins, with several whose genes carry mutations that increase the risk of AD, and these data will be reported in subsequent publications. Other contributors to the study were the University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden; University College London, UK; University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.","Published: September 22, 2016"

A team from the A*STAR Singapore Bioimaging Consortium and Nanyang Technology University has developed a  nano-photonics platform  that measures changes in the local tissue environment at the site of a tumor or cancer, by measuring enzyme reactions specific to the cancer. This nano-photonics platform includes a promising compound for increasing the contrast of photo-acoustic images, which allows imaging of tissue in vivo.  Nanomaterials have been recognized as promising platforms for the battle against many urgent health concerns including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases,  say lead researchers Malini Olivo from A*STAR and Xing Bengang from NTU.  However, a critical challenge remains in designing targeted nano-platforms that are capable of selectively localizing at the specific diseases; in particular, tumor sites for early-stage diagnosis and effective treatment,  explains Olivo, who says their new work addresses this challenge.  These developments have the potential to improve diagnostics and allow for the development of therapies that can be delivered at the cell level, leading to fewer side effects,  says Olivo. Previously direct targeting of diseased cells had used ligands (or molecules) to bind nanoparticles to a cell with the complementary receptor. However, Olivo says the inability of the ligand to differentiate between normal and tumor cells was a flaw in the strategy. A key to the latest innovation is that the nano-photonics platform is adapted to respond to a tumor-specific enzyme and then accumulate at that site. The accumulation of the nano-photonics platform improves the effectiveness of light treatments that kill cancer cells, such as photodynamic therapy and laser irradiation, and opens the possibility of inhibiting tumor growth through injection of nanoscale smart drugs. Olivo says nanostructures offer great potential in biomedical applications due to properties such as tunable chemical composition, flexible morphology, high surface area, and multivalent binding ability. Nanostructures also have the potential to penetrate pores in the lining of blood and lymphatic vessel walls allowing the nanostructures to more effectively target and accumulate into the diseased region. Olivo says their approach could be expanded into other areas of nanomedicine, opening  new doors for selective and precise theranostics in future clinical applications .","Published: September 22, 2016"

That s Botrytis cinerea, a fungal pathogen that can infect more than 1,000 plant species, including almost every fruit and vegetable and many flowers. Wine grapes are also a notable host   in grapes the condition is known as bunch rot. It causes billions of dollars in crop loss annually. A team of researchers, led by Hailing Jin, a University of California, Riverside professor of plant pathology and microbiology, have developed a new strategy that could provide an easy-to-use and environmentally friendly fungicide to fight B. cinerea and other fungal pathogens that harm crops. These findings build on a paper by Jin s group published in 2013 in the journal Science. In that paper, they outlined how they discovered the mechanism by which B. cinerea infects plants. Many pathogens secrete protein effectors molecules to manipulate and   eventually   compromise host immunity. The researchers, led by Jin, found three years ago for the first time that B. cinerea can deliver small RNA effector molecules to the host cells to induce cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress host immunity. Building on that work, in the just-published study in Nature Plants, they discovered that such cross-kingdom RNAi is bidirectional, meaning small RNAs can flow from the pathogen to the host and from the host to the pathogen. Furthermore, they found that B. cinerea is capable of taking up RNA molecules from the environment, which makes it possible to use such external RNAs in fungicidal sprays to manage diseases. The researchers tested that idea and found that applying those pathogen gene-targeting RNA molecules to the surface of fruits and vegetables and flowers   they used tomato, strawberry, grape, lettuce, onion, and rose   can control gray mold diseases. The findings outlined in the Science and Nature Plants papers have significant implications for farmers looking to control fungal pathogens. Currently, fungicides and chemical spraying are still the most common disease control strategy. But, these treatments pose serious threats to human health and environments. RNA, which is present in all living organisms, doesn t present problems for human health and it naturally degrades in soil. While the research focused on the fungal pathogens B. cinerea and Verticillium dahliae, another fungal pathogen that causes wild disease on dozens of trees, shrubs, vegetables, and fields crops, the researchers believe this RNAi-based technique could be used to control multiple pathogens at the same time. While the research focused on the fungal pathogen B. cinerea, the researchers believe the technique could be used to control other fungal pathogens, such as Verticllium dahliae, which causes wild disease on dozens of trees, shrubs, vegetables, and fields crops.","Published: September 22, 2016"

In theory, the heart patches, engineered tissue composed of the several different types of cells that make up heart muscle, would be implanted to replace diseased or damaged tissue and would perform all the functions of healthy, beating heart muscle. Using stem cells to treat cardiovascular disease is a grail of regenerative medicine, explains Timothy J. Kamp, a University of Wisconsin Madison cardiologist and co-director of the UW Madison Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center. Treating diseased hearts by implanting healthy, lab-grown cells to replace damaged tissue has been an aspiration of stem cell biologists since all-purpose human stem cells were first derived and cultured at UW Madison in 1998. Working with teams from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Duke University in a newly funded $8.6 million consortium, Kamp and his colleagues will seek to devise and seed with the appropriate mix of cells three-dimensional patches that will be used in a pig model, a close approximation in an animal to the human heart. The seven-year study is being funded by the National Institutes of Health.  The excitement here is we re moving closer to patient applications,  says Kamp, a professor in the UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH).  We re at a stage when we need to see how these cells do in a large animal heart attack model. We ll be making patches of heart muscle that can be applied to these injured areas.  Other types of cells have been tried for cardiac repair with limited success, Kamp notes, but the advent of embryonic and induced stem cell technologies brings a new precision to the problem: the ability to make in the lab all of the specific cell types that make up heart muscle and that could be more personalized to individual patients. To achieve that and to begin to lay out a game plan for how the technology can ultimately be applied to human patients, there are a number of big hurdles Kamp and his collaborators will need to overcome. The first challenge is to create in the lab the primary cell types that compose heart tissue: cardiomyocytes, the cells responsible for muscle contraction; fibroblasts, the cells that provide structural framework to tissue; and endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels. Kamp s group previously has devised techniques for spinning fibroblasts in mice into progenitor master heart cells, cells capable of differentiating into all the different types of cells that make up heart muscle. Applied to human cells, the technology could provide a foundation for mass producing heart cells for clinical use in the laboratory. Another key obstacle, Kamp notes, is making cells that, when transplanted, do not prompt an immune response by a new host.  The body s immune response is a big part of this,  he says. To test immune reaction to implanted cells, Kamp and his colleague, William Burlingham, from the SMPH s Department of Surgery, will first transplant lab-made cells into mice engineered to have a human immune system. Ideally, cells can be made to at least partially match the human immune response, which might open the door to creating cells that do not need to be individually matched to a patient. Such technologies already exist for many solid organ transplants. In addition to creating the right mix of cells that aren t rejected by a host, Kamp and his colleagues must forge cells that beat in rhythm with the new host:  Another barrier we are particularly concerned about is triggering arrhythmias,  says Kamp.  Will putting these cells in create a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia? That is one of the risks that we need to overcome.  Finally, the UAB-Duke-Wisconsin group must devise a heart patch in a way that it can effectively integrate into the heart of a patient. The technology is not at all like  plugging in a USB drive,  says Kamp. Building the heart patch technology and testing it in a large animal model, Kamp says, will go a long way toward harnessing the potential of stem cells to treat heart disease, which in many respects is still unproven.  The proposed studies in animal models are essential to develop this novel therapy,  Kamp says,  but the gold standard, of course, is a human patient. ","Published: September 22, 2016"

A team of researchers at Yale found that a treatment using bioadhesive nanoparticles loaded with a potent chemotherapy drug proved more effective and less toxic than conventional treatments for gynecological cancer. The results of the work, led by professor Mark Saltzman at the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Science and professor Alessandro Santin at the Yale School of Medicine, appear Sept. 19 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The nanoparticles are loaded with a drug known as epothilone B (EB) and injected into the peritoneal space, the fluid of the abdominal cavity. EB has been used in clinical trials to target tumor cells resistant to conventional chemotherapy agents. The drug proved effective in these trials, but severe side effects caused by the drug s high toxicity prevented further use. The Yale Cancer Center researchers  treatment significantly reduces the drug s toxicity by encasing it in a nanoparticle that gradually releases the drug in high concentration at the cancer site. The problem with conventional nanoparticles, though, is that they are cleared from the target region too quickly to have much of an effect due to their small size, note the scientists.  The challenge was to find a way to use that drug, which is very effective if you can keep it in the right place for a long enough period,  said Saltzman, the Goizueta Foundation Professor of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering. To that end, the Yale team developed nanoparticles covered with aldehyde groups, which chemically adhered to mesothelial cells in the abdominal cavity when injected into the peritoneum. Tested on mice with human tumors growing in their abdominal regions, the bioadhesive nanoparticles stayed in place for at least 24 hours. Non-adhesive nanoparticles injected into control mice began to leave the abdominal cavity after five minutes. Sixty percent of the mice receiving the treatment with the bioadhesive nanoparticles survived for four months   a significant improvement over mice in the control groups, where 10% or fewer lived as long. By localizing the delivery of the drug, Santin said, they both decreased the toxicity of the drug and increased its effectiveness. This treatment could be particularly beneficial to patients with later stages of ovarian and uterine cancer, which is extremely difficult to treat due to how the cancer spreads in the peritoneal region, he said.  They ve been treated with surgery and chemotherapy and are now resistant to any standard treatment, and we ve shown that this agent can be effective,  said Santin, professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences, and research team leader of the Gynecologic Oncology Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. For future studies, Saltzman said, they may  tune  the nanoparticles  properties. For instance, they can adjust the adhesiveness of the particles, and how quickly the particles release the drugs at the target site.","Published: September 22, 2016"

Announced today, the San Francisco-based Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, an independent collaboration between the Bay Area s three premier research universities, is the first philanthropic science investment made by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is dedicated to  advancing human potential and promoting equality.   We are excited to see such a generous and timely investment in fundamental scientific work across the Bay Area,  said Jennifer Doudna, UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and chemistry, Li Ka Shing Chancellor s Chair in Biomedical and Health Sciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a member of the Biohub s Science Advisory Group.  The Biohub will allow researchers at leading institutions to collaborate and accelerate the development of breakthrough scientific and medical advancements, applications and therapeutics,  added Doudna, who is best known for her pioneering work on CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing technology that has the potential to revolutionize genetics, molecular biology and medicine. Headquartered next to UCSF s Mission Bay campus, with a satellite site at Stanford, the Biohub will provide basic researchers and clinical scientists with flexible laboratory space, the latest technological tools and funding for ambitious research projects.  In bringing together three world-class research universities in UC Berkeley, UCSF, and Stanford, the Biohub represents the type of cross-institutional collaborative environment that will be critical for addressing the most pressing life sciences challenges of our time,  said UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks.  Each of these institutions brings its own set of perspectives, questions, ideas, and expertise to this venture, and, given this unprecedented kind of exchange, I am confident that the Biohub will be the catalyst for major and even transformational research breakthroughs,  he added.  New avenues to treat and cure disease  Paul Alivisatos, vice chancellor for research at UC Berkeley and a pioneer of nanoscience, said  this forward-looking gift will empower scientists at the leading edges of their fields to work across disciplines in new ways and to be nimbler and to pursue new ideas.   The research community at UC Berkeley is thrilled to have this new opportunity to collaborate with researchers at UCSF and Stanford to expand our knowledge of human health and lay the groundwork to create new avenues to treat and cure disease,  he said. In 2015, Chan and Zuckerberg pledged in an open letter to their newborn daughter to donate 99 percent of their Facebook shares during their lives for charitable purposes.  Partnering with experts,  they wrote,  is more effective for the mission than trying to lead efforts ourselves.  They are now making good on their promise, said Robert Tjian, a UC Berkeley professor of biochemistry, biophysics and structural biology who as president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute   a post he left earlier this month   served as an adviser in the creation of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. He will be a member of the President s Advisory Board at the Biohub and will serve on the Scientific Advisory Board at the larger Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative.  It s a game changer, not only for the Bay Area and the three respective campuses, but for the life sciences in general,  Tjian said. The Biohub will immediately initiate two potentially transformative research projects to be conducted over the next five years: the Cell Atlas and the Infectious Disease Initiative. The Cell Atlas will be a map made available to researchers around the world that reveals the many different types of cells that control the body s major organs, such as the brain, heart, breast and lungs. The Cell Atlas will also depict the internal machinery of cells in unprecedented detail, allowing scientists to search for the basic breakdowns that occur within cells when disease strikes. The Infectious Disease Initiative will explore new ways to create drugs, diagnostic tests and vaccines against the many infectious diseases that still threaten much of the world, like HIV, Ebola and Zika. The initiative will include a Rapid Response Team that can immediately devote world-class scientists and advanced research technology to develop new ways to fight a sudden outbreak. The Biohub s open-access model will allow researchers at its three member universities and elsewhere to use its technology and collaborate with scientists at the Biohub, which will provide support for both established and early-career scientists. Nurturing young scientists Moreover, the Biohub will fund Chan Zuckerberg Investigators to support high-impact projects that may be too exploratory to receive government support. The competition for these slots will open to faculty at the three universities in October. Investigators are expected to be selected by an independent panel of scientists by the end of the year.  We have three great research powerhouses in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Biohub will serve as a completely new nexus of collaboration by providing exceptional resources and opportunities for UCSF, Stanford and Berkeley scientists to create highly productive partnerships,  said Biohub co-director Joseph DeRisi, professor and chair of biochemistry and biophysics at UCSF.  The Biohub will be the sinew that ties together these three institutions in the Bay Area like never before,  said Stephen Quake, Stanford professor of bioengineering and of applied physics, who will co-lead the center with DeRisi. DeRisi is renowned for his use of genomic technologies for the study of malaria and viruses, and the diagnosis of unknown infections; Quake developed a platform called microfluidics, which can sequence miniscule amounts of DNA or analyze molecules within drops of liquid, technology that has accelerated research into the genetic basis of disease.  This exciting new venture by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative brings together private philanthropy with some of the best minds in the world,  said UC President Janet Napolitano.  Collaboration in the name of science and the public good among the Bay Area s three leading research universities will surely speed the development of new treatments and cures for diseases once deemed intractable.  Advancing the Biohub s overarching projects will require technologies such as the CRISPR genome-editing technology, advanced cryo-EM, single-cell sequencing platforms as well as single-molecule imaging technologies and the computational infrastructure needed to analyze giant datasets, Tjian said. A unique collaboration  The three research universities bring great scientific strengths, cross-cutting expertise and a spirit of collaboration,  Tjian said.  For example, Berkeley has both depth and breadth in computational biology and is spearheading the application of next-generation super- resolution live-cell imaging.   There are also great people working on infectious diseases complemented by experts in cell biology to help develop the cell atlas,  he added.  These foundational discovery efforts will be critical to uncover the underlying basis of disease that will inform the development of novel diagnosis platforms and therapies.  In addition to the Biohub, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has also announced plans for a broader focus on science, its second major initiative, alongside work to improve education for all students. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative s goal is to cure, prevent or manage all diseases by the end of the century by accelerating basic science research.  The initiative seeks to support new ways of enabling scientists and engineers to work together to build new tools that will empower the whole scientific community and advance progress.","Published: September 22, 2016"

The collaboration will combine Genentech s leading cancer immunotherapy portfolio and research program with BioNTech s proprietary mRNA cancer vaccine technology platform, and personalized medicine expertise. Together, the two companies will develop individually tailored cancer immunotherapies against a broad range of cancers to potentially provide a new treatment paradigm for cancer patients. The collaboration will focus on the development of mRNA cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens, based upon BioNTech s Individualized Vaccines Against Cancer (IVAC ) MUTANOME clinical platform for the potential treatment of multiple cancers. A patient s cancer genome can be rapidly sequenced with next generation technology to define a spectrum of unique mutations known as  neoantigens  or  neoepitopes  present in a particular patient s tumor (the  mutanome ). An mRNA vaccine encoding selected neoepitopes can be manufactured for each individual tumor s mutanome signature, which may trigger an immune response highly specific to the tumor resulting in precisely targeted cancer cell death. Initial clinical development will focus on combination studies using IVAC  MUTANOME in a variety of cancer types. Under the terms of the agreement Genentech will pay BioNTech $310 million in upfront and near-term milestone payments. The two companies will equally share all development costs and any potential profits for certain programs under the agreement. BioNTech has the right to co-promote certain products that arise from the agreement in the United States and certain countries, including Germany and other major European markets. Under certain circumstances, BioNTech may have sole commercialization rights for other products that Genentech elects not to commercialize. BioNTech will manufacture mRNA cancer vaccines for clinical studies. Genentech will manufacture mRNA cancer vaccines for commercial supply and BioNTech will have the right to manufacture commercial product as part of the global supply network. Professor Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech AG commented:  We are delighted to collaborate with a leading cancer immunotherapy company such as Genentech. Supported by its extensive tumor immunology understanding, BioNTech has been building clinical experience with its proprietary mRNA vaccines in a number of cancer types over several years. Combining BioNTech s broad proprietary capabilities in the design, formulation, manufacturing and clinical testing of individualized neoantigen-based mRNA vaccines with Genentech s eminent cancer immunotherapy, diagnostic, manufacturing and commercial expertise, will allow us, on a global scale, to drive forward the development of individualized vaccines to the market to treat a broad range of cancers.  Sean Marett, COO of BioNTech added:  This alliance underpins BioNTech s strategy of collaborating with companies that are committed to developing truly disruptive immunotherapies and its long term ambitions of bringing its own products to market .

Based on this complaint, new research from the University of Warwick reveals that the way chronic pain patients think about pain and sleep leads to insomnia and poor management of pain. Researchers from the Sleep and Pain Lab in the Department of Psychology have demonstrated that conditions like back pain, fibromyalgia, and arthritis are directly linked with negative thoughts about insomnia and pain, and this can be effectively managed by cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT).

To better understand who is at risk, researchers at University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine conducted the first genome-wide association study for loneliness as a life-long trait, not a temporary state. They discovered that risk for feeling lonely is partially due to genetics, but environment plays a bigger role. The study of more than 10,000 people, published in Neuropsychopharmacology, also found that genetic risk for loneliness is associated with neuroticism and depressive symptoms. See Also: Researchers switch emotion linked to memory The research was led by Abraham Palmer, PhD, professor of psychiatry and vice chair for basic research at UCSD School of Medicine. In their paper, Palmer and team explain that just as physical pain alerts us to potential tissue damage and motivates us to take care of our physical bodies, loneliness triggered by a discrepancy between an individual's preferred and actual social relations is part of a biological warning system that has evolved to alert us of threats or damage to our social bodies. But not everyone perceives loneliness in the same way. ""For two people with the same number of close friends and family, one might see their social structure as adequate while the other doesn't,"" Palmer said. ""And that's what we mean by 'genetic predisposition to loneliness' we want to know why, genetically speaking, one person is more likely than another to feel lonely, even in the same situation."" The heritability of loneliness has been examined before, in twins and other studies of both children and adults. From these, researchers estimated that 37 to 55 percent of loneliness is determined by genetics. Previous studies also tried to pinpoint specific genes that contribute to loneliness, focusing on genes related to neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, or other cellular systems associated with human attachment, such as oxytocin. But, Palmer said, these studies mostly relied on small sample sizes. Read Next: Brain circuits involved in emotion discovered In their latest research, Palmer and team used a much larger sample size they examined genetic and health information from 10,760 people aged 50 years and older that was collected by the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal study of health, retirement and aging sponsored by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health (U.S.). As part of this study, participants answered three well-established questions that measure loneliness. The survey doesn't actually use the word ""lonely,"" as many people are reluctant to report feeling that way. Instead, the questions were: The study accounted for gender, age and marital status, as married people tend to be less lonely than unmarried people. Here's what Palmer's team found: Loneliness, the tendency to feel lonely over a lifetime, rather than just occasionally due to circumstance, is a modestly heritable trait 14 to 27 percent genetic, as compared to the previous estimates of 37 to 55 percent. This new estimate of the genetic contribution to loneliness could be lower than previous estimates because Palmer's team relied on chip heritability, a method that only captures common genetic variations and not rare genetic variation. The researchers also determined that loneliness tends to be co-inherited with neuroticism (long-term negative emotional state) and a scale of depressive symptoms. Weaker evidence suggested links between heritable loneliness and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. In contrast to previous studies, the researchers did not find loneliness to be associated with variations in specific candidate genes, such as those that encode dopamine or oxytocin. Learn More: Brain structure governing emotion is passed down from mother to daughter, says study According to Palmer, these results could differ from previous loneliness findings in part because the team exclusively surveyed older adults in the United States, whereas other research groups looked at young adults in Europe.

To focus on the book at hand, you need to ignore the surrounding chatter and clattering of cups, with your brain filtering out the irrelevant stimuli coming through your ears and ""gating"" in the relevant ones in your vision words on a page. In a new paper in the journal Nature Communications, New York University (NYU) researchers offer a new theory, based on a computational model, on how the brain separates relevant from irrelevant information in these and other circumstances. See Also: How the brain pays attention: Identifying regions of the brain dealing with object-based, spatial attention ""It is critical to our everyday life that our brain processes the most important information out of everything presented to us,"" explains Xiao-Jing Wang, Global Professor of Neural Science at NYU and NYU Shanghai and the paper's senior author. ""Within an extremely complicated neural circuit in the brain, there must be a gating mechanism to route relevant information to the right place at the right time."" The analysis focuses on inhibitory neurons the brain's traffic cops that help ensure proper neurological responses to incoming stimuli by suppressing other neurons and working to balance excitatory neurons, which aim to stimulate neuronal activity. ""Our model uses a fundamental element of the brain circuit, involving multiple types of inhibitory neurons, to achieve this goal,"" Wang adds. ""Our computational model shows that inhibitory neurons can enable a neural circuit to gate in specific pathways of information while filtering out the rest."" In their analysis, led by Guangyu Robert Yang, a doctoral candidate in Wang's lab, the researchers devised a model that maps out a more complicated role for inhibitory neurons than had previously been suggested. Of particular interest to the team was a specific subtype of inhibitory neurons that targets the excitatory neurons' dendrites components of a neuron where inputs from other neurons are located. These dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons are labeled by a biological marker called somatostatin and can be studied selectively by experimentalists. The researchers proposed that they not only control the overall inputs to a neuron, but also the inputs from individual pathways for example, the visual or auditory pathways converging onto a neuron. Learn More: Brain network that controls, redirects attention identified ""This was thought to be difficult because the connections from inhibitory neurons to excitatory neurons appeared dense and unstructured,"" observes Yang. ""Thus a surprising finding from our study is that the precision required for pathway-specific gating can be realized by inhibitory neurons."" The study's authors used computational models to show that even with the seemingly random connections, these dendrite-targeting neurons can gate individual pathways by aligning with excitatory inputs through different pathways.

They have uncovered a previously unknown mechanism in the brain that allows networks of neurons to protect against the kind of spreading secondary damage seen in cases of strokes and traumatic brain injuries. ""If this network activity could be triggered clinically as soon as possible then major brain damage could be minimised and recovery periods shortened,"" said Dr Christopher Connolly, Reader in Neurobiology in the University of Dundee's School of Medicine. See Also: Scientists catch brain damage in the act ""Although this is basic laboratory research, it does now re-open the door to the possibility of stopping ongoing brain damage. ""Slow acting neuroprotection is well known but approaches to induce protection require at least 24 hours notice to be effective. This is of no practical use in a clinical emergency situation such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury, so current treatment options are limited to aiding the recovery processes. ""We have identified that neuronal networks react to an insult by sending rapid in minutes warning signals in an attempt to protect against the toxicity that causes brain damage. If that could be recruited clinically then it would give us a tool to deploy quickly in cases where brain damage was a risk. ""Where we can't protect neurons quickly, we can recruit the help of surrounding neurons to do this for us. It is a case of `If you need a job done quickly, ask the expert' and in this instance the experts are the neurons themselves.""

Dr. Zagnoni said, ""Using microfluidic technology, we were able to produce in-vitro neuronal networks to investigate spreading toxicity in the brain, which is the cause of brain damage even after an initial trauma. ""Through this process we were able to demonstrate how the spread of this toxicity is driven. In doing that we also uncovered a previously unknown, fast acting, neuroprotective signalling mechanism.

Fr d ric Caupin is a Professor in the Liquids and Interfaces Group at the Institute of Light and Matter CNRS at Universit  Claude Bernard Lyon 1. The main motivation of his research is the study of water anomalies. Indeed, water is the most common liquid, but also the most anomalous. For instance, it expands upon cooling below 4  C. Water anomalies are due to the complex hydrogen bonded network present. These anomalies get even more pronounced in the metastable liquid, namely liquid water supercooled below 0  C, its equilibrium melting point, or when liquid water is stretched at negative pressure.  The concept of negative pressure sounds surprising. It is just a mechanical tension that is applied to the liquid which is able to resist it thanks to the attractive forces between its molecules. To generate these extreme conditions of negative pressure, Professor Caupin uses water droplets a few microns in size, trapped inside a quartz crystal. These samples have been known for a long time by geologists. He approached this work as a physicist but was to discover the relevance to the geology community and, in particular, V ronique Gardien from the Laboratoire of Geology of Lyon.  This new collaboration has led to a new tool for paleoclimate reconstruction and to understand temperature back in geological times, the science of paleothermometry. Using the study of water droplets trapped during the formation of minerals, small bubbles may be present. These give indication to the ambient temperature when they were formed. However, what happens if a bubble is not present?  The answer is provided by shining a laser on one of these small drops, and analyzing the light after its interaction with the liquid (Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy), the researchers explain how to obtain the temperature sought for without the need for a bubble.1 In their paper, proof of concept of the method is demonstrated using inclusions of water in quartz crystals, for which it is easy to make a direct comparison between the new Brillouin method and the traditional bubble-based method. The two methods are in excellent agreement. Having established this, the group are now going to apply the technique to samples relevant for paleothermometry.  The experimental work for this work was performed using a Linkam THMS600 stage. Describing the set-up, Professor Caupin says  The Linkam stage was ideal as a  turnkey  solution to apply the wide thermal cycles necessary to our study while providing easy optical access to perform the spectroscopic measurements. The sample-to-window distance of the THMS600 stage is quite large so we had to use appropriate long-working distance objectives and to fit them to our microscope set-up.

The High-Tech Health Research Expo, organized by Pennsylvania Representative Tom Marino (PA-10), gave InSphero and other life science companies the opportunity to present their technologies to Congressional leaders working to reduce the use of animal testing in the United States.   InSphero s flagship products, 3D InSight  Human Liver Microtissues and Human Islet Microtissues, are produced using cells obtained from human donor tissue, which is broken down and reassembled into 3D microtissues using InSphero 3D Select  Technology. Microtissues are delivered to researchers in a 96-well plate, one microtissue per well, allowing the simultaneous testing of multiple drugs on a standardized, human-derived tissue. Compared to the same cells grown in 2D, 3D microtissues more accurately reflect the native biology of in vivo human tissue, and can be cultured for over four weeks, enabling long-term testing of drug exposure over weeks instead of hours. Dr. Jan Lichtenberg, InSphero CEO and Co-founder, says the use of more in vivo-like, human-derived 3D model systems is already making a positive impact on drug development pipelines in the pharmaceutical industry. Lichtenberg says,  Our 3D models enable researchers to verify a drug s efficacy and predict potential toxicity and side-effects using more biologically relevant cell based assays. An additional benefit is less dependency on animal models, the use of which is not only ethically charged, but can also add significant cost, delay time to market, and often fail to accurately reflect how humans will respond to a drug.  Congressman Tom Marino, an advocate for reducing the use of animal testing for research purposes, says the event accomplished its objective of bringing together legislators and technology providers with a common aim. Marino states,  It was a pleasure to host and recognize InSphero as one of the companies who specialize in alternative, non-animal testing methods. The more stringent restrictions on animal testing imposed in Europe helped InSphero to emerge as a leader in the field of human-based tissue models. They have now established roots in the United States, and are a leading solution provider in the global cause toward developing better drugs while using fewer animals.

This vaccine aims to save many young children s lives worldwide. Rotavirus infection, associated with severe vomiting and diarrhea, is the second largest infectious cause of death in young children. According to the World Health Organization, 215,000 child deaths globally occur due to rotavirus infection. Additionally, 2 million children are hospitalized. Current marketed vaccines often demonstrate reduced efficacy in lower-income settings, have undesirable presentation characteristics and are too expensive for widespread use in developing countries, which means many millions of children remain at risk. Chris Yallop, CSO of Batavia Biosciences, explains:  To deliver a low cost manufacturing process that is suitable for developing countries, Batavia Biosciences will employ novel technologies such as fixed-bed, high cell density bioreactors. Additionally, the vaccine will be based on the RV3-BB rotavirus strain, a naturally occurring attenuated strain developed by the Murdoch Children s Research Institute that shows promising immunogenicity data in early testing.  Batavia Biosciences will develop the process in partnership with Bio Farma, a leading vaccine manufacturer who will be responsible for market authorization and commercial manufacture. Menzo Havenga, CEO of Batavia Biosciences, states:  We are proud to work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Bio Farma on bringing a safe, efficacious and affordable rotavirus vaccine to all in need as this vaccine is clearly long overdue.

The funding is used to expand the global use of Euformatics s clinical software products.  Next Generation Sequencing unlocks your genomic data, which enables personalised treatment. As the complexity is increasing, hospitals and clinical laboratories need tools to use the genomic data. We provide those tools: omnomicsQ for data quality management and the CE-marked omnomicsNGS for interpreting the results , says Jussi Volanen, CEO. Euformatics helps clinical laboratories to meet the highest quality standards in their use of genomic data. Next generation sequencing (NGS) based methods are complex: it is a challenge to produce consistently high quality results. There exists a vast number of different quality control metrics that need to be calculated, tracked and stored. Evolving standards and guidelines dictate what quality control methods are appropriate. Moreover, preparing for audits and inspections or troubleshooting sub-optimal performance and spotting outliers take up valuable laboratory time and resources. The omnomicsQ platform enables users to circumvent all these issues and additionally lets the users comply with best practice guidelines to ensure data quality compliance as defined by EuroGenTest, ACGS, CAP, etc. The omnomicsQ platform is trusted by the leading EQA providers EMQN and UK NEQAS for Molecular Genetics with whom the company has partnered.  The omnomicsQ platform ensures that genomics labs optimise their resources, generate consistent results, secure a good reputation and ultimately deliver accurate treatment for the patient. Let us take one of our customers at a Swiss University Hospital. Before omnomicsQ it took them hours to perform each coverage analysis. That task, among other quality control tasks, could be fully automated, as can almost all other tasks. These significant time savings enable them to better allocate their resources , says Christophe Roos, Chief Scientific Officer. Once the NGS data quality is secured, the next step is the annotation and interpretation of genomic variants. The CE-marked software omnomicsNGS is a software platform that provides all the relevant genomic and mutation information laboratories need based on patient data, growing local knowledge, and external information sources. Not only does it speed up genetic reporting for each patient, it also allows users to revisit old samples and to notify health service providers whenever new genetic information becomes available. The platform can be used on the cloud, as local stand-alone solution or integrated into larger IT infrastructures connected to other patient records and biobanks.","Published: September 21, 2016"

Such epigenetic marks play a central role in the regulation of the genome s expression. Led jointly by Ludwig San Diego s Bing Ren and Arne Klungland of the University of Oslo, the authors describe their application of this method to unravel a key mystery of the earliest stage of development. The new technique, named mChIP-seq, is also likely to be of notable relevance to cancer research. Very soon after fertilization, the control of embryonic development shifts from pre-existing maternal gene products to the products of genes encoded by the early embryo (or zygote). This passing of the genetic baton, called the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), is poorly understood because existing technologies have generally been too insensitive to capture the full scale of the epigenetic changes it entails across the zygotic genome. The improved sensitivity of mChIP-seq, developed jointly by Klugland, Ren and John Arne Dahl of Oslo University, led to  some remarkable discoveries that have completely changed our view of epigenetic inheritance mechanisms,  says Ren. In the current paper, Ren and his colleagues describe their use of mChIP-seq to investigate how epigenetic information is passed from one generation to the next to orchestrate the MZT. To that end, they examined in mouse embryos the global distribution of an epigenetic mark known to play a critical role in regulating the activity of genes. This mark (H3K4me3) modifies chromatin the complex of DNA and its protein packaging by adding three identical molecules known as methyl groups at a specific place on a packaging protein known as histone 3. Dahl, a visiting scholar in Ren s lab and co-first author on the Nature paper, fine-tuned the technique for mapping such epigenetic tags to where only a few hundred embryos or cells were needed for each experiment. Previous methods required up to 10,000 cells to conduct similar analyses. The other first author, Inkyung Jung, a Ludwig postdoc in Ren s lab, contributed significantly to the computational analysis of the resulting data. When the scientists compared H3K4me3 distribution in immature mouse egg cells they found something unexpected: broad but distinct domains of the immature egg cell s genome, representing some 22% of the whole, are heavily marked by H3K4me3. These domains rapidly decrease in size in 2-cell embryos and eventually shrink to about 1% to 2% of the genome.  The key lesson we learned was that the genes that are destined to be turned on specifically in the fertilized egg are covered by this unique chromatin domain structure,  says Ren. Those marks have to be removed by specialized enzymes to activate the zygotic genome.  This mark is a mechanism for the oocyte to influence which genes in the zygote are activated. It is an epigenetic mechanism for the passage of information from the maternal oocyte to the zygote.  The ability to map  epigenomes  using such a small number of cells will be valuable to cancer research, since the epigenetic landscape is dramatically rearranged in cancer and contributes to phenomena driven by small subpopulations of cells, such as drug resistance and metastasis.  With a better understanding of the epigenetic landscapes in cancers, we are going to have more tools to study the basis of tumorigenesis,  says Ren.  We still have a long way to go, but our goal is to have a thorough understanding of gene regulatory programs so we can use that knowledge to treat cancer and develop diagnostic tools.

In work funded by Cancer Research UK and EMBO, the researchers, from the University of Cambridge, found that these quadruple helix structures occur in the regions of DNA that control genes, particularly cancer genes, suggesting that they may play a role in switching genes on or off. The results, reported in the journal Nature Genetics, could also have implications for cancer diagnostics and the development of new targeted treatments.  Most of us are familiar with the double helix structure of DNA, but there is also a version of the molecule which has a quadruple helix structure. These structures are often referred to as G-quadruplexes, as they form in the regions of DNA that are rich in the building block guanine, usually abbreviated to  G . These structures were first found to exist in human cells by the same team behind the current research, but at the time it was not exactly clear where these structures were found in the genome, and what their role was, although it was suspected that they had a link with certain cancer genes.  There have been a number of different connections made between these structures and cancer, but these have been largely hypothetical,  said Professor Shankar Balasubramanian, from Cambridge s Department of Chemistry and Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, and the paper s senior author.  But what we ve found is that even in non-cancer cells, these structures seem to come and go in a way that s linked to genes being switched on or off.  Starting with a pre-cancerous human cell line, the researchers used small molecules to change the state of the cells in order to observe where the G-quadruplexes might appear. They detected approximately 10,000 G-quadruplexes, primarily in regions of DNA associated with switching genes on or off, and particularly in genes associated with cancer.   What we observed is that the presence of G-quadruplexes goes hand in hand with the output of the associated gene,  said Balasubramanian. This suggests that G-quadruplexes may play a similar role to epigenetic marks: small chemical modifications which affect how the DNA sequence is interpreted and control how certain genes are switched on or off.  The results also suggest that G-quadruplexes hold potential as a molecular target for early cancer diagnosis and treatment, in particular for so-called small molecule treatments which target cancer cells, instead of traditional treatments which hit all cells.   We ve been looking for an explanation for why it is that certain cancer cells are more sensitive to small molecules that target G-quadruplexes than non-cancer cells,  said Balasubramanian.  One simple reason could be that there are more of these G-quadruplex structures in pre-cancerous or cancer cells, so there are more targets for small molecules, and so the cancer cells tend to be more sensitive to this sort of intervention than non-cancer cells.   It all points in a certain direction, and suggests that there s a rationale for the selective targeting of cancer cells.   We found that G-quadruplexes appear in regions of the genome where proteins such as transcription factors control cell fate and function,  said Dr Robert H nsel-Hertsch, the paper s lead author.  The finding that these structures may help regulate the way that information is encoded and decoded in the genome will change the way we think this process works.  Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK s science information manager, said:  Figuring out the fundamental processes that cancer cells use to switch genes on and off could help scientists develop new treatments that work against many types of the disease. And exploiting weaknesses in cancer cells could mean this approach would cause less damage to healthy cells, reducing potential side effects. It s still early days, but promising leads like this are where the treatments of the future will come from. ","Published: September 21, 2016"

This reduces their odds of transmitting the malaria parasite, according to a University of California, Davis, study published Sept. 15 in the journal PLOS Genetics. Rates of malaria transmission depend on whether mosquitoes bite humans or animals, and whether they rest after that meal in an area where they will encounter pesticides. Bradley Main, a researcher in the Vector Genetics Lab at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, and his colleagues investigated whether there is a genetic basis to host choice and resting behavior in Anopheles arabiensis. That species of mosquito has become the primary vector of malaria in east Africa due to its broader host range and the frequent use of pesticide-treated bed nets, which kill other species that live closely with humans.  Whether there is a genetic basis to feeding preferences in mosquitoes has long been debated,  Main said.  Using a population genomics approach, we have established an association between human feeding and a specific chromosomal rearrangement in the major east African malaria vector. This work paves the way for identifying specific genes that affect this critically important trait.  Using genetics to help stop malaria s spread  Using genetics to better understand and track mosquito behavior can improve local control strategies. This knowledge may also open novel avenues for stopping malaria s spread, such as genetically modifying mosquitoes to prefer cattle over people. The researchers sequenced the genomes of 23 human-fed and 25 cattle-fed mosquitoes collected indoors and outdoors from the Kilobero Valley in Tanzania. They identified a genetic component that contributes to the mosquito s host choice but not its choice of resting place. They narrowed down the gene region associated with cattle feeding to a chromosomal rearrangement called the 3Ra inversion. The study is the first to use genomic tools to find a genetic basis for earlier observations that inversions can be linked to a preference for cattle in mosquitoes. While the findings provide strong support that the inversion in An. arabiensis is linked to cattle feeding, researchers need to test a larger geographic area to confirm the connection.","Published: September 21, 2016"

Their findings suggest that a disordered protein, called alpha-synuclein, partially escapes from the cell membrane when it runs out of space.  This study provides new insight into the complex structural physics of three-component protein interactions in biology,  said TSRI Associate Professor Ashok Deniz, who led the new study, which was designated as a  hot paper  by the journal Angewandte Chemie. A Crowded Neighborhood Cells are crowded places, and many biophysicists have studied the effects of such crowding on the structural features of biological molecules, such as proteins. These studies tend to be done in three dimensions, with proteins suspended in a dilute solution and crowded from all sides. The new research brought scientists closer to understanding how crowding on the two-dimensional surface of a cell membrane can influence protein biophysics and function.  This issue is particularly important given that interactions of some disordered proteins with membranes are critical elements of cellular function and health,  said Deniz. The team focused on alpha-synuclein because it is an important example of an  intrinsically disordered protein  (IDP), which means it has relatively little structure on its own. Like several other IDPs, it can change its shape depending on interactions with nearby partners. The flexibility of IDPs makes it hard for scientists to capture clear images of them in action. Alpha-synuclein has also been linked to Parkinson s disease, making it an interesting target for understanding the roles of IDPs in disease. In the new study, the scientists investigated how alpha-synuclein behaves when the membrane is crowded by a second protein, called Hsp27. By adding this third component to the alpha-synuclein-membrane scene, the scientists came closer to seeing what really happens in a complex cell membrane environment, where real estate is naturally limited. The researchers found a surprising change in the alpha-synuclein shape when it gets crowded by Hsp27.  The protein is staying partially bound, but our data suggest that part of it is flipping off the surface,  said Deniz. The scientists said the work combined experiments, observations and simulations, which together pointed toward an explanation of the findings in terms of relatively simple physics. Finding New Partners The scientists think the section that detaches from the surface might work as an  arm  for waving down new potential partners.  The fragment of alpha-synuclein can potentially interact with other binding partners, which could initiate further function,  said TSRI Graduate Student Mahdi Muhammad Moosa, who served as first author of the study with TSRI Research Associate Priya R. Banerjee. The scientists added that other intrinsically disordered proteins may have similar reactions to crowding on membranes by proteins other than Hsp27.  We think the basic features of this model, in principle, could be applied to any intrinsically disordered protein that is bound to the cell membrane,  said Banerjee. The researchers said the next step in this research will be to study how cell membrane composition and other modifications might alter how crowded membranes modulate the shape and cellular function of intrinsically disordered proteins.","Published: September 21, 2016"

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels at higher than normal pressures. A high force of blood flow can damage and weaken your blood vessels. Over time, hypertension can harm different organs, including the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. To learn more about how genes might affect our blood pressure, 3 international research teams that included NIH researchers analyzed hundreds of thousands of people s genomes to look for genetic variations associated with blood pressure regulation. The research was funded by NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute on Aging (NIA), and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), among many others. Results were published online on September 12, 2016 in Nature Genetics. The first study analyzed Cardio-Metabochip microarray data from 74 studies that included over 342,000 people of European ancestry. Using these data, the researchers identified 66 blood-pressure associated regions of the genome (loci), 17 of which were previously unknown. Analyses suggested that many of the newly identified loci may play a role within cells lining blood vessels in controlling blood pressure. There was no enrichment of a single predominant genetic pathway in the data, reflecting the complexity of blood pressure influences. The group found comparable results in a group of more than 64,000 people of South Asian, East Asian, and African descent. The second research group performed a genome-wide analysis of more than 327,000 people. Their meta-analysis of Human Exome BeadChip gene array (Exome Chip) data revealed 31 new blood pressure-associated loci and confirmed 39 that had been previously identified. These loci were strongly linked to genetic risk of heart disease and heart attack. A third team led by United Kingdom-based researchers used Exome Chip data to screen nearly 350,000 people. Their meta-analysis identified 30 new blood pressure-associated regions of the genome. Taken together, these 3 studies expand our understanding of the genetic components of blood pressure by doubling the number of reported blood pressure genes. They also highlight potential new targets for treating hypertension.  High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major cause of heart disease and stroke worldwide, but its underlying causes are poorly understood,  says Dr. Christopher Newton-Cheh of Massachusetts General Hospital, a senior author of the first 2 papers.  Existing therapies target only a small subset of the pathways that contribute to hypertension, so identifying additional genes that influence blood pressure can point us in new directions, giving us exciting new leads for drug development.

The laboratory-grown lung-like tissue can be used to study diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which has traditionally been difficult to study using conventional methods.  While we haven t built a fully functional lung, we ve been able to take lung cells and place them in the correct geometrical spacing and pattern to mimic a human lung,  said Dr. Brigitte Gomperts, an associate professor of pediatric hematology/oncology and the study s lead author. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by scarring of the lungs. The scarring makes the lungs thick and stiff, which over time results in progressively worsening shortness of breath and lack of oxygen to the brain and vital organs. After diagnosis, most people with the disease live about three to five years.  To study the effect of genetic mutations or drugs on lung cells, researchers have previously relied on two-dimensional cultures of the cells. But when they take cells from people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and grow them on these flat cultures, the cells appear healthy.  Scientists have really not been able to model lung scarring in a dish,  said Gomperts, who is a member of the UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center. The inability to model idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the laboratory makes it difficult to study the biology of the disease and design possible treatments. Using the new lung organoids, researchers will be able to study the biological underpinnings of lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and also test possible treatments for the diseases. To study an individual s disease, or what drugs might work best in their case, clinicians could collect cells from the person, turn them into stem cells, coax those stem cells to differentiate into lung cells, and then use those cells in 3-D cultures. Because it s so easy to create many tiny organoids at once, researchers could screen the effect of many drugs.  This is the basis for precision medicine and personalized treatments,  Gomperts said.","Published: September 21, 2016"

The researchers identified  a molecular switch that controls immune suppression, opening the possibility to further improving and refining emerging immunotherapies that boost the body s own abilities to fight diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer s and Crohn s disease. The findings are published in the September 19 online issue of Nature.  Immunotherapies, such as T cell checkpoint inhibitors, are showing great promise in early treatments and trials, but they are not universally effective,  said Judith A. Varner, PhD, professor in the Departments of Pathology and Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  We have identified a new method to boost the effectiveness of current immune therapy. Our findings also improve our understanding of key mechanisms that control cancer immune suppression and could lead to the development of more effective immunotherapies.  When confronted by pathogens, injury or disease, the initial response of the body s immune system comes in the form of macrophages, a type of white blood cell that express pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines that, in turn, activate T cells, another immune cell, to attack the health threat. The macrophages then switch gears to express other cytokines that dampen T cell activation, stimulating tissue repair.   In chronic inflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer s and Crohn s, however, macrophages associated with the malignancy continue to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and other substances that kill or transform normal cells. In cancer, highly abundant microphages express anti-inflammatory cytokines that induce immune suppression, effectively stopping the healing process.  In the Nature paper, Varner and colleagues pinpoint a key, suspected player: an enzyme in macrophages called PI-3 kinase gamma (PI3Ky). In mouse studies, they found that macrophage PI3Ky signaling promotes immune suppression by inhibiting activation of anti-tumor T cells. Blocking PI3Ky activated the immune response and significantly suppressed growth of implanted tumors in animal models. It also boosted sensitivity of some tumors to existing anti-cancer drugs and synergized with existing immune therapy to eradicate tumors. Varner and her colleagues at the Moores Cancer Center also identified a molecular signature of immune suppression and response in mice and cancer patients that may be used to track the effectiveness of immunotherapy.  Recently developed cancer immunotherapeutics, including T cell checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, have shown encouraging results in stimulating the body s own adaptive immune response,  said co-author Ezra Cohen, MD, who heads the cancer immunotherapy program at Moores Cancer Center.  But they are effective only on a subset of patients, probably because they do not alter the profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment created by tumor-associated macrophages. Our work offers a strategy to maximize patient responses to immune therapy and to eradicate tumors.   The Nature paper builds upon other work by Varner and colleagues. In a paper first published online in May in Cancer Discovery, Varner s team reported that blocking PI3Ky in tumor-associated macrophages stimulated the immune response and inhibited tumor cell invasion, metastasis and fibrotic scarring caused by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in animal models.  In humans, PDAC is the most common malignancy of the pancreas It s aggressive and difficult to treat. Though only the 12th most common type of cancer in the United States, pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death.    PDAC has one of the worst 5-year survival rates of all solid tumors, so new treatment strategies are urgently needed,  said Megan M. Kaneda, PhD, an assistant project scientist in Varner s lab and collaborator on all of the papers.  In a December 2015 paper published online in Cancer Discovery, Varner and colleagues described animal studies that revealed how disrupting cross-talk between B cells (another type of immune cell) and tumor-associated macrophages inhibited PDAC growth and improved responsiveness to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Specifically, that research team, which included scientists in San Francisco, Oregon and Switzerland, reported that inhibiting Bruton tyrosine kinase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in B cell and macrophage functions, restored T cell-dependent anti-tumor immune response. In other words, it reactivated the natural, adaptive immune response in tested mice. ","Published: September 21, 2016"

Cells create their own fat molecules to build their plasma membranes and other critical structures. Now, researchers at the Salk Institute, along with academic and industry collaborators have found a way to obstruct this instrumental process to stifle cancer s growth, detailed September 19, 2016 in Nature Medicine. Like halting the delivery of supplies to a construction site, the approach stalls the molecular building blocks cancer needs to grow.  Cancer cells rewire their metabolism to support their rapid division,  says Salk Professor Reuben Shaw, whose lab has made significant progress in establishing the ties between cancer and metabolic processes.  Because cancer cells are more reliant on lipid synthesis activity than normal cells, we thought there might be subsets of cancers sensitive to a drug that could interrupt this vital metabolic process.  Researchers had previously hypothesized that interrupting cells  lipid assembly line could disable cancer, but it was only recently that they were able to disrupt the process and test this theory. Shaw s team partnered with a Boston-based biotech, Nimbus Therapeutics, which discovers and develops small molecules in the hopes of treating a variety of diseases, who were developing a molecule to shut off a critical player in lipid synthesis, an enzyme called Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, or ACC.  This confirms that shutting down endogenous lipid synthesis could be beneficial in some cancers and that inhibitors of the ACC enzyme represent a feasible way to do it,  said Rosana Kapeller, Chief Scientific Officer at Nimbus Therapeutics and a co-author of the paper.  We ve taken a novel computational chemistry approach to designing high-potency allosteric inhibitors of this difficult enzyme, and we are very encouraged by the results.  In multiple and extensive large-scale tests in both animal models of cancer and in transplanted human lung cancer cells, the results of the novel ACC inhibitor, dubbed ND-646, were far more promising than expected: tumor mass shrank by roughly two-thirds compared to untreated animals. And when the researchers paired ND-646 with one of the common treatments for non-small lung cancer called carboplatin, the anti-tumor response was even greater: a dramatic 87 percent of tumors were suppressed, compared to 50 percent with the standard treatment of carboplatin alone. This combination of carboplatin (which damages DNA, a problem for rapidly dividing cells) and ND-646 (knocking out ACC and halting lipid synthesis) didn t seem to impair normal cells even as it dramatically slowed cancer growth.  We found surprisingly well-tolerated dosing with some of these novel ACC inhibitors that have broad bioavailability and should not be far away from what would be needed to initiate clinical trials,  says first author Robert Svensson, a Salk research associate.  This is the first time anyone has shown that this enzyme, ACC, is required for the growth of tumors and this represents compelling data validating the concept of being able to target fat synthesis as a novel anticancer approach,  adds Shaw, who is the holder of the William R. Brody Chair.  The implications are that we have a very promising drug for clinical trials for subtypes of lung cancer as well as liver and other types of cancer. This represents a new weapon in the arsenal to fight cancer. ","Published: September 21, 2016"

The study findings, published online in PLOS Biology, describe how two UT Southwestern research teams created a synthetic compound that blocks a bacterial pump used to expel antibiotics. Bacteria that use these  efflux pumps  and that are treated with the new compound become sensitive to antibiotics they were previously resistant to. The findings  potentially have huge implications for clinical infectious diseases,  said Dr. Trish Perl,  Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Professor of Internal Medicine, and holder of the Jay P. Sanford Professorship in Infectious Diseases at UT Southwestern.  In an era when antibiotic choices are increasingly limited because of resistance, and few new agents are being developed, this becomes a novel and exciting tool that needs to be explored.  The UTSW experiment focused on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacterial pathogens with genetically similar efflux pump complexes. E. coli belongs to a large family of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, which plays a major role in human disease and is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. This is the first time researchers have tailored one of these synthetic compounds, part of a class called PPMOs or peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, to target a specific efflux pump found in bacterial cell walls, said Dr. David Greenberg, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Microbiology at UT Southwestern and a senior author of the study. The PPMO compound itself doesn t kill the bacteria, he explained, but keeps it from expelling an antibiotic, allowing the drug to do its job.  This is just a different strategy,  Dr. Greenberg said.  There is a lot of interest in trying to develop new antibiotics, or antibiotics that act in new ways. The other way of thinking about this challenge is to try to make a resistant organism sensitive.  Despite the availability of many excellent antibiotics, bacteria are developing resistance to those most commonly used, forcing physicians to give higher doses or fall back to  last line of defense  drugs, said co-senior author Dr. Erdal Toprak, Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and in the Cecil H. and Ida Green Comprehensive Center for Molecular, Computational, and Systems Biology and a Southwestern Medical Foundation Scholar in Biomedical Research at UT Southwestern. To attack this problem, two UTSW labs with different focuses came together to seek a solution. Dr. Greenberg had been trying to create new antibiotics using PPMOs   also called anti-sense molecules because they can mimic DNA or RNA and bind to mRNA s genetic sequence like the other half of a zipper, blocking the bacterial machinery for building proteins. Meanwhile, Dr. Toprak s lab was using a device he had developed to study how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. About a year ago, his research team identified a mutation in E. coli that increased drug sensitivity by blocking an efflux pump complex called AcrAB-TolC. The two scientists and their labs then joined forces to create a PPMO that could target this important E. coli complex. In the study, they reported that a PPMO designed to prevent creation of the AcrA protein significantly increased the efficacy of antibiotics against E. coli in cell models   from two- to 40-fold.  In fact, Dr. Toprak said, some antibiotics that are never used against E. coli because they were thought to be ineffective killed the bacteria, when used in conjunction with the AcrA-PPMO. The AcrA-PPMO also was effective against the human pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, since those bacteria contain the same efflux pump with a matching gene sequence, Dr. Greenberg said. The next step will be to study the effect of the AcrA-PPMO in animal models. The researchers also will study whether a PPMO could be effective against other extremely antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, he said. Co-lead authors of the study were Dilay Hazal Ayhan, a visiting researcher, and Yusuf Talha Tamer, a graduate student, both in the Toprak lab. Also contributing was Dr. Seth Daly, a postdoctoral researcher in Internal Medicine. This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas Endowed Scholars Program. Other contributing authors included two employees of Sarepta Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company that holds numerous patents on the methods of synthesis and use of PPMOs. Dr. Greenberg receives research support from Sarepta, holds numerous patents related to PPMOs, and receives royalties through a licensing agreement from these inventions.","Published: September 21, 2016"

Now, a new gene therapy technique being developed by researchers at MIT is showing promise as a way to prevent breast cancer tumors from metastasizing. The treatment, described in a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, uses microRNAs   small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression   to control metastasis. The therapy could be used alongside chemotherapy to treat early-stage breast cancer tumors before they spread, according to Natalie Artzi, a principal research scientist at MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women s Hospital, who led the research in collaboration with Noam Shomron, an assistant professor on the faculty of medicine at Tel-Aviv University in Israel.  The idea is that if the cancer is diagnosed early enough, then in addition to treating the primary tumor [with chemotherapy], one could also treat with specific microRNAs, in order to prevent the spread of cancer cells that cause metastasis,  Artzi says. The regulation of gene expression by microRNAs is known to be important in preventing the spread of cancer cells. Recent studies by the Shomron team in Tel-Aviv have shown that disruption of this regulation, for example by genetic variants known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can have a significant impact on gene expression levels and lead to an increase in the risk of cancer. To identify the specific microRNAs that play a role in breast cancer progression and could therefore potentially be used to suppress metastasis, the research teams first carried out an extensive bioinformatics analysis. They compared three datasets: one for known SNPs; a second for sites at which microRNAs bind to the genome; and a third for breast cancer-related genes known to be associated with the movement of cells. This analysis revealed a variant, or SNP, known as rs1071738, which influences metastasis. They found that this SNP disrupts binding of two microRNAs, miR-96 and miR-182. This disruption in turn prevents the two microRNAs from controlling the expression of a protein called Palladin. Previous research has shown that Palladin plays a key role in the migration of breast cancer cells, and their subsequent invasion of otherwise healthy organs. When the researchers carried out in vitro experiments in cells, they found that applying miR-96 and miR-182 decreased the expression of Palladin levels, in turn reducing the ability of breast cancer cells to migrate and invade other tissue.  Previous research had discussed the role of Palladin in controlling migration and invasion (of cancer cells), but no one had tried to use microRNAs to silence those specific targets and prevent metastasis,  Artzi says.  In this way we were able to pinpoint the critical role of these microRNAs in stopping the spread of breast cancer.  The researchers then developed a method to deliver engineered microRNAs to breast cancer tumors. They embedded nanoparticles containing the microRNAs into a hydrogel scaffold, which they then implanted into mice. They found that this allowed efficient and precise delivery of the microRNAs to a target breast cancer tumor site. The treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in breast cancer metastasis, says Artzi.  We can locally change the cells in order to prevent metastasis from occurring,  she says. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment even further, the researchers then added the chemotherapy drug cisplatin to the nanoparticles. This led to a significant reduction in both the growth of the primary tumor, and its metastasis.  We believe local delivery is much more effective (than systemic treatment), because it gives us a much higher effective dose of the cargo, in this case the two microRNAs and the cisplatin,  she says.  The research offers the potential for combined experimental therapeutics with traditional chemotherapy in cancer metastasis,  says Julie Teruya-Feldstein, a professor of pathology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who was not involved in the study. The research team, which also includes MIT post doc Joao Conde and graduate student Nuria Oliva, both from IMES; graduate student Avital Gilam and postdoc Daphna Weissglas-Volkov, from Tel-Aviv University; and Eitan Friedman, an oncogeneticist from Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel, now hopes to move on to larger animal studies of the treatment.  We are very excited about the results so far, and the efficacy seems to be really good. So the next step will be to move on to larger models and then to clinical trials, although there is still a long way to go,  Artzi says.","Published: September 21, 2016"

The process allows small, synthetic molecules to exhibit the functionaldiversity of much larger enzymatic catalysts, and offers a promising new toolfor synthesizing therapeutics based on natural products. The findings appear inthe journal ACS Central Science.  In a sense, this is a miniaturization exercise,  said principalinvestigator Scott Miller, the Ir n e du Pont Professor of Chemistry at Yale. This is fundamental work in which we re trying to control the way we makechemical bonds.  A host of natural products exist that have beneficial properties for newdrugs   yet many of them also have negative side effects. One of the challengesfor researchers is to guide the action of catalysts in a way that alters themolecular structure of a target, like a natural product, to eliminate toxiceffects while retaining beneficial properties. Miller s lab has been able to tune the bond-forming functions inpeptide-based catalysts, which are similar to nature s enzymes in that they arecomposed of amino acids, but are orders of magnitude simpler in terms of theirmolecular size. The researchers did this by changing the framework   orscaffolding   of the small, synthetic molecules. The new molecules are able toperform fundamentally different tasks, despite common catalytic fragments. We ve created scaffolding that tailors a critical part of the catalyst, Miller said.  We now hope to apply these ideas to modify the structures ofbiologically active products. It creates opportunities for doing quite complexsynthesis. ","Published: September 21, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/bacteria-use-ranking-strategy-to-fight-off-viruses-187695,Bacteria Use Ranking Strategy to Fight Off Viruses Researchers have explained why microbes store virus confrontation information sequentially  with most recent attacks first  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Like humans, bacteria come under attack from viruses and rely on an immune system to defend them. A bacterial immune system known as CRISPR helps microbes  remember  the viruses they encounter and more easily defend against them in the future. Since researchers first discovered CRISPR in the mid-2000s, they have noticed something peculiar: It records confrontations with viruses sequentially, placing the most recent attack first in a series of genetically encoded memories. Now, two researchers at The Rockefeller University have explained why microbes store their immunological memories in this particular way. Their results were described September 8 in Molecular Cell.  Until now, no one knew if this organizational feature serves a purpose, let alone what that might be,  says senior author Luciano Marraffini, an associate professor and head of the Laboratory of Bacteriology.  We found an answer: It allows the microbe to mount the strongest immune response against its most recent threat, which is likely to be the most potent one around.  Microbial CRISPR systems remember viruses by capturing genetic snippets from them and storing them like beads on a string. (CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.) Should the cell meet a particular virus again, CRISPR-associated (Cas) enzymes use these snippets, known as spacers, to recognize and cut the virus. Thanks to this precision, one such system, CRISPR-Cas9, has become a powerful tool for editing genomes. Researchers have wondered for some time why CRISPR systems create a chronological record of encounters with bacteria-attacking viruses known as phage. Marraffini and first author Jon McGinn, a graduate student in the lab, determined that a small piece of the bacterial genome, which they called the leader anchoring sequence, is responsible for directing the most recent viral snippet to the first position within CRISPR. When this sequence was altered, CRISPR stopped adding new spacers to the front and began inserting them further downstream. They found the bacteria with the misplaced spacers could still defend themselves against a low concentration of phage, but that the bugs were much more vulnerable at a high level of phage.  An individual bacterium acquires a new spacer right when other infected cells in its surroundings are dying and releasing astronomical levels of new viral particles,  McGinn says.  We think this system ensures the cell can protect itself when the colony it lives in is inundated by phage.  While this study helps scientists understand how CRISPR systems function within their native bacteria, it may also have implications for a new type of CRISPR-based biotechnology, one that is so far still the stuff of science fiction.  Synthetic biologists have ambitions of creating biological recording devices that could store information using living cells. Technology like this could, for example, record a cell s exposure to environmental stimuli or even the activity of brain cells  Marraffini says.  By acquiring sequential genetic memories of viral attacks, CRISPR already accomplishes a version of this, and our work helps to explain how this potential template works.

Agricultural crops, grasses and garden plants alike can get sick and die when factors such as drought and excess sun force them to work harder to survive. Now, plants can better tolerate drought and other stressors with the help of natural microbes, University of Washington research has found. Specifically, plants that are given a dose of microbes stay green longer and are able to withstand drought conditions by growing more leaves and roots and using less water.  Plants are less stressed if they have these natural microbes,  said senior author Sharon Doty, a UW professor of environmental and forest sciences.  They will help plants deal with environmental challenges, especially with climate change.  The findings were published online in the journal Current Plant Biology. Microbes and their benefits to plants is a burgeoning field, and Doty s lab in the last 15 years has explored many different aspects of this mutual symbiosis. Earlier this year, her team demonstrated that microbes in plants help them grow in otherwise inhospitable environments   essentially serving as a natural fertilizer. Naturally providing nutrients and boosting drought resistance could make it easier and more environmentally friendly to grow grain and vegetable crops, fruit and nut trees, and even keep golf courses looking lush and green without using excess amounts of water and chemical fertilizer.  The more I learn, the more I do research in this field, the more exciting it gets, especially in the applied aspects,  said lead author Zareen Khan, a UW research scientist in environmental and forest sciences.  I think this knowledge can be used to develop strategies to face the challenges of climate change.  In this study, the researchers looked at the ability of young poplar trees to tolerate drought conditions over a month-long period, with and without the help of added microbes, called endophytes, bacteria that live inside a plant without causing disease. Researchers inoculated the young poplar cuttings with a cocktail of microbes isolated from wild poplar and willow trees growing in unfavorable conditions. They poured the mixture at the base of the stems of 10 poplars, while the other 10 cuttings did not receive any microbes. After a short growth period in a greenhouse, all 20 plants were subjected to drought conditions for a month. It s important to note that all of the poplars had microbes inside   they are naturally present in every living thing. But when the researchers added microbes from wild poplar and willow, they noticed a benefit to the plants. Specifically, the poplars that were given the probiotics doubled their root biomass and experienced nearly 30 percent more leaf and stem growth than poplars without the added microbes. When exposed to drought conditions, the poplars with microbes also stayed green with robust leaves and stems, while their counterparts browned and wilted.  Plants are overall greener and healthier if they have these microbes,  Doty said. The researchers chose poplar trees to demonstrate this beneficial relationship because the fast-growing trees are important for biofuels, or plant-based renewable energy.  One of the limitations of biofuel is large-scale production,  Khan said.  If we can reduce water usage on poplar-tree plantations by adding naturally occurring endophytes, then that could provide huge economic and environmental benefits.  Microbes also help crop plants such as tomatoes, corn and peppers be more tolerant of drought. The researchers are collaborating with an engineering company, Intrinsyx Technologies, to show this same beneficial relationship between microbes and agricultural plants, with crops given the beneficial microbes yielding more vegetables and responding better in dry, hot weather.  Having microbes that can help plants establish early, grow fast and protect them from some of the stresses in their environment, especially drought, is a big deal,  said John Freeman, chief science officer at Intrinsyx who works with Doty s team at the UW.  Using these endophytes in agricultural settings holds a lot of promise for growers and farmers.  The researchers suspect a number of factors are at work. Microbes enable plants to accumulate more nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The microbes also help plants use water more efficiently, and even produce molecules that promote plant growth and help them stay green. Gaining more root, stem and leaf mass also makes plants able to store more water.  Endophytes are helping plants make more roots, so they have more surface area to hang onto water and survive the stress of drought longer,  Khan said. Next steps include better understanding exactly how microbes bolster plants, and finding the best strains to help different plants deal with various stresses.  Finding the most beneficial ones for the job is the key in using this technology,  Khan said.","Published: September 21, 2016"

The development of novel pain medicines, such as fasinumab, can be one important step in combating the growing opioid epidemic,  said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron and President, Regeneron Laboratories.  Fasinumab represents the culmination of more than 25 years of Regeneron scientific work in neurotrophic factors. We look forward to working with Teva, a leading global pharmaceutical company with an expertise in pain therapeutics, to advance this program for patients in need.   Fasinumab has shown proof of concept in early clinical trials, and represents an exciting, novel target for pain relief. Adding the promise of fasinumab to our developing pipeline of pain products also provides a strong, strategic cornerstone to our pain franchise at Teva. It has the potential to provide a treatment option without the concerns of abuse, addiction and misuse of opioids. In the United States alone, it is estimated that 30 million people suffer pain from osteoarthritis and the same number with chronic low back pain,  said Michael Hayden, President of Teva Global R&D and Chief Scientific Officer.  Fasinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets NGF, a protein that plays a central role in the regulation of pain signaling.

UT Southwestern Medical Center cancer researchers studying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a group of triple negative breast cancer patients found that 13 percent of participants were unaware of ancestry that could influence their risk of cancer.  We found 12 differences among 92 patients, a significant amount,  said lead author Dr. Roshni Rao, Director of the George N. Peters, M.D. Center for Breast Surgery at UT Southwestern.  Some patients who self-identified as Hispanic had African-American ancestry. One Hispanic woman was found to be Ashkenazi Jewish. Both African Americans and some Ashkenazi Jewish populations have a higher risk for triple negative breast cancer,  said Dr. Rao, Associate Professor of Surgery and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Triple negative breast cancer is characterized by tumors that do not express receptors for estrogen, progesterone, or Her2-Neu, and accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases. This form of the disease is known to be particularly aggressive, and challenging to treat. Patients with triple negative breast cancer have a higher incidence of metastatic disease   cancer spreading to other parts of the body   and an overall higher rate of death from breast cancer, compared to patients with other types of breast cancer.  This study is the first to perform mtDNA testing for self-described African-Americans, Caucasians and Hispanics with triple negative breast cancer and to identify unexpected mtDNA patterns,  said senior author Dr. Barbara Haley, Professor of Internal Medicine, who holds the Charles Cameron Sprague, M.D. Chair in Clinical Oncology.  It is estimated that 10 to 30 percent of Americans may not be aware of their mixed ancestry. This type of assessment has the potential to be informative for other cancers where we see ethnic differences in frequency without understanding the cause.  Patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer tend to be younger and are more likely to be African-American or Hispanic. These patients may be less likely to be identified through traditional mammography screenings, which tend to target women 50 and older.  If you know your ancestry, then you could be included in the group that gets screened at a younger age,  Dr. Rao said. The researchers asked each volunteer   31 African-Americans, 31 Caucasians, and 30 Hispanics who are triple negative breast cancer patients   to come in for a simple test, which collects cells from inside the cheek on a swab. Mitochondrial DNA was then isolated from these samples for comparison. Mitochondrial DNA differs from nuclear DNA because it is maternally inherited so it does not change or mix. Researchers can trace the lineage of mtDNA through multiple generations. Among 30 Hispanic patients in this study, 22 did not have a family history of breast cancer whereas eight did. These results suggest that further genetic testing can potentially become an important step in identifying those at risk. Additionally, those of Nigerian, Cameroon, and Sierre Leone ancestry were most strongly associated with triple negative breast cancer, an unexpected finding of this study. This association could indicate that ancestry from specific African countries may predispose an increased risk in the rate of triple negative breast cancer, which does not respond to standard breast cancer therapies, such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or trastuzumab. The study, which appears in the journal Cancer, was supported by Young Texans Against Cancer and the David M. Crowley Foundation. Additional UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study include: Dr. Aeisha Rivers, Assistant Professor of Surgery; Dr. Assal Rahimi, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology; Dr. Rachel Wooldridge, Assistant Professor of Surgery; Dr. Madhu Rao, Research Associate; and Dr. Ann Marilyn Leitch, Professor of Surgery, who holds the S.T.

The Phase 2a study, named the COMBAT study, is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of BL-8040 and KEYTRUDA in up to 30 subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study is designed to evaluate the clinical response, safety and tolerability of the combination of these therapies as well as multiple pharmacodynamic parameters, including the ability to improve infiltration of T cells into the tumor and their reactivity. The study will be conducted in the US, Israel and additional territories. In January 2016, BioLineRx entered into an immunotherapy collaboration with MSD, known as Merck in the US and Canada, to support a Phase 2a study investigating BioLineRx s BL-8040 in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. BL-8040, BioLineRx s lead oncology platform, is a CXCR4 antagonist that has been shown in several clinical trials to be a robust mobilizer of immune cells and to be effective at inducing direct tumor cell death. Additional findings in the field of immuno-oncology suggest that CXCR4 antagonists may be effective in inducing the infiltration of anti-tumor T cells into the tumor. Therefore, when combined with KEYTRUDA, which blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells, BL-8040 has the potential to enable activated T cells to better reach tumor cells in the fight against pancreatic cancer. Philip Serlin, Chief Financial and Operating Officer of BioLineRx, stated, ""We are looking forward to conducting this combination study of our lead oncology product and MSD s immune checkpoint inhibitor, which will be the first study of BL-8040 in the exciting and promising field of cancer immunotherapy. We believe that the combination of BL-8040 with KEYTRUDA has the potential to expand the benefit of immunotherapy to cancer types currently resistant to immuno-oncology treatments, such as pancreatic cancer, which represent a significant unmet medical need.  ""Furthermore, we view BL-8040 s inhibition of CXCR4, which effects a change in the protective tumor micro-environment, as potentially synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors in additional oncological indications.

In the research, which is the largest analysis of evidence on the effect of feeding allergenic foods to babies, scientists from Imperial College London analysed data from 146 studies. In total the studies involved more than 200,000 children. The study, which was commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency, also found feeding children peanut, between the ages of four and eleven months, may reduce risk of developing peanut allergy. In addition, the team analysed milk, fish (including shellfish), tree nuts (such as almonds) and wheat, but didn't find enough evidence to show introducing these foods at a young age reduces allergy risk. The research is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Although previous studies have found feeding children peanut and egg may reduce allergy risk, other studies have found no effect. Dr Robert Boyle, lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said: ""This new analysis pools all existing data, and suggests introducing egg and peanut at an early age may prevent the development of egg and peanut allergy, the two most common childhood food allergies. ""Until now we have not been advising parents to give these foods to young babies, and have even advised parents to delay giving allergenic foods such as egg, peanut, fish and wheat to their infant."" Allergies to foods, such as nuts, egg, milk or wheat, affect around one in 20 children in the UK. They are caused by the immune system malfunctioning and over-reacting to these harmless foods. This triggers symptoms such as rashes, swelling, vomiting and wheezing. ""The number of children diagnosed with food allergies is thought to be on the rise"", added Dr Vanessa Garcia-Larsen, a co-author on the study from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial. ""There are indications that food allergies in children have become much more common over the last 30 years. The number of patients coming into our clinics has increased year-on-year, and allergy clinics across the country have seen the same pattern."" She added that the reasons behind this rise are still unclear - doctors may be better at recognising food allergy, or there may be environmental factors involved. In the new study, called a meta-analysis, the team initially analysed 16,289 research papers on allergies and other immune system problems. Out of these, 146 were used for data analysis of when to feed babies allergenic foods such as egg, peanut, wheat and fish. The results showed that children who started eating egg between the ages of four and six months had a 40 per cent reduced risk of egg allergy compared to children who tried egg later in life. Children who ate peanut between the ages of four and eleven months had a 70 per cent reduced peanut allergy risk compared to children who ate the food at a later stage. However, the authors cautioned that these percentages are estimates based on a small number of studies. Five studies (involving 1915 children) were used to estimate reduced risk of egg allergy, and two studies (involving 1550 children) were used to estimate reduced risk of peanut allergy. Therefore these figures may change when more studies are completed. The team also calculated absolute risk reduction. They found that in a population where 5.4 per cent of people have egg allergy (the UK prevalence rate from one recent study), introducing egg between four and six months of age could prevent 24 cases of egg allergy per 1,000 people. For peanut, in a population where 2.5 per cent of people have peanut allergy, introducing the food between four and eleven months could prevent 18 cases per 1,000 people. The authors cautioned that the analysis didn't assess safety, or how many of the babies suffered allergic reactions from the early introduction. Dr Boyle cautioned against introducing egg and peanut to a baby who already has a food allergy, or has another allergic condition such as eczema. ""If your child falls into these categories, talk to your GP before introducing these foods."" He also noted that whole nuts should not be given to babies or toddlers due to the choking hazard. ""Whole nuts should be avoided in young children - if you decide to feed peanut to your baby, give it as smooth peanut butter."" The team also analysed whether introducing peanut, egg, milk, fish or wheat early into a baby's diet affected their risk of autoimmune diseases such as coeliac disease. The team found no effect on risk. Commenting on the findings, the UK Food Standards Agency said: ""Imperial College London has produced a high quality review. The Government is considering these important findings as part of its review of complementary feeding for infants to ensure its advice reflects the best available evidence. Families should continue to follow the Government's current long-standing advice to exclusively breastfeed for around the first six months of age because of the health benefits to mothers and babies."" The study was funded by the UK Food Standards Agency who commission research to understand the causes and mechanisms of food allergy and intolerance.

These results, which may have implications for clinicians and their patients, employers and public policy, were presented at the29th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) Congress in Vienna (Sept, 17-20, 2016). Up to a third of patients who receive drug treat for depression do not respond to treatment. Knowing which groups don't respond could help clinicians understand which treatments are appropriate to which person. In the case of workers, it may also enable employers to take steps to ease stressful conditions. Although there is a wealth of research showing that low social and economic status is associated with a greater risk of depression, there has been little work focusing on how occupational levels respond to treatment. See Also: Link found between depression and abnormal brain response to visceral pain in patients with IBS A group of international researchers from Belgium, Italy, Israel and Austria enlisted 654 working adults attending clinics for depression, and classified their work according to occupational level. 336 (51.4%) held high occupational level jobs, 161 (24.6%) middle-level, and 157 (24%) low level. Around two-thirds of the patients were female (65.6%), which reflects the normal gender difference in reported depression. Most patients were treated with SRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), although other pharmaceutical agents were also used, as well as psychotherapy. Those in the higher levels were found to have received fewer SRIs and more psychotherapy. On analyzing results after treatment, they found that 55.9% in the highest occupational group were resistant to treatment. In contrast, only 40.2% of the middle-level workers remained treatment resistant, and 44.3 of the low-level workers. This difference was also reflected in the degree of remission, with only around one in 6 in remission in the higher status group, as against around one in 4 for the other groups. Commenting, Professor Siegfried Kasper (Vienna, Austria) said ""Though these findings should be considered preliminarily, they indicate that high occupational levels may be a risk factor for poor response to treatment. A number of variables may explain these findings. For example, there may be specific working environment demands and stressors; people may find it difficult to accept or cope with illness, or to continue with medication; or there may be other factors, related for example to cognitive, personality and behavioral differences."" Co-worker Professor Joseph Zohar (ECNP Past-President, Tel-Hashomer, Israel) said; ""This shows that the need for precise prescribing is not only related to the symptoms and genetics but also to occupational level; one might need to prescribe different medication for the same disorder and need to take into account the occupational level in order to reach optimum effect."" Learn More: Two-drug combo helps older adults with hard-to-treat depression Professor Eduard Vieta (ECNP Executive Committee member and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona), commented: ""The results of this study might sound counterintuitive, but people with highly demanding jobs are subject to a lot of stress, and when they breakdown with depression it may be particularly difficult to cope with their previous life. An alternative explanation, which cannot be ruled out given the naturalistic design of the study, is that high-status job patients may be more prone to request psychosocial treatments without the support of pharmacotherapy. The ideal treatment of depression is, in general, the combination of both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy."" A paper based on this work is published in European Neuropsychopharmacology.

In most cases, those symptoms eventually dissipate, but about 15% of young people who get concussions struggle with persistent symptoms despite seeing doctors and receiving medical care. The ongoing symptoms interfere with school, social life and physical activity. See Also: Athletes may have white matter brain changes 6 months after a concussionResearchers at Seattle Children's Research Institute published a study in the journal Pediatrics showing a new intervention for adolescents with persistent post-concussive symptoms that improved health and wellness outcomes significantly. The approach combines cognitive behavioral therapy and coordinated care among providers, schools, patients and families. ""We were pleased to find that using an approach that adds a psychological care component to treating concussions and providing coordination of care in areas of the patient's life significantly improved outcomes,"" said Dr. Cari McCarty, a psychologist and researcher at Seattle Children's Research Institute who led the study. ""This new approach aims to improve the quality of life for patients who were otherwise left to deal with unrelenting concussion symptoms."" Carmen Einmo, 16, loves to ride horses. In November 2014, she fell off her horse and broke her arm. At first, she didn't complain of typical concussion symptoms, but after a few weeks it became clear something was amiss. ""I developed really bad headaches and became very sensitive to light,"" Carmen said. ""I started having memory issues and would forget words in the middle of a conversation."" As her symptoms persisted over a couple months, Carmen's doctor at Seattle Children's, Dr. Elaine Tsao, suggested she sign up for McCarty's study. The family was excited to have found another treatment option to pursue. Don't Miss: Does concussion impact men and women differently? ""A lot of Carmen's schoolwork had to be done on an iPad, and spending long amounts of time on it hurt her eyes and head,"" said Diana Einmo, Carmen's mom. ""Some of the teachers didn't understand that Carmen couldn't spend a lot of time on an iPad, and they didn't know what to make of how long her symptoms had been going on."" Carmen's grades had started to slip and she worried about how the persistent symptoms got in the way of schoolwork. ""I entered my second year of high school ready to start off strong, but the concussion set me back,"" she said. ""My PE class was especially challenging because I couldn't run, so I would walk, and I got penalized for it in my grade."" As a participant in the study, Carmen got support from a research team member that created a coordinated care plan for her. The researcher worked with the school and family on a plan that would allow Carmen to continue school with accommodations as she recovered. The plan included a homework priority list, allowing her more time to finish work and access to another room if she became tired from light and sound in class. In addition, Carmen received cognitive behavioral therapy that involved her parents and sister.

Only 13% of patients who received the coordinated care and psychological intervention in the study reported high levels of post-concussive symptoms after six months, compared to 42% of patients who received standard concussion care. In addition, 78% of patients who received the specialized care reported reduction in depression symptoms, compared to just 46% of patients who received standard care. Carmen is feeling more like herself now and has been cleared to ride horses again. She and her mom say one of the most important things they learned during this experience was to take concussions seriously, especially because the effects and symptoms might not be apparent right away. ""It's especially challenging when a teenager gets a concussion because it's hard to tell if a change in behavior is because of a concussion, or because a teenager is going through a growth and development phase,"" Einmo said. ""We found the therapy to be especially helpful in figuring some of this out."" Carmen adds that having a plan and realistic expectations with school helped immensely.

But what causes mass panic and where are the danger zones? Researchers from the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Human Development, Disney Research Zurich, ETH Zurich, and Rutgers University have examined these questions in a virtual environment. Their results are published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Read Next: Serotonin-deficient brains are more vulnerable to social stress Why are emergency situations such as evacuations of buildings so often characterized by mass herding and overcrowding? And which areas of a building are particularly dangerous in emergency evacuations? Because these questions are difficult to study in the real world, the international research team exposed 36 participants to an emergency in a three-dimensional virtual environment. Each participant simultaneously navigated an avatar through virtual space on a computer screen. The researchers studied the participants' behaviors in several experiments, setting them various tasks under high-stress conditions. The researchers were able to show that participants' behavior in the virtual environment was largely consistent with real-world behaviors. For example, participants were asked to move their avatar through a narrow corridor without bumping into any of the other avatars. The avoidance behaviors seen in the virtual environment were consistent with those observed in a real-life experiment: 95% of participants chose to pass each other on the right-hand side. Previous studies have shown that Europeans tend to intuitively walk on the right-hand side. ""Our experiments have shown that virtual environments can help us investigate human behavior in emergency situations -- something that isn't possible in the real world for ethical and safety reasons,"" says Mehdi Moussa d, researcher in the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. To find out how the participants reacted in an emergency situation, the researchers simulated an evacuation from a complex building with four exits, only one of which was usable. Although most of the group did not know which was the correct exit, some participants were directed to it by an arrow at the top of their computer screen. Participants knew that some group members were aware of the correct exit, but they did not know who those people were. In addition, the researchers increased the stress level by putting participants under time pressure and monetary pressure: Participants had to escape the building within 50 seconds to avoid a substantial loss of points. At the end of the session, the points won were converted into monetary bonuses. Further stress-inducing elements were poor lighting, red blinking lights, and fires at the blocked exits. The experiments showed that collisions and pushing increased quickly under stress. The most dangerous zones were places where decisions had to be made, areas where bottlenecks occurred and caused congestion, and dead ends where participants were forced to turn around and walk back against the flow of the crowd. Learn More: Children react physically to stress from their social networks The researchers also looked at group dynamics during the stressful evacuation situation. Their analyses revealed that individuals were exposed to much stronger social signals under high stress and high density levels than in less stressful situations. In other words, they were more aware of where the group was going, what it was doing, and how it was feeling, and were thus more strongly influenced by the group. The study's findings indicate that individuals are more likely to follow a group under the influence of these strong social signals. This can quickly lead to mass herding and dangerous overcrowding. ""Our findings show that human behavior in virtual environments is consistent with the behaviors seen in real life. Immersive virtual environments are thus promising tools for behavioral research and beyond. For example, urban planners and architects could use them to test evacuation plans,"" says Mehdi Moussa d.

The paper, an extensive review of current research, offers a much deeper understanding of why nicotine withdrawal symptoms for people with depression make it much more difficult to quit smoking. The paper is published in the journal Addiction. See Also: Smoking thins vital part of brain ""We've used this new theory of withdrawal in depressed smokers to develop the first targeted approach for smoking cessation in this underserved population,"" said senior author Brian Hitsman, associate professor of preventive medicine and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Depressed smokers experience adverse withdrawal states that contribute to resumption of smoking, including low mood, difficulty engaging in rewarding activities and impaired thinking/memory, the paper reports. These symptoms are more severe for people with depression than for those without depression. In addition, depressed smokers tend to have fewer ways to cope with the symptoms and the nicotine in cigarettes helps to mitigate these problems, which is why depressed people tend to relapse at higher rates. ""Many smokers learn, 'If I smoke in this situation, my mood gets better.' But while smoking improves mood in the short term, it produces a long-term decline in mood,"" said lead author Amanda Mathew, research assistant professor in preventive medicine at Feinberg and a licensed clinical psychologist. ""On the other hand, successfully quitting smoking is associated with improvements in mental health."" Read Next: Brains of smokers who quit successfully might be wired for success The review found that depressed smokers' first adverse state while trying to quit is a combination of ""low positive affect"" (low pleasure and engagement in rewarding activities, such as socializing or physical activity) and ""high negative affect"" (feelings of anger, sadness, guilt or anxiety). The second adverse state is ""cognitive impairment"" (difficulty making decisions, focusing and memory). The study's researchers have begun testing a treatment that targets the specific challenges depressed smokers face when they're quitting. People who have clinical depression have typically been excluded from smoking cessation clinical trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration- (FDA-) approved medication Chantix is coupled with a type of behavior therapy called ""behavioral activation"" to treat the depressed smokers. Researchers are investigating whether Chantix reverses thinking and memory problems that depressed smokers experience during withdrawal, and whether the behavioral activation improves smokers' moods so they engage in normal pleasurable activities, and thus have less desire to smoke and are able to resist relapsing. Behavioral activation is an effective treatment for depression, but this is the first time it is being used as a treatment for smoking cessation among depressed smokers.

This finding by Whitehead Institute scientists challenges current understandings of gene regulation via DNA methylation, from development through adulthood. ""All of this dynamic variation between individuals and within individuals is really very surprising,"" says Whitehead Founding Member Rudolf Jaenisch, who is also a professor of biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""We don't yet understand the significance of this. Is it functionally important and does it reflect, particularly in the brain, the history of neurons activity states, for example? These are all interesting possibilities."" See Also: Biological mechanism passes on long-term epigenetic ""memories"" Methylation the attachment of molecules, known as methyl groups, to DNA is an epigenetic phenomenon that affects gene expression. Generally, methylated genes are turned off while unmethylated genes are active and ready for transcription. Although advances in sequencing technology have yielded informative methylation maps in a variety of tissues, such approaches only capture static ""snapshots"" of methylation and are unable to reveal the dynamics of methylation in real time in tissues and individual cells. Because of this limitation, researchers have theorized that inherited methylation, also referred to as parental imprinting, largely remains stable throughout development, except during two important developmental milestones: after fertilization and during the creation of sperm and egg cells. Altered gene imprinting at other times has been associated with developmental disorders and cancer. Cells exhibiting different imprinted methylation in a section of a mouse cerebellum. Courtesy: Cell Press  To investigate active methylation in individual cells, Jaenisch lab postdoctoral researcher Yonatan Stelzer developed a reporter system that tracks genomic methylation in real-time. When a target gene is unmethylated, the reporter is also unmethylated, triggering expression of a glowing protein that illuminates the cell. When the target is methylated, so too is the reporter. The glowing protein is then unexpressed, leaving the cell dark. As the target gene's methylation changes, so does the reporter's. In the latest research, described online this week in the journal Cell Reports, Stelzer used the reporter system in mice to discover that imprinted methylation in developing and adult tissues is actively regulated rather than merely maintained in stable fashion. ""What we see with the reporter in adult tissues is very surprising and much more complex than we had thought,"" says Stelzer, who is a co-author of the Cell Reports paper. ""The regulation of imprinted methylation results in these very consistent patterns in different tissues and even in a cell-type dependent manner. In the case of neural cells, it means that imprinted methylation is dynamically shaping the adult brain over time and could play a role in aging. Because this imprinting affects hundreds of genes that are non-coding, including microRNAs and non-coding RNAs, it's a very interesting fine-tuning mechanism for the dosage of gene expression in the brain and elsewhere in the body.""

But vision has nothing to do with it Johns Hopkins University (JHU) neuroscientists have found that the brain network behind numerical reasoning is identical in blind and sighted people. See Also: An eye opening look at adult visual plasticity The researchers also found the visual cortex in blind people is highly involved in doing math, suggesting the brain is vastly more adaptable than previously believed. The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""The number network develops totally independently of visual experience,"" said lead author Shipra Kanjlia, a graduate student in JHU's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. ""These blind people have never seen anything in their lives, but they have the same number network as people who can see."" The researchers had congenitally blind people and sighted people wearing blindfolds solve math equations and answer language questions while having a brain scan. With the math problems, participants heard pairs of increasingly complicated recorded equations and responded if the value for ""x"" was the same or different. The participants also heard pairs of sentences and responded if the meaning of the sentences was the same or different. Related: The amazing adaptability of the brain's vision center With both blind and sighted participants, the key brain network involved in numerical reasoning, the intraparietal sulcus, responded robustly as participants considered the math problems. Meanwhile, in blind participants only, regions of the visual cortex also responded as they did math. And the visual cortex didn't merely respond the more complicated the math, the greater the activity in the vision center. Although it had been thought that brain regions including the visual cortex had entrenched functions that could change slightly but not fundamentally, these findings underscore recent research that showed just the opposite: The visual cortex is extremely plastic and, when it isn't processing sight, can respond to everything from spoken language to math problems. Co-author Marina Bedny, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences, says the findings here, taken together with earlier results, suggest the brain as a whole could be extremely adaptable, almost like a computer that depending on data coming in could reconfigure to handle almost limitless types of tasks. It could someday be possible to reroute functions from a damaged area to a new spot in the brain, she said.

Turns out, they were wrong. Glutamate, the most common neurotransmitter in the brain, is also necessary. Researchers at the University at Buffalo (UB) and Johns Hopkins University reported their findings with mice in the Journal of Neuroscience. See Also: Endurance exercise improves neuronal connections to muscle fibers based on muscle-induced feedback The team took a new approach to the old question of how the connections from the spinal cord to the muscles mature, says Kirkwood Personius, the paper's lead author and a clinical associate professor of rehabilitation science in UB's School of Public Health and Health Professions. Each muscle is made of many individual muscle fibers and, in adults, each of those muscle fibers is contacted by a single motor neuron. However, this simple arrangement is not what you see at birth. Instead, each muscle fiber is contacted by as many as 10 nerves. The process that allows one motor neuron to stay while all the others are retracted seems to be this, according to the researchers: the nerve that's most effective in activating the muscle is the one that wins. But what specifically occurs during the nerve's firing that triggers the stabilizing of the winner and the withdrawal of the others? For many decades, it was assumed that the pruning process began with release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the nerve. This seemed logical, the paper's authors say, because motor neurons do indeed release lots of acetylcholine. ""However, we now have shown that an important transmitter is one that nobody had previously expected: it is glutamate,"" said Personius, PT, PhD. ""The nerves release a molecule that is converted into glutamate, and the glutamate then activates glutamate receptors, notably NMDA receptors, on the muscle."" NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are one of several types of molecules that respond to glutamate. They are especially important in the central nervous system controlling brain development, learning and synaptic plasticity. ""Nobody thought NMDA receptors played any role in the innervation of muscle,"" Personius said. The researchers tested their hypothesis that glutamate receptor activation modulates the development of the neuromuscular system in several ways, each of which supported what they thought. In addition, they showed that the response of the muscle to glutamate is very strong at birth, but quickly disappears as mice mature.

They hope to turn the discovery into new therapeutic approaches to fight metastatic cancers. The work by members of Rice s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics led by co-director and biophysicist Herbert Levine and scientists at Duke combined simulations and experiments to uncover genes that regulate how cells transition from epithelial (nonmobile) to mesenchymal (migrating)   or vice versa. The work appears on the October cover of the American Society for Microbiology journal Molecular and Cellular Biology. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, known as EMT, is a characteristic of developmental processes but can be hijacked by cells that turn cancerous and metastatic. A previous study by Rice s theoretical group found that during EMT, some cells are in a hybrid state that has both epithelial and mesenchymal properties, including group migration. The reverse, aka MET, is important to normal development but is also suspected of helping roving mesenchymal cancer cells use epithelial characteristics to settle in distant organs and initiate metastasis.  We re interested in understanding the hierarchy of controls that cells use when they change from one phenotype to another,  Levine said.  Most of the work here has been on carcinoma cells, which start out as epithelial and then, as part of the metastatic process, pick up mesenchymal-like properties in order to move and evade detection.  Here the opportunity was to look at the same process, but almost in reverse. Here we have a cell that s really mesenchymal, but it has picked up certain properties to be epithelial,  he said.  We were interested in how symmetric these processes were. And the answer is there are some degrees of symmetry but there are some clear differences that seem to involve what I think of as the second layer of how regulation works.  Cells change their orientation from mesenchymal to epithelial or back depending on genetic signals or mutations, Levine said.  When a gene is expressed for a very long time   or not expressed for a very long time   that gets encoded at the structural level of DNA,  he said.  So the DNA of genes that are used often are more accessible.  We discovered these sarcoma cells, which are really mesenchymal, have gone to this extra structural level of DNA organization where epithelial-like genes are more strongly constrained.  That, he said, makes it much harder for hybrid cells to drop their epithelial traits. Both EMT and MET exhibit what s called phenotypic plasticity, in this case the ability of a cell to change its type in response to changes in its environment. But in some types of sarcomas   malignant tumors that develop in soft tissue and bone   roving mesenchymal cells seem to acquire a greater share of the traits of stationary epithelial cells. According to lead author Jason Somarelli of Duke Cancer Institute,  Patients whose sarcomas have more of these epithelial-like traits have better survival outcomes. They live longer than patients whose sarcomas do not exhibit this phenotypic plasticity.  The team found that in multiple sarcoma cell lines, the combined expression of the micro RNA-200 family and upregulation of an epithelial gene activator, GRHL2, led to downregulation of the ZEB1 protein, which makes cells lean more toward epithelial-like behavior and therefore less aggressive. The initiative at Duke first caught the eye of Rice graduate student Mohit Kumar Jolly, who with Levine has published related works based on predictive computer simulations of biological systems. The ability of cells to become epithelial-mesenchymal hybrids was the topic of a 2015 study in which the Rice team discovered that tumors depend on these hybrids to hijack cell-signaling processes.  We thought they were looking at the same players that we were, but they are connected differently in sarcomas as compared to carcinomas,  Jolly said.  They had different results from what our initial model predicted, so we developed a new mathematical model to capture cellular plasticity in sarcomas.  The next challenge, Levine said, will be to understand the mechanism by which genes that encode the relevant proteins are made available in DNA s chromatin structure, a subject of ongoing study at Rice.  We want to understand how those factors either help or prevent cells from going through the phenotypic transitions we think are important for cancer metastasis,  he said.","Published: September 20, 2016"

Their study, which appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today, opens the possibility of developing therapeutic agents against this virus that causes the death of about 200,000 children every year.  Some people infected with norovirus do not get sick,  said senior author Dr. B V Venkataram Prasad, professor of virology and the Alvin Romansky Chair in biochemistry at Baylor.  We wanted to understand how these protective human antibodies work.  The researchers screened and isolated protective antibodies from human blood and discovered that the most protective were of the IgA type, an antibody mostly involved in gut immunity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness and of acute gastroenteritis in all age groups in the U.S. The virus enters the body hidden in contaminated food, travels through the digestive system and infects the top layer of cells, the epithelial cells, on the small intestine. To enter the epithelial cells the virus attaches to complex sugar molecules, or glycans, on the surface of the cells.  The initial attachment is very important for the virus to subsequently get in,  said Prasad.  It is like knocking at the door, and then the door opens and the virus can get inside the cells.  The epithelial cells have a thick cover of glycans of diverse types, but norovirus seems to selectively bind to a particular group of glycans, the histo-blood group antigens, or HBGA, which also determine our blood types. Different strains of norovirus interact with different types of HBGAs.  The site on the norovirus particles that binds to HBGA is located in a region of the virus called P domain,  said Prasad.  We knew that human antibodies that bind to P domain of norovirus and block HBGA binding correlate with protection, but we didn t know where these antibodies bind on the P domain and how this interaction prevents norovirus from binding to HBGA. Do the antibodies change the structure of the P domain or disrupt the HBGA binding site so it can no longer bind to the glycans? Or do the antibodies physically block the glycan binding site on P domain preventing its binding to HBGAs? We answered these questions with X-ray crystallographic analysis.  Scientists use X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of highly purified molecules in the form of crystals. Crystals are symmetrical structures that produce symmetrical diffraction patterns when irradiated with X rays. Scientists use the symmetrical X-ray diffraction patterns to determine how molecules would look in 3-D.  The hardest, most time-consuming part of this project was to obtain good quality diffracting crystals ready for X-ray crystallographic analysis,  said first author Dr. Sreejesh Shanker, a senior scientist in the Prasad lab. To answer the question of how the antibodies prevent norovirus from binding to HBGA, Shanker purified the complex of the norovirus P domain with the part of the antibody that binds to the domain, called antigen binding fragment (Fab), of a human IgA antibody. He then successfully used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the complex.  We found that the Fab fragment binds close to the HBGA binding site. It does not change the structure of the HBGA binding site, but physically blocks access to the site,  said Shanker. These results open the possibility of developing compounds that mimic the structure of the Fab fragment and using them as a therapeutic agent to block the virus binding to cells,  said Prasad. Now that the scientific community has the ability to grow noroviruses in the lab, it is possible to test whether blocking binding would inhibit infection and replication of the virus inside the cells.  We see the possibility of using these blocking therapeutic agents to treat norovirus infections in transplant recipients suffering from these infections, which can be fatal,  said co-senior author Dr. Mary Estes, Cullen Endowed Professor of Human and Molecular Virology and Microbiology at Baylor and emeritus founding director of the Texas Medical Center Digestive Diseases Center.","Published: September 20, 2016"

The grant, from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), funds research into how the virus replicates and interacts with the body. These studies may lead to the development of drugs that treat Ebola by interfering with the viral replication process. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or specific drugs for the virus. Ebola virus is one of the deadliest viruses in the world, with death rates as high as 90 percent. Despite this, the virus has attracted relatively little research attention. A large epidemic that began in 2014 in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone commanded worldwide attention, but before then, the virus was limited mostly to relatively small outbreaks in central Africa.  My lab has been studying Ebola for some time, but the epidemic from 2014 to 2016 showed us that it has significant potential to impact global health,  said Amarasinghe, the grant s principal investigator.  As we watched the epidemic unfold, I think we also realized that there s a lot we don t know about the basic biology of the virus, and that limits our ability to find ways to target it therapeutically.  The primary goal of the grant is to understand the enzyme complex that the virus uses to replicate, including how it interacts with the body s cells and with other factors such as the immune response.  We think there are host factors that modulate the replication complex, but we don t know what they are,  said Daisy Leung, assistant professor of pathology and immunology who leads a section of the grant devoted to making the tools needed to study the virus and to investigating protein interactions.  We need to find out in order to identify targets for potential therapeutics.  Although drug development per se is not the main focus of the grant, the scientists expect that knowledge gleaned from the research will lead to drug studies down the road.  The replication complex is the only enzyme this virus has, and traditionally enzymes are good drug targets,  Amarasinghe said. The grant represents a collaboration by 12 labs at seven institutions. Christopher Basler, PhD, at Georgia State University leads a project to identify how elements of the viral genome affect how much of the viral replication complex is synthesized, and how host factors impact the function of the complex. Douglas LaCount at Purdue University and Robert Davey at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute are leading a project to screen for host factors required for Ebola virus infection and replication. Only the team at Texas Biomed will work with the live virus; the other labs will study proteins and nucleic acids from the virus. Since the disease has a high death rate and no vaccine or treatment, working with Ebola virus requires the highest level biosafety facility: level four. Texas Biomed has one of a handful of biosafety level four facilities in the United States.  We have a long-standing collaboration with these other groups   we ve published with them, we have other grants together   so doing this big project together is a natural progression of those collaborations,  Amarasinghe said.  It s a unique opportunity in the sense that we have pulled together a really impressive set of expertise to address a very important question of our time. ","Published: September 20, 2016"

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The study, from which headline results were reported in October 2015, showed that the two-dose candidate shingles vaccine had 90% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 84-94%) compared to placebo in people over 70 years old. Vaccine efficacy was maintained across the various age groups included in the study, ranging between 90% in people aged 70-79 years (95% confidence interval: 83-94%) and 89% in those aged 80 years and above (95% confidence interval: 74-96%). The high efficacy is in line with the results of the ZOE-50 trial, a study in people over 50 years old which was presented and published last year showing a 97% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 93-99%). A pooled analysis of data from both trials showed the vaccine demonstrated 91% efficacy against shingles (95% confidence interval: 86-95%) in adults aged 70 years and older compared to placebo. This efficacy was maintained with an 88% reduction in the risk of shingles (95% confidence interval: 73-95%) in the fourth year after vaccination. The risk of serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or deaths observed in ZOE-70 was similar in people receiving Shingrix and placebo. The most commonly reported local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site and the most frequently reported systemic adverse reaction was fatigue. The majority of injection site and systemic reactions occurred within seven days of vaccination, with most lasting 1-3 days, and generally were mild-to-moderate in intensity. Dr Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President, Vaccines Research and Development, GSK, said:  This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable, as we know that these people frequently have an age-related weakening of their immune system. If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people.

The program will be available at nearly 150 hospitals and care centers across the U.S., serving approximately 12 million patients annually, creating the largest community-based precision medicine program in the country. The Alliance will initially focus on advanced diagnostic tumor profiling in cancer treatment and will later expand into other areas such as cancer and cardiovascular risk, and pharmacogenomics. The program will also support oncology research by populating a database that will become the largest collection of clinical cancer data ever compiled by a single organization.   The Precision Medicine Alliance will provide community physicians with access to a wide range of diagnostic technology that is currently only available in academic medical centers. This will provide more accurate diagnoses, with personalized therapies tailored to each patient through community providers, where the vast majority of care happens,  said Lloyd Dean, president and CEO of Dignity Health. He continued,  Through our partnership with CHI, we are using the latest technology, especially in genomic sequencing, to deliver the right care, to the right patients, quickly and efficiently.   Conventional wisdom suggests patients suffering from the same condition should be treated with the same therapy.  added Kevin E. Lofton, CEO of Catholic Health Initiatives,  Science now tells us that the efficacy of one-size fits all for medications and therapies varies by patient because each person has a unique DNA profile that responds differently to prevailing treatments. Through the new Precision Medicine Alliance, use of genomics for diagnosis and treatments enables a new degree of precision for identifying the most effective treatment and/or clinical trial for each patient, as well as those treatments that would potentially be ineffective or harmful. Through the program we will partner with laboratories and data solution companies nationwide to promote new clinical trial development and molecular tests to meet specific patient needs.  The Precision Medicine Alliance will also integrate electronic medical records into a robust data-management infrastructure that will allow quick access to the right clinical expertise and clinical trial information. The two health systems will partner with laboratories and bioinformatics companies nationwide to develop molecular tests specific to meet the needs of patients and clinicians. By combining the data from highly sensitive diagnostic tests with an individual s medical history, health care providers will be able to develop individualized treatment and prevention plans.  Additionally, the Precision Medicine Alliance is aligned with the national Precision Medicine Initiative , which is a $215 million investment from the White House to accelerate biomedical research and provide clinicians with new tools to select the therapies that will work best in individual patients.   Current treatment programs largely focus on the best course of treatment for the general population,  said Edward Abrahams, president of the Personalized Medicine Coalition.  However, with recent advancements in science and technology, the ability of personalized medicine to improve health outcomes for individuals and reduce toxicity due to adverse drug responses is great. Partnerships such as the one between Dignity Health and CHI that will bring this targeted approach directly to the communities is thrilling and will have a significant impact on patient lives and improving overall community health.

St. Jude Children s Research Hospital is the leading institute in the US for research on understanding the genetic basis of paediatric forms of blood, brain and bone cancers. To characterise the genetic variants responsible for driving cancer formation in children, the hospital sequences the DNA from hundreds of childhood tumours. Their new system to explore this data, ProteinPaint, has been carefully designed to provide simple and easy ways to visualise and understand such large quantities of information. The challenge is to identify which genetic variations are playing an active role in driving cancer development and which are there by chance - simply passengers along for the ride. It is only by comparing the childhood tumour genomes with many other tumour genomes that the  cancer drivers  can be separated from the  passengers .

Known as  Mayaro virus,  it is closely related to chikungunya virus and was first isolated in Trinidad in 1954. Most reported cases, however, have been confined to small outbreaks in the Amazon. Whether this case signals the start of a new outbreak in the Caribbean region is currently unknown.  While current attention has been focused on the Zika virus, the finding of yet another mosquito-borne virus which may be starting to circulate in the Caribbean is of concern,  said Glenn Morris, M.D., M.P.H., director of the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute .  Hopefully we will not see the same massive epidemics that we saw with chikungunya, dengue and now Zika. However, these findings underscore the fact that there are additional viruses  waiting in the wings  that may pose threats in the future, and for which we need to be watching. The case was identified from a blood sample taken in January 2015 from an 8-year-old boy in rural Haiti. The patient had a fever and abdominal pain but no rash or conjunctivitis. Because faculty from the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute were in the region during and after the 2014 chikungunya outbreak, plasma samples were obtained from febrile children and analyzed for the presence of chikungunya virus RNA using a genetic identification technique known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The plasma samples, which were examined by UF s Maha Elbadry, Ph.D., in Gressier, Haiti, were then sent to EPI for additional virology and molecular analyses, focusing on the detection of chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses. Dengue virus was detected in the patient, in addition to a  new  virus that was subsequently identified as Mayaro.  The virus we detected is genetically different from the ones that have been described recently in Brazil, and we don t know yet if it is unique to Haiti or if it is a recombinant strain from different types of Mayaro viruses,  said John Lednicky, Ph.D., an associate professor in the environmental and global health department at the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions and the study s lead author. The findings were published online in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The symptoms of Mayaro fever are similar to those of chikungunya fever: fever, joint pain, muscle pain and rashes.

The primary objective of the Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD). Finally, the trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo.  We are both surprised and disappointed by the outcome of the Resolve trial, which we recently unblinded. Our initial analyses and review of the key aspects of the trial do not indicate issues with trial execution, data collection, data integrity, or drug product quality. We expect to have preliminary immunogenicity data in the coming weeks to further our understanding of the trial results,  said Gregory Glenn M.D., President, Research and Development.  Historically, annual seasonal RSV ARD attack rates between 3% and 7% have been observed in older adults. In our Phase 2 trial, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 4.9% and an RSV msLRTD attack rate of 1.8%. In contrast, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 2.0% and an msLRTD attack rate of 0.4% in our Phase 3 trial. These attack rates indicate a mild RSV season in older adults this year. We are continuing to investigate potential root causes that could have impacted the outcome of this trial. We continue to believe that there is a path forward for our RSV vaccine and that there is an important unmet need for an RSV vaccine in older adults. ","Published: September 20, 2016"

Our lab is combining immunology and nanotechnology to reprogram how the immune system responds to self-cells in the brain that are mistakenly attacked during MS,  said BIOE Assistant Professor Christopher Jewell, corresponding author on the new report.  The finding, conducted in cells and pre-clinical animal models of MS, could lead to new approaches for reversing paralysis in MS, or better therapies for other autoimmune diseases.  The group s findings were published today in the journal Cell Reports. Collaborator Dr. Jonathan Bromberg from the University of Maryland School of Medicine said,  The studies show it is possible to treat and cure inflammatory disease with a single dose of therapeutics loaded in biodegradable polymers targeted directly to lymph nodes   the tissues that coordinate immune function in the body.  In MS, the immune system incorrectly recognizes myelin that insulates and protects nerves fibers in the brain. Immune cells enter the brain and attack, leading to slow loss of motor function and other complications. Current therapies for MS work by decreasing the activity of the immune system; but, they do so in a broadly-suppressive way that often leaves patients vulnerable to infection. There are also no cures for MS, type 1 diabetes, and other autoimmune diseases.  The goal of our work   and that of others in the field   is to expand cells that are both myelin-specific and regulatory in nature,  said Lisa Tostanoski, first author on the paper.  The hope is that these cells can directly suppress inflammation without targeting healthy immune function.  Jewell s team is working to reprogram the function of lymph nodes: instead of generating inflammatory cells that attack myelin, the lymph nodes are  instructed  to promote regulatory immune cells that control the attack against myelin. To carry out the  reprogramming,  degradable polymer particles that incorporate regulatory signals are delivered to lymph nodes using a unique intra-lymph node injection technique. Once in the lymph nodes, these particles slowly release immune signals to promote regulatory immune cells that mature and migrate to the central nervous system to suppress the attack against myelin. In order to test their strategy, the team is using two rodent models of MS. The results are promising thus far, demonstrating that a single particle treatment can permanently reverse paralysis. Importantly, these effects were found to be myelin-specific, and correlated with local changes in the function and types of cells in lymph nodes and the central nervous system.  Moving forward, our team is working to show the therapeutic effects result from repair and remyelination in the brain,  Jewell said.  That represents a goal that is a critical criterion to improve on human MS therapies.  To support this breakthrough research, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has awarded the team more than $600,000 in research funding.  This innovative research has the potential to open up a new, highly selective approach to treating multiple sclerosis,  said Bruce F. Bebo, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.  We are pleased to have helped launch this work with early pilot and full research grants, and hope that the further research required to translate these results to people is equally successful.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hyperstable-peptides-for-ondemand-drugs-197452,Hyperstable Peptides for  On Demand  Drugs These small molecules can fold into different conformations that could allow for greater flexibility in precision drug design ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at the University of Washington s Institute for Protein Design have shown it is possible to create small, hyperstable peptides that could provide the basis for developing powerful new drugs and diagnostic tests.   These super stable peptides provide an ideal molecular scaffold on which it should be possible to design  on demand  a new generation of peptide-based drugs,  said UW Medicine protein engineering pioneer David Baker, who oversaw the research project.  He is a UW professor of biochemistry. In a study, which appears in the journal Nature, the researchers demonstrate that not only is it possible to design peptides that fold into a wide variety of different conformations, but also that it is possible to incorporate functional groups of chemicals not normally found in peptides.  Both of these abilities could give designers even greater flexibility to create drugs that act on their molecular targets with high precision. Such drugs should not only be more potent but would also be less likely to have harmful side effects. Most drugs work by binding to a key section of a protein in a way that alters how the protein functions, typically by stimulating or inhibiting the protein s activity. For the binding to occur, the drug must fit into the target site on the protein as a key fits into a lock. How close the lock-and-key fit is can often determine how well the medication works. Currently, most prescription drugs are either made of small molecules or much larger proteins.  Both classes of drugs have advantages and disadvantages. Small molecule drugs, for example, tend to be easy to manufacture, tend to have a long shelf life, and are often easily absorbed. But they often don t fit the targeted  lock  as selectively as could be hoped.  This imperfect fit can result in off-target binding and side-effects that diminish their effectiveness. Protein drugs, on the other hand, often fit their target receptors very well but they are difficult to manufacture, are more unstable, and lose their potency if they are not kept refrigerated.  Because of their size and instability, they need to be injected into patients. Peptide drugs fall in between these two classes. They are small, so they have many of advantages of small molecule drugs. But they are made of a chain of amino acids, the same components that make up proteins, so they have the potential to achieve the precision of larger protein drugs. The power of some tiny peptides can be observed in venomous creatures. A number of poisonous insects and sea creatures produce small peptide toxins. Those are some of the most potent pharmacologically active compounds known.  Their potency is among the reasons why medical scientists are interested in tapping into beneficial uses of peptides. In the new study, Gaurav Bhardwaj, Vikram Khipple Mulligan, Christopher D. Bahl, senior fellows in the Baker lab, and their colleagues, developed computational methods that are now incorporated in the computer program called Rosetta.  These methods are being used to design peptides ranging from 18 to 47 amino acids in length in 16 different conformations, called topologies. Originally developed by Baker and his earlier team, Rosetta uses advanced modelling algorithms to design new proteins by calculating the energies of the biochemical interactions within a protein, and between the protein and its surroundings. Because a protein will assume the shape in which the sum of these interaction energies is at its minimum, the program can calculate which shape a protein will most likely assume in nature. The peptides were made hyperstable by designing them to have interior crosslinking structures, called disulfide bonds, which staple together different sections of the peptide.  Additional stabilization was secured by tying the two ends of the peptide chain together, a process called cyclization. The resulting constrained peptides were so stable that they were able to survive temperatures to 95  C, nearly boiling. This survival feat would be impossible for antibody drugs. The researchers also showed that the design of these peptides could include amino acids not normally found in proteins. Amino acids have a property called handedness or chirality. Two amino acids can be made of the same atoms but have different arrangements, just as our hands have the same number of fingers but have two mirror-image configurations, right and left. This handedness keeps the right hand from fitting properly into a left-handed glove and vice versa.  In nature, perhaps due to a chance event billions of years ago, amino acids in living cells are all left-handed. Right-handed amino acids are very rare in naturally occurring proteins.  Nevetheless, the researchers were able to insert right-handed amino acids in their designed peptides.  Being able to include other types of amino acids allows us to create peptides with a much wider variety of conformations,  said Baker,  and  being able to use right-handed amino acids essentially doubles your palette.   By making it possible to create peptides that include  unnatural  amino acids, this approach will allow researchers to explore peptide structures and function that have not been explored by nature through evolution,  Baker said.","Published: September 20, 2016"

Women who reported feeling depressed during the first two trimesters of pregnancy were nearly twice as likely to develop gestational diabetes, according to an analysis of pregnancy records. Conversely, a separate analysis found that women who developed gestational diabetes were more likely to report postpartum depression six weeks after giving birth, compared to a similar group of women who did not develop gestational diabetes. The study was published online in Diabetologia. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes (high blood sugar level) occurring only in pregnancy, which if untreated may cause serious health problems for mother and infant.  Our data suggest that depression and gestational diabetes may occur together,  said the study s first author, Stefanie Hinkle, Ph.D., staff scientist in the Division of Intramural Population Health Research at the NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).  Until we learn more, physicians may want to consider observing pregnant women with depressive symptoms for signs of gestational diabetes. They also may want to monitor women who have had gestational diabetes for signs of postpartum depression.  Although obesity is known to increase the risk for gestational diabetes, the likelihood of gestational diabetes was higher for non-obese women reporting depression than for obese women with depression. The researchers analyzed pregnancy records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, which tracked the progress of thousands of pregnancies, to understand the patterns of fetal growth. The study enrolled 2,334 non-obese and 468 obese women in weeks eight to 13 of pregnancy. The women responded to questionnaires on symptoms of depression when they enrolled in the study, again between the 16th and 22nd week of pregnancy, and then six weeks after giving birth. The researchers also reviewed the women s records to identify who had developed gestational diabetes.  Of particular note, persistent depression from the first to second trimester set women at even greater risk for gestational diabetes  said the study s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, M.D., Ph.D, in the Division of Intramural Population Health Research at NICHD. Women who had the highest scores for depression in the first and second trimesters   about 17 percent   had nearly triple the risk for gestational diabetes when compared to women who had lower depression scores.  Our results suggest it would be a good idea for clinicians to pay particular attention to women with high depression scores when evaluating the risk of gestational diabetes,  Dr. Zhang added. Although obesity increases the risk for gestational diabetes, non-obese women with high depression scores had nearly triple the risk for gestational diabetes than the other women in the study. Depression did not appear to increase the risk for gestational diabetes among obese women. Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends (link is external) that physicians screen patients at least once for depression during the perinatal period (link is external) (22 weeks of pregnancy through 7 days after birth.) The researchers also found a higher risk for postpartum depression among the women who had gestational diabetes. Of the women who developed gestational diabetes, nearly 15 percent experienced depressive symptoms after birth, which was more than four times that of women who had not had gestational diabetes. Dr. Hinkle stressed that the study was not able to prove a cause and effect relationship between symptoms of depression and gestational diabetes. The researchers added that earlier studies have shown that depression is associated with impaired glucose metabolism that may lead to higher blood sugar levels. Similarly, high blood sugar levels may lead to inflammation, hormonal, and other changes that could lead to symptoms of depression.","Published: September 20, 2016"

The technique, called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to modify mood, emotion, and cognition, yet researchers lack any evidence for how or even if it directly modulates brain activity. Still, some researchers see its potential for a new strategy to treat psychiatric disorders. See Also: Neurostimulation: What is being said in the media and academic literature? A new study in Biological Psychiatry is the first to measures changes in brain metabolism during tDCS. Led by senior author Shirley Fecteau of the Universit  Laval in Quebec, Canada, the study reports that tDCS increases levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate + glutamine--glutamate is the main activating chemical messenger in the brain-and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), an indicator of neuronal health. Both of these neurotransmitters support learning and adaptation in the brain. ""These interesting data provide chemical evidence suggesting that tDCS may activate the human cerebral cortex,"" said John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry. ""This type of change would seem to be critical for producing behavioral and perhaps therapeutic effects."" Learn More: Pilot study: Noninvasive brain stimulation temporarily improves motor symptoms in people with Parkinson s disease In the study, the researchers applied a single tDCS session to 15 healthy participants for 30 minutes at a current intensity of 1 mA, considered a mild dose. They stimulated the prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in behavior and cognition. During stimulation, the researchers acquired magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans to measure changes in neurotransmitter levels in the prefrontal cortex and in the striatum, an important region involved in many functions including reward and learning. In participants who received tDCS, first author Antoine Hone-Blanchet measured a rapid increase in prefrontal NAA, within 15 minutes of stimulation, and in striatal glutamate + glutamine within 30 minutes. The levels returned to normal immediately at the end of the session. According to Fecteau, these results suggest that tDCS has a rapid but short-lived excitatory effect at and downstream from the stimulation site. ""These findings need to be replicated with greater sample size, but also compel for investigation on the neural effects of tDCS,"" said Fecteau, noting that the scientific community and general population have been increasingly using tDCS over the prefrontal cortex in recent years.

Another person's direct gaze not only increases physiological arousal, but it has, in fact, several different types of effects on cognition and behavior. Research has shown that seeing another person's direct gaze increases peoples' awareness of themselves, improves memory for contextually presented information, increases the likelihood of behaving in a pro-social manner, and makes people evaluate the gazer more positively. But why does a direct gaze have such diverse effects? See Also: The social origins of intelligence in the brain In a new study, a research team from France and Finland proposes that all these effects are in fact related to the self-referential power of eye contact. Perceiving another's direct gaze first captures the observer's attention onto the other's face. Then, however, it turns the observer's attention ""inwards,"" to the self. As a result, the observers interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their self-concept as a background for processing information. ""The direct gaze has the power to enhance the experience that the information present in the situation is strongly related to one's own person. Processing stimuli in relation to oneself acts as an associative 'glue' for perception, memory, and decision-making. This automatically modulates current information processing and related decisions, improving, for example, memory performance,"" explains Professor Laurence Conty from the University of Paris, France. Another interesting effect is that people take other people into consideration and behave more honestly in the presence of another's direct gaze. This is true even when the eyes appear just in a printed poster, for example. Professor Nathalie George from the French Brain and Spine Institute in Paris says that ""this is because self-involvement in information processing also heightens the salience of concerns about being a target for others' social evaluation and, consequently, concerns about one's self-reputation. These concerns lead to adopt pro-social, altruistic behavior."" Remarkably, the effects of eye contact may occur following the presentation of pictures of eyes. This is because the visual perception of a direct gaze is strongly associated with the belief of being the object of another's attention. ""The belief of being watched by another is embedded in the perception of the direct gaze. Such a belief has become an intrinsic property of the direct gaze, based on both human evolution and overlearning during early life,"" explains Professor Jari Hietanen, from the University of Tampere, Finland.

A paper published Sept. 16 in the journal Science has found that pathogens in the intestinal tract cause harm because they benefit from immune system responses designed to repair the very damage to the intestinal lining caused by the bacteria in the first place.    The finding is important because it explains how some enteric pathogens can manipulate mammalian cells to get the oxygen they need to breathe,  said Andreas B umler, a professor of medical microbiology and immunology at UC Davis School of Medicine and lead author of the study.  It also offers new insight into developing strategies targeting the metabolism of the intestinal lining to prevent the expansion of harmful bacteria in the gut, a situation that is exacerbated by the overuse of antibiotics.  A healthy large intestine is mostly free of oxygen, and the beneficial microbes residing there thrive in this anaerobic environment. In contrast, enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia coli in humans or Citrobacter rodentium in mice, need oxygen to survive. B umler s team discovered how these pathogens change the gut environment to favor their own growth.  Enteric pathogens deploy virulence factors that damage the intestinal lining and cause diarrhea,  B umler said.  To repair the damage, the body accelerates the division of epithelial cells that form the intestinal lining, which brings immature cells to the mucosal surface. These new cells contain more oxygen and wind up increasing oxygen levels in the large bowel, creating an environment that allows gut pathogens like E. coli to outcompete the anaerobic-loving resident microbes.  B umler s research has important implications for developing new treatment strategies that target factors that compromise the intestinal-lining function or bolster microbiota composition to offer either resistance or assistance to invading pathogens.  The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria has become a major public health threat worldwide, B umler said.  As more bacterial strains do not respond to the drugs designed to kill them, the advances made in treating infectious diseases over the last 50 years are in jeopardy.  This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified three drug-resistant organisms   Clostridium difficile, Carbapenem enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae   as requiring urgent attention, and in May, a report commissioned by the UK government predicted that by 2050 antimicrobial-resistant infections could claim 10 million lives a year and cost up to $100 trillion from the global economy. Understanding how gut pathogens manipulate the body s natural defense mechanisms to grab hold and contribute to abnormal states within and beyond the GI tract is a burgeoning area of research at UC Davis. Scientists from schools and colleges across the campus are investigating antibiotic resistance as well as the influence that gut-flora imbalances have on many conditions, including brain health and behavior, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, GI cancers, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease, autism, arthritis and asthma.

This research has future implications and can be used to monitor the dynamics of histone modifications and genome integrity in single living cells without disturbing cellular functions. Genomic integrity in living cells is maintained by packaging of nuclear DNA into chromatin, which protects it from damage and controls gene replication and expression. Histones are the primary protein components of chromatin and their post-translational modifications regulate chromatin structure and play a fundamental role in biological processes such as DNA repair, DNA replication, mitosis, etc. Among the modifications, methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20) is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and exists in three states, mono-, di- and trimethylation, each of which have distinct biological roles. Conventional techniques studying regulation by histone modifications are limited to fixed (dead) cells, thus preventing assessment of histone modification in single, living cells. To address this challenge, a group of scientists led by Prof. Kimura from the Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, generated a genetically encoded live-cell imaging probe for sensitive monitoring of the intracellular spatiotemporal dynamics of H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1). The probe, called mintbody (modification-specific intracellular antibody), is a single-chain variable fragment tagged with a fluorescent protein that demonstrates high specificity for H4K20me1 over di- and trimethylation in living yeast, mammalian cells, and even multicellular organisms. H4K20me1 is most likely associated with the tight packing of a redundant (inactivated) female X chromosome (Xi) into heterochromatin. In a roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans model, Prof. Kimura and colleagues showed that the H4K20me1-mintbody could be used to monitor changes in H4K20me1 over the cell cycle and localization of dosage-compensated X chromosomes without disrupting cell function. Thus, the new mintbody can overcome the challenges associated with visualizing and tracking histone modifications directly in living cells. This research also identified key amino acids responsible for H4K20me1-mintbody conformational stability, solubility, and consequently, functional performance using X-ray crystallography and genetic analyses. Thus, a possible solution to the existing problem of limited solubility of intracellularly expressed antibody fragments due to aberrant folding in the cytoplasm that restricted their use was formulated. In the future, development of additional mintbodies specific to diverse post-translational histone modifications will facilitate the identification of regulatory mechanisms that control epigenetic modifications.","Published: September 19, 2016"

The researchers studied the records of more than 11,000 women in England who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer and found that, without screening, an additional 1,827 more women would die from the disease. But if all women aged between 25 and 64 were screened regularly, an extra 347 lives could be saved   extensively reducing the number of deaths from the disease.   The biggest impact of screening is among women aged between 50-64 where there would be five times more women dying from cervical cancer if there were no screening. Lead researcher Professor Peter Sasieni from QMUL s Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine said:  This study looked at the impact of cervical screening on deaths from the disease and estimated the number of lives the screening programme saves each year.  Thousands of women in the UK are alive and healthy today thanks to cervical screening. The cervical screening programme already prevents thousands of cancers each year and as it continues to improve, by testing all samples for the human papilloma virus, even more women are likely to avoid this disease.  In England around 800 women die from cervical cancer each year. Cervical cancer screening is offered in the UK to women aged between 25 and 64. The screening programme invites women every three years between the 25 and 49; after that they are invited every five years until they re 64. Dr Claire Knight, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said:  Whether or not to go for screening is an individual choice, but Cancer Research UK recommends women take up the offer to attend cervical screening when invited.  It s important to remember that cervical screening is for women without symptoms. Women who have any unusual or persistent bleeding, pain, or change in vaginal discharge - even if they ve been screened recently and whatever their age - should get it checked out by their GP. Chances are it won t be cancer but, if it is, getting it diagnosed and treated early can make a real difference. ","Published: September 19, 2016"

As oceans warm, physical forces like wave strength and water flow influence which reefs thrive and which die, according to a study led by Justin Rogers, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford s Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory. The results, published in a report in the journal Limnology and Oceanography, offer new insight into how climate change will affect reefs on a local level   and also hint at steps conservationists can take to reduce the impact of warming on these fragile ecosystems.  We have known for a while that high water temperatures are harmful to coral reefs,  Rogers said.  What this paper illuminates for the first time is how waves can lower the water temperature and create better conditions for coral reefs to thrive.  Coral reefs are among the world s biodiversity hotspots. They host thousands of marine species to support sustainable fisheries. Their towering structures help to protect vulnerable coastal areas from storm waves. Rogers wanted to understand how forces driving ocean water circulation would affect reef temperatures and, by extension, reef health. To find out, he and his team deployed a series of instruments in the waters surrounding the South Pacific atoll of Palmyra, including temperature sensors, velocity sensors to track wave speed and pressure sensors to measure the strength of incoming waves and tides.  The idea was just to get a huge coverage over the reef,  Rogers said. After placing the instruments, the researchers monitored them for about three years to collect data. When Rogers and his team analyzed their atoll data, it became clear that the health of particular reef zones was closely tied to the temperature, wave and pressure dynamics in those areas. Scientists have long known that rising ocean temperatures affect coral health in a variety of ways. Zooxanthellae   colorful, single-celled algae that live inside coral   ordinarily supply the coral with an abundant food source, and the coral provide shelter for the algae. As ocean water warms, however, stressed corals expel the vibrantly colored algae, exposing the bone-white coral skeleton. Such  bleached  corals are more vulnerable to disease and environmental shocks as a result. Oceans also absorb more carbon dioxide as temperatures rise, and when this happens, corals are less able to extract calcium carbonate from the water   a mineral they need to form and strengthen their skeletons. As a result, they suffer from stunted growth and may even start to dissolve. The reefs that did best over time   those showing the highest level of live coral cover   were the ones that received an ample flow of cooler water from the ocean further offshore. The team found that both waves and tides in nearby waters drive the flow rate around these high-performing reefs, with waves being the most significant factor.  High temperature is very stressful to corals,  Rogers said.  If there s not enough exchange of water from the open ocean, those areas do not do well.  Not surprisingly, in reef zones around the atoll that had less moving water, coral cover was much sparser, since there was little cool inflow to offset rising water temperatures. The researchers also found that coral health suffered when there was high wave stress around the outer edges of reefs   heavy pounding that inflicts physical damage. High wave stress may become more common as climate change proceeds and sea levels rise. Conversely, protected reefs subject to less intense pounding had higher levels of healthy coral cover. Rogers  study suggests how coral die-offs in other, similar reefs may proceed if global ocean temperatures continue to rise. A 2016 U.S. government-funded study reports that oceans are already warming worldwide at an unprecedented rate. If this trend continues, more coral reefs will sicken or die, threatening fisheries in coastal areas and throwing undersea ecosystems off balance. Reefs in stagnating water zones and those exposed to heavy wave pounding may be among the first to go.  Areas of the reef that are not stressed will suddenly become stressed,  Rogers said. Corals can withstand brief water temperature fluctuations, he added, but their resistance wanes when average temperatures remain high for weeks or months at a time, as they do in areas with low ocean inflow.  What really seems to affect corals are these long-term temperature changes. They create an environment where it s difficult for the corals to thrive,  he said. While the prognosis may be grim, Rogers  findings also suggest practical strategies to salvage as many reefs as possible.  At a local reef scale, we could look at promoting flow in some areas,  he said, though he cautioned that such interventions would have to be vetted carefully to avoid unintended adverse consequences. But in a warming world, certain reefs may be so severely stressed that they would be unlikely to survive even with help. He suggests that limited conservation funding is best directed to reefs with high ocean inflow, which still have a fighting chance.  The reefs [with] a better chance of survival are the ones that have a better connection to offshore ocean waters,  he said.  It would be helpful to say,  These areas of the reef are going to do better under climate change, so let s focus our conservation efforts [there]. ","Published: September 19, 2016"

Ciliberto led the largest study of genetically modified crops and pesticide use to date, alongside Edward D. Perry of Kansas State University, David A. Hennessy of Michigan State University and GianCarlo Moschini of Iowa State University. The four economists studied annual data from more than 5,000 soybean and 5,000 maize farmers in the U.S. from 1998 to 2011, far exceeding previous studies that have been limited to one or two years of data.  The fact that we have 14 years of farm-level data from farmers all over the U.S. makes this study very special,  Ciliberto said.  We have repeated observations of the same farmers and can see when they adopted genetically modified seeds and how that changed their use of chemicals.  Since 2008, genetically engineered crops have accounted for more than 80 percent of maize and soybean crops planted in the U.S. Maize seeds are modified with two genes: one kills insects that eat the seed and one allows the seed to tolerate glyphosate, a herbicide commonly used in weed killers like Roundup. Soybeans are modified with just one glyphosate-resistant gene.  Unsurprisingly, maize farmers who used the insect-resistant seeds used significantly less insecticide   about 11.2 percent less   than farmers who did not use genetically modified maize. The maize farmers also used 1.3 percent less herbicide over the 13-year period. Soybean crops, on the other hand, saw a significant increase in herbicide use, with adopters of genetically modified crops using 28 percent more herbicides than non-adopters. Ciliberto attributes this increase to the proliferation of glyphosate-resistant weeds.  In the beginning, there was a reduction in herbicide use, but over time the use of chemicals increased because farmers were having to add new chemicals as weeds developed a resistance to glyphosate,  Ciliberto said. Maize farmers, he said, have not yet had to address the same level of resistance, in part because they did not adopt genetically modified crops as quickly as their counterparts in the soy industry. However, the study did find evidence that both maize and soybean farmers increased herbicide use during the last five years of the study, indicating that weed resistance is a growing problem for both groups. From 2006 to 2011, the percentage of hectares sprayed with only glyphosate shrunk from more than 70 percent to 41 percent for soybean farmers and from more than 40 percent to 19 percent for maize farmers. The decrease resulted from farmers having to resort to other chemicals as glyphosate-resistant weeds became more common.  Evidence suggests that weeds are becoming more resistant and farmers are having to use additional chemicals, and more of them,  Ciliberto said. Insects do not appear to have developed a similar resistance, in part because federal regulations require farmers to have a  safe haven  in their fields that is free of genetically modified crops. Insects and worms in those safe havens have no need to develop resistance, and because they interact and breed with insects in other parts of the field, they help prevent the development of resistant genes. Despite the decrease in insecticide use, continued growth in herbicide use poses a significant environmental problem as large doses of the chemicals can harm biodiversity and increase water and air pollution. Ciliberto and his colleagues measured the overall environmental impact of the changes in chemical use that have resulted from the adoption of genetically modified crops, using a measure called the environmental impact quotient, or EIQ, to account for chemicals  impact on farmworkers, consumers and the environment. Comparing adopters to non-adopters, they found little change in the impact on farmworkers and consumers. However, the adoption of genetically modified soybeans correlated with a negative impact on the environment as increased herbicide use also increased contamination of local ecosystems. Overall, Ciliberto said he was surprised by the extent to which herbicide use had increased and concerned about the potential environmental impact.  I did not expect to see such a strong pattern,  he said.","Published: September 19, 2016"

Plasticell and CellSpring are developing tissue models using 3D Bloom Biopolymer seeded with hMSCs that are subsequently differentiated to bone, cartilage and brown/white fat tissue using CombiCult-derived differentiation media. 3D cultures of cells resemble natural tissues more closely compared to conventional 2D cultures grown on flat dishes. In particular, 3D tissues have more accurate biological responses to drug treatment and are used in the pharmaceutical industry to identify promising lead compounds in all stages of drug discovery. Plasticell has used its proprietary Combinatorial Cell Culture  (CombiCult ) platform to develop fully defined, highly effective media formulations to differentiate stem cells, for applications in drug discovery research and cell therapy. In particular, Plasticell has used the platform to develop media for rapid, reliable differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to high quality osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes (both white and brown), with a view to creating tissue models for drug screening and cell therapies. While Plasticell s osteogenic media formulation has been licenced to MilliporeSigma for research use only (marketed as OsteoMAX-XF), Plasticell has retained rights to use the formulation and derivatives to develop therapeutic products, such as a cell-based therapy for repair of bone fractures. The global bone grafts and substitutes market is estimated to be $2.5bn per year and growing rapidly. Testing Plasticell s formulations in our system it became clear that impressive 3D bone structures were being formed,  said Dr Chris Millan, co-founder and CTO of CellSpring.  After only a few days in culture we saw up regulation of osteogenic markers and morphological changes. The bone structures became white and opaque, whereas normally micro tissues remain quite transparent to the naked eye, and after staining with Alizarin red we were barely able to transmit light through them in order to image the cells - this is something we have never seen before using our system.

Mutations of these genes cause death at the embryo stage. Many of them have counterparts in the human genome, so understanding why these genes are so vital could help prioritize human genes for study.  This is the first comprehensive survey of its kind, and it shows that one-third of the mouse protein-coding genome is essential to life,  said Kent Lloyd, professor of surgery at UC Davis and director of the Mouse Biology Program and the NIH-funded Knockout Mouse Project.  This begins to inform what may be happening in people.  The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, which includes UC Davis researchers, is generating and characterizing  knockout  mutations for all of the protein-coding genes in the mouse genome. The consortium aims to discover new functions for the roughly 20,000 genes mice share with humans, providing tools for investigating human disease. The new study reports the results of the first 1,751 genes characterized by the consortium, finding that nearly one-third are essential for life. These include 410 that are fully lethal when mutated, and an additional 198 for which fewer than half of the expected number of mutants were identified, meaning that only a few variations of the gene lead to viable offspring. Using high-resolution 3D imaging and automated, computational analysis of the images, the researchers established for each gene both the time of embryonic death and why the embryos died, shedding light on the function of these genes. Human counterparts are candidates for precision medicine Many of these genes have counterparts in the human genome, and these genes are thus strong candidates for undiagnosed human genetic conditions.  Where we don t know the cause of disease, they may not have a full knockout, but a variant that doesn t work quite right,  Lloyd said. The mouse data could help prioritize genes to study through the national Precision Medicine Initiative, he said.","Published: September 19, 2016"

Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health problem   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 2 million illnesses are caused in the U.S. each year by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resulting in 23,000 deaths. The study findings, published online in PLOS Biology, describe how two UT Southwestern research teams created a synthetic compound that blocks a bacterial pump used to expel antibiotics. Bacteria that use these  efflux pumps  and that are treated with the new compound become sensitive to antibiotics they were previously resistant to. The findings  potentially have huge implications for clinical infectious diseases,  said Dr. Trish Perl,  Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Professor of Internal Medicine, and holder of the Jay P. Sanford Professorship in Infectious Diseases at UT Southwestern.  In an era when antibiotic choices are increasingly limited because of resistance, and few new agents are being developed, this becomes a novel and exciting tool that needs to be explored.  The UTSW experiment focused on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacterial pathogens with genetically similar efflux pump complexes. E. coli belongs to a large family of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, which plays a major role in human disease and is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. This is the first time researchers have tailored one of these synthetic compounds, part of a class called PPMOs or peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, to target a specific efflux pump found in bacterial cell walls, said Dr. David Greenberg, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Microbiology at UT Southwestern and a senior author of the study. The PPMO compound itself doesn t kill the bacteria, he explained, but keeps it from expelling an antibiotic, allowing the drug to do its job.  This is just a different strategy,  Dr. Greenberg said.  There is a lot of interest in trying to develop new antibiotics, or antibiotics that act in new ways. The other way of thinking about this challenge is to try to make a resistant organism sensitive.  Despite the availability of many excellent antibiotics, bacteria are developing resistance to those most commonly used, forcing physicians to give higher doses or fall back to  last line of defense  drugs, said co-senior author Dr. Erdal Toprak, Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and in the Cecil H. and Ida Green Comprehensive Center for Molecular, Computational, and Systems Biology and a Southwestern Medical Foundation Scholar in Biomedical Research at UT Southwestern. To attack this problem, two UTSW labs with different focuses came together to seek a solution. Dr. Greenberg had been trying to create new antibiotics using PPMOs   also called anti-sense molecules because they can mimic DNA or RNA and bind to mRNA s genetic sequence like the other half of a zipper, blocking the bacterial machinery for building proteins. Meanwhile, Dr. Toprak s lab was using a device he had developed to study how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. About a year ago, his research team identified a mutation in E. coli that increased drug sensitivity by blocking an efflux pump complex called AcrAB-TolC. The two scientists and their labs then joined forces to create a PPMO that could target this important E. coli complex. In the study, they reported that a PPMO designed to prevent creation of the AcrA protein significantly increased the efficacy of antibiotics against E. coli in cell models   from two- to 40-fold. In fact, Dr. Toprak said, some antibiotics that are never used against E. coli because they were thought to be ineffective killed the bacteria, when used in conjunction with the AcrA-PPMO. The AcrA-PPMO also was effective against the human pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, since those bacteria contain the same efflux pump with a matching gene sequence, Dr. Greenberg said. The next step will be to study the effect of the AcrA-PPMO in animal models. The researchers also will study whether a PPMO could be effective against other extremely antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, he said. Co-lead authors of the study were Dilay Hazal Ayhan, a visiting researcher, and Yusuf Talha Tamer, a graduate student, both in the Toprak lab. Also contributing was Dr. Seth Daly, a postdoctoral researcher in Internal Medicine. This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas Endowed Scholars Program. Other contributing authors included two employees of Sarepta Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company that holds numerous patents on the methods of synthesis and use of PPMOs. Dr. Greenberg receives research support from Sarepta, holds numerous patents related to PPMOs, and receives royalties through a licensing agreement from these inventions.","Published: September 17, 2016"

See Also: Bug eyes: Tiny glasses confirm 3D vision in insects Amblyopia is the most common cause of permanent visual defects among children and is often a result of improper brain development due to deprivation during the ""critical period"" of vision development. In a previous study, Xu helped discover that a specific class of inhibitory neurons (parvalbumin-expressing neurons, or PV neurons) control the critical period of vision development. In this study, Xu and colleagues found that neuregulin-1 (NRG1) molecules modulate the activities of these neurons, thus outlining a new path for treatments that can restore normal vision in children who have had early deficits. As neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia appear to result from brain developmental defects during defined postnatal windows, the linkage of NRG1 signaling to critical growth periods provides important new insights.

The insects extend their midday siesta on long summer days. Researchers from the University of W rzburg have now found out what triggers this behavior. A miniature pair of eyelets also discovered in W rzburg in the late 80s plays a crucial role in this context. See Also: Fruit fly brains shed light on why we get more tired the later we stay up In 1989, the W rzburg biologists Alois Hofbauer and Erich Buchner reported a surprising finding in the journal Naturwissenschaften: They had identified a new pair of eyelets in drosophila unknown until then. The fruit fly was considered an important model organism for zoologists and geneticists even back then with scores of scientists showing an interest in the tiny insect. But they had all failed to detect the additional eyes no wonder given their microscopic size: Each eyelet consists of just four photoreceptor cells. In spite of this, the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets seem to play a major role in the life of drosophila. A study conducted by scientists from the University of W rzburg with colleagues from the University of Michigan and the University of Bristol has come to this conclusion. Drosophila's activity peaks in the morning and in the late afternoon and they rest during the hottest time of the day. The tiny sensory organs evidently influence when this midday siesta ends. ""On long summer days, they delay the onset of the afternoon activity phase,"" explains Professor Charlotte Helfrich-F rster from the University of W rzburg's Biocenter. The scientist has studied drosophila's circadian rhythms for years. In the current study, her research team has been able to show for the first time that the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets are wired to a clock neuron network in the flies' brain: Nerve fibres run directly from the eyelets to two groups of clock neurons. One of them is responsible for the morning activity whereas the other influences the evening activity. ""At daybreak, light falls onto the eyelets,"" Helfrich-Forster details. ""This light input triggers the production of the two neurotransmitters histamine and acetylcholine. We suppose that acetylcholine activates the neurons relevant for morning activity. At the same time, the histamine seems to indirectly inhibit the circadian clock for the evening peak phase thereby extending the phase of inactivity."" Hence, the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets are part of a complex network that governs drosophila's sleep/activity rhythm. Learn More: Scientists find what controls waking up and going to sleep Another reason why the findings are interesting is because the circadian clocks of animals have changed comparably little in the course of evolution. ""Mice, for example, have a neuronal clock network in their brains that shares many similarities with that of the fruit fly,"" Helfrich-F rster emphasises.

Adults with high prenatal exposure to methylmercury, which mainly comes from maternal consumption of fish with high mercury levels, did not experience the faster cognitive processing and better short term memory benefits of exercise that were seen in those with low prenatal methylmercury exposures. See Also: Shark fins & meat contain high levels of neurotoxins linked to Alzheimer's This is one of the first studies to examine how methylmercury exposure in the womb may affect cognitive function in adults. Mercury comes from industrial pollution in the air that falls into the water, where it turns into methylmercury and accumulates in fish. The scientists, based at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, suspect that prenatal exposure to methylmercury, known to have toxic effects on the developing brain and nervous system, may limit the ability of nervous system tissues to grow and develop in response to increased aerobic fitness. ""We know that neurodevelopment is a delicate process that is especially sensitive to methylmercury and other environmental toxins, but we are still discovering the lifelong ripple effects of these exposures,"" said Gwen Collman, PhD, director of the NIEHS Division of Extramural Research and Training. ""This research points to adult cognitive function as a new area of concern."" The 197 study participants are from the Faroe Islands, 200 miles (323 km) north of England, where fish is a major component of the diet. Their health has been followed since they were in the womb in the late 1980s. At age 22, this subset of the original 1,022 participants took part in a follow-up exam that included estimating the participants' VO2 max, or the rate at which they can use oxygen, which increases with aerobic fitness. Also, a range of cognitive tests were performed related to short-term memory, verbal comprehension and knowledge, psychomotor speed, visual processing, long-term storage and retrieval, and cognitive processing speed. Read Next: Lead exposure linked to ADHD in kids with genetic mutation Overall, the researchers found that higher VO2 max values were associated with better neurocognitive function, as expected based on prior research. Cognitive efficiency, which included cognitive processing speed and short term memory, benefitted the most from increased VO2 max. But when the researchers divided the participants into two groups based on the methylmercury levels in their mothers while they were pregnant, they found that these benefits were confined to the group with the lowest exposure. Participants with prenatal methylmercury levels in the bottom 67 percent, or levels of less than 35 micrograms per liter in umbilical cord blood, still demonstrated better cognitive efficiency with higher VO2 max. However, for participants with higher methylmercury levels, cognitive function did not improve as VO2 max increased. ""We know that aerobic exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but these findings suggest that early-life exposure to pollutants may reduce the potential benefits,"" added Collman.

Now a program developed at Case Western Reserve University has outperformed physicians on a more serious matter. The program was nearly twice as accurate as two neuroradiologists in determining whether abnormal tissue seen on magnetic resonance images (MRI) were dead brain cells caused by radiation, called radiation necrosis, or if brain cancer had returned. See Also: Revolutionary new probe zooms in on cancer cells The direct comparison is part of a feasibility study published in the American Journal of Neuroradiology. ""One of the biggest challenges with the evaluation of brain tumor treatment is distinguishing between the confounding effects of radiation and cancer recurrence,"" said Pallavi Tiwari, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and leader of the study. ""On an MRI, they look very similar."" But treatments for radiation necrosis and cancer recurrence are far different. Quick identification can help speed prognosis, therapy and improve patient outcomes, the researchers say. With further confirmation of its accuracy, radiologists using their expertise and the program may eliminate unnecessary and costly biopsies Tiwari said. Brain biopsies are currently the only definitive test but are highly invasive and risky, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. To develop the program, the researchers employed machine learning algorithms in conjunction with radiomics, the term used for features extracted from images using computer algorithms. The engineers, scientists and physicians trained the computer to identify radiomic features that discriminate between brain cancer and radiation necrosis, using routine follow-up MRI scans from 43 patients. The images were all from University Hospitals Case Medical Center. Learn More: Deadly dance observed between nerves and cancer cellsThe team then developed algorithms to find the most discriminating radiomic features, in this case, textures that can't be seen by simply eyeballing the images. ""What the algorithms see that the radiologists don't are the subtle differences in quantitative measurements of tumor heterogeneity and breakdown in microarchitecture on MRI, which are higher for tumor recurrence,"" said Tiwari, who was appointed to the Department of Biomedical Engineering by the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. More specifically, while the physicians use the intensity of pixels on MRI scans as a guide, the computer looks at the edges of each pixel, explained Anant Madabhushi, F. Alex Nason professor II of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve, and study co-author. ""If the edges all point to the same direction, the architecture is preserved,"" said Madabhushi, who also directs the Center of Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics at CWRU. ""If they point in different directions, the architecture is disrupted -- the entropy, or disorder, and heterogeneity are higher. "" In the direct comparison, two physicians and the computer program analyzed MRI scans from 15 patients from University of Texas Southwest Medical Center. One neuroradiologist diagnosed seven patients correctly, and the second physician correctly diagnosed eight patients. The computer program was correct on 12 of the 15.

However, an examination of various sub-groups showed that second-generation survivors whose parents were babies during the Holocaust are at higher risk of suffering from a more severe course of schizophrenia. See Also: Researchers identify signature of microbiomes associated with schizophrenia ""Likely these are transmitted from the parental environment to the child"" commented Prof. Stephen Levine, the lead author of the study. The study was undertaken by Prof. Stephen Levine and Prof. Itzhak Levav of the Department of Community Mental Health at the University of Haifa, together with Ms. Inna Pugachova, Ms. Rinat Yoffe, and Ms. Yifat Becher of the Ministry of Health. The study was based on information on 51,233 individuals who immigrated to Israel through 1966, and was made possible thanks to the cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health, with funds from Israel Science Foundation and published in Schizophrenia Research. The research population included individuals who experienced the Holocaust directly, while the comparison group comprised of individuals who immigrated to Israel before the Holocaust began in their respective country of origin. All the second-generation subjects were born between 1948 and 1989, and were followed through 2014 to ascertain whether or not they suffered from schizophrenia. Related: Powerful genetic regulator identified as risk factor for schizophreniaThe question of the impact of exposure to the Holocaust among second-generation survivors is the subject of disagreement among researchers. Clinic-based studies have found that trauma increases psychopathology in the offspring of Holocaust survivors, while community based studies have found that there is no such effect among adult s, as noted by Levav and collaborators in two large representative samples in Israel The researchers sought to examine whether parental Holocaust exposure is associated with schizophrenia among second-generation survivors. The good news is that the association was not significant. However, a more specific inquiry showed that offspring to mothers with Holocaust exposures in the womb only were 1.7 times more likely to have a more severe course of the disorder. Similarly, offspring to mothers exposed to the Holocaust in the in the womb and thereafter were 1.5 more likely to have a more severe course than persons not exposed. Among offspring to fathers exposed in the womb and thereafter were 1.5 times, and those whose fathers exposed at ages 1-2 had offspring with similar risk to have a worse course of the disorder than persons not exposed.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/arms-race-with-a-superbug-187060,Arms Race with a Superbug Scientists have discovered that increased risk of superbug infection can be directly casued by immune system response to invading bacteria  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.If you get pneumonia, or even an infected cut, your body becomes a war zone. And as the immune system battles invading bacteria, the outcome of that war may hinge on a microscopic arms race based on an essential element: iron. Scientists from the University of Michigan Medical School say they have figured out how that race for iron actually increases the risk we face from one of our most dangerous microscopic foes, Klebsiella pneumoniae. They made the discovery in mice with pneumonia. K. pneumoniae has already figured out how to overcome our best defenses   including, in some cases, all our most powerful antibiotics. It s the third-most-common cause of infections that arise in hospitalized patients, and causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, wound infections and bloodstream infections. In its most drug-resistant form, it s considered one of the carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE   so called ""nightmare bacteria"". The new findings could aid the search for drugs to fight it, and other  superbugs . Iron scavenging   and more In a new paper in the journal mBio, the team led by Michael Bachman, M.D., Ph.D. report what happens after the bacteria send out tiny iron-scavenging molecules. Called siderophores, those molecules have long been thought of as a way for bacteria to gather a precious element needed to grow and reproduce, by attaching to iron and stealing it from us. Siderophores from K. pneumoniae are hundreds of times more powerful at grabbing iron than the proteins that our own bodies produce. What s more, the bacteria produce a kind of siderophore that our defense systems can t neutralize. But Bachman and his colleagues show that bacterial siderophores do much more than just grab iron. Their experiments show that K. pneumoniae actually use the molecules to help them invade the rest of the body beyond their initial point of entry, and to bring on inflammation caused by our own immune system.  This is a bacterium that has evolved new ways to get iron, and it turns out that the mechanism it uses also causes cellular stress during infections,  says Bachman, an assistant professor of pathology at U-M.  That response triggers an immune response that tells our bodies to fight the infection, but it also activates a mechanism that allows bacteria to escape and travel to the rest of the body.  That mechanism, a protein called Hif-1alpha, normally helps our bodies respond to low oxygen or low iron. But when K. pneumoniae siderophores activate it, it worsens the infection. Exactly how is still a mystery. Bachman sees the effects of K. pneumoniae on patients in his work as a clinical microbiologist at the U-M Health System, where he s associate director of clinical microbiology. That motivates him to study it in the lab, though he notes that it s too early to say exactly how the discovery could be used to help patients. One promising route could be to develop strategies to prevent the bacteria from sending out siderophores in the first place -- or to use the siderophores to bring antibiotics back into bacterial cells. Or, it may even be possible to create a vaccine based on siderophores to teach the immune system to attack them as invaders. Meanwhile, he and others at U-M including Microbiology & Immunology chair Harry Mobley, Ph.D., are pursuing a broader goal through U-M s Host Microbiome Initiative. Using an advanced genetic technique called transposon sequencing, they re working to figure out which genes K. pneumoniae and other superbugs absolutely need in order to cause infections. How they did it To figure out the double role that siderophores play in a K. pneumoniae infection, Bachman and his colleagues had to figure out how to create bacteria that would not reproduce, while still producing siderophores. They were able to mutate bacteria in a way that kept iron-laden siderophores from getting back into the bacterial cells and promoting growth. That way, the number of bacteria in a mouse s body stayed the same, but the researchers could study what the siderophores did. They expected that if the siderophores grabbed enough iron from the mouse s lung tissue and robbed the mouse an essential element, the mouse s cells would respond.. Indeed, they found that the mouse immune system was triggered directly by the siderophores, causing the release of molecules called cytokines that attract infection-fighting cells and cause inflammation as a result. The activation of Hif-1alpha was part of this   because the mouse cells sensed that iron supply was low. So, the team figured out how to eliminate Hif-1alpha in the cells lining the mouse lungs   and showed that in these mice, most of the bacteria couldn t escape from the lungs to the spleen. But in mice that made Hif-1alpha, more K. pneumoniae bacteria spread to the rest of the body, making the infection worse.   This work provides us with motivation to target the production of siderophores, rather than just the uptake of them,  says Bachman.  Now that we know that the bacteria cause cellular stress just by secreting them, we may be able to prevent these effects if we neutralize them. ","Published: September 16, 2016"

It appears that antibodies can target these holes, which are scattered in HIV s protective sugar or  glycan  shield, and the question is now whether these holes can be exploited to induce protective antibodies.  It s important now to evaluate future vaccine candidates to more rapidly understand the immune response they induce to particular glycan holes and learn from it,  said TSRI Professor Dennis R. Burton, who is also scientific director of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Neutralizing Antibody Center and of the National Institutes of Health s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID) at TSRI. The study, published recently in the journal Cell Reports, was co-led by Burton, TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward, also of CHAVI-ID, and Rogier W. Sanders of the University of Amsterdam and Cornell University. A Clue to Stopping HIV Every virus has a signature structure, like the architecture of a building. By solving these structures, scientists can put together a blueprint showing where HIV is vulnerable to infection-blocking antibodies. In the 1990s, scientists discovered that HIV can have random holes in its protective outer shell of glycan molecules. Until now, however, scientists weren t sure if antibodies could recognize and target these holes. Researchers at Cornell and TSRI had previously designed a stabilized version of an important HIV protein, called the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer, to prompt rabbit models to produce antibodies against the virus. In the new study, the plan was to reveal HIV s vulnerabilities by examining where the antibodies bound the virus.  From work on HIV-positive individuals, we knew that the best way to understand an antibody response is to isolate the individual antibodies and study them in detail,  said Laura McCoy, a TSRI, IAVI and CHAVI-ID researcher now at University College London, who served as co-first author of the study with TSRI Senior Research Associate Gabriel Ozorowski, also of TSRI and CHAVI-ID, and Marit J. van Gils of the University of Amsterdam. To their surprise, when the researchers examined the rabbits  antibodies, they found three rabbits had produced antibodies that targeted the same hole in Env. It appeared that antibodies could indeed target holes in the glycan shield.  This opened up a whole new concept,  said Ozorowski. If the immune system was targeting this hole preferring it to other vulnerable spots on Env maybe holes would be especially important in designing vaccine candidates. Toward Better Antibodies By analyzing the genetic sequences of thousands of strains of HIV, the researchers found that 89 percent of strains appear to have a targetable hole in the Env. The virus has a defense mechanism though it quickly mutates to fill in these gaps. The researchers speculate that future vaccines might prompt the immune system to create antibodies to target holes.  Targeting a hole could help the immune system get its foot in the door,  Ozorowski said. Alternatively, the holes may prove a distraction and should be filled in so the immune system can focus on targeting better sites for neutralizing the virus. Burton said researchers must investigate the different possibilities, but he emphasized that this new understanding of glycan holes could help researchers narrow down the field of molecules needed in potential HIV vaccines. Ward added that this same method of  rational  vaccine design where researchers use a virus s precise molecular details to prompt the immune system to produce specific antibodies can also be applied to efforts to fight other viruses, such as influenza and Ebola viruses.","Published: September 16, 2016"

The drug a mood stabilizer called valproate is commonly prescribed to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, though its mechanism of action is poorly understood and only some patients respond to the treatment. Few options currently exist for treating the debilitating  negative  symptoms of severe psychiatric disorders, which include slowed movement, blunted affect, and social withdrawal. (Antipsychotic medications are used to treat hallucinations, delusions, and other  positive  symptoms of schizophrenia). The authors conclude that valproate may be effective for treating negative symptoms in psychiatric patients with two copies of the  Val  variant of the COMT gene, which breaks down dopamine in the brain. In the roughly 40 percent of patients with this genotype, higher levels of proline (a neuromodulator that is increased by valproate), correlated with fewer negative symptoms. In patients who have a  Met  variant of COMT, rising levels of proline appeared to do the exact opposite: These patients had more or worse negative symptoms, and the symptoms did not improve with valproate. The results were published on Sept. 13 in Translational Psychiatry by Catherine Clelland, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and cell biology (in the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer s Disease and the Aging Brain) at CUMC, and colleagues at Columbia, the Nathan S. Kline Institute, and NYU School of Medicine. Previous studies have demonstrated an interaction between elevated blood levels of proline a modulator of neurotransmitters that, in higher amounts, is associated with psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia and a gene called COMT, which makes an enzyme that helps maintain normal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. One version of the enzyme contains the amino acid methionine (Met), while another type contains valine (Val). People may inherit one copy of each type (Val/Met) or two copies of the type (Val/Val or Met/Met). Additional studies have suggested that COMT Val/Val has greater enzymatic activity, increasing its ability to lower dopamine levels in the brain. In this study, the researchers compared the severity of negative symptoms and proline levels in 95 hospitalized schizophrenia patients with variants of the COMT gene. In patients with COMT Val/Val, symptom severity decreased as proline levels rose. In contrast, higher proline levels were associated with greater negative symptom severity in patients with the Met/Met gene. Among those patients who were being treated with valproate (approximately one-third of the schizophrenia patients), negative symptoms were more severe in those with the Met/Met gene than in those with the Val/Val gene. The researchers also evaluated negative symptoms in 43 patients with bipolar disorder, about half of whom were treated with valproate. After one week of treatment, negative symptoms decreased for those with the Val/Val genotype, while symptoms increased or remained the same for those with the Met/Met genotype.  While longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results, this study suggests that boosting proline levels in patients with the Val/Val gene may help address negative symptoms, whereas increasing proline in patients with the Met/Met gene may have the opposite effect,  said Dr. Clelland.  This information may help to determine which patients may be most likely to benefit from treatment with mood stabilizers such as valproate that are known to modulate proline levels.

The AiM Institute brings together scientists, technologies and expertise across quantitative, biological, chemistry and translational sciences to target three key therapeutic areas: Immuno-dementia, immuno-oncology and auto-immune indications.    In immuno-dementia, AiM is studying the subset of dementia patients with immune-driven pathology, targeting immune dysfunction and enhancing internal neuroimmune mechanisms identified by human genetics to develop novel targeted treatments for Alzheimer's disease and dementia;    In immununo-oncology, as the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a viable target to prevent and treat cancer tumor growth, AiM is utilizing its expertise in immune cell biology, genomics and small molecules to discover novel precision immunotherapies targeting myeloid lineage cells. One such therapy, E7046, is a first-in-class orally active EP4 receptor antagonist currently under clinical development; and    AiM is also building on Eisai's strengths in targeting toll-like receptors and prostaglandins with small molecules to prosecute genetically validated therapeutic targets for auto-immune indications, including for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While the opportunity provided by human genetics to disrupt the drug discovery process is well established, realizing this potential has been hampered by conventional biopharma models structured with several siloed research groups ""supporting"" one another. By contrast, the AiM Institute is premised upon innovation without borders, and the ownership of a focused portfolio by a dedicated and multi-disciplinary group of scientists with a single mission: realizing a new paradigm in human biology driven drug discovery. ""The AiM Institute combines the focus, agility and innovative culture of a 90-person biotech-like organization with Eisai's operational expertise and experience in bringing new medicines to patients,"" said Nadeem Sarwar, president of the Eisai AiM Institute To achieve its mission, AiM has established and will continue to seek collaborations and strategic alliances with a broad spectrum of external scientific partners who complement its internal scientific expertise. Current AiM collaborations are focused on human genetics, functional genomics, assay development, structural biology, computational chemistry, library synthesis, compound screening, and translational biomarkers. In addition, AiM scientists are proactively involved in several ""pre-competitive"" research consortia, and are actively encouraged to contribute data to collaborations as well as publish research findings. To enable such collaboration, AiM has initiated a variety of flexible, innovative collaborative agreements concentrated on accelerating drug discovery. To develop and accelerate its focused discovery portfolio, AiM is integrating multidisciplinary scientists within a single and dedicated research facility. The close scientific integration of AiM scientists enables the initiation of translational and biomarker-related research from project inception, providing a more seamless transition from preclinical discovery to clinical development.  The AiM Institute is organized around five scientific engines:   The Human Biology & Data Sciences Engine focuses on accessing, analyzing, integrating, interpreting and applying human biology data from several sources for the discovery and validation of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers;    The Integrated Biology Engine validates therapeutic concepts by evaluating genetic variants in human cell systems and in vivo disease models to understand how genetic variation changes the function of targets to cause disease. This engine's end goal is to generate an extensive preclinical package for an investigational new drug (IND) application filing, including preclinical proof-of-concept and translational biomarkers for dose-setting and patient selection;    The Target Modulation Engine serves as the interface between chemistry and biology, connecting novel therapeutic targets with bioactive compounds. This engine focuses on accelerating drug discovery for human biology validated targets by developing hypotheses for target modulation mechanisms; experiment-supported structural biology; creation of target specific assays; selection of flexible, strategic screening approaches; and providing unique compound collections;    The Integrated Chemistry Engine utilizes combined expertise in medicinal, synthetic, screening, structural, translational, and platform chemistry to create innovative solutions for human biology validated targets. Building upon Eisai's success in structurally complex fully synthetic small molecule drugs, this engine will explore previously inaccessible areas of complex molecular spaces to address novel and previously undruggable targets; and    The Imaging Center of Excellence provides imaging expertise and in vivo applications to provide decision-making experimental data, strategies and solutions for global discovery and translational research. This engine applies MRI, CT, SPECT, and PET scanning, as well as radiochemistry solutions for neuroscience, oncology, immunology and drug safety. ","Published: September 16, 2016"

For the final re-evaluation, EFSA s experts concluded that available data on titanium dioxide (E 171) in food do not indicate health concerns for consumers. But they recommended new studies be carried out to fill data gaps on possible effects on the reproductive system, which could enable them to set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Over the past seven years, EFSA s Panel on Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) has re-assessed the safety of 41 food colours, taking into account all available scientific studies and data. Where possible, the Panel has established or updated an ADI for each substance. Ruud Woutersen, Vice-Chair of the ANS Panel, said:  The completion of the food colour re-evaluations is an important milestone for EFSA, but our work does not stop here. There are still a considerable number of other food additives to be re-evaluated by 2020. And, of course, we are prepared to respond to any additional requests from the European Commission to review colours and other additives in the light of newly available scientific information.  Available toxicological data on titanium dioxide do not indicate adverse effects via oral ingestion. While the ANS Panel was unable to set an ADI for titanium dioxide because of data limitations, using the margin of safety approach, they concluded that dietary exposure does not pose health concerns. The experts highlighted, however, the need for new research to fill data gaps on potential effects of titanium dioxide on the reproductive system. What is titanium dioxide? Titanium dioxide is a pigment commonly used to provide a cloudy effect and white background colour. Its main food uses are in confectionery, bakery and sauces but it is also found in cosmetics and has many industrial uses. Following ingestion, most titanium dioxide passes through the body unchanged in the faeces but a small amount (maximum 0.1%) can be absorbed by the gut and distributed to various organs. Food-grade titanium dioxide is not considered a nanomaterial under the current European Commission Recommendation on the definition of nanomaterial but it may contain up to 3.2% nanoparticles (less than 100 nanometres in size) by weight. EFSA s experts, therefore, evaluated studies with food-grade and non-food-grade (including nano-sized) titanium dioxide. A small number of studies with some non-food grade titanium dioxide suggest possible adverse effects on the reproductive system. What is the margin of safety? In the food additives area, when there are insufficient data for establishing an ADI, risk assessors calculate a margin of safety to determine whether current exposure might be of potential concern. Generally, a margin of safety of 100 or more is not considered to be a concern for public health. In the most realistic scenario for food-grade titanium dioxide, the margin of safety for high-consuming children (the most exposed population) would be 150, but for most scenarios the margins were several times higher. More data needed Additional testing on food-grade titanium dioxide   an extended 90-day study or a multi-generation or extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study according to current OECD guidelines   would help to clarify possible reproductive effects and provide more comprehensive data for deriving an ADI.","Published: September 16, 2016"

In a description of the work, published online Sept. 12 in the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, they express hope that the tests in anesthetized dogs and pigs are a step toward human trials of a technique to treat Parkinson s disease, stroke, and other brain damaging disorders.  Although stem cell-based therapies seem very promising, we ve seen many clinical trials fail. In our view, what s needed are tools to precisely target and deliver stem cells to larger areas of the brain,  says Piotr Walczak, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine s Institute for Cell Engineering. The therapeutic promise of human stem cells is derived from their ability to develop into any kind of cell and, in theory, regenerate injured or diseased tissues ranging from the insulin-making islet cells of the pancreas that are lost in type 1 diabetes to the dopamine-producing brain cells that die off in Parkinson s disease. Ten years ago, Shinya Yamanaka s research group in Japan raised hopes further when it developed a technique for  resetting  mature cells, such as skin cells, to become so-called induced pluripotent stem cells. That gave researchers an alternative to embryonic stem cells that could allow the creation of therapeutic stem cells that matched the genetic makeup of each patient, greatly reducing the chances of cell rejection after they were infused or transplanted. But while induced pluripotent stem cells have enabled great strides forward in research, Walczak says they are not yet approved for any treatment, and barriers to success remain. In a bid to address once such barrier   how to get the cells exactly where needed and no place else   Walczak and his colleague Miroslaw Janowski, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of radiology, sought a way around strategies that require physicians to puncture patients  skulls or inject them intravenously. The former, Walczak says, is not only unpleasant, but also only allows delivery of stem cells to one limited place in the brain. In contrast, injecting cells intravenously scatters the cells throughout the body, with few likely to land where they re most needed, says Walczak.  Our idea was to do something in between,  says Janowski, using intra-arterial injection, which involves threading a catheter, or hollow tube, into a blood vessel, usually in a leg, and guiding it to a vessel in a hard-to-reach spot like the brain. The technique currently is used mainly to repair large vessels in the brain, says Janowski, but the research team hoped it might also be used to get stem cells to the exact place where they were needed. To do that, they would need a way of monitoring the catheter placement and movement of implanted cells in real time. Walczak and Janowski teamed with colleagues including Monica Pearl, M.D., an associate professor of radiology practicing in the Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, who specializes in intra-arterial procedures. Usually the procedure is performed using an X-ray image as a guide, but that approach ruled out watching injected stem cells  movements and making adjustments in real time. In their experiments, after placing the catheter under X-ray guidance, they transferred anesthetized dog and pig subjects to an MRI machine, where images were taken every few seconds throughout the procedure. Once the catheter was in the brain, Pearl pre-injected small amounts of a harmless contrast agent that included iron oxide and could be detected on the MRI.  By using MRI to see in real time where the contrast agent went, we could predict where injected stem cells would go and make adjustments to the catheter placement, if needed,  says Janowski.  It s like having GPS guidance in your car to help you stay on the right route, instead of only finding out you re lost when you arrive at the wrong place.  adds Jeff Bulte, Ph.D., a professor of radiology who participated in the study. The team then injected both small stem cells (glial progenitor cells from the brain) and large mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow into the animals under MRI, and found that in both cases, the pre-injected contrast agent and MRI allowed them to accurately predict where the cells would end up. They could also tell whether clumps of cells were forming in arteries and, if so, possibly intervene to avoid letting the clumps grow large enough to cut off blood flow and pose a danger.  If further research confirms our progress, we think this procedure could be a big step forward in precision medicine, allowing doctors to deliver stem cells or medications exactly where they re needed for each patient,  says Walczak. The research team is planning to test the procedure in animals as a treatment for stroke and cancer, delivering both medications and stem cells while the catheter is in place.","Published: September 16, 2016"

But a handful of cancers appear to favor fat over sugar, a propensity that has long mystified scientists. Now, a study from Harvard Medical School reveals how certain tumors develop a taste for fat as their life-sustaining fuel. The findings, published Sept. 15 in Molecular Cell, show how a signaling pathway that normally keeps fat-burning in check goes awry in some cancers, revving up fat consumption and fueling tumor growth.   Specifically, the study found that a protein called prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) appears to be a key regulator of the delicate balance inside cells that dampens fat- burning. That protein, the research shows, is abnormally low in certain forms of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer a finding that can help lay the groundwork for development of therapies that work by starving tumors of their fuel.  This really represents a new frontier in looking at the metabolism of cancer,  said Marcia Haigis, HMS associate professor of cell biology and senior author of the paper.  Understanding the molecular handle of this pathway is the first step toward translating the basic work into therapy.  Biologists have known for some time that when cells run low on nutrients, they switch from sugar to fat as their fuel source to sustain function.   When cells have low energy, the protein AMPK targets an enzyme, ACC, to activate fat oxidation, which helps cells burn fats to make energy. But when cells have enough resources, they seek to maintain energy balance. Even in the face of stress, cells fight to keep this state known as homeostasis. The scientists were searching for precisely how cells turn off fat oxidation. Looking for possible players involved in this delicate balance, the team homed in on the protein PHD3. A handful of recent studies had suggested that PHD3 plays a part in cell metabolism but until now its precise role has remained unclear. In a series of experiments, the HMS team showed that PHD3 suppressed fat-burning by chemically modifying and activating ACC2 a version of the same enzyme responsible for keeping cellular fat-burning in check. To determine PHD3 s role in cancer, the team combed through scores of databases of all human cancers. Sugar-craving tumors would have high levels of this fat-burning blocker, to keep sweet-powered energy flowing, the researchers surmised. On the other hand, tumors that relied on fat for their energy would show low levels of PHD3. Two forms of cancer acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer had by far the lowest PHD3 levels, the analysis showed. To test their hypothesis that these particular cancers needed fats to survive and that PHD3 was a key regulator in the fat-burning process fueling tumor growth, the researchers restored to normal the levels of PHD3 in a line of cancer cells and in mice. The tumors not only stopped growing, they died.  That was really exciting,  Haigis said.  We ve altered a lot of metabolic pathways in cancer, and this is one of the few pathways we ve modulated where we really see the tumors die. They are so dependent on fat oxidation that they die.  Before this discovery can move ahead to the clinic, Haigis said, more basic research needs to be done, both in animal models and in cancer cells taken from patients, to understand why certain tumors depend on fat.  What do fats provide to tumors that other fuels don t? That s one open question, and this is only the first chapter in the story. ","Published: September 16, 2016"

The main findings of the doctoral research of Eliane Deschrijver of Ghent University, which are now published, show that individuals with ASD may have difficulties to determine which tactile sensations belong to the action of someone else. Many individuals with ASD are over- or undersensitive to sensory information. Some feel overwhelmed by busy environments such as supermarkets, others are less sensitive to pain, or dislike being touched. See Also: Neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations Large-scale queries in the scientific literature had reported already that the severity of daily social difficulties of individuals with ASD is strongly related to the extent to which they are sensitive to touch, more so than to the extent to which they show visual or auditory sensitivities. To determine why this is the case, Deschrijver and her colleagues investigated how the brain of individuals with and without ASD uses own touch to understand touch sensations in the actions of others. Prof. Dr. Marcel Brass clarifies: ""We think that the human brain uses the own sense of touch to distinguish one's self from others: When I perform an action that leads to a tactile sensation, for instance by making a grasping movement, I expect to feel a tactile sensation that corresponds to this. If my own touch tells me something else, the tactile sensation will probably belong to the other person, and not to me. The brain can thus effectively understand others by signaling tactile sensations that do not correspond to the own sense of touch."" Don't Miss: New findings on how brain handles tactile sensations In a series of experiments with electro-encephalography (EEG), the scientists showed that the brain activity of adults with ASD differs from that of adults without ASD while processing touch. The research showed that the human brain of individuals without ASD indicated very quickly when a tactile sensation does not correspond to the own sense of touch. This means that the human brain is able to signal that a tactile sensation of a finger that touches a surface does not correspond to own touch. This process occured otherwise in the brain of adults with ASD however. Their brain signaled to a much lesser extent when the external touch sensation did not correspond to their own touch. Those individuals that experienced stronger sensory difficulties showed a stronger disturbance of the neural process, while they were also the ones that experienced more severe social difficulties. ""It is to my knowledge the first time that a relationship could be identified between the way individuals with ASD process tactile information in their brain, and their daily social difficulties. The findings can yield a novel and crucial link between sensory and social difficulties within the autism spectrum,"" concludes Deschrijver. Read Next: Paying attention makes touch-sensing brain cells fire rapidly and in sync ""These findings primarily lead to a better understanding of the complex disorder, and of associated difficulties.

Interestingly, in mice that have no dopamine D2 receptor, YHS effect is weakened in neuropathic pain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitters that when released from nerve cells to send signals to other nerves. It is known to be involved in reward but studies have also shown that dopamine may play a role in maintaining chronic pain, and that removing dopamine-containing cells can reduce this pain.

Now a team of scientists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) has shed light on how the needs of the body affect the way the brain processes visual food cues. In two newly-published studies, the researchers examined with unprecedented resolution the brain circuits responsible for the differences in the way the brain responds to visual food cues during hunger versus satiety. See Also: Research indicates food craving is  hard-wired  in the brain ""Our goal is to understand how specific brain circuits bias attention to food cues, as these biases are powerful drivers of food consumption,"" said corresponding author Mark L. Andermann, PhD, of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at BIDMC and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Ideally, specific cell types within these circuits could be targeted in order to shift attention away from unhealthy cues such as high-calorie food cues. We hope this research will provide strategies to develop better therapies not cures to help people help themselves get better."" In a study published in the journal Neuron, co-first authors Christian Burgess, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow; Rohan Ramesh, a graduate student, and colleagues in Andermann's lab recorded images of brain activity in mice across different states of hunger and satiety. Mice were trained to discriminate among three visual cues associated with a high-calorie liquid treat, a bitter liquid or nothing at all. In food-restricted mice, just being shown the visual cue associated with the liquid treat provoked a strong response in sets of neurons in three different brain areas. When these same mice were tested after a meal, the same food cue produced a decreased response in the neurons in a subset of these same brain areas. The scientists used this information to map the circuitry controlling motivation-dependent processing of sensory responses. ""Visual information about food cues is processed in sequential stages. We found that later stages of visual processing vary when the mouse is hungry versus sated, while the earlier stages are less state-dependent,"" Andermann said. ""This turns out to be very similar to the situation in humans. We hope this new model that we've developed can be used to study the circuitry underpinning the brain's responses to food cues in health and in obesity."" Specifically, the team's findings suggest that neurons in two regions of the brain the postrhinal association cortex and the lateral amygdala help integrate information about external food cues and hunger state. The scientists suggest this same brain circuitry could be involved in integrating other motivational drive states such as thirst. In experiments published in Current Biology, graduate student Nick Jikomes and colleagues in Andermann's lab investigated how natural and artificially-induced hunger affects food-seeking behavior, even in threatening contexts. Mice were placed in an arena where they had been trained to seek food after seeing visual cues associated with either a food reward or a mild shock to the feet. Researchers compared the behavior of well-fed mice to that of mice that had been on a restricted diet for 24 hours. Food-restricted mice avoided shocks much less frequently than fed mice, continuing to seek food even after being shown the visual cue associated with shock. That is, the motivation to eat overpowered the tendency to avoid threats. Conversely, fed mice prioritized avoiding shocks over seeking more food. The researchers then used a technique called optogenetics to stimulate specific neurons the agouti-related peptide neurons (AgRP) known to induce food consumption in sated mice. When AgRP neurons were stimulated in sated mice well before being placed into the experimental arena, the animals behaved like naturally hungry mice, as expected. However, when mice were placed in the threatening arena prior to activation of AgRP neurons, mice behaved more similarly to sated animals, prioritizing shock avoidance over seeking food.

An international team led by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and co-organized by BRI, recently documented widespread mercury contamination in air, soil, sediment, plants, fish, and wildlife at various levels across this region. They evaluated potential risk from mercury to human, fish, and wildlife heath, and examined resource management activities that influence this risk.  Mercury is widespread in the environment, and under certain conditions poses a substantial threat to environmental health and natural resource conservation,  says Collin Eagles-Smith, Ph.D., USGS ecologist and team lead.  The research team gathered decades of mercury data to examine patterns of mercury and methylmercury in numerous components of the western landscape. The results show where mercury occurs in western North America, how it moves through the environment, and the processes that influence its movement and transfer to aquatic food chains.  This integrated effort provides critical information on mercury pathways to humans and wildlife that government regulators, lawmakers, and the public can use to make decisions,  says David Evers, Ph.D., executive director and chief scientist of Biodiversity Research Institute and co-organizer of the project.  The Western mercury synthesis builds upon our Northeastern and Great Lakes regional efforts through which we collected and analyzed environmental mercury data that were often separated by sample type.  The initiative for the western region of the continent continues BRI s efforts to assess environmental mercury deposition across North America in the Institute s series of studies called Mercury Connections. Complete findings for the Western North America Mercury Synthesis (the Western Synthesis) have been published in a 2016 special issue of Science of The Total Environment: Mercury in Western North America Spatiotemporal Patterns, Biogeochemistry, Bioaccumulation, and Risks. Dr. Evers is co-author on five out of the 17 papers published in this Virtual Special Issue (available only online). All of the papers will also be published in the October issue of the journal.  Summary of Key Findings and Implications (related to fish and wildlife) include:   Methylmercury contamination in fish and birds is common in many areas throughout western North America, and large-scale ecological attributes, such as climate and land cover, are important factors influencing mercury contamination and availability to animals.   Fish and birds in many areas were found to have mercury concentrations above levels associated with toxicity.   Patterns of methylmercury, the most toxic form of mercury, exposure in fish and wildlife across western North America do not overlap with patterns of inorganic mercury on the landscape, indicating a disconnect between inorganic mercury distribution and exposure in fish and wildlife   Land and water management activities can strongly influence how methylmercury is created and transferred to fish, wildlife, and humans.Effective management of environmental health risks associated with mercury goes beyond controlling sources of inorganic mercury, and would be improved with tools for controlling the production of methylmercury and its introduction to animal and human food sources The Western Synthesis results suggest that effective management of environmental health risks associated with mercury goes beyond controlling sources of inorganic mercury, and could be improved by development of tools to control the production of methylmercury and its bioaccumulation through the food web, ultimately affecting animals and humans.","Published: September 15, 2016"

Increasingly, artificial intelligence is helping to ""read"" this data as well, highlighting similarities between datasets that scientists might miss. For the past 15 years, the big data techniques pioneered by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have been revolutionizing biomedical research. On Sept. 6, 2016, JPL and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, renewed a research partnership through 2021, extending the development of data science that originated in space exploration and is now supporting new cancer discoveries. The NCI-supported Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is a consortium of biomedical investigators who share anonymized data on cancer biomarkers, chemical or genetic signatures related to specific cancers. Their goal is to pool all their research data into a single, searchable network, with the goal of translating their collective work into techniques for early diagnosis of cancer or cancer risk. In the time they've worked together, JPL and EDRN's efforts have led to the discovery of six new Food and Drug Administration-approved cancer biomarkers and nine biomarkers approved for use in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments labs. The FDA has approved each of these biomarkers for use in cancer research and diagnosis. These agency-approved biomarkers have been used in more than 1 million patient diagnostic tests worldwide. ""After the founding of EDRN in 2000, the network needed expertise to take data from multiple studies on cancer biomarkers and create a single, searchable network of research findings for scientists,"" said Sudhir Srivastava, chief of NCI's Cancer Biomarkers Research Group and head of EDRN. JPL had decades of experience doing similar work for NASA, where spacecraft transmit hundreds of petabytes of data to be coded, stored and distributed to scientists across the globe. Dan Crichton, the head of JPL's Center for Data Science and Technology, a joint initiative with Caltech in Pasadena, California, helped establish a JPL-based informatics center dedicated to supporting EDRN's big data efforts. In the renewed partnership, JPL is expanding its data science efforts to research and applying technologies for additional NCI-funded programs. Those programs include EDRN, the Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions, and the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research initiative. ""From a NASA standpoint, there are significant opportunities to develop new data science capabilities that can support both the mission of exploring space and cancer research using common methodological approaches,"" Crichton said. ""We have a great opportunity to perfect those techniques and grow JPL's data science technologies, while serving our nation. Crichton said JPL has led the way when it comes to taking data from raw observations to scientific conclusions. One example: JPL often deals with measurements from a variety of sensors -- say, cameras and mass spectrometers. Both can be used to study a star, planet or similar target object. But it takes special software to recognize that readings from very different instruments relate to one another. There's a similar problem in cancer research, where readings from different biomedical tests or instruments require correlation with one another. For that to happen, data have to be standardized, and algorithms must be ""taught"" to know what they're looking for. Since the time of its founding, EDRN's major challenge has been access. Research centers all over the United States had large numbers of biomarker specimens, but each had its own way of labeling, storing and sharing their datasets. Ten sites may have high-quality specimens for study, but if their common data elements -- age of patient, cancer type and other characteristics - aren't listed uniformly, they can't be studied as a whole. ""We didn't know if they were early-stage or late-stage specimens, or if any level of treatment had been tried,"" Srivastava said. ""And JPL told us, 'We do this type of thing all the time! That's how we manage our Planetary Data System.'"" As the network has developed, it has added members from dozens of institutions, including Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School's Massachusetts General Hospital; Stanford's NIST Genome-Scale Measurements Group; University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center; and numerous others. Christos Patriotis, program director at NCI's Cancer Biomarkers Research Group, said the network's members now include international researchers from the U.K., China, Japan, Australia, Israel and Chile. ""The more we expand, the more data we integrate,"" Patriotis said. ""Instead of being silos, now our partners can integrate their findings. Each system can speak to the others."" As JPL and NCI's collaboration advances, next steps include image recognition technology, such as helping EDRN archive images of cancer specimens. Those images could be analyzed by computer vision, which is currently used to spot similarities in star clusters and other astrophysics research. In the near future, Crichton said, machine learning algorithms could compare a CT scan with an archive of similar images, searching for early signs of cancer based on a patient's age, ethnic background and other demographics. ""As we develop more automated methods for detecting and classifying features in images, we see great opportunities for enhancing data discovery,"" Crichton said. ""We have examples where algorithms for detection of features in astronomy images have been transferred to biology and vice-versa.""","Published: September 15, 2016"

Recent studies have shown that some of these bacteria may influence, for better or worse, human diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. As scientists have learned more about these bacteria, many have raised the possibility that manipulating these populations, known collectively as the microbiome, could improve human health. Looking toward that future, a team of MIT scientists has developed a strategy for delivering large numbers of beneficial bacterial to the human gut.  Once the microbiome is better understood, we can use this delivery platform to target certain areas and introduce certain species there,  says Ana Jaklenec, a research scientist at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and one of the senior authors of a paper describing this approach in the Sept. 12 issue of the journal Advanced Materials. Jaklenec and colleagues developed a way to coat bacteria with polymer layers that protect them from the acids and bile salts found in the digestive tract. When the microbes reach the intestine, they attach to the intestinal lining and begin reproducing.  The bacteria are delivered and they adhere to the intestinal wall, where they survive much better than noncoated bacteria,  says Koch Institute postdoc Aaron Anselmo, the paper s first author. Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, is also a senior author of the paper. Other authors are postdoc Kevin McHugh and technical assistant Jamie Webster. Beneficial bacteria Doctors sometimes recommend beneficial bacteria, also known as probiotics, for patients suffering from GI illnesses such as colitis and Crohn s disease. However, these over-the-counter probiotic supplements may contain varying amounts of bacteria, and may include cells that are no longer viable. Furthermore, these probiotics have no protective coating, so they can be damaged by acid in the stomach before reaching the intestines. The MIT team decided to try coating bacterial cells with thin layers of polysaccharides, or sugars. They chose two biodegradable polysaccharides known as chitosan and alginate, which have been previously used in other oral delivery technologies. These polysaccharides are known to be mucoadhesive, meaning that they will stick to the mucosal lining of the intestines. In this study, the researchers demonstrated their technique with a strain of bacteria known as Bacillus coagulans, which is sometimes used to treat colitis and irritable bowel syndrome. This strain is not normally found in the human gut but helps to alleviate abdominal pain and bloating by producing lactic acid. To coat the bacteria, the researchers used a technique known as layer-by-layer encapsulation, achieved by depositing thin, alternating layers of positively and negatively charged materials. Bacillus coagulans have a negatively charged surface, so the researchers first applied a layer of chitosan, which is positively charged, followed by a layer of negatively charged alginate. They applied a total of four layers (two of each polysaccharide).  It s a reasonably gentle process, so you re not destroying the bacteria,  Jaklenec says. This results in a very thin, gel-like coating that individually encapsulates each bacterial cell. In tests in mice, the researchers showed that this coating protects the cells from acid in the stomach, as well as bile salts. Once the cells reach the intestines, they settle in and begin replicating. The researchers found that the coated bacteria had a survival rate six times greater than that of uncoated bacteria. ""Increasingly, scientists are learning that the microbiome plays an important role in many diseases, yet the technological tools to safely, effectively, and precisely engineer the microbiome are lacking. This research may help in this effort by creating delivery vehicles that can more effectively shuttle desirable probiotics safely through stomach acid and bile salts to reach the intestines, with the potential to modify human disease,  says Jordan Green, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. Oral delivery This kind of oral probiotic delivery could replace an experimental treatment known as fecal transplant, which is now in clinical trials to treat infections of Clostridium difficile, which can produce severe inflammation of the colon. Fecal transplant involves isolating beneficial bacteria from stool samples of healthy people and delivering them to a patient by enema or colonoscopy. For medicinal use, the coated bacteria could be easily packaged into a capsule or made into a dried powder that could be mixed into a drink, the researchers say. This strategy should work with any kind of bacteria that has a charged surface, whether positive or negative, and it could also work with other microbes such as yeast, the researchers say. They are now working on making the coatings responsive to acidity levels, which could make it easier to target them to other parts of the GI tract, such the colon. They are also interested in adapting this approach to deliver microbes to other parts of the body such as the skin or mouth.","Published: September 15, 2016"

The body s ability to make the adaptable antibody suggests potential strategies for creating improved or even  universal  influenza vaccines, according to a team led by Wayne A. Marasco, MD, PhD, a cancer immunologist and virologist at Dana-Farber, reporting in the journal Nature Communications. The novel infection-fighting protein, named 3I14 mAb, is a  broadly neutralizing antibody,  so-called because it can recognize and disable a diverse group of the 18 different strains of influenza virus that circulate around the globe. Marasco reported the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies in 2009. According to the new report, the 3I14 antibody demonstrated it could neutralize the two main types of influenza A virus, group 1 and 2, and protected mice against lethal doses of the virus. The 3I14 antibody is made by the human immune system s  memory  B cells   white blood cells that circulate in the blood and reside in the spleen and bone marrow. When a person is exposed to an infectious agent, or receives a vaccine made from pieces of that agent, B cells that respond to the invaders can generate a memory of the specific type or strain. Pools of these memory B cells constitute a reserve defensive force that can quickly recognize and attack the microbe or virus should it enter the body again. Unlike most infectious agents that can be protected against with a one-time vaccination, influenza is a shape-shifting virus that constantly and rapidly mutates, and also combines with other flu viruses from animals and birds. The shape changing occurs every flu season and is responsible for seasonal flu that we are vaccinated against yearly. The more dramatic changes that occur when new viruses emerge from animal and bird reservoirs are responsible for potentially more serious pandemics such as occurred in 2009. The discovery of the new broadly neutralizing antibody came after Marasco and his colleagues took blood samples from seven blood bank donors that were shown to harbor these types of antibodies in their blood and challenged their immune B cells in the laboratory with an array of flu viruses. The researchers ultimately identified one B cell population  that recognized all the strains we screened against it,  Marasco said. Sorting through the B cells  DNA, the scientists isolated the gene that carried the instructions for the 3I14 antibody. The antibody proved that it could bind to the unchanging stem portion of flu viruses. And the antibody s genetic makeup gave it the flexibility to adapt or evolve, through mutations, to neutralize a myriad of flu viruses. The investigators challenged the B cells with a bird flu virus of the H5 type that the immune cells had never encountered. While the 3I14 antibody didn t initially bind strongly to the virus, the researchers introduced a single DNA mutation   a change in one letter of genetic code   that increased its binding strength to H5 by 10 times.  To our delight, we made one mutation and it did the job,  Marasco said.  This was a simple mutation that would readily occur in nature.  What these results suggest, he said, is that the memory B cells of the immune system may be continuously diversifying through mutations. As a result, he said, through this mechanism, B cells  may lay down immunologic memory that can recognize all virus strains, present and future.  Ideally, Marasco said, vaccination strategies could be devised to build up in individuals a pool of memory B cells that aren t committed to making a single antibody type; instead,  you would hope to store B cells that have broad activity that, with minimum activity, can recognize all strains.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/tracking-bugs-reveal-secret-of-cancer-cell-metabolism-212243, Tracking Bugs  Reveal Secret of Cancer Cell Metabolism Unexpected finding shows instead of throwing away valuable nutrients  the cells squeeze out every last drop of energy  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. One of the hallmarks of cancer is a change in cellular metabolism, a series of chemical reactions so fundamental to life that their alteration makes cancer cells seem creepily malevolent. Healthy cells take in blood sugar (glucose molecules), which they break down to extract energy.  This happens in two phases   one phase that takes place in the cytoplasm and a subsequent phase that occurs inside cellular compartments called mitochondria. Cancer cells are thought to mostly skip the high-energy producing mitochondrial phase, compensating for the energy they forgo by revving up the first phase and breaking down glucose rapidly to secrete large quantities of lactate   a form of partially digested glucose that has long been regarded as a  waste product.  Some parts of this hypothesis must be true because cancer cells do soak up more glucose than healthy cells; this increased glucose uptake is significant enough to be the basis of an imaging technique used to diagnose cancer in the clinic. On the other hand, it has been hard to understand how cells could afford to discard most of the energy and substance that can be produced from glucose, like royal food testers taking only one bite of each  dish.   It s been a very confusing topic in cancer research for a long time   seemingly paradoxical   that cancer cells could be so wasteful,  said Gary J. Patti, associate professor of chemistry in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. In the Sep. 12 advance online issue of Nature Chemical Biology, Patti and then-doctoral student Amanda (Ying-Jr) Chen describe the surprising results of a seemingly simple experiment. Originally undertaken to test a new methodology, their findings unexpectedly challenged this notion of cancer metabolism. By studying lactate, they showed that cancer cells can run their energy production differently than thought. They have the ability to import the  waste product  lactate into the mitochondria where the rest of the glucose energy can then be extracted.  If you look up lactate in our undergraduate biochemistry textbook, it says that lactate is secreted as a waste product,  Patti said,  but our research shows that it doesn t have to be; it can be used productively.  The Warburg puzzle Most of the energy that cells need to live is produced in the mitochondria, the so-called power plant of the cell. Only 5 percent of glucose s energy can be extracted in the cytoplasm, whereas 95 percent can be extracted in the mitochondria. To produce energy in the mitochondria, oxygen is required. In 1924, the German physiologist Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells tend to ferment glucose into lactate even in the presence of oxygen. They apparently shift from metabolizing glucose in the mitochondria to breaking down most glucose in the cytoplasm. This observation, called the Warburg effect, has long puzzled cancer researchers. Why would cells that are rapidly growing switch to a form of metabolism that generates less energy? What advantage does it confer? Despite many efforts to resolve this issue, it never really went away.  If you look at metabolic maps in the literature,  Patti said,  there s usually only an arrow showing lactate going outside of the cell. It s only a single arrow, but it makes a big difference in how we think.  A dead end that wasn t To study metabolism in an unbiased way, Patti s lab puts tags (isotope labels) on nutrients so that they can track what becomes of them when they are metabolized by cells.  We developed this technology,  Patti said.  And we thought,  OK, what s the first thing we should test it on?  We decided an obvious molecule to start with was lactate, which is often called a dead end. We expected that giving cancer cells this tag would demonstrate that our technology works, because we wouldn t see much of it converted into other molecules.  But when Chen did the experiment, it didn t turn out as expected.  We saw thousands of labeled signals,  she said.  Nearly every lipid in the cell ended up tagged. It was very unexpected and exciting.  The cells weren t just extracting extra energy from lactate; they were then using its atoms to make other important building blocks essential to cancer cell growth.  It s a big transition,  Patti said.  We re going from saying something is thrown away to saying that it is used to make effectively an entire class of molecules in cancer cells.  Since the finding was so startling, the team ran a series of experiments to ensure that the lactate was actually going into the mitochondria. The experiments not only confirmed that lactate can be transported into the mitochondria, but also demonstrated that an enzyme within the mitochondria metabolizes lactate to produce energy and cellular building blocks. Having your cake and eating it too So why waste effort converting glucose into lactate if it is just going to be transported into the mitochondria anyway? When cells metabolize glucose in the cytoplasm, it produces electrons. They have to put the electrons somewhere, or the tightly regulated metabolic reactions stop. Healthy cells move the electrons into the mitochondria, but cancer cells make electrons faster than transport can keep up. This forces cancer cells to stick the electrons on lactate and excrete it, or so it was thought.  We think what we have found is a work-around,  Patti said. Cancer cells stick electrons on lactate, but that doesn t mean the precious nutrient has to be wasted. It can go into the mitochondria.  It s a case of having your cake and eating it too,  he said.","Published: September 15, 2016"

Following the United States, Europe marks the second region where lenvatinib has been licensed for the advanced renal cell carcinoma indication. This license was based on a Phase II clinical study (Study 205)(1) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma following one prior VEGF-targeted therapy. From the results of the study, the lenvatinib plus everolimus group (n=51) demonstrated a significant extension in the study's primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) compared to the everolimus alone group (n=50) (median PFS for the lenvatinib plus everolimus group: 14.6 months vs median PFS for the everolimus alone group: 5.5 months; Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.40 [95% CI: 0.24-0.68], p=0.0005). Furthermore, updated median overall survival in the study population was 25.5 months in the lenvatinib plus everolimus group compared with 15.4 months in the everolimus alone group (HR 0.59 [95% CI: 0.36-0.97]).(2) The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the lenvatinib plus everolimus group were diarrhea, decreased appetite and fatigue. The most common TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) were diarrhea, hypertension and fatigue. The number of patients with renal cancer is estimated to be approximately 338,000 worldwide, including approximately 115,000 in Europe, 58,000 in the United States and 17,000 in Japan.(3) Renal cell carcinoma comprises more than 90% of all malignancies of the kidney,(4) and originates from malignant cells in the lining of the tubules of the kidney. The incidence of renal cell carcinoma in people over 55 years of age is rising, and it is more likely to affect men than women. For advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that is difficult to treat with surgery, the standard treatment is molecular targeted drug therapy, however with low 5-year survival rates, this remains a disease with significant unmet medical need. In Europe, lenvatinib has been designated as an orphan drug for thyroid cancer and is marketed as Lenvima for this indication. In Europe, renal cell carcinoma does not meet the criteria for orphan drug designation. Accordingly, under European regulations, any licensed medicine that previously received orphan drug designation for an indication and subsequently receives license for a non-orphan indication must be marketed under a different trade name. As such, lenvatinib will be marketed as Kisplyx in the European Union for the indication covering renal cell carcinoma.

The research plan of the CRADA is designed to develop a novel AML MRD assay for monitoring the expression of multiple genes (including WT1) that can document the kinetics of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia during treatment with SELLAS' most advanced product candidate, galinpepimut-S, the Company's WT1 cancer vaccine.  Galinpepimut-S is a late clinical-stage cancer immunotherapy being developed to target hematologic cancers and solid tumors, including AML, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, and multiple other cancers. SELLAS plans to commence a pivotal Phase 3 trial of galinpepimut-S in AML patients where this new AML-MRD assay will be used as a biomarker test. SELLAS will collaborate with Christopher S. Hourigan, DPhil, FACP, Chief of the Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, and Dr. Hourigan's research unit in this very promising research effort.   David Scheinberg, MD, PhD, Chairman of SELLAS Scientific Advisory Board and Chairman of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Pharmacology Program and the Center for Experimental Therapeutics stated, ""The objective of this collaboration is to develop a robust MRD-assay that can be widely used in patients with AML undergoing therapy with galinpepimut-S and with other therapies in which the evaluation of MRD is crucial to monitor the effect of the drug and to predict relapse. The development of the new MRD assay will be based on the encouraging results with RQ-PCR obtained at Dr. Hourigan's lab, a world leader in the AML MRD field, and from data generated by RNA-sequencing technology.""  Sellas' goal is to further develop the assay to a point where it can be run as a routine assay by a CLIA-certified laboratory or to be developed as a companion diagnostic kit.  Sellas looks forward to furthering our collaboration on many levels with the Myeloid Malignancies Section at the NIH. Dr. Hourigan stated ""Patients with AML need better options.  The NIH established the Myeloid Malignancies Section with the mandate to investigate the detection, prevention and treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia relapse, with particular focus on novel immunotherapy.  This new collaboration with SELLAS and their galinpepimut-S program in AML aligns well with our mission and we are excited to use this opportunity to refine and advance our research in molecular assays for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML patients.  Our hope is work in the laboratory may be able to be translated by others into a clinical test, allowing both earlier diagnosis of relapse and to provide a better tool for monitoring AML patient's progress during treatment"".  Dr. Hourigan noted that the current research plan contemplated by the CRADA will go on in a number of stages over an initial period of three years. Dr. Angelos M. Stergiou, M.D., Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS, commented: ""SELLAS is honored and excited to be able to work with NIH and its world-renowned research scientists, particularly with Dr. Hourigan, and his collaborators at other US Institutions, who are developing a practical and viable solution for the detection of MRD in clinical trials and  potentially - in daily practice in the future. When we discussed the development of this assay with the NIH a few months ago, we thought that our Phase 3 AML trial was the ideal platform to evaluate it as a reflex test of the effect of our cancer vaccine on MRD. This CRADA very well characterizes what an ideal academic-industry collaboration should aim for in terms of common scientific and clinical goals in the best interest of patients and caregivers"".

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center successfully developed a synthetic polymer that can transport a drug into lung cancer cells without going inside of normal lung cells. Since conventional chemo drugs indiscriminately kill all rapidly dividing cells to halt the growth of cancer, these selective nanoparticles could decrease side effects by reducing drug accumulation in normal cells.  The discovery that nanoparticles can be selective to certain cells based only on their physical and chemical properties has profound implications for nanoparticle-based therapies because cell type specificity of drug carriers could alter patient outcomes in the clinic,  said corresponding author Dr. Daniel Siegwart, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at UT Southwestern Medical Center and with Simmons Cancer Center.  At the same time, a deeper understanding of nanoparticle interactions in the body opens the door to predict patient responses to existing liposome and nanoparticle therapies, and offers the potential to create future drug carriers customized according to individual genetic profiles.  The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists tested hundreds of polymers to make the surprising discovery that cells could respond differently to the same drug carrier, even when those cancerous and normal cells came from the lungs of the same patient.  These functional polyester nanoparticles provide an exciting alternative approach for selective drug delivery to tumor cells that may improve efficacy and reduce adverse side effects of cancer therapies,  said co-author Dr. John Minna, Professor and Director of the Nancy B. and Jake L. Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, and Director of the W.A.  Tex  and Deborah Moncrief Jr. Center for Cancer Genetics at UT Southwestern. The researchers developed new chemical reactions to create a diverse library of polymers that could deliver nucleic acid drugs while possessing enough structural diversity to discover cancer cell-specific nanoparticles. This is an important step to improving tailored cancer therapies to an individual s specific genetic makeup.  The ability to specifically target cancer cells using nanoparticles could alter how we administer drugs to patients,  said Dr. Minna, Professor of Pharmacology and Internal Medicine, and with Simmons Cancer Center, who holds the Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research, and the Max L. Thomas Distinguished Chair in Molecular Pulmonary Oncology.  It is already possible to use genetic sequencing to customize drug regimens for each patient. We may also be able to customize the drug carrier to predictably improve patient responses.  Nanoparticles are tiny spheres (1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair) that can improve the solubility and delivery of drugs to cells. In this study, Cancer Center researchers delivered short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based drugs to disrupt the functioning and growth of tumor cells by eliminating the proteins the cells need to survive. Amazingly, the cancer selective nanoparticles stayed inside of tumors in mice for more than one week, while nonselective control nanoparticles were cleared within a few hours. This translated to improved siRNA-mediated cancer cell death and significant suppression of tumor growth. Support for this latest research came from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), Welch Foundation, American Cancer Society, UTSW s Friends of the Comprehensive Cancer Center, the UTSW Translational Pilot Program, and the NIH National Cancer Institute SPORE grant in Lung Cancer. The Special Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Lung Cancer program, now in its 18th year, is the largest thoracic oncology effort in the U.S. Other UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study are Research Scientists Dr. Yunfeng Yan and Dr. Kenneth Huffman; Postdoctoral Researchers Dr. Hu Xiong and Dr. Petra Kos; Graduate Student Researchers Jason Miller and Sussana Elkassih with the UT Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences; Dr. James Kim, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and with the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research; Dr. Li Liu, Assistant Professor of Radiology; Dr. Kejin Zhou, Assistant Instructor with Simmons Cancer Center; and researchers Dr. Ryan Carstens and John Norman.

However, most nanoparticles that have been developed so far are limited to carrying only one or two drugs. MIT chemists have now shown that they can package three or more drugs into a novel type of nanoparticle, allowing them to design custom combination therapies for cancer. In tests in mice, the researchers showed that the particles could successfully deliver three chemotherapy drugs and shrink tumors. In the same study, which appears in the Sept. 14 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the researchers also showed that when drugs are delivered by nanoparticles, they don t necessarily work by the same DNA-damaging mechanism as when delivered in their traditional form. That is significant because most scientists usually assume that nanoparticle drugs are working the same way as the original drugs, says Jeremiah Johnson, the Firmenich Career Development Associate Professor of Chemistry and the senior author of the paper. Even if the nanoparticle version of the drug still kills cancer cells, it s important to know the underlying mechanism of action when choosing combination therapies and seeking regulatory approval of new drugs, he says.  People tend to take it as a given that when you put a drug into a nanoparticle it s the same drug, just in a nanoparticle,  Johnson says.  Here, in collaboration with Mike Hemann, we conducted detailed characterization using an RNA interference assay that Mike developed to make sure the drug is still hitting the same target in the cell and doing everything that it would if it weren t in a nanoparticle.  The paper s lead authors are Jonathan Barnes, a former MIT postdoc; and Peter Bruno, a postdoc at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Other authors are grad students Hung Nguyen and Jenny Liu, former postdoc Longyan Liao, and Michael Hemann, an associate professor of biology and member of the Koch Institute. Precise control The new nanoparticle production technique, which Johnson s lab first reported in 2014, differs from other methods that encapsulate drugs or chemically attach them to a particle. Instead, the MIT team creates particles from building blocks that already contain drug molecules. They can join the building blocks together in a specific structure and precisely control how much of each drug is incorporated.  We can take any drug, as long as it has a functional group [a group of atoms that allows a molecule to participate in chemical reactions], and we can load it into our particles in exactly the ratio that we want, and have it release under exactly the conditions that we want it to,  Johnson says.  It s very modular.  A key advantage is that this approach can be used to deliver drugs that normally can t be encapsulated by traditional methods. Using the new particles, the researchers delivered doses of three chemotherapy drugs   cisplatin, doxorubicin, and camptothecin   at concentrations that would be toxic if delivered by injection throughout the body, as chemotherapy drugs usually are. In mice that received this treatment, ovarian tumors shrank and the mice survived much longer than untreated mice, with few side effects. Unexpected mechanism Using a method developed by Hemann s lab, the researchers then investigated how their nanoparticle drugs affect cells. The technique measures cancer drugs  effects on more than 100 genes that are involved in the programmed cell death often triggered by cancer drugs. This allows scientists to classify the drugs based on which clusters of genes they affect.  Drugs that damage DNA get clustered into DNA damage-inducing agents, and drugs that inhibit topoisomerases cluster together in another region,  Johnson says.  If you have a drug that you don t know the mechanism of, you can do this test and see if the drug clusters with other drugs whose actions are known. That lets you make a hypothesis about what the unknown drug is doing.  The researchers found that nanoparticle-delivered camptothecin and doxorubicin worked just as expected. However, cisplatin did not. Cisplatin normally acts by linking adjacent strands of DNA, causing damage that is nearly impossible for the cell to repair. When delivered in nanoparticle form, the researchers found that cisplatin acts more like a different platinum-based drug known as oxaliplatin. This drug also kills cells, but by a different mechanism: It binds to DNA but induces a different pattern of DNA damage. The researchers hypothesize that after cisplatin is released from the nanoparticle, via a reaction that kicks off a group known as a carboxylate, the carboxylate group then reattaches in a way that makes the drug act more like oxaliplatin. Many other researchers attach cisplatin to nanoparticles the same way, so Johnson suspects this could be a more widespread issue. His lab is now working on a new version of the cisplatin nanoparticle that operates according to the same mechanism as regular cisplatin. The team is also developing nanoparticles with different combinations of drugs to test against pancreatic and other types of cancers.","Published: September 15, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genes-essential-to-life-discovered-195612,Genes Essential to Life Discovered Genes critical for life are discovered in humans and mice as part of large scale phenotyping study  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Roughly a third of all genes in the mammalian genome are essential for life. A new article in Nature, from an international, multi-institutional research team including the Medical Research Council (MRC) Harwell, describes the large-scale discovery of those genes and how it will impact understanding of mammalian development and human disease. MRC Harwell is a leading member of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, which includes researchers representing over 30 institutions world-wide. The IMPC is generating and phenotyping (assessing the morphological and physiological characteristics of) knockout mutations for all of the protein-coding genes in the mouse genome. The Consortium aims to discover new functions for the roughly 20,000 genes shared with humans, and makes all of the mouse strains available to provide a platform for dissecting the mechanisms of human disease. The Nature study reports the results of the first 1,751 genes characterized by the IMPC using these knock out mouse models, including the finding that nearly one third are essential for life. This includes 410 lines that are fully lethal where embryos did not survive, and an additional 198 for which fewer than half of the expected number of mutants were identified.  Using a new, standardized phenotyping platform and mouse lines on a single C57BL/6N genetic background, the researchers established both the time of embryonic death and the nature of the lethal phenotypes, discovering many novel characteristics that shed light on the function of these genes. The incorporation of high-resolution 3D imaging and automated, computational analysis of the images allowed the team to gather detailed information and make discoveries of new phenotypes on an unprecedented scale. The group also showed that identification of essential genes in the mouse provides a window on human disease, including the discovery of a number of novel cases where these genes overlap with known human disease genes. In addition, in collaboration with the ExAC Consortium**, they showed that human orthologs of mouse essential genes are significantly depleted for loss-of-function mutations in humans, and that these genes are thus strong candidates for undiagnosed human genetic conditions.  Joint first author, Dr Lydia Teboul from MRC Harwell, says:  The MRC Harwell Institute is proud to have contributed to the international effort of the IMPC that has begun to dissect the function of many of the genes of the mouse genome. MRC Harwell has worked with our partners to design the testing pipeline and produce data. The collection of the data at the Data Coordination Centre at MRC Harwell has also been pivotal to the emerging findings from the study of the first 1700 genes analysed. Most excitingly, the consortium has identified a large number of essential genes in the mouse, many of which are associated with human disease. The work will contribute significantly to our understanding of the genetic bases for human diseases including spina bifida and cardiovascular defects amongst many others.  Moreover, JAX Senior Research Scientist Dr Steve Murray, corresponding author of the study, notes  When looking across the seven or eight embryos generated for each knockout, we found variations in phenotype at a surprising frequency. We expect diversity when we look across different genetic backgrounds, but this is the first large-scale documentation of pervasive variable expressivity in a defined genetic background.  The research collaboration included Dr Mary Dickinson at Baylor College of Medicine, Dr Ann Flenniken and Dr Michael Wong at the University of Toronto, and Dr Xiao Ji of the University of Pennsylvania. Groups from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Francis Crick Institute were also involved. Dr David Adams, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, says:  This study heralds a landmark in our understanding of mammalian development with phenotypes described for over 600 genes important for embryonic development. The mouse lines produced are an invaluable resource for modelling human developmental diseases.  All data and images generated by the project are available to the research community, disseminated via an open-source web portal in real time without embargo. The mouse models generated are also available to other researchers who may be investigating particular pathways or disease phenotypes.  As current estimates indicate that only a small percentage of genes are studied by the broad research community,  the researchers note in the paper,  the systematic approach to phenotyping and unrestricted access to data and mouse models provided by the IMPC promises to fill this large gap in our understanding of mammalian gene function.  Dr Lindsay Wilson, Programme Manager for Genetics and Genomics at the MRC, says:  The MRC, together with our international partners, recognises the value of building up a repository of high quality gene-function data that will shape the research of present-day and future scientists.  This is especially true for underexplored genes, which might have roles we can t imagine without seeing what happens when we remove them altogether.  That is why we have made substantial investments over many years, through our world-class Harwell Institute, to secure the ambitions of the IMPC.  Professor Steve Brown, Director at MRC Harwell and chair of the IMPC Steering Committee, says: ""A worldwide consortium of labs, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, is well on the way to generating a mutant for every gene in the mouse genome and characterising the effects of those mutations. This will provide a comprehensive catalogue of mammalian gene function and provide many new insights into the role of genes in disease. This report from the IMPC describes the phenotypes from the first 1700 genes analysed and indicates that at least a third of the genes are essential for life. In one of the most significant findings of the paper, the IMPC shows that many of these essential genes are associated with disease in humans throwing new light on the genetic bases for disease.""","Published: September 15, 2016"

The BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay provides health care providers the ability to detect for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) from a single specimen in just one test. CT, GC and TV are among the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate 2.86 million new chlamydial infections and 820,000 gonorrheal infections each year.1,2 Trichomoniasis, a much neglected STI until recently, ranks third among all common STIs after HPV and Chlamydia, with nearly an estimated 1.1 million new infections each year in the U.S.3 Although most of these infections are asymptomatic, they can have serious consequences if left unaddressed, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility, pre-term or low birth-weight babies and increased risk of STI transmission or infection (including HIV) in males and females. Trichomonas can be difficult to diagnose with manual methods, and despite its high prevalence in many populations, awareness remains low. The CDC 2015 guidance recommends the use of highly sensitive and specific tests, such as nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) technology, as the recommended test for Trichomonas detection. The BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay allows health care providers to detect these common and addressable STIs from a single specimen in just one test. Specimen collection options are flexible, allowing for male or female urines, self-collected vaginal swabs and clinician collected endocervical swabs. Once samples are loaded onto the BD MAX System, results will be ready in less than three hours, and all reagents are ready-to-use and can be stored at room temperature. ""The FDA clearance and launch of the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay in the U.S. brings a  one-test  approach to detect for three sexually transmitted infections,  said Doug White, vice president and general manager of Molecular Diagnostics and Women s Health for BD.

The workflow, which has been published in the Journal of Laboratory Automation, was developed through the combination of UC San Diego s expertise in genomics and the use of TTP Labtech s mosquito liquid handlers, which can pipette nanolitre to microlitre volumes with high accuracy and reproducibility, to miniaturise and automate the process. Although single-cell genomics is advancing rapidly, researchers face challenges linked with reproducibility, sensitivity, scalability and cost, particularly when trying to miniaturise high-throughput applications. To maximise accuracy and precision, library prep protocols recommend volumes that are within the range of manual pipettes or large-volume liquid handlers. However, only a small proportion of each of the libraries prepared will be required for sequencing. The focus of UC San Diego s partnership with TTP Labtech was to miniaturise single-cell RNA library prep reaction set-up, to minimise sample and reagent requirements. The resulting workflow has been shown to reduce library prep costs by up to 90% while maintaining throughput, accuracy and reproducibility. The miniaturisation of library prep volumes was achieved using TTP Labtech s mosquito HTS and HV liquid handlers, which accurately dispense volumes between 25 nL and 1.2  L and 0.5 to 5  L, respectively. Both instruments use true positive-displacement pipetting technology, which maintains volumetric accuracy even for highly viscous liquids, enabling high concentration gDNA to be handled, to save on reagent cost and sample input. To assess the quality of the libraries, UC San Diego applied the workflow to analyse pancreatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. The resulting single-cell RNA-sequencing data were analysed to determine the reproducibility of this system and its ability to distinguish not only between cells at different stages of differentiation but also between individual cells within each stage. Joby Jenkins, Product Manager, TTP Labtech, commented:  Single cell sequencing requires large numbers of samples to be handled in order to provide valid data based on population studies. Reproducibility and sensitivity, as well as scalability and cost, can be limiting factors when large numbers of cells are analysed, and we are very pleased that our partnership with UCSD has achieved our goal of improving sample prep for single cell genomics research.  Dr Louise Laurent, MD, PhD, Associate Professor, UC San Diego, said:  The workflow we have developed, in partnership with TTP Labtech, has the potential to provide researchers with significant cost savings while maintaining the quality of single cell sequencing. The instrument cost and their ease-of-use make the mosquito liquid handlers viable options for labs that would like to scale-down and automate next-generation sequencing sample preparation.  TTP Labtech will be presenting a poster on the published workflow at the Single Cell Genomics Conference, 14-16 September 2016, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK and exhibiting at ASHG 2016 booth #1326, 18-22 October 2016, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","Published: September 15, 2016"

Novasep s services will be extended to include solid form screening, selection, development, characterization and analytical method development.  This alliance was designed from the ground up to benefit companies who want a seamless handoff between development and scale up. While there are numerous synthesis companies and early stage development groups, this alliance is distinctive as it pairs two leading companies with extensive, unique and demonstrated physical and analytical chemistry capabilities,  said Dr. David Bugay, CSO of Triclinic Labs.  We can now offer world-class large and small molecule screening, characterization, purification, control, scale up, method development/validation and intellectual property support capabilities.  While the efficiency of a drug is based on its intrinsic nature and its interactions with biological targets, the preparation process has a strong impact on these properties. Finding the most appropriate solid phase can optimize these features. The best solid phase   be it a crystalline polymorph, salt, cocrystal or amorphous form   can maximize physicochemical properties and therefore improve drug efficiency.  This new partnership with Triclinic Labs is a further step in our  Back to Basics  strategic plan. It enables us to expand our offering to our clients by adding services onto the last stage of product development,  said Dr. Michel Spagnol, CEO of Novasep.  The alliance with Triclinic Labs emphasizes our continued commitment towards the North American market, following the recent opening of our US-based synthesis laboratory and kilo lab in Boothwyn, PA,  said Andrew Brennan, general manager at Novasep s US operations.  The exciting thing about this strategic alliance is that there is real commitment and effort behind it, at all levels of both companies,  Shawn Comella, Triclinic Labs  CEO commented.  We believe that collaboration will lead to increased efficiency and success for our clients when they require both solid-state development as well as API manufacturing expertise.

They have found elevated levels of transglutaminase 2, or TG2, in the brains of mice experiencing chronic stress an animal model of depression as well as the prefrontal cortex of depressed people who committed suicide. High TG2 levels in the mouse translated to atrophy of neurons, depression-like symptoms and reduced levels of TrkB, the receptor for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a brain-nourishing molecule that also aids connectivity, said Dr. Anilkumar Pillai, neuroscientist in the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. See Also: Stress resiliency and susceptibility: The neurocircuitry underlying the detrimental effects of chronic stress When scientists overexpressed TrkB, it relieved the depression-like symptoms in their animal model.  If you don t have enough BDNF, then all the serotonin in the world won t help,  said Pillai, corresponding author of the study in the Nature journal Molecular Psychiatry. Likewise, when they directly reduced TG2 levels using a drug or a viral vector, more BDNF signaling occurred and depressive symptoms abated, said Pillai, who suspects that the protein may be a powerful new target in the fight against depression. They found TG2 levels increased in their animal model following administration of stress hormones and after several weeks of actual stress that mimics the lives of chronically stressed individuals. Both produced classic depressive behavior and increased TG2 levels in the prefrontal cortex, a region involved in complex thoughts, decision-making as well as mood and personality expression. Learn More: Stress hormone elevation associated with working memory deficits in aging Serotonin is a major neurotransmitter in the brain involved in many functions, including mood regulation. Serotonin levels in a depressed patient s blood should be high because serotonin signaling in the brain is low, Pillai said. Blood levels can be used to help diagnose the condition that affects about 350 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization. Many cell types make serotonin. Interestingly, the vast majority of serotonin is made in the gut, but neurons do make some of their own, Pillai said. Astrocytes make BDNF, whose levels are also low in depression. Although just how the two work together is an unfolding mystery. In this study, Pillai and his team further linked them by showing that treatment that increases serotonin availability   as most antidepressants do also increased levels of the BDNF receptor thru the action of RAC1. TG2 converts serotonin to RAC1, a protein that helps rejuvenate the BDNF receptor, TrkB. Now the MCG scientists have shown that in depression a healthy balance of all these is upset, as elevated TG2 makes less serotonin available, leaving insufficient levels to enable proper communication between neurons. The brain also is more vulnerable as the increased level of activated RAC1 is inexplicably degraded, which leads to less instead of more BDNF signaling.  Increased amounts of TG2 will eventually lead to decreased levels of RAC1, and BDNF signaling is just not happening,  Pillai said. Don't Miss: 'Trigger' for stress processes discovered in brain Next steps include looking for other drugs that lower TG2 levels. For the study, researchers used cysteamine, whose clinical uses today include treatment of a rare genetic condition in which a buildup of crystals can cause kidney failure. Unfortunately, the drug creates an odor that has patients bathing multiple times daily. They also want to directly measure serotonin levels following treatment, although Pillai notes that increased BNDF signaling should be significant to alleviate symptoms.

In a first-of-its-kind study published just before back-to-school season, the authors found that students can combat the blues with some simple, deliberate actions on their mobile devices. By conducting exercises via smartphone photo technology and gauging users' psychological and emotional states, the researchers found that the daily taking and sharing of certain types of images can positively affect people. The results of the study out of UCI's Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences were published recently in the Psychology of Well-Being. See Also: Facial motion activates a dedicated network within the brain, research shows ""Our research showed that practicing exercises that can promote happiness via smartphone picture taking and sharing can lead to increased positive feelings for those who engage in it,"" said lead author Yu Chen, a postdoctoral scholar in UCI's Department of Informatics. ""This is particularly useful information for returning college students to be aware of, since they face many sources of pressure."" These stressors financial difficulties, being away from home for the first time, feelings of loneliness and isolation, and the rigors of coursework can negatively impact students' academic performance and lead to depression. ""The good news is that despite their susceptibility to strain, most college students constantly carry around a mobile device, which can be used for stress relief,"" Chen said. ""Added to that are many applications and social media tools that make it easy to produce and send images."" The goal of the study, she said, was to help researchers understand the effects of photo taking on well-being in three areas: self-perception, in which people manipulated positive facial expressions; self-efficacy, in which they did things to make themselves happy; and pro-social, in which people did things to make others happy. Chen and her colleagues designed and conducted a four-week study involving 41 college students. The subjects 28 female and 13 male were instructed to continue their normal day-to-day activities (going to class, doing schoolwork, meeting with friends, etc.) while taking part in the research. Learn More: Impressions shaped by facial appearance foster biased decisions But first each was invited to the informatics lab for an informal interview and to fill out a general questionnaire and consent form. The scientists helped students load a survey app onto their phones to document their moods during the first ""control"" week of the study. Participants used a different app to take photos and record their emotional states over the following three-week ""intervention"" phase. Subjects reported their moods three times a day using the smartphone apps. In evening surveys, they were asked to provide details of any significant events that may have affected their emotions during the course of the day. The project involved three types of photos to help the researchers determine how smiling, reflecting and giving to others might impact users' moods. The first was a selfie, to be taken daily while smiling. The second was an image of something that made the photo taker happy. The third was a picture of something the photographer believed would bring happiness to another person (which was then sent to that person). Participants were randomly assigned to take photos of one type. Researchers collected nearly 2,900 mood measurements during the study and found that subjects in all three groups experienced increased positive moods. Some participants in the selfie group reported becoming more confident and comfortable with their smiling photos over time. The students taking photos of objects that made them happy became more reflective and appreciative. And those who took photos to make others happy became calmer and said that the connection to their friends and family helped relieve stress.

The drug a mood stabilizer called valproate is commonly prescribed to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, though its mechanism of action is poorly understood and only some patients respond to the treatment. Few options currently exist for treating the debilitating ""negative"" symptoms of severe psychiatric disorders, which include slowed movement, blunted affect, and social withdrawal. (Antipsychotic medications are used to treat hallucinations, delusions, and other ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia). See Also: Study offers clues to early detection of bipolar disorders in high-risk childrenThe authors conclude that valproate may be effective for treating negative symptoms in psychiatric patients with two copies of the ""Val"" variant of the COMT gene, which breaks down dopamine in the brain. In the roughly 40 percent of patients with this genotype, higher levels of proline (a neuromodulator that is increased by valproate), correlated with fewer negative symptoms. In patients who have a ""Met"" variant of COMT, rising levels of proline appeared to do the exact opposite: these patients had more or worse negative symptoms, and the symptoms did not improve with valproate. The results are published in Translational Psychiatry by Catherine Clelland, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and cell biology (in the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain) at Columbia University Medical Center and colleagues at Columbia, the Nathan S. Kline Institute, and New York University School of Medicine. Previous studies have demonstrated an interaction between elevated blood levels of proline a modulator of neurotransmitters that, in higher amounts, is associated with psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia and a gene called COMT, which makes an enzyme that helps maintain normal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. One version of the enzyme contains the amino acid methionine (Met), while another type contains valine (Val). People may inherit one copy of each type (Val/Met) or two copies of the type (Val/Val or Met/Met). Additional studies have suggested that COMT Val/Val has greater enzymatic activity, increasing its ability to lower dopamine levels in the brain. In this study, the researchers compared the severity of negative symptoms and proline levels in 95 hospitalized schizophrenia patients with variants of the COMT gene. In patients with COMT Val/Val, symptom severity decreased as proline levels rose. In contrast, higher proline levels were associated with greater negative symptom severity in patients with the Met/Met gene. Among those patients who were being treated with valproate (approximately one-third of the schizophrenia patients), negative symptoms were more severe in those with the Met/Met gene than in those with the Val/Val gene. The researchers also evaluated negative symptoms in 43 patients with bipolar disorder, about half of whom were treated with valproate. After one week of treatment, negative symptoms decreased for those with the Val/Val genotype, while symptoms increased or remained the same for those with the Met/Met genotype. Learn More: How to tell the difference between bipolar disorder and depression ""While longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results, this study suggests that boosting proline levels in patients with the Val/Val gene may help address negative symptoms, whereas increasing proline in patients with the Met/Met gene may have the opposite effect,"" said Dr. Catherine Clelland.

Researchers at Link ping University in Sweden have exploited this difference to develop a method that can predict disease activity in multiple sclerosis. It is not currently possible to know which individuals with multiple sclerosis risk developing severe disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS), is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects young adults. The disease is a life-long condition. See Also: Slowed processing speed linked with executive deficits in multiple sclerosis The researchers behind the new study hope that the method they have developed will contribute to answering the question why certain patients suffer less severely with the disease than others. Eventually, a test may be developed for use in patient management. The new study, published in the journal Cell Reports, describes how the researchers have sought biomarkers that can be used in MS. Biomarkers are naturally occurring substances in the body that can be measured in, for example, blood and that mirror a condition in the body. They are used in medical care to follow the progression of a disease and measure the effect of a treatment. The researchers compared immune cells from patients with MS with cells from healthy controls. They discovered important differences in the functioning of cells from healthy and sick individuals. The researcher investigated how large numbers of proteins interact with each other, and used new bioinformatics methods to find those that are highly significant in MS. ""We have been able to study in detail changes in the immune cells of patients, and been able to identify important proteins. This has led us to a biomarker that can predict how the disease will progress in the patient,"" says bioinformatics specialist Mika Gustafsson, who has led the study together with Professor Jan Ernerudh. The biomarker that the researchers have identified is a combination of four proteins, whose concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid can be measured. In the study, it was possible for the researchers to predict with the aid of the biomarker which patients with MS would have active MS disease two years later. The new method was also able to predict the efficacy of a common MS drug in a small group of patients.

Instead, it takes a single monkey equipped with brain-sensing technology and a cheat sheet. That technology, developed by Stanford Bio-X scientists Krishna Shenoy, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, and postdoctoral fellow Paul Nuyujukian, directly reads brain signals to drive a cursor moving over a keyboard. In a pilot experiment conducted with monkeys, the animals were able to transcribe passages from the New York Times and Hamlet at a rate of 12 words per minute. See Also: Researchers demonstrate direct brain-to-brain communication in human subjects Earlier versions of the technology have already been tested successfully in people with paralysis, but the typing was slow and imprecise. This latest work tests improvements to the speed and accuracy of the technology that interprets brain signals and drives the cursor.  Our results demonstrate that this interface may have great promise for use in people,  said Nuyujukian, who will join Stanford faculty as an assistant professor of bioengineering in 2017.  It enables a typing rate sufficient for a meaningful conversation.  Other approaches for helping people with movement disorders type involve tracking eye movements or, as in the case of Stephen Hawking, tracking movements of individual muscles in the face. However, these have limitations, and can require a degree of muscle control that might be difficult for some people. For example, Stephen Hawking wasn t able to use eye-tracking software due to drooping eyelids and other people find eye-tracking technology tiring. Directly reading brain signals could overcome some of these challenges and provide a way for people to communicate their thoughts and emotions. Read Next: Mind-controlled prosthetic arm moves individual 'fingers' The technology developed by the Stanford team involves a multi-electrode array implanted in the brain to directly read signals from a region that ordinarily directs hand and arm movements used to move a computer mouse. It s the algorithms for translating those signals and making letter selections that the team members have been improving. They had tested individual components of the updated technology in prior monkey studies but had never demonstrated the combined improvements in speed and accuracy.  The interface we tested is exactly what a human would use,  Nuyujukian said.  What we had never quantified before was the typing rate that could be achieved.  Using these high-performing algorithms developed by Nuyujukian and his colleagues, the animals could type more than three times faster than with earlier approaches. The monkeys testing the technology had been trained to type letters corresponding to what they see on a screen. For this study, the animals transcribed passages of New York Times articles or, in one example, Hamlet. The results, which are published in IEEE, show that the technology allows a monkey to type with only its thoughts at a rate of up to 12 words per minute. People using this system would likely type more slowly, the researchers said, while they think about what they want to communicate or how to spell words. People might also be in more distracting environments and in some cases could have additional impairments that slow the ultimate communication rate.  What we cannot quantify is the cognitive load of figuring out what words you are trying to say,  Nuyujukian said. Despite that, Nuyujukian said even a rate lower than the 12 words per minute achieved by monkeys would be a significant advance for people who aren t otherwise able to communicate effectively or reliably.  Also understand that we re not using auto completion here like your smartphone does where it guesses your words for you,  Nuyujukian said. Eventually the technology could be paired with the kinds of world completion technology used by smartphones or tablets to improve typing speeds. Related: Carbon nanotube fibers make superior links to brain In addition to proving the technology, this study showed that the implanted sensor could be stable for several years. The animals had the implants used to test this and previous iterations of the technology for up to four years prior to this experiment, with no loss of performance or side effects in the animals. Shenoy and Nuyujukian are part of the Brain-Machine Interface initiative of the Stanford Neurosciences Institute, which is working to develop this and other methods of interfacing technology directly with the brain. The team is running a clinical trial now, in conjunction with Jaimie Henderson, professor of neurosurgery, to test this latest interface in people.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/finding-compounds-that-inhibit-zika-194553,Finding Compounds That Inhibit Zika Researchers identified compounds that inhibit the Zika virus and reduce its ability to kill brain cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Zika has been reported in more than 60 countries and territories worldwide. The virus spreads primarily through bites from infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact or from mother to child during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Infection during pregnancy can cause severe fetal defects. Zika virus also is associated with neurological diseases such as Guillain-Barr  syndrome in infected adults. Currently, there are no vaccines or effective treatments. A research group led by Dr. Wei Zheng at NIH s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), in collaboration with scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Florida State University, tested for compounds that were effective against Zika virus. The scientists first developed a test using a protein called caspase 3, which is activated in brain cells upon infection with Zika virus and leads to the cells  death. The researchers also carried out a screen for compounds that protect brain cells from infection. Using drug-screening robots, the scientists tested about 6,000 approved drugs and investigational compounds. The screening identified more than 100 molecules that appeared promising against Zika virus. The results were published online on August 29, 2016, in Nature Medicine. An investigational drug called emricasan was most potent at preventing neural cell death. The compound is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial to reduce liver injury and fibrosis. Zika viruses persisted after emricasan treatment, so this potential drug protects nerve cells from death without inhibiting the Zika virus itself. Two other promising compounds niclosamide and PHA-690509 work by inhibiting replication of Zika virus. Niclosamide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating worm infections in humans. PHA-690509 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDKs are crucial for regulating cellular processes and normal brain development, which can be disrupted by the Zika virus during replication. Previous studies have shown that CDK inhibitors can block replication of other viruses, including herpes viruses and HIV. Thus, the team tested a set of structurally distinct CDK inhibitors for their effects on Zika virus infection. Nine proved promising. The most potent was an experimental drug candidate called seliciclib. The team tested emricasan and PHA-690509 in combination and found that the compounds had an additive effect. They prevented both virus replication and cell death.  Using the NCATS drug repurposing platform for emerging infectious diseases can help rapidly identify potential treatments for urgent needs such as the Zika virus,  Zheng says. While identifying promising compounds is an important first step, these potential drugs will need to be carefully evaluated before they could be used in the clinic, particularly during pregnancy. The researchers are now testing these compounds in a mouse model of Zika infection. The scientists are also further studying the compounds  mechanisms of action.","Published: September 14, 2016"

These include blood infections (bacteremia), urinary tract infections, and brain or spinal fluid infections (bacterial meningitis). Determining whether an infant has a bacterial infection currently involves sizable costs and risks. A health care provider must obtain samples of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, which can require invasive procedures such as a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). The samples are then cultured to grow and identify bacteria. While waiting for test results, the infant may be hospitalized or given antibiotics that can turn out to be unnecessary. When bacteria infect a person, they trigger the immune system to turn on certain genes, thereby creating a distinct  biosignature.  In adults and older children, diagnostic tests are able to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections by analyzing the immune system s response. But it s been unclear whether this approach might also work in infants, since their immature immune systems might not generate a measureable response. A team led by Drs. Prashant Mahajan at Children s Hospital of Michigan, Nathan Kuppermann at University of California Davis Medical Center, and Octavio Ramilo at Nationwide Children s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, set out to determine whether they could define an RNA biosignature in infants to diagnose bacterial infections. The study was funded in part by NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Results were published on August 23, 2016, in JAMA. The researchers enrolled more than 1,800 infants who were seen in 22 different emergency departments that were part of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). The infants had fevers, were 2 months of age or younger, and had a blood sample taken. The team first defined potential gene sets for biosignatures by analyzing blood samples from feverish infants, including 89 with bacterial infections and 190 without. A comparison group included 19 healthy non-feverish infants. The analysis identified a biosignature of 66 genes that could distinguish infants with a bacterial infection from those without. To validate the accuracy of the RNA biosignature, the scientists analyzed blood samples from a second set of feverish infants. The biosignature proved to be 87% sensitive, correctly identifying samples with bacterial infection. The researchers further identified a set of 10 genes that could distinguish infants with bacteremia from those without.  The development of a fast and noninvasive diagnostic tool holds promise for better outcomes and lower treatment costs for young infants with fevers of unknown cause,  says NICHD s Dr. Valerie Maholmes, who oversees studies of pediatric trauma and critical illness. The approach will need to be further tested and validated in larger groups to assess its potential for clinical use.","Published: September 14, 2016"

And that internal structure can be changed by small cues from outside. A group of scientists at the University of Chicago s Institute for Molecular Engineering has found a way to exploit this property to turn liquid crystals into a tool to manipulate the shape of synthetic cell membranes. The technique has potential for use in biology, medicine, and advanced materials development.   What we ve done is reproduced the beginnings of cell division in a synthetic system,  said Juan de Pablo, the Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering, who headed the group. When a cell divides, the spherical cell membrane stretches into an elliptical form, develops a waist in the middle, and then splits into two spherical cells. The scientists built sophisticated models that produced this behavior on the computer and then reproduced it in the real world, testing the model s predictions.  It s the first time that this has been done,  said de Pablo.  It s a system that has been engineered at the molecular level using computer models.  Cellular stand-ins Standing in for cells in the experiments were capsules, or  vesicles,  a few microns in diameter (a fraction the width of a human hair) made of some of the same phospholipids that make up real cell membranes. These were immersed in a bath of liquid crystal oil whose molecules are slightly elongated rather than round. At temperatures above 97 degrees Fahrenheit, the oil behaves like any other oil. But when the temperature is lowered slightly, the molecules of the oil pack tightly against one another like cigarettes and align along a single direction.  When that happens, the liquid crystal presses on the vesicle more in one direction than in the other, so the vesicle becomes elongated,  de Pablo said.  If you squash it more and more, it becomes an ellipsoid, and the two ends become pointier and pointier. There is a point when the molecules around those points separate from one another and create a little gap in the membrane through which things could be squeezed out.  Lipid vesicles are in current use for drug delivery. De Pablo envisions using the liquid crystal technique as a cunning way to control that process.  What we find intriguing is that we have a mechanism that will allow us to take vesicles loaded with something interesting, and by changing the temperature a little bit, we could deform the vesicle and have it squeeze out whatever it has inside without our ever touching the vesicle. And then as we restore the temperature to the original value, the vesicle becomes spherical again.  Calculations indicate that squeezing more or less would alter the size of the gap, allowing for the release of contents of varying sizes.  But that s something that we still have to demonstrate,  said de Pablo.","Published: September 14, 2016"

To mark the launch of the library Dr John Harris (Ubiquigent Scientific Advisory Board member) will be presenting DUBtarget -001 at the Society of Chemical Industry (SCI) conference   Innovation in design, supply and acquisition for compound screening libraries. Ubiquigent, in collaboration with the Drug Discovery Unit (DDU) at the University of Dundee, have jointly developed the library to support both commercial and academic researchers looking to either enter the ubiquitin drug discovery field or to support those with active programmes but who are seeking access to additional chemical diversity. The design of DUBtarget -001 (led by Dr Andrew Woodland of the DDU) has been informed by DUB-related structural data to yield a library with the potential to have activity across multiple DUB families. Ubiquigent has already screened the library against USP2 (a DUB with potential roles in oncology) and demonstrated a significant number of hits from different structural classes. These structures represent multiple starting points with the potential to lead to the development of novel therapeutic and tool compounds. The library is now available in either its physical form for screening within researchers  own laboratories or as a dataset where the library will be screened against any of the 40 other DUB enzymes included within Ubiquigent s DUBprofiler  screening platform. Ubiquigent s Executive Chairman, Dr Mark Treherne commented: ""DUB-targeted libraries are the keys that can unlock the multiple therapeutic opportunities that are emerging for the exploitation of novel DUB inhibitors. DUBtarget -001 is the first of a pipeline of innovative libraries that will link ubiquitin research to new drug discovery opportunities for oncology, neurodegeneration and many other chronic diseases with significant unmet medical need."" Dr John Harris noted:  As has become clear in the kinase inhibitor field, the application of libraries that have been custom-designed with the structure and mechanism of the drug target(s) in mind is expected to be a substantially more effective route to innovative and potent starting-points for DUB candidate drugs than target-agnostic screening approaches.

The findings highlight the importance of developing early interventions to improve microbial health in young infants. The new paper, published September 12, 2016 in Nature Medicine, shows that the gut microbes present in some one-month-old infants predict a three-fold higher risk of developing allergic reactions by age two and asthma by age four. The paper demonstrates that the perturbed microbial ecosystem present in these at-risk babies produces molecules that reduce the abundance of a key type of immune cell known to help prevent allergy. The researchers surmise that having fewer of these cells leads to a hyperactive immune system and eventually to chronic asthmatic inflammation of the lungs. Co-senior author Susan Lynch, PhD, a UCSF associate professor of medicine, says she believes the discovery represents an opportunity to develop new treatments that could stave off allergies and asthma before they become established.  If we are to prevent disease development, we need to intervene early,  Lynch said.  Currently, children are typically six or seven years old when they are diagnosed with asthma, which has no cure and has to be managed through medication. But if the genesis of the disease is visible as a disruption of gut microbiota in the very earliest stages of postnatal life, it raises an exciting question: could we reengineer the community of microbes in at-risk infants to prevent allergic asthma from developing?  Emerging Science About Beneficial Microbes Numerous studies in recent years have tied early exposure to beneficial microbes in the environment to a host of positive health effects. Breast-feeding, vaginal births (as opposed to C-sections) and even having dogs in the household during the first year of life are all associated with protective effects against allergies and asthma. Recently, researchers at the University of British Columbia reported that three-month-old infants with low levels of four key types of gut bacteria were significantly more likely to show early warning signs of asthma at their first birthdays than infants with normal levels of these bugs.  We have been working for over a decade, trying to figure out why some children get asthma and allergies and some don t,  said co-senior author Christine Cole Johnson, PhD, MPH, who is chair of public health sciences in the Henry Ford Health System.  It seems that the microbial communities within the body could be the keystone to understanding this and a number of different immune diseases.  Since 2003, Johnson s lab has been tracking a variety of early life risk factors for asthma in a racially and socio-economically diverse population of infants born in and around Detroit. In this study   the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS)   Henry Ford researchers conducted repeated follow-up appointments during the first year of life, then tested the infants for allergies at the age of two and for asthma around their fourth birthdays. As part of this study, Johnson s team collected stool samples from the diapers of the infants and kept them on ice. Years later, Johnson connected with Lynch, whose lab specializes in human microbiome research, and the two researchers teamed up to discover how soon after birth they could detect microbiome differences predictive of asthma later in life, and why these microbes were so influential in triggering the disease.  We went back to the freezers and pulled out the stool samples and shipped them over to UCSF, where the Lynch lab was able to use new genetic technology to examine them for the entire microbial community that had been there in these infants,  Johnson said.  Technology has really changed   you couldn t have done that 10 years ago.  Lynch and her team used high-throughput genetic analysis of the stool samples to map the gut microbes of 130 young infants around one-month of age   so-called neonates. This analysis, which was the first study of both bacterial and fungal diversity in the neonatal gut, found that the babies fell into one of three distinct groups, each characterized by different types of bacterial and fungal species in the gut. Based on the Henry Ford team s two-year and four-year follow-up data, the smallest of these three groups (11 of 130 infants) were three times more likely to develop atopy and asthma than the rest of the infants. The size of this at-risk group was strikingly consistent with the rate of allergic asthma in the general population, Lynch said, and the microbial diversity analysis showed that these infants were missing certain normal gut bacteria and also that they possessed abnormally high levels of certain resident fungal species. To learn how the abnormal complement of gut microbes in these high-risk infants might cause the hypersensitive immune reactions that characterize atopy and asthma, the UCSF team studied the microbes  metabolic byproducts   molecules in the stool samples that could offer clues about what these microbes had been up to in the gut. They discovered that the guts of neonates with healthy microbiomes contained a wide range of molecules that can reduce inflammation. These include a set of fat molecules, or lipids, that the researchers suspect nourish immune cells called T-regulatory cells, whose job is to keep the rest of the immune system in check. In contrast, these key anti-inflammatory lipids were absent in the guts of at-risk babies. Instead, the researchers detected different fats, including one associated with asthma in adults, called  12, 13 DIHOME.  Further experiments found that even healthy, adult immune cells became hyper-sensitized after being exposed to just the byproducts of the at-risk babies  gut microbiomes, and that 12, 13 DIHOME in particular could reduce the number of T-regulatory cells. The researchers suspect that gut microbes play a key role in processing dietary components such as fats, giving them a powerful influence over whether anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory molecules end up in the gut.  Asthma has doubled in prevalence in modern  westernized  societies about every 20 years for the past 60 or 70 years, so an effective strategy for prevention is becoming an urgent need for public health,  added Homer Boushey, MD, a professor of medicine at UCSF, and member of the research team. The new paper is among the first to go beyond simply cataloging differences in microbes between children who do or do not go on to develop asthma, he said:  By focusing on the differences in microbial functions   in their metabolic products and their effects on immune function   this kind of study helps define the pathway we ll need to follow to prevent this disease.  Hope to Spur Testing, Interventions The researchers also examined a number of environmental and socioeconomic factors to learn why some children developed a high-risk gut microbiome profile, but only found a couple strong links: namely that male infants were more likely to have the problem than females, and also that those who didn t have dogs in the home were also more at risk, in line with the authors earlier findings.  Humans have co-evolved with microbes and as a result we rely on their genomes for certain critical functions. We believe this is particularly true during the earliest stages of human development,  Lynch said.  But lifestyles have changed dramatically over the past several decades: We ve significantly reduced our exposure to these environmental microbes our bodies rely on. Having a dog track the external environment into the home may be just one way to improve the breadth of microbes babies are exposed to in very early life.  Lynch and Johnson s groups also published a second paper in the journal Scientific Reports on Aug. 31, 2016, detailing for the first time how numerous socioeconomic, environmental and demographic factors intersect to influence microbiome composition in the WHEALS children, without reference to particular disease risk factors. The researchers hope the findings of these two papers will spur development of tests to detect signs of an unhealthy gut microbiome in infants and to implement early-life interventions to shift microbial ecosystems toward a healthier state.","Published: September 14, 2016"

This includes  Crosswalk Insight: Oncology  (Crosswalk), a precision medicine knowledge visualization and decision support platform. Inspirata plans to integrate Crosswalk with its Digital Pathology Cockpit and its Cancer Information Data Trust (CIDT) to enhance the precision medicine tools and services available in these products. When a cancer center engages Inspirata for an end-to-end digital pathology workflow solution, each pathologist at the institution receives a Digital Pathology Cockpit, which provides single-sign-on access to all of the patient s institution-based diagnostic data, including Whole Slide Images (WSI). This enables pathologists to quickly gain insights about the patient s history so they can work faster and make better informed decisions. With the addition of Crosswalk these capabilities are extended to encompass actionable multidisciplinary medical data, comprising genomic profiles, clinical trials and personalized therapies. Crosswalk aggregates this information in a cloud-based platform with an intuitive user interface for easy access and navigation. According to Precision Medicine Network s Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer, Mark Boguski, MD, PhD,  The rapid pace of discovery and change in cancer diagnosis and care has created a pervasive knowledge gap between what is possible and what is actually available for precision diagnosis and personalized treatment inside a healthcare system. Through Crosswalk, we ve been able to connect our users to information about disease types, biomarkers and companion diagnostics, molecular biological pathways, as well as available drugs and clinical trials. When pathologists have this information at their fingertips in Inspirata s Digital Pathology Cockpit, they will be able to provide a more precise diagnosis and recommend treatment options tailored to the individual patient. Precision diagnosis is a critical component of precision medicine and an essential contributor to value-based care.

One of the studies, by Johns Hopkins University scientists in collaboration with many other groups, turned up unexpected hints that biochemical signals controlling blood pressure may spring from within cells that line blood vessels themselves. The three studies appear Sept. 12 in the journal Nature Genetics. The study, with first author Georg Ehret, M.D., a research associate at Johns Hopkins, was a so-called genomewide association study involving information gathered on 342,415 people of both European and non-European descent.  It s thought that about half the explanation for our blood pressure comes from environmental and lifestyle factors, like diet, exercise and smoking, and the other half is controlled by our genes,  says Aravinda Chakravarti, Ph.D., professor of medicine in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine s McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and leader of the Johns Hopkins component.  But as with many other complex, multigene traits, pinning down what those genes are is challenging.  Prior to the new studies now reported, Chakravarti says, his and other groups had identified some 90 sites in the genome as likely linked to blood pressure regulation, but in sum, they could not explain all variations in blood pressure measurements. To identify what the scientists were convinced had to be more sites, researchers from 265 institutions worldwide banded together to perform the genomewide association study. Participants  genomes were examined on computer-chiplike devices known as microarrays, which had been customized to simultaneously analyze nearly 200,000 sites in the genome where variations from person to person were suspected to have some effect on blood pressure. They then compared variants at the sites with information on each individual s blood pressure information to nail down likely associations. Ehret, a research associate in Chakravarti s lab, crunched the numbers from all the study sites and found variants at 66 sites in the genome   17 of them newly reported   that had statistically significant associations with blood pressure levels. At the same time, Ehret and Chakravarti were also involved in another of the studies reported in the new issue of Nature Genetics. That study identified 31 additional and distinct new blood pressure-related sites and confirmed a further 39 that had been previously reported. It used data from 327,288 people and focused on rare genetic variants. Still, says Ehret,  even taking all the known variants together, we explain only about 2 to 3 percent of the blood pressure variability between individuals.  He estimates there are  hundreds or thousands  of blood pressure-linked variants still to be found and says identifying them will require studies with even more participants. One benefit of gathering those missing genetic puzzle pieces would be to enable a genetic test to predict whether a person is likely to develop high blood pressure and, if so, would suggest early intervention, Ehret says. One surprising finding from the study co-led by Johns Hopkins, Ehret says, was that many of the new sites identified were near genes that are active in cells that line the inside of blood vessels, suggesting those cells are somehow involved directly in blood pressure control.  As a physician, I would have suspected the kidney, and perhaps the adrenal gland, of sending signals to control blood pressure,  he says.  But it seems that the blood vessels themselves may also be part of the cause of hypertension.  High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects one in three adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, but most people with high blood pressure aren t aware they have it.","Published: September 14, 2016"

These altered virus particles are known as A-particles, or virus entry intermediates. In previous experiments, exposing a virus to extreme heat or proteins caused the shape of the entire capsid shell to change. These were the closest observable simulations to a virus invading a cell that had been devised at the time.  Using these lab tricks, my lab and those of other researchers were able to create high-resolution structures of the altered virus particles, but all of these tricks were triggering the capsid from all directions,  said Susan Hafenstein, assistant professor of medicine and microbiology and immunology, Penn State College of Medicine. Hafenstein hypothesized that in a more realistic simulation, only the part of the virus that interacted with receptors on the cell would change shape. In the new experiment, Hafenstein and her coinvestigators simulated the surface of a cell by using mock membranes called nanodiscs. They inserted human cell receptors   protein molecules that let outside signals into the cell   into the nanodiscs, the first time this has been done to capture a virus capsid. The results were reported in a recent edition of the journal Science Advances.  This particular receptor has a long tail that it buries into the cell membrane,  Hafenstein explained.  In our experiment, it buried its tail into the nanodisc, giving us a mock membrane displaying the appropriate receptor to bind to the virus.  The researchers then added virus capsids to the receptor-membranes and observed the resulting changes to the capsid shell using an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy. When the thousands of 2D images they took were reassembled into a 3D capsid   much like a CAT scan   they found that previously observed shape changes only happened on the focused site where the receptors bound to the virus.  Our work shows that a pore only opens up at that one point of interaction with the host cell,  Hafenstein said.  And that s what s going to set up the capsid to release the genetic material into the cell. We think we have captured the first physiologically accurate virus capsid prepared to enter the host. All the ones that we had studied previously showed changes taking place all over the capsid, but now we know the changes the virus has to make only happen in one spot, next to the host membrane.  A recent advance to cryo-electron microscopy   direct electron detecting   made the observation possible.  This way of taking images has allowed us to take really fast images that can then be corrected into perfect data,  Hafenstein said.  Now we can get atomic resolution using cryoEM.  The researchers used a virus called coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in their experiment. CVB3 is a type of picornavirus, a family of rapidly mutating small RNA viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to pancreatitis to polio. RNA viruses a group that also includes HIV change every time they replicate. These highly-mutating viruses can escape antiviral medications. The ultimate goal is to understand intricacies in the steps of the virus life cycle, such as how the virus enters the host cell, to direct antivirals to those specific steps, Hafenstein said.  Then, if the virus mutates away to escape the drug, it will also lose the ability to enter the cell.  Next, Hafenstein s group plans to use a larger nanodisc to capture the process of the virus interacting with the mock membrane.  Because the nanodiscs in this set of experiments were so small, we re not getting the best picture of the interaction, and that s one place to improve,  she said. This, she hopes, will reveal  the most important step figuring out what triggers the release of the RNA into the cell. ","Published: September 14, 2016"

The team, led by Dr Nasreen Akhtar from the University s Department of Oncology and Metabolism, made the breakthrough while studying the female breast to better understand how the organ gets rid of dead cells and surplus milk when it is no longer required. In pregnancy, specialized epithelial cells within the breast grow to form alveoli that secrete milk. When the milk supply is no longer required the alveoli die and the breast reverts back to a non-pregnancy state. Breast epithelia also line the mammary ducts which transport milk towards the nipple when required. Through gene deletion studies, Dr Akhtar and her team found the Rac1 protein is crucial both for the secretion of milk and its removal in the drying-up period that follows. Inflammatory phagocytes from the immune system are normally recruited to clear up dead cells lurking in tissues and surplus fluids. If too many are recruited for extended periods, they can trigger inflammation within tissues, causing damage. The study found that the breast epithelia use Rac1 to evade harmful inflammatory phagocytes from the immune system by hijacking their job. In the first few days after weaning, live breast epithelia eat their dying neighbours and swallow all of the secretions, clearing the ducts from old milk and dead cells. The phagocyte-like breast epithelia then die themselves and these are subsequently cleared up by professional phagocytes from the immune system. Dr Akhtar said:  By doing the job themselves, the breast epithelia limit both the numbers and time of immune phagocyte infiltration which protects the tissue from becoming damaged.  Without Rac1, the dead cells and milk flood the interconnecting breast ducts causing them to bloat and triggering chronic inflammation. The bloated ducts then fail to regenerate and produce milk in a future pregnancy.  Dr Akhtar originally began the research in 2009 in collaboration with Professor Charles Streuli whilst at the University of Manchester.  It is thought that we shed the equivalent of our own body weight in dead cells every year,  said Dr Ahktar.  However, very little is known about how we get rid of them. If immune phagocytes were the only cell type to clear up cell corpses our bodies would be continuously inflamed. It s quite likely that epithelial engulfment occurs in many other organs because this cell type forms the building blocks of our bodies. Over 90 per cent of cancers come from epithelial cells which is why unlocking the mystery of how they work is essential. It is fundamental to understand how healthy cells work properly in order to fully appreciate why they go wrong when cancer develops, and how best to combat the disease. The study, which is published today (Monday 12 September 2016) in the journal Developmental Cell will be hugely beneficial to cancer biologists. Dr Akhtar added:  Rac1 is over expressed in various cancers including breast cancer and Rac1 inhibitors are currently being considered as anticancer therapies.  However, until now virtually nothing was understood about what Rac1 does in healthy tissue and our study shows that in the breast one of its central roles is to prevent harmful inflammatory responses. Without Rac1 these responses are heightened and prolonged within tissues.  Given that sustained inflammation is linked to cancer progression, the findings show that blocking Rac1 might not be a good idea. ","Published: September 14, 2016"

Understanding why and how this synchronization spreads would be a critical tool in treating severe epilepsy. In a study published in Neuron, an interdisciplinary team of University of Pennsylvania researchers has identified a new explanation for this phenomenon. Using a computer model based on direct brain recordings from epilepsy patients, they are the first to show the existence of a network of neural regions that can push or pull on the synchronization of the regions directly involved in a seizure. See Also: Researchers find an important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures With further study, this regulatory network could be a more effective target for epilepsy therapies, including implantable stimulation devices that would help quiet a localized seizure before it spreads throughout the brain. The study was led by Danielle Bassett, Eduardo D. Glandt Faculty Fellow and associate professor in the Department of Bioengineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Brian Litt, professor of neurology and neurosurgery in Penn's Perelman School of Medicine and of bioengineering in Engineering and director of the Penn Epilepsy Center, and Ankit Khambhati, Bassett's postdoctoral fellow and a recent graduate of the Litt Lab. Medicine's Kathryn Davis, assistant professor of neurology, and Timothy Lucas, assistant professor of neurosurgery and co-director of the Penn Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics, also contributed to the work As a network scientist, Bassett studies how the interconnections between members of a group influence the behavior of the whole. Looking at epilepsy through that lens, she, Litt, and Khambhati developed a computer model of seizure networks based on brain recordings from Penn's epilepsy patients. An earlier study using that model showed that the algorithms in the model can predict where in the brain a seizure will originate and which groups of neurons it will likely spread to as it grows. Learn More: Human stem cell-derived neuron transplants reduce seizures in mice In their new study, the researchers aimed to understand how focal seizures, which are limited to only a part of the brain, become general seizures, which spread throughout the brain and are therefore more dangerous and debilitating. ""For people with epilepsy, there are a number of areas of the brain that are really broken that's the seizure-generating network,"" Bassett said. ""Our hypothesis was that there is a separate regulatory network that is usually able to quiet the seizure, and for people whose seizures generalize, that regulatory network is also broken."" ""No one has really talked about this regulatory network before,"" she said. In their new study, the researchers have shown that this second network acts on the one directly involved in the seizure, influencing whether the pathological synchronization remains confined to a local area or spreads across the brain. ""As a dysfunction in the ability of the brain to regulate the communication of information between brain regions,"" Khambhati said, ""seizures can be thought of as a traffic flow problem. If, on one hand, all the traffic lights at an intersection are green, drivers from all directions attempt to cross at once, in complete synchrony, leading to a jam. On the other hand, if all the lights are red, drivers remain stationary and information ceases to flow. The most efficient road network should coordinate traffic flow where different groups of drivers are moving and stopped at different times."" To study how seizure networks synchronize and desynchronize, the researchers added a new dimension to their simulation. Using a technique known as ""virtual cortical resection,"" they could simulate the surgical removal of different sections of the brain. Resection of regions implicated in the seizure network is a last-ditch treatment for severe epilepsy; using virtual cortical resection, the researchers could test the impact of targeting the regulatory network instead. ""Our virtual cortical resection technique,"" Khambhati said, ""enables us to map the locations of synchronizing, or green-light, and desynchronizing, or red-light, brain regions that facilitate the flow of information. Intuitively, our results showed that seizures are more likely to spread in brain networks with a weaker capacity to limit traffic flow via desynchronizing brain regions."" ""In engineering terms,"" Bassett said, ""we think this regulatory network has what is known as a 'push-pull regulatory control.' There are some regions of the regulatory network that can push the seizure network into a less active state, or pull it out of that state."" This ""push-pull"" mechanism appears to work in a manner similar to other biological processes that maintain homeostasis, such as the regulation of heart rate or body temperature, but the researchers are the first to show this kind of regulatory network for epilepsy.

The researchers  observations of how Zika virus arrested fetal brain formation in a pigtail macaque could provide a model for testing therapeutic interventions.  See Also: Zika virus tested in brain precursor cells The findings are reported in Nature Medicine.  Our results remove any lingering doubt that the Zika virus is incredibly dangerous to the developing fetus and provides details as to how the brain injury develops,  noted Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, the lead author of the study and a University of Washington (UW) Medicine physician and researcher, and a UW professor of obstetrics and gynecology who specializes in maternal and fetal infections.  This study brings us closer to determining if a Zika vaccine or therapy will prevent fetal brain injury, but also be safe to take in pregnancy,  she added.    This is the only direct evidence that shows that the Zika virus can cross the placenta late in pregnancy and affect the fetal brain by shutting down certain aspects of brain development,  said one of the study s senior authors, Dr. Michael Gale Jr., a UW professor of immunology. An expert on how the body responds to viruses, he directs the UW Medicine Center for Innate Immunity and Immune Disease. Gale explained that the study results met Koch s Postulate, which establishes the criteria for determining if a microorganism is a causative agent for a disease or disorder. Adams Waldorf, Gale and Dr. Lakshmi Rajagopal, UW associate professor of pediatrics, led the project.  Rajagopal studies pregnancy and newborn infectious diseases at Seattle Children s Research Institute and UW Medicine.  We were shocked when we saw the first MRI [magnetic resonance image] of the fetal brain 10 days after viral inoculation.  We had not predicted that such a large area of the fetal brain would be damaged so quickly,  Rajagopal noted.  Our results suggest that a therapy to prevent fetal brain injury must either be a vaccine or a prophylactic medicine taken at the time of the mosquito bite to neutralize the virus.  Learn More: Mouse models of Zika in pregnancy show how fetuses become infected  She added,  By the time a pregnant woman develops symptoms, the fetal brain may already be affected and damaged.   Our entire team is deeply committed to developing an animal model in which we can rapidly test a vaccine or therapy to determine if we can prevent fetal brain injury caused by the Zika virus,  said Adams Waldorf.  Primates, including people, are an order of mammals that share many features of brain development.  Non-human and human primates  gestations also have key similarities.  These include the structure of the placenta, the timing of nerve and brain development, and the resulting proportions of gray and white matter in the brain. Previously, no experimental animal model closely emulated the effects of Zika virus infection during human pregnancy.   While the virus can cause fetal demise in mice, mouse models have not enabled medical researchers to delve into the causal relationships between Zika virus infection and fetal brain injury.   The Zika virus is transmitted by certain types of mosquitoes, including the Aedes egypti mosquito.  It is a flavivirus, part of a group of insect-carried viruses that cause illness throughout the world.  Other mosquito-borne flaviviruses are West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, and the Japanese encephalitis virus.  In some cases, those infections can become complicated by severe nervous system inflammation. In contrast, the symptoms of a Zika virus infection are often milder.  Some people have no symptoms and others develop fever, muscle aches, rash, and sore, swollen eyes.  However, contracting the Zika virus during pregnancy is a serious concern, because the fetal brain may be destroyed or quit developing.  The Zika prenatal study took place during the equivalent of the third trimester of a human gestation.  The amount of virus inoculated in this study approximated what a person might contract from the probing and biting of an infected, feeding mosquito. The pregnant animal did not show any significant symptoms of infection, such as fever or rash.  The white matter of the fetal brain, which is important for coordinating communication between different parts of the brain, stopped growing about three weeks after viral inoculation. If the study continued one additional month with the same trajectory of brain growth, microcephaly, a condition where the brain is abnormally small, would have occurred. The study brought together scientists and physicians from the fields of obstetrics, virology, molecular microbiology, immunology, pediatrics, pathology, radiology, neurology, medicine, bioengineering bioinformatics, neurological surgery, primatology and other fields. The researchers in the Nature Medicine study listed some brain development problems that could affect some infants whose mothers had a Zika virus infection during pregnancy.  These might include a loss of brain cells and brain cell connections, enlargement of the fluid-containing brain cavities, a smaller-than-normal hindbrain (a part of the brain that controls movement and other functions), and vision problems from disruptions in the optic nerve. In addition, they found that the Zika viral genome was also present in other fetal tissues including, eye, liver and kidney. Read Next: New report details pre- and postnatal brain defects from Zika virusThis research revealed conclusively that the Zika virus had crossed from the mother through the placenta and into the fetal brain.  In fact, Gale pointed out, the virus level in the fetus s brain was higher than that in the mother. A big question, Gale said, was how long the virus stays in the system during pregnancy and fetal development. He explained that the presence of the Zika virus in some way perturbs the normal balance of brain development by pushing the brain to build up too much supportive structure and not enough nerve cell structure.  This alters the brain shape, size and function. The Zika virus used in the study was a 2010 Cambodian strain that is nearly genetically identical to the strain now found in Brazil.

Using the Company s knowledge of synthetic biology, the new vaccine will be active against both modes of Zika transmission - insect-borne (antibody-mediated) and sexually transmitted (mucosal and cell-mediated) infections   the first to do so.  Zika is spreading fast. According to the World Health Organisation, 67 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2015. Sexual transmission also complicates the spread of the disease in areas where people are being bitten by mosquitoes such as Brazil and Colombia. In fact, Zika s ability to spread through sexual contact means that all countries are at risk, whether Zika mosquitoes are found there or not. A vaccine that protects against both transmission routes is the only way to offer the maximum safeguard and stop the spread. Prokarium s CEO Ted Fj llman commented:  We use a safe bacterium, which is swallowed and then enters into the immune cells of the gut lining to produce vaccine there. The oral delivery means that we kick-start mucosal immunity, the body s first defence against infection in e.g. the gut, nose or the vaginal tract. The production of vaccine from within immune cells means that our approach causes few or zero side effects, while crucially initiating cellular immunity, which is very important for combatting viruses like Zika.  Steve Chatfield, Chairman of Prokarium, added,  The Small Business Research Initiative innovation procurement contract is from the UK Department of Health and the UK Vaccine Network, administered by Innovate UK. It will help Prokarium and our partner, Public Health England, to develop an orally delivered Zika vaccine. This places Prokarium at centre-stage of a few selected organisations that will help the UK to build an independent rapid response capability against emerging epidemics.  Prokarium s Zika project is a one-year programme starting 1st October 2016 and aims to show pre-clinically that the vaccine can protect against vaginal Zika challenge. If successful, it is anticipated that a phase 1 clinical trial could be started in 2018. The project is a part of a  2M funding received for developing three vaccines against plague (anti-bioterror), bacterial diarrhoea and Zika.","Published: September 13, 2016"

Biological therapeutics represented seven of the top ten best selling drugs of 2015, and they feature extensively in developmental pipelines.  Access to bioproduction cell lines for their manufacture can be cost prohibitive, and is often restricted in ways that prevent their further optimisation by customers. This stifles innovation and can impede the launch of biological therapeutics due to the challenge of generating bioproduction cell lines that meet the needs of commercial release. Horizon is using its expertise in genome engineering to improve biological therapeutics manufacturing. As well as developing a tool box of cell lines for the manufacture of a range of current and next generation biological therapeutics, Horizon aims to encourage innovation in other organisations by allowing access to its state of the art bioproduction cell line platform (CHO SOURCE) under flexible licensing terms that include allowing the further modification of cells. This agreement allows any organisation, through CPI or NIBRT, to access Horizon s state of the art biomanufacturing cell lines for research purposes, benefiting the global bioprocessing community by allowing access to cutting edge bioproduction cell lines at an early stage of drug or technology development. This initiative reinforces Horizon s reputation as a leader and innovator, well positioned to support new biomanufacturing programmes whether in the UK or globally.  Upon completion of these studies, it is anticipated that many organisations will continue to use Horizon s cell lines, thereby establishing a long-term revenue stream for these high value products as they transition to use for commercial manufacture. Darrin Disley, CEO, Horizon Discovery, commented:  Horizon is committed to driving innovation in bioprocessing.

Under the agreement, iSpecimen will serve as the exclusive channel partner for the Mayo Clinic Cancer/Normal Serum Biobank, connecting biomedical researchers with the samples and associated data for their studies. The Cancer/Normal Serum Biobank, located on Mayo Clinic s campus in Rochester, Minnesota, includes approximately 130,000 frozen vials of serum from about 17,000 unique, consented patients. The samples were collected between 1975 and 1990 across 85 different malignant and benign conditions. iSpecimen, which works to procure annotated samples for life science researchers, will manage the serum inventory and associated data through its cloud-based technology solution, matching researchers to the right samples to fuel their studies.  As is the case with many biorepositories, intensive resources have been put into creating a variety of sample collections along with state-of-the-art facilities,  said Stephen Thibodeau, Ph.D., the David F. and Margaret T. Grohne Director, Biorepositories Program, Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine.  But despite holding thousands of sought-after samples, the biorepository is underutilized by external researchers. iSpecimen presented an opportunity for us to work with them to efficiently move these specimens into the hands of many more scientists studying cancer and related conditions, which ultimately should result in better treatments.  With the surge of precision medicine, and particularly increased interest and funding for cancer research, as evidenced by initiatives such as the Cancer Moonshot and Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Mayo Clinic s Cancer/Normal Serum Biobank presents research value not only due to the thousands of serum samples it holds, but also due to the longitudinal nature of many of the samples. Also of considerable value is the clinical annotation accompanying the samples; this includes patient demographics, blood collection data, tumor information, treatment information, and status of tumor at time of blood collection.

The teams also discovered that Con-Ins G1 was able bind to human insulin receptors, signifying the potential for its translation into a human therapeutic. Associate Professor Mike Lawrence from Melbourne s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research led a collaborative study between the University of Utah, the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, La Trobe University and Flinders University. Associate Professor Lawrence, a specialist in the structure of insulins and their receptors, said the teams utilised the Australian Synchrotron to create and analyse the three-dimensional structure of this cone snail venom insulin protein with exciting results.  We found that cone snail venom insulins work faster than human insulins by avoiding the structural changes that human insulins undergo in order to function   they are essentially primed and ready to bind to their receptors,   Associate Professor Lawrence said. Associate Professor Lawrence said human insulins could be considered  clunky  by comparison.  The structure of human insulins contain an extra  hinge  component that has to open before any  molecular handshake  or connection between insulin and receptor can take place.  By studying the three-dimensional structure of this snail venom insulin we ve found how to dispense with this  hinge  entirely, which may accelerate the cell signalling process and thus the speed with which the insulin takes effect.  Associate Professor Lawrence said. Published today in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, the team s findings build on earlier studies from 2015, when the University of Utah reported that the marine cone snail Conus geographus used an insulin-based venom to trap its prey. Unsuspecting fish prey would swim into the invisible trap and immediately become immobilised in a state of hypoglycaemic shock induced by the venom. Dr Helena Safavi-Hemami from the University of Utah said it was fascinating to uncover how the cone snail insulin was able to have such a rapid effect on its prey and, furthermore, that the peptide had therapeutic potential in humans.  We were thrilled to find that the principles of cone snail venom insulins could be applied to a human setting,  Dr Safavi-Hemami said.  Our Flinders University colleagues have shown that the cone snail insulin can  switch on  human insulin cell signalling pathways, meaning the cone snail insulin is able to successfully bind to human receptors,  Dr Safavi-Hemami said.  The next step in our research, which is already underway, is to apply these findings to the design of new and better treatments for diabetes, giving patients access to faster-acting insulins,  she said.","Published: September 13, 2016"

Mice lacking the gene age prematurely, while mice with extra copies live longer. One of the molecular functions of SIRT6 is to help repair DNA when the strands of the molecule break. While such disruptions are a result of normal chemical processes that take place in cells, the damage has been linked to aging, as well as several age-related diseases. But how SIRT6 is activated has been unknown.  Now a research team led by Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov, professors of biology at the University of Rochester, has discovered a protein that may serve as a first responder, activating SIRT6 and setting in motion a cascade of molecular activity to repair the damaged DNA.  We wanted to find how SIRT6 receives its signal to spring into action. Once we learn that, we may be able to activate SIRT6 even without stress,  said Gorbunova, who is the Doris Johns Cherry Professor in the Department of Biology. To find out what activates SIRT6, the researchers alternately applied chemical inhibitors to human skin cells to determine which proteins were essential in getting the gene to repair the broken DNA strands. They discovered that one protein was involved in activating the gene in response to oxidative stress c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which goes by the simpler term JNK.  When JNK was inhibited, SIRT6 was not activated and the broken strands of DNA were not repaired efficiently. The findings have been published in the journal Cell Reports. To communicate stress signals within cells, JNKs add phosphate groups to proteins, and the Rochester study found the amino acid residue on SIRT6 that is modified by JNK.  Once modified, SIRT6 can attract the enzyme PARP1 (Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1) to the damaged site, where the enzyme undertakes a chemical process to repair the DNA. In effect, the activated gene serves as a first responder, recruiting DNA repair enzymes to the accident site and getting them to work. The study is the latest work by Gorbunova and Seluanov to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that drive the aging process. Their previous work involved understanding the prominence of an inferior DNA repair process later in life, as well as how errant DNA fragments called jumping genes are typically kept inactive. Understanding the molecular, chemical, and genetic process of aging has implications for both longevity and quality of life. While more research and clinical work need to be done, such studies help pave the way for possible treatments in the future. For example, Seluanov says the results may allow pharmaceutical researchers to one day design drugs that activate SIRT6 in ways that reduce molecular damage.  These drugs may be used to protect our genomes from damage, and could ultimately prevent cancer and extend healthy lifespan,  he says.","Published: September 13, 2016"

In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at Penn s ACC, mutations detected from liquid biopsies (cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) captured from blood) closely paralleled the mutations from tissue biopsies identified in next generation sequencing tests: EGRF, TP53, and ALK, to name a few. What s more, in several cases, liquid biopsies captured clinically relevant mutations not found in tissue biopsies as patients  disease progressed. These data add to the growing evidence supporting the use of liquid biopsies, particularly when tissue samples are nonexistent or hard to obtain, as is often the case with lung cancer and other cancers that have metastasized throughout the body. About half of the 102 patients in this study did not have sequenceable biopsy tissue, so researchers relied on blood tests to detect mutations.  In addition, clinicians are now seeing the emergence of targetable resistance mutations in advanced NSCLC as the disease progresses and therapies change.  Keeping up with such an evolution is not as feasible with traditional tissue biopsies, the authors said, but much more plausible with serial blood samples.  This represents a bit of a paradigm shift,  said senior author Erica L. Carpenter, PhD, MBA, director of the Circulating Tumor Material Laboratory and research assistant professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  The tissue biopsy sequencing result has been considered the gold standard against which one compares the ctDNA result. Our work suggests that one can act on a ctDNA result, even in the absence of the so-called gold standard, and get a clinical response in these patients. It also offers the advantage of testing without discomfort to the patient and possible risks associated with invasive biopsies.  Importantly, the study addresses an urgent, unmet need articulated in the recently released  Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel Report 2016  that called for more efforts toward the development of non-invasive tests for markers, including ctDNA, to accelerate the ability to detect the emergence of drug-resistant disease.  Being able to accurately predict when a patient may develop drug resistance could have profound implications for selecting appropriate cancer therapies for individual patients,  states the report, which notes 10 key recommendations put forth by members of the Blue Ribbon Panel, including Chi Van Dang, MD, PhD, director of the ACC. In the study, researchers enrolled 102 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated at Penn between February 2015 and March 2016 who had blood samples sent for ctDNA testing as part of their routine clinical care. Most were women (68 percent) with adenocarcinoma (81 percent) and stage IV disease (96 percent), all with different courses of treatment. Liquid biopsy samples were collected in all 102 patients and sent to Guardant Health in California for genomic analysis; the 70 gene Guardant360 panel was utilized. Tissue samples were only able to be collected in 50 patients and subsequently analyzed at Penn s Center for Personalized Diagnostics with a 47-gene panel.   Among the 50 patients, 41 mutations were detected by both methods, while 24 therapeutically targetable driver EGFR mutations (a known driver of lung disease) were detected in tissue samples and 19 in ctDNA samples. Importantly, concordance between the two tests was nearly 100 percent when the samples were obtained concurrently, with discordance increasing when the blood samples were collected at longer intervals after the tissue sample. One explanation for this may be that the blood test can detect new mutations that have evolved to resist treatment and may not have been detectable at time of the initial tissue test. The EGFR T790M resistance mutation was identified in eight liquid samples and only four tissue samples. Serial liquid biopsies were also performed on six patients as part of disease surveillance, and in all six cases, the results helped guide clinical decision making, either by identifying a driver or resistance mutation amenable to targeted therapy, or by confirming that chemotherapy was likely the best course of action when a tissue sample was not possible. The researchers also described the clinical history of three of these patients for whom ctDNA detected the emergence of therapeutically targetable variants over the course of their therapy. One patient presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis, with a tissue biopsy detecting no variants in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1. Upon referral to Penn, ctDNA testing revealed an EML4-ALK translocation and a TP53 mutation, and the patient started on crizotinib monotherapy with significant improvement in symptoms. Two months following therapy, a repeat ctDNA test showed a decrease in EML4-ALK, and the TP53 mutation was undetectable, which correlated with symptomatic and radiographic improvement. The other two patients had similar success stories. To further understand the potential clinical actionability of ctDNA next generation sequencing, all detected mutations were also cross-referenced against available U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, off-label, or investigational therapies. The majority of patients (70 percent) were determined to have a relevant clinical trial available, 56 (55 percent) patients had an off-label targeted therapy that could potentially be used, and 32 (31 percent) patients had an FDA-approved therapy available to them to target the detected mutation.  Taken together, these data suggest that liquid biopsies for NSCLC patients can yield results with high clinical relevance, including detection of therapeutically targetable mutations in EGFR, ALK, and other genes. According to the authors, this is the largest study of its kind to use a clinical assay to monitor NSCLC patients. It also demonstrates for the first time the clinical utility of the non-invasive blood tests in patients for whom tissue analysis is not possible.  The next step is to evaluate the liquid biopsy s utility at diagnosis as a complement to tissue testing, and in the context of genetically heterogeneous metastatic disease. Here, the researchers reported on serial ctDNA testing for six patients, but indicated that larger scale studies will be required to further evaluate ctDNA monitoring for treatment selection, including patients for whom no therapeutically targetable mutations are detected and who may be candidates for checkpoint inhibitors.  The ever-expanding number of targeted therapies for lung cancer patients has been accompanied by a need for diagnostics with real-time detection of therapeutically targetable mutations,  said co-author Corey J. Langer, MD, a professor of Hematology/Oncology and director of the Thoracic Oncology Program in Penn s Abramson Cancer Center, and a treating physician on the trial.  More and more, liquid biopsies are proving to help fill this need. While tissue samples will likely remain a major part of the initial diagnostic process, this non-invasive approach appears to be another powerful tool in our toolbox to help determine the best course of treatment for lung cancer patients.

The pink region indicates that iCas is positioned at the DNA to perform its function. (Image source: A*STAR's Genome Institute of Singapore) Researchers in Singapore have developed a new protein that can alter DNA in living cells with much higher precision than current methods. The ability to alter DNA accurately will open more doors in the development of personalised medicine that could help to tackle human diseases that currently have few treatment options. Examples of diseases that have unmet therapeutic needs include neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophies, and blood disorders like sickle cell anaemia. This new protein, named iCas, can be easily controlled by an external chemical input and thus solves some of the problems with CRISPR-Cas[1], the existing gold-standard for DNA altering. For example, existing Cas enzymes may sometimes alter places in the DNA that result in dire consequences. With iCas, users now have the ability to control enzyme activity and thus minimize unintended DNA modifications in the cell. Developed by a collaboration between A*STAR's Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), iCas was published in the peer reviewed scientific journal Nature Chemical Biology this week. Leading the joint research team is Dr Tan Meng How, Senior Research Scientist of Stem Cell & Regenerative Biology at the GIS, and Assistant Professor at NTU's School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering. ""DNA is like an instruction manual that tells living cells how to behave, so if we can rewrite the instructions in this manual, we will be able to gain control over what the cells are supposed to do,"" explained Dr Tan. ""Our engineered iCas protein is like a light switch that can be readily turned on and off as desired. It also outperforms other existing methods in terms of response time and reliability."" How DNA altering works To ensure that DNA is precisely altered, which is required in many biomedical and biotechnological applications, the activity of the Cas protein must be tightly regulated. The chemical that switches the iCas protein on or off is tamoxifen, a drug commonly used to treat and prevent breast cancer. In its absence, iCas is switched off with no changes made to the DNA. When switched on with tamoxifen, iCas will then edit the target DNA site. In the study, iCas was found to outperform other chemical-inducible CRISPR-Cas technologies, with a much faster response time and an ability to be switched on and off repeatedly. The higher speed at which iCas reacts will enable tighter control over exactly where and when DNA editing takes place. This is useful in research or applications that demand precise control of DNA editing. For example, in studies of cell signalling pathways or vertebrate development, iCas can precisely target a subset of cells within a tissue (spatial control) or to edit the DNA at a particular developmental stage (temporal control). ""The iCas technology developed by Dr Tan is an exciting addition to the growing CRISPR toolbox. It enables genome editing in a precisely controlled manner, thus opening new doors for applications of the CRISPR technology in basic and applied biological research,"" said Dr Huimin Zhao, the Steven L. Miller Chair Professor of the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). GIS Executive Director Prof Ng Huck Hui added, ""This development allows the researchers to have precision control for more accurate DNA editing, and it can help researchers engineer cells with new properties or repair diseased cells with mutated DNA."" Prof Teoh Swee Hin, Chair of NTU's School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, said, ""DNA editing is an exciting field with many potential uses in the treatment of diseases. NTU has been active in research in the area of gene sequencing and bioengineering over the past years and this work by Dr Tan and his Singapore team will add to the growing body of knowledge in cell engineering for medicine."" [1] The CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) system is a powerful technology that can be used to manipulate the DNA in living cells. For instance, it can be used to correct disease-causing mutations in humans or to engineer improved agricultural crops with desirable traits to ensure food security.","Published: September 13, 2016"

The joint venture is based in Kendall Square in Cambridge. Onduo s mission is to help people with diabetes live full, healthy lives by developing comprehensive solutions that combine devices, software, medicine, and professional care to enable simple and intelligent disease management. Under the leadership of Onduo s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Joshua Riff, M.D., M.B.A., the company will leverage Verily s experience in miniaturized electronics, analytics, and consumer software development, and Sanofi s clinical expertise and experience in bringing innovative treatments to people living with diabetes. Dr. Riff joins Onduo from Optum, the health services company of UnitedHealth Group, where he was senior vice president of prevention and wellbeing.  My experience as a physician and in leading consumer health initiatives has shown me the daily burden of living with diabetes,  said Dr. Riff, CEO, Onduo.  From monitoring food intake to testing glucose levels to actively seeking medical care, the challenges both on the physical and mental well-being of a person living with diabetes are incredibly difficult. We want to develop solutions that allow people living with diabetes to focus on the things they love and enjoy in life by providing tools to make dealing with their diabetes less burdensome.  Initially, Onduo will focus on the type 2 diabetes community, specifically on developing solutions that could help people make better decisions about their day to day health, ranging from improved medication management to improved habits and goals. Over time, the company plans to expand its focus to include the type 1 diabetes community, and eventually to people at risk of developing diabetes with the goal of helping them better prevent the onset of the disease.  The integration of multiple interventions, such as data-driven patient support and devices in addition to treatment, can help improve outcomes, which is important from the perspective of patients, healthcare professionals and the overall healthcare system,   said Peter Guenter, Executive Vice President, Head, Global Diabetes & Cardiovascular Business Unit, Sanofi.  The new company Sanofi and Verily invested in will adopt a more service-centric approach and support doctors in their efforts to treat their patients more effectively.

The lawsuit alleges infringement of U.S. Patent 7,566,537 by QIAGEN s GeneReader NGS System.  While we are disappointed and disagree with the Court s decision, we believe our intellectual property position in next-generation sequencing is strong, and we are pursuing all legal means to get the current decision reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as soon as possible,  said Peer M. Schatz, Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN N.V.  The disputed intellectual property claim is related to a narrow step within the overall broad GeneReader NGS workflow. In addition, QIAGEN intends to accelerate the development already underway of an upgrade to the component under dispute to resume U.S. commercialization with a full workflow of at least comparable or even better performance. The issue in this case also applies only in the United States, so customers in all other regions of the world can continue to purchase and use the GeneReader NGS System.  The latest decision comes as part of a long-standing intellectual property dispute involving differences of opinion with a competitor and complex litigation among several entities. These types of disagreements are common in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries, where new product launches can trigger legal actions by other parties to defend their positions.  We are confident in QIAGEN s ability to continue to develop our franchise with the first Sample to Insight solution designed to deliver actionable insights. Our value proposition for the GeneReader NGS System goes far beyond the sequencing workflow step, since this system focuses on the insights that can be generated from a complete workflow. We are working to further enhance the overall performance, capabilities and applications of this unique system,"" Mr. Schatz added. No meaningful revenue contributions from the GeneReader NGS System were included in QIAGEN s internal financial forecasts for 2016 due to the early launch stage and the start of commercialization only in December 2015. As a result of this court decision, which only applies to the U.S., and also in light of the forthcoming upgrade to the component under dispute that is not expected to fall under this decision, QIAGEN does not expect a material financial impact from this decision on its financial outlook for full-year 2016 nor currently anticipates any material changes to its internal financial projections for 2017.

The team published their work in Biological Psychiatry.   Although medications are available for treating symptoms sometimes associated with ASD, such as anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and irritability, there are no medications currently approved for treatment of the core social interaction deficits in ASD, and the brain basis of these social interaction symptoms are still not well understood.  This research could significantly change our understanding of the causes and brain changes in autism and could lead to new treatment approaches for the harder-to-treat social aspects of ASD,  said senior author Edward S. Brodkin, MD, an associate professor of Psychiatry and director of the Adult Autism Spectrum Program.  Behavioral symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder have been attributed, in part, to aberrant connections between neurons, but the molecular underpinnings of ASD-related behavioral and brain physiology are largely unknown. Previous studies on human genetics have implicated a little-studied gene called Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) in ASD. PCDH10 is a neural cell adhesion molecule that is involved in brain development and the maintenance of synapses, the points of connections between neurons where neurotransmitters are released. The PCDH10 protein is expressed at high levels in particular brain regions, including the amygdala, which mediates emotion and motivation and is implicated in the social deficits of ASD. When one of the two copies of the Pcdh10 genewas deleted in mice, these animals   called Pcdh10+/- mice   showed reduced social approach behavior, which resembled the social withdrawal of humans with ASD. This effect was seen more prominently in males than in females, which is consistent with the male predominance of ASD in humans. In addition, the male Pcdh10+/- mice had anomalies in the structure and function of amygdala circuitry, as well as lower levels of certain types of glutamate receptor subunits (called NMDA receptor subunits) in the amygdala.     Social approach deficits in these male mice were rescued by giving them a medication called d-cycloserine, which binds to the glycine binding site on the NMDA receptor. This, in turn, boosts glutamate signaling at these receptors.  By enhancing NMDA-receptor signaling, the mice went from social avoidance to more typical social approach behavior,  Brodkin said.   This finding in the mouse model is also consistent with preliminary clinical studies in humans. D-cycloserine has been shown, in recent small studies, to significantly improve social interactions in older adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders.  The new study in Pcdh10+/- mice may give additional impetus to pursue these initial results in human studies with larger-scale clinical studies of d-cycloserine or related medications.  Along with collaborator Ted Abel, PhD, the Brush Family Professor of Biology at Penn, Brodkin is planning future studies with the mouse model to explore the biological mechanisms that cause the male Pcdh10+/- mice to show more severe social withdrawal than female Pcdh10+/- mice. This may elucidate the biology underlying the male preponderance of autism and will involve more detailed analysis of amygdala circuit functioning. These future studies may point to additional potential treatment approaches for social withdrawal in certain ASD subtypes.","Published: September 13, 2016"

It is a science fiction-like biological machine and testing ground housed  on-a-chip  that is being developed by University of Melbourne scientists in a bid to monitor human tissue in an environment that mimics the mechanics inside our bodies, including the mechanics of breathing. The project could help radically improve how we test whether a new drug will work and in the process save the medical industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Using magnets the scientists plan to manipulate the iron particles and stretch the lung tissue by dragging the spheroid around corners and squeezing it down corridors. And by using quantum physics the scientists will be able to watch how drugs interact with healthy and diseased cells. Underneath the glass they plan to place a thin sheet of diamond, the structure of which has been modified with atomic defects that can be used to image the magnetic fields cast by the embedded iron particles, effectively imaging the cells themselves.  What we are trying to do is add another level of reality to drug testing,  says the University s Professor Alastair Stewart, a pharmacologist at the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Science and co-director of the Lung Health Research Centre. A more reaListic environment  This three-dimensional chip environment is a softer environment than the two dimensional plastic environment we currently use to test human tissue cultures, and in mechanical terms is more similar to a human body. So we are aiming to replicate the environment of the cells in the disease as it occurs in our bodies.  Pharmaceutical development depends on mouse models or on two-dimensional cultures for testing the potential effectiveness of a drug before progressing to expensive human trials. But these tests are failing to identify the many drugs that go on to fail when finally tested in humans. A review of pharmaceutical giant Astra-Zeneca s portfolio performance between 2005 and 2010 suggests that failure rates when testing for effectiveness in humans can be as high as 85 per cent. The wasted money can range from $10 million to $100 million per failed drug. But by introducing drugs to human tissue inside the three-dimensional obstacle course and monitoring what happens, researchers aim to be able to better determine whether a drug can work or not before ever having to undertake expensive human trials. In this case the researchers are working on pulmonary fibrosis, a disease in which lung tissue is scarred and stiffens making it difficult to breathe. It is a progressive and fatal disease for which we don t know the cause, but is linked to smoking.  There is significant unmet need for new drugs to be developed that can combat this fatal lung condition,  Associate Professor Glen Westall, a leading lung fibrosis expert at Alfred Health and a partner investigator on the research. Through the University s cross-disciplinary Hallmark research initiatives, Professor Stewart has teamed with bioengineers and quantum physicists to work with Australian-based global biopharmaceutical company CSL Limited in developing the  micro-tissue on a chip  model. They plan to use it to test a series of different anti-fibrotics in what would be the first systematic benchmarking of whether such models can accurately fail ineffective drugs. The research team is focusing on fibroblast cells that form the connective tissue in our bodies and which, when fibrosis occurs, produce too much of the connective  glue  that binds tissue and therefore causes it to stiffen. By being able to move a spheroid of diseased fibroblasts through the corridors on the chip and use the magnets to replicate breathing, the researchers will be able to monitor what is going on at a cellular level when the tissue stiffens. The lung cells are made available through collaboration with Alfred Health and Donate Life. Diseased lung cells are harvested from patients with lung fibrosis who have undergone a lung transplant, and healthy cells come from donor lungs that for various reasons haven t been suitable for a transplant. Technology to create tissue and organs  on-a-chip  is at the forefront of medical research aimed at replicating what is going on in our bodies. But so far, while researchers around the world have been working to perfect the action of whole organs in a micro-fluidic chip environment, Professor Stewart says the accuracy of such models in being able to  fail  potential drugs is yet to be proven.  There are many aspects of organ-on-a-chip technology that remain a matter of belief rather than of evidence,  he says. Rather than trying to replicate a whole organ-on-a-chip, such as a lung, bioengineer Professor Peter Lee says the project is focused on creating a testing system specifically adapted to the area they want to test, in this case lung fibroblasts.  It is like creating an obstacle course that has some specific meaning to it,  says Professor Lee from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Melbourne.  We are developing it in conjunction with what we want to test, rather than trying to develop the most ideal whole organ we can and then working out what we can do with it.  Imaging with quantum physics Critical to the project will be the ability of the researchers to  see  at high magnification what is going on in the spheroid as it is put through the obstacle course and interacts with drugs. That is where the quantum physics comes in. In 2013 University of Melbourne physicist Professor Lloyd Hollenberg won the Victoria Prize for his work in using quantum physics to create nano-scale sensors. These sensors are the size of a single atom embedded in diamond crystal, and when engineered as a two dimensional grid just below a diamond surface they can image magnetic fields at resolutions a million times better than traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Crucially, the imaging can be done without exposing the tissue to direct light that would be toxic for the cells.  Alastair needed a non-invasive way of measuring the magnetic fields within the spheroid,  says Professor Hollenberg, the Thomas Baker Chair at the School of Physics.  By bringing the light in at an angle onto the diamond, the light only goes into the sensors and reflects back. It doesn t enter the tissue.  The imaging technique uses a thin sheet of synthetic diamond crystal about four millimetres square. To create the sensors the researchers remove two carbon atoms from the usual diamond structure, replacing them with one nitrogen atom and leaving an atomic space, or vacancy, where the other carbon atom should be. The combination of the nitrogen atom, the vacancy and an additional electron creates the so-called Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) defect, which acts as the sensor. When green light is shone onto the diamond surface the NV defects reflect back red light, the strength of which is dependent on the local magnetic field. In addition the NV defects can be put into a quantum state, i.e. it can exist in two energy states at once   grounded and excited. Once in this state of  superposition  the NV is highly sensitive to picking up any magnetic fields around it. When the tissue chip is placed on the diamond-imaging chip, the NVs will pick up the magnetic fields of iron particles embedded on the cells. Using the variation in the power of the red light reflected back, the scientists will pinpoint the source of the magnetic field and therefore image the cells.  By imaging the position of the beads using their magnetic fields, and then moving the beads to mimic actions like breathing, we can watch what is happening and how stiff or soft the cells and tissue may become in response to drugs,  says Dr David Simpson, research fellow in quantum physics at the School of Physics who has built the quantum sensor microscope system. Ultimately Professor Hollenberg wants to take the imaging technique further down in scale to be able to image the single proteins in cells that regulate our tissues and organs. That could allow us to accurately understand and predict how a drug or a potential drug will work in the body.  What we want to do is position a protein or other bio-molecule on our sensor surface and use the quantum imaging system like a nano-MRI machine and find out exactly what the shape is, because that shape tells you a lot about how a drug will interact with it.

This defect, which precedes the death of a group of nerve cells whose loss is the hallmark of the condition, play a critical role in triggering that die-off.  We ve found a molecular biomarker that characterizes not just familial cases of Parkinson s, in which a predisposition for the disease is clearly inherited, but also the condition s far more prevalent sporadic forms, for which the genetic contribution is either nonexistent or not yet discovered,  said Xinnan Wang, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurosurgery. The defect, described in a study published online Sept. 8 in Cell Stem Cell, renders cells unable to quickly dismantle their internal power packs, called mitochondria, when they wear out, stop supplying energy and start spewing out pollutants instead. This discovery could lead to not only more accurate but much earlier diagnoses of Parkinson s disease and could also point to entirely new pharmacological approaches to treating it, said Wang, who is the study s senior author. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Chung-Han Hsieh, PhD. The second-leading neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s affects one in every 60-70 Americans age 65 or older. While 5-10 percent of all cases are familial, the vast majority are sporadic. Prevalent mutation in Parkinson s The most frequent genetic mutations responsible for familial Parkinson s occur at various points along a gene coding for a protein called LRRK2. Several such mutations are known, but genetic tests reveal that the mutation known as LRRK2G2019S is the most prevalent, turning up in 1 in 20 familial cases and 1 in every 50 apparently sporadic cases among Caucasians. Curiously, LRRK2G2019S shows up in 40 percent of familial Parkinson s cases and 13 percent of sporadic cases among Ashkenazi Jews; figures for North African Berbers are 39 and 40 percent, respectively. Until now, no one could clearly account for LRRK2 s connection to Parkinson s. In an extensive series of experiments with cells cultured from Parkinson s patients and healthy subjects, Wang and her colleagues have cleared up that mystery. Mitochondria convert fats and sugars into other molecules that transport energy where it s needed in a cell. A single nerve cell can host hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria. A vast supply of energy is particularly crucial for a group of midbrain nerve cells whose nonstop activity fine-tunes our voluntary movements: These cells constantly produce and secrete a substance called dopamine (they re called  dopaminergic ), and each sends out numerous long-distance, dopamine-squirting cellular extensions to elsewhere in the brain. The failure of these dopamine-producing midbrain nerve cells triggers the classic symptoms of Parkinson s disease: tremor, stiffness, difficulty initiating and sustaining voluntary motion, and, sometimes, cognitive difficulties. Until now, the question of what causes the death of these dopaminergic nerve cells in Parkinson s patients has occasioned many highly uncertain guesses backed by little solid evidence. This uncertainty limits medical practitioners  ability to diagnose Parkinson s early on, and it impedes drug developers  attempts to find effective treatments. Malfunctioning mitochondria are like old jalopies: Their fuel efficiency is rotten, and they spew out tons of toxic exhaust in the form of corrosive chemicals called free radicals. But, the Stanford scientists showed, before faulty mitochondria can be decommissioned, they must first be detached from the cytoskeleton, a network of molecular filaments and tubules that spans and shapes most of our cells. Only after the mitochondria are detached can the cell destroy them. But this can t happen, Wang s team found, until a protein called Miro that anchors mitochondria to the cytoskeleton is severed. Removing Miro The researchers discovered that Miro s removal can occur only after LRRK2 forms a complex with Miro. Defective LRRK2 is impaired in forming this complex, resulting in significant delays in Miro s removal. In the study, Wang and her associates obtained 20 different lines of cultured fibroblasts from human skin: four from healthy subjects; five from apparently sporadic Parkinson s patients; six from familial patients with LRRK2 mutations, including the notorious LRRK2G2019S; and five from familial patients with other mutations. Six hours after biochemically inducing mitochondrial damage in these cells, the scientists broke open some of them to observe signs of Miro degradation. At 14 hours post-biochemical assault, they broke more cells open to monitor mitochondrial breakdown. In all four cultured fibroblast lines from healthy subjects, that s just what they witnessed. But to their surprise, mitochondrial detachment and breakdown were substantially delayed in all 16 cell lines representing Parkinson s cases. Digging deeper, the scientists used advanced methods to create nerve cells enriched for dopaminergic activity from several of the skin-fibroblast lines. They then employed techniques ranging from live imaging with microscopic cameras to biochemical manipulations to show that damaged mitochondria in the dopaminergic nerve cells generated from healthy subjects  fibroblasts quickly led to those mitochondria being destroyed. But in the dopaminergic nerve cells derived from the cells of patients with LRRK2G2019S-mutant Parkinson s, this process and the key steps leading up to it were substantially delayed. Free radicals When the researchers biochemically induced excessive free-radical production in the nerve cells, those from every Parkinson s patient sampled   familial and sporadic alike   died in much greater numbers than equivalent cells derived from healthy patients.  The healthy cells could handle higher free-radical concentrations,  Wang said.  But the Parkinson s cells were more prone to dying under those conditions, which are apt to occur in the energy-intensive, midbrain, dopamine-producing nerve cells that degenerate in Parkinson s disease.  Remarkably, the scientists discovered they could prevent the delay in Parkinson s-derived nerve cells  dismantling of faulty mitochondria, as well as forestall those cells  untimely death in the face of free-radical onslaught. They performed a biochemical trick that reduced Miro levels in the cells. The reduction wasn t enough to dislodge healthy mitochondria from the cytoskeleton, but it reduced their attachment intensities closer to the point at which detachment could occur. When the scientists then chemically induced mitochondrial damage, no increased mitochondrial drop-off or degradation took place in the nerve cells derived from healthy subjects. But in the equivalent LRRK2G2019S nerve cells, the previously seen delays pretty much disappeared   and far fewer of these cells died. Lowering Miro concentrations, in those cells, compensated for their Miro-chopping impairment. In a fruit-fly model of LRRK2 linked-Parkinson s locomotion difficulties (good rodent models for this aspect of Parkinson s don t exist), lowering Miro levels resulted in the restoration of larvae s visibly compromised crawling ability and fully reversed deficits in the climbing and jumping abilities of adult flies. Wang s team also proved that LRRK2 is recruited to sites of mitochondrial stress. They believe many different intracellular difficulties can contribute to the failure of even a perfectly normal LRRK2 complex with Miro, and that Miro s resultant failure to release its grip may be a reliable early biomarker   and possibly the crucial causal event   of Parkinson s disease.  Existing drugs for Parkinson s largely work by supplying precursors that faltering dopaminergic nerve cells can easily convert to dopamine,  Wang said.  But that doesn t prevent those cells from dying, and once they ve died you can t bring them back. Measuring Miro levels in skin fibroblasts from people at risk of Parkinson s might someday prove beneficial in getting an accurate, early diagnosis. And medicines that lower Miro levels could prove beneficial in treating the disease. ","Published: September 13, 2016"

The Milieu Int rieur consortium, coordinated by Prof. Matthew Albert (Immunobiology of dendritic cells Unit, Institut Pasteur / Inserm) and Dr Lluis Quintana-Murci (Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit, Institut Pasteur / CNRS) seek to establish the parameters that characterize the immune system of healthy individuals and its natural variability. In a study just published (August 25th) in Cell Reports, coauthored by Magnus Fontes (Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University and International Group for Data Analysis, Institut Pasteur) and one of Qlucore s founders, the researchers describe a new approach for analyzing the inflammatory response at the gene expression level in blood samples from healthy individuals, which reproduces the conditions of in-vivo stimulation. The striking result from this study is that the immune response to complex stimuli such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi could be defined and distinguished based on a small number of genes that were induced by 4 key immune proteins or cytokines. In particular as few as fourty-four genes, that were identified by machine learning techniques, could explain the variance present within such diverse immune responses. At a time of high-throughput sequencing approaches which create huge challenges for data analysis and medical applications, this study suggests that simplified approaches if properly targeted may provide more effective solutions with easier clinical translation. In addition, the study highlights that the utilization of highly standardized techniques for all steps including sample collection, sample preparation, and data analysis results in the generation of higher quality and more informative data.  We are excited by the results of this study which demonstrated that a relatively small subset of identified genes could explain the variability in responses to different complex immune stimuli  said Dr Darragh Duffy, immunologist and manager of the Milieu Interieur consortium at Institut Pasteur, Paris. In support of the published article, reference values are providied for each immune stimuli which reflects the natural variation of immune responses in humans. An online application was also released which provides an opportunity for the scientific community to exploit these data and to explore which genes are induced by a variety of immune stimuli. This newly established approach is now being applied to the 1000 healthy donors within the Milieu Int rieur cohort, which will enable the dissection of how age, gender, environment, lifestyle, and genetics contribute to variable immune responses. This is a first necessary step on the path towards precision medicine approaches. Several of the data analyses in this study were carried out using Qlucore Omics Explorer. Most of the up-stream analyses in the study can quickly be reproduced using Qlucore Omics Explorer, directly downloading the data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

And that internal structure can be changed by small cues from outside. A group of scientists at the University of Chicago s Institute for Molecular Engineering has found a way to exploit this property to turn liquid crystals into a tool to manipulate the shape of synthetic cell membranes. The technique has potential for use in biology, medicine, and advanced materials development. The team reported its findings in the Aug. 10 edition of Science Advances.  What we ve done is reproduced the beginnings of cell division in a synthetic system,  said Juan de Pablo, the Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering, who headed the group. When a cell divides, the spherical cell membrane stretches into an elliptical form, develops a waist in the middle, and then splits into two spherical cells. The scientists built sophisticated models that produced this behavior on the computer and then reproduced it in the real world, testing the model s predictions.  It s the first time that this has been done,  said de Pablo.  It s a system that has been engineered at the molecular level using computer models.  Cellular stand-ins Standing in for cells in the experiments were capsules, or  vesicles,  a few microns in diameter (a fraction the width of a human hair) made of some of the same phospholipids that make up real cell membranes. These were immersed in a bath of liquid crystal oil whose molecules are slightly elongated rather than round. At temperatures above 97 degrees Fahrenheit, the oil behaves like any other oil. But when the temperature is lowered slightly, the molecules of the oil pack tightly against one another like cigarettes and align along a single direction.  When that happens, the liquid crystal presses on the vesicle more in one direction than in the other, so the vesicle becomes elongated,  de Pablo said.  If you squash it more and more, it becomes an ellipsoid, and the two ends become pointier and pointier. There is a point when the molecules around those points separate from one another and create a little gap in the membrane through which things could be squeezed out.  Lipid vesicles are in current use for drug delivery. De Pablo envisions using the liquid crystal technique as a cunning way to control that process.  What we find intriguing is that we have a mechanism that will allow us to take vesicles loaded with something interesting, and by changing the temperature a little bit, we could deform the vesicle and have it squeeze out whatever it has inside without our ever touching the vesicle. And then as we restore the temperature to the original value, the vesicle becomes spherical again.  Calculations indicate that squeezing more or less would alter the size of the gap, allowing for the release of contents of varying sizes.  But that s something that we still have to demonstrate,  said de Pablo.","Published: September 13, 2016"

The training uses an auditory or visual signal that corresponds to the activity of a particular brain region, called neurofeedback, which can guide people to regulate their own brain activity. However, treating stress-related disorders requires accessing the brain's emotional hub, the amygdala, which is located deep in the brain and difficult to reach with typical neurofeedback methods. This type of activity has typically only been measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is costly and poorly accessible, limiting its clinical use. See Also: Training brain patterns of empathy using functional brain imaging A study published in Biological Psychiatry  tested a new imaging method that provided reliable neurofeedback on the level of amygdala activity using electroencephalography (EEG), and allowed people to alter their own emotional responses through self-regulation of its activity. ""The major advancement of this new tool is the ability to use a low-cost and accessible imaging method such as EEG to depict deeply located brain activity,"" said both senior author Dr. Talma Hendler of Tel-Aviv University in Israel and The Sagol Brain Center at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, and first author Jackob Keynan, a PhD student in Hendler's laboratory, in an email to Biological Psychiatry. The researchers built upon a new imaging tool they had developed in a previous study that uses EEG to measure changes in amygdala activity, indicated by its ""electrical fingerprint"". With the new tool, 42 participants were trained to reduce an auditory feedback corresponding to their amygdala activity using any mental strategies they found effective. During this neurofeedback task, the participants learned to modulate their own amygdala electrical activity. This also led to improved downregulation of blood-oxygen level dependent signals of the amygdala, an indicator of regional activation measured with fMRI. In another experiment with 40 participants, the researchers showed that learning to downregulate amygdala activity could actually improve behavioral emotion regulation. They showed this using a behavioral task invoking emotional processing in the amygdala. The findings show that with this new imaging tool, people can modify both the neural processes and behavioral manifestations of their emotions. ""We have long known that there might be ways to tune down the amygdala through biofeedback, meditation, or even the effects of placebos,"" said John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry. ""It is an exciting idea that perhaps direct feedback on the level of activity of the amygdala can be used to help people gain control of their emotional responses."" Learn More: Maturing brain flips function of amygdala in regulating stress hormones The participants in the study were healthy, so the tool still needs to be tested in the context of real-life trauma.

Alzheimer's statistics are always staggering. The neurodegenerative disease affects an estimated 5 million Americans, one in three seniors dies with Alzheimer's or a form of dementia, it claims more lives than breast and prostate cancers combined, and its incidence is rising. See Also: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein To help fight this deadly disease, Lisa Lapidus, Michigan State University (MSU) professor of physics and astronomy, has found that peptides, or strings of amino acids, related to Alzheimer's wiggle at dangerous speeds prior to clumping or forming the plaques commonly associated with Alzheimer's. ""Strings of 40 amino acids are the ones most-commonly found in healthy individuals, but strings of 42 are much more likely to clump,"" said Lapidus, who published the results in ChemPhysChem. ""We found that the peptides' wiggle speeds, the step before aggregation, was five times slower for the longer strings, which leaves plenty of time to stick together rather than wiggle out of the way."" This so-called ""wiggle"" precedes clumping, or aggregating, which is the first step of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Lapidus pioneered the use of lasers to study the speed of protein reconfiguration before aggregation. If reconfiguration is much faster or slower than the speed at which proteins bump into each other, aggregation is slow. If reconfiguration is the same speed, however, aggregation is fast. She calls the telltale wiggle that she discovered the ""dangerous middle."" ""The dangerous middle is the speed in which clumping happens fastest,"" Lapidus said. ""But we were able to identify some ways that we can bump that speed into a safer zone."" Lapidus and her team of MSU scientists, including Srabasti Acharya, Kinshuk Srivastava and Sureshbabu Nagarajan, found that increasing pH levels kept the amino acids wiggling at fast, safe speeds. Also, a naturally occurring molecule, curcumin (fr m the spice turmeric), kept the peptide out of the dangerous middle.

By the time patients show symptoms and go to a doctor, aggregation already has a stronghold in their brains.

Because vertebrates, such as birds and humans, have two ears and sounds from either side travel different distances to arrive at each one localizing sound involves discerning subtle differences in when sounds arrive. The brain has to keep time better than a Swiss watch in order to locate where sound is coming from. See Also: Hearing experts break sound barrier for children born without hearing nerve In fact, the quality of this sound processing precision is a limiting factor in how well one detects the location of sound and perceives speech. A team of researchers led by R. Michael Burger, neuroscientist and associate professor in Lehigh University's Department of Biological Sciences, have identified the specific synaptic and post-synaptic characteristics that allow auditory neurons to compute with temporal precision ultimately revealing the optimal arrangement of both input and electrical properties needed for neurons to process their ""preferred"" frequency with maximum precision. In order for birds and mammals to hear, hair cells in the cochlea the auditory portion of the inner ear vibrate in response to sounds and thereby convert sound into electrical activity. Each hair cell is tuned to a unique frequency tone, which humans ultimately experience as pitch. Every hair cell in the cochlea is partnered with several neurons that convey information from the ear to the brain in an orderly way. The tone responses in the cochlea are, essentially, ""remapped"" to the cochlear nucleus, the first brain center to process sounds. This unique spatial arrangement of how sounds of different frequencies are processed in the brain is called tonotopy. It can be visualized as a kind of sound map: tones that are close to each other in terms of frequency are represented by neighboring neurons of the cochlear nucleus. Timing precision is important to cochlear nucleus neurons because their firing pattern is specific for each sound frequency. That is, their output pattern is akin to a digital code that is unique for each tone. ""In the absence of sound, neurons fire randomly and at a high rate,"" says Burger. ""In the presence of sound, neurons fire in a highly stereotyped manner known as phase-locking--which is the tendency for a neuron to fire at a particular phase of a periodic stimulus or sound wave."" Read Next: How does the brain respond to hearing loss? Previous research by Burger and Stefan Oline a former PhD candidate at Lehigh, now a postdoctoral fellow at New York University Medical School demonstrated for the first time that synaptic inputs (the messages being sent between cells) are distinct across frequencies and that these different impulse patterns are ""mapped"" onto the cells of the cochlear nucleus. They further established the computational processes by which neurons ""tuned"" to process low frequency sound actually improve the phase-locking precision of the impulses they receive. However, the mechanisms that allow neurons to respond properly to these frequency-specific incoming messages remained poorly understood. In new research, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, Burger and Oline, along with Dr. Go Ashida of the University of Oldenburg in Germany, have investigated auditory brain cell membrane selectivity and observed that the neurons ""tuned"" to receive high-frequency sound preferentially select faster input than their low-frequency-processing counterparts--and that this preference is tolerant of changes to the inputs being received. ""A low frequency cell will tolerate a slow input and still be able to fire but a high frequency cell requires a very rapid input and rejects slow input,"" says Burger. ""The neurons essentially demand that the high-frequency input be more precise."" ""What I find really striking is that the tuning of these neurons helps them uniquely deal with the constraints of the ear,"" says Oline. ""Neurons responding to low frequency input can average their inputs from hair cells to improve their resolution. But hair cells aren't very good at responding to high frequency tones as they introduce a lot of timing errors. Because of this, and because they occur at such a high rate, averaging these inputs is impossible and would smear information across multiple sound waves. So, instead, the high-frequency-processing cells use an entirely different strategy: they are as picky as possible to avoid averaging at all costs."" Learn More: Stop and listen: Study shows how movement affects hearing Burger and his colleagues built a computer simulation of low frequency and high frequency neurons, based on observations of physiological activity. They then used these computational models to test which combinations of properties are crucial to phase-locking. The model predicted that the optimal arrangement of synaptic and cell membrane properties for phase-locking is specific to stimulus frequency. These computational predictions were then tested physiologically in the neurons. The team's model is not only useful for determining how the brain responds to sounds, but also reveals general features of input-output optimization that apply to any brain cell that processes time varying input. Understanding the mechanisms that allow cells of the cochlear nucleus to compute with temporal precision has implications for understanding the evolution of the auditory system. ""It's really the high frequency-processing cells that have uniquely evolved in mammals,"" explains Burger. Understanding these processes may also be important for advancing the technology used to make cochlear implants. A cochlear implant is an electronic medical device that helps provide a sense of sound to someone who is deaf or has severe hearing loss. It replaces the function of the damaged inner ear by sending electrical impulses directly to the auditory nerve. These impulses, in turn, are interpreted by the brain as sound. Though an established and effective treatment for many, cochlear implants cannot currently simulate the precision of sound experienced by those with a naturally-developed auditory system. The sound processing lacks the clarity of natural hearing, especially across frequencies. Related: Researchers identify part of the brain that compensates for hearing loss in older adults""Ideally, what you want whether in your natural auditory system or through a cochlear implant is the most precise representation in the brain of the various frequencies,"" says Burger. Burger and his colleagues have assembled what is known about the optimal electrical properties and synaptic inputs into a single cohesive model, laying the groundwork needed to investigate some of the big questions in the field of auditory neuroscience. Resolving these questions may someday lead scientists and medical professionals to a better understanding of how to preserve the natural organization of the auditory structures in the brain for those who are born with profound hearing loss.

Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that affects around 1 in every 10,000 people and damages nerve cells in the brain. This causes neurological symptoms affecting movement, cognition and behavior. Huntington's usually only begins to show symptoms in adulthood. There is currently no cure and no way to slow the progression of the disease. Symptoms typically progress over 10-25 years until the person eventually dies. See Also: Test developed to measure effectiveness of treatments for Huntington s disease Now, the EU-funded FINGERS4CURE project team led by researchers at Imperial College London have engineered a therapeutic protein called a 'zinc finger'. Huntington's disease is caused by a mutant form of a single gene called Huntingtin. The zinc finger protein works by targeting the mutant copies of the Huntingtin gene, repressing its ability to express and create harmful proteins. In the new study involving mice, published in the journal Molecular Neurodegeneration, the injection of zinc finger repressed the mutant copies of the gene for at least six months. In a previous study in mice, the team had curbed the mutant gene's activity for just a couple of weeks. By tweaking the ingredients of the zinc finger in the new study they were able to extend its effects to several months, repressing the disease gene over that period without seeing any harmful side effects. This involved making the zinc finger as invisible to the immune system as possible. Project lead Dr. Mark Isalan from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial said: ""We are extremely excited by our latest results, which show a lot of promise for treating Huntington's disease. Learn More: Scientists adopt new strategy to find Huntington s disease therapies ""However, while these encouraging results in mice mean that the zinc finger looks like a good candidate to take forward to human trials, we still need to do a lot of work first to answer important questions around the safety of the intervention, whether repeat treatments are effective, whether there might be longer-term side effects, and whether we can extend and increase the benefits beyond six months. ""In this study we weren't looking at how repressing the gene activity affected the symptoms of the disease and this is obviously a critical question as well. However, we have reason to be confident from our previous studies that repressing the gene does in fact significantly reduce symptoms. ""If all goes well and we have further positive results, we would aim to start clinical trials within five years to see whether the treatment could be safe and effective in humans. We are urgently looking for industry partners and funding to achieve this."" The mutant Huntingtin gene is thought to cause toxic levels of protein to aggregate in the brain. Preventing the activity of this gene could theoretically halt the disease, but this has been difficult to achieve. The gene is present in many different cell types in the brain, making it difficult to target, and every patient also has a non-mutant copy of the gene, which scientists need to avoid targeting with any intervention in order to prevent unwanted side effects. The zinc finger protein sticks to the DNA of the mutant Huntingtin gene and turns off the gene's expression. ""We don't know exactly how the mutant Huntingtin gene causes the disease, so the idea is that targeting the gene expression cuts off the problem at its source - preventing it from ever having the potential to act,"" said Dr Isalan. By targeting the fundamental DNA of the gene, the zinc finger therapy also has the advantage over other potential Huntington's therapies of needing less frequent treatments. Read Next: Team finds method to reduce accumulation of damaging Huntington's disease protein In the study, the researchers gave a single injection of zinc finger to 12 mice with Huntingdon's disease. They examined the brains of the mice at different intervals after the initial injection and found that on average, 77 per cent of the 'bad' gene expression was repressed in mouse brains three weeks after injection of the zinc finger, 61 per cent repressed at six weeks, and 48 per cent repressed at 12 weeks. By 24 weeks after the initial injections, there was still 23 per cent repression, which is thought to still be useful therapeutically. The team are now working on ways to lengthen the repression period even further. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source.

The IWGAV is the first initiative of its size and scope to establish strategic recommendations for antibody validation for both antibody producers and users.  Thermo Fisher Scientific provided financial support to the IWGAV in 2015 to spearhead the development of industry standards and help combat the common challenges associated with antibody specificity and reproducibility. Although antibodies are among the most frequently used tools in scientific research, there is not a comprehensive scientific framework for the validation of antibody specificity across research applications. The use of poorly characterized antibodies has been estimated to cost $350 million each year in the United States alone and $800 million worldwide as a result of failed or unreliable experiments.  This publication is an important first step towards the development of widely accepted standards for validating antibodies and ensuring high quality and consistent antibodies for biomedical research,  said Dr. Mathias Uhl n, professor of microbiology, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden and chair of the IWGAV.  We look forward to receiving feedback from the broader community of antibody users, publishers, funding agencies and producers to help strengthen this initial proposal and ensure the reliability of these essential tools of biomedical research.  The IWGAV identified five  conceptual pillars  to guide antibody validation in specific research applications:    Genetic strategies: Measure the relevant signal in control cells or tissues in which the target gene has been knocked out or knocked down using techniques such as CRISPR/Cas or RNAi.    Orthogonal strategies: Use an antibody-independent method for quantification across multitudes of samples and then examine the correlation between the antibody-based and antibody-independent quantifications.    Independent antibody strategies: Use two or more independent antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the target protein and confirm specificity via comparative and quantitative analyses.    Expression of tagged proteins: Modify the endogenous target gene to add sequences for an affinity tag or a fluorescent protein. The signal from the tagged protein can be correlated with detection through antibody-based methods.    Immunocapture followed by mass spectrometry (MS): Couple immunocapture, the technique of isolating a protein from a solution through binding with a target-specific antibody, with MS analysis to identify proteins that interact directly with the purified antibody as well as proteins that may form a complex with the target protein.  While each of these conceptual pillars may provide evidence of antibody specificity, the IWGAV recommends multiple pillars be used to claim a particular antibody has been well validated for use in a specific application. The manuscript in Nature Methods also includes recommendations for producers and users to ensure antibody reproducibility over time.  The proposal, published in Nature Methods is intended to provide a scientific foundation for antibody validation and reproducibility standards that encourage the widespread adoption of comprehensive guidelines for antibody use. However, this will require continued input from the global research community and antibody producers. Each of these stakeholders will have important roles to play in the adoption and implementation of this proposal. ","Published: September 12, 2016"

The results were produced by scientists affiliated with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI); The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI); U.S National Institute of Health s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); The Rockefeller University; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard; Boston Children s Hospital; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard Medical School (HMS); Vanderbilt University; Columbia University; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC); Duke University School of Medicine and Kymab Ltd.  It s early work, but we re trying to rewrite some rules of vaccine development to overcome the extraordinary challenges of HIV,  says William Schief, TSRI Professor and Director of Vaccine Design for IAVI s Neutralizing Antibody Center (NAC) at TSRI.  In a collaborative effort we have reached critical milestones, including the first proof ever that immunization with designer proteins can produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. The new results strongly support further developing these approaches toward testing in clinical studies.  Do better than nature HIV circulates in a person s body in many variants that mutate rapidly and escape defensive immune responses. Since the virus attacks the very immune cells that are supposed to fight it, and it hides in persistently infected cells, capable of re-emerging and striking at any time, traditional vaccine strategies have failed to work against HIV. New approaches are needed to develop a broadly effective AIDS vaccine. In laboratory and animal testing, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been shown to prevent or control infection from a wide range of HIV variants. Many researchers believe bNAbs are a critical component of future broadly effective AIDS vaccination. However, developing these vaccines will require scientists to do better than nature as only 10% to 20% of people living with HIV develop bNAbs, and such a process can take years to happen. Expanding on earlier work, the new studies have taken further critical steps to show that it could be possible to actually coax the human immune system to create bNAbs against HIV. Innovative immune system training The researchers tested the efficacy of immune system training that combines a prime shot with an immunogen (the active ingredient of a vaccine) to activate bNAb precursor cells (germline B cells) with booster shots of other immunogens that trigger mutations in the antibodies until they mature into bNAbs. They did this in mice whose immune systems mimicked components of the human immune system, testing for different challenges that immunogens would have to overcome. They aimed at generating two classes of bNAbs (VRC01 and PGT121) as it is believed that neutralizing a wide range of HIV variants will require more than one type of bNAb. A study published in Science expanded earlier results achieved with a promising prime immunogen (eOD-GT8 60mer, a nanoparticle composed of 60 units of an engineered version of the HIV envelope protein s outer domain) in a more human-like and challenging mouse model. Dennis Burton, Scientific Director of IAVI s NAC at TSRI and Chair of TSRI s Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, Schief and colleagues at TSRI, Ragon Institute, MIT, HMS and Kymab Ltd, administered the immunogen to mice (Kymouse ) engineered to express human antibodies, but to express precursor B cells for the VRC01 bNAB in a much lower concentration than found in humans. Nonetheless, the mice were successfully primed to have the type of immune response a vaccine should induce in humans, demonstrating the immunogen s strong priming effectiveness. In another study, published in Cell, and conducted by Schief, Burton, TSRI Professor David Nemazee and their colleagues at IAVI s NAC, TSRI, Ragon Institute, MIT and HMS, mice engineered to make precursors of VRC01 bNAbs were primed with the eOD-GT8 60mer and boosted with two other immunogens. The elicited antibodies shared many genetic features with mature bnAbs and had the ability to neutralize one native HIV isolate as well as multiple slightly modified HIV isolates. The boosters seem to have guided the antibody-producing B cells to mutate in the right direction. The researchers now think that additional boosters are needed to complete the bNAb maturation. A second study published in Cell succeeded with a similar approach. They showed that a series of priming with the eOD-GT6 60mer immunogen (an earlier version of the eOD-GT8 60mer) and boosting with different modified HIV envelope proteins could induce antibodies with properties of partially mature bNAbs in mouse models with immune systems that can create an even wider range of antibodies. This study was conducted by John Mascola at the NIAID s Vaccine Research Center and Frederick Alt, a HHMI researcher at Boston Children s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, along with colleagues at IAVI s NAC at TSRI, TSRI, Vanderbilt University, Columbia University, Ragon Institute, FHCRC and Duke University School of Medicine. With a third study published in Cell and another published in Immunity, Schief, Michel Nussenzweig and teams at IAVI s NAC, TSRI, HHMI, The Rockefeller University and Ragon Institute demonstrated the ability of different prime and booster immunogens to induce the generation and full maturation of a PGT121 bNAb that neutralized diverse HIV isolates in another mouse model. This is the first proof ever that immunization with a series of prime and booster shots using designer proteins can produce bNAbs against HIV. This work is also novel in that it suggests a way to induce bNAbs that bind sugar molecules that shield HIV from antibody attack. Many bNAbs that develop during natural infection bind at least in part to the sugar coating, but it has not been known until now how to develop immunogens to induce this kind of response through vaccination. Taken together, these results offer encouraging insights and proof points for a planned Phase I clinical trial by IAVI to test the eOD-GT8 60mer prime and to further develop booster immunogens and test their ability to elicit bNAbs in humans in future trials. And, the work on PGT121 vaccine development and testing in a mouse model has encouraged the researchers to further develop their approach to get it ready for clinical studies.","Published: September 12, 2016"

The infectious prion protein is a misfolded protein, which makes it very difficult to purify and study. Since it clumps together, standard structural biology techniques cannot be used to study it. Since the protein was first purified in the 1980s researchers have made limited insights into the structure of the protein. The collaborative study, published in PLOS Pathogens, used electron cryomicroscopy to collect high-resolution electron micrographs. This was the first time this technology has been used on amyloid fibrils of the infectious prion, which are a special form of clumped-together proteins that form fibrils.  The recent advances to electron cryomicroscopy technology are certainly a breakthrough,  says Holger Wille, co-principal investigator and an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta s Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry.  We know the structure of the healthy normal cellular form of the protein, but we knew very little about the infectious prion protein and how it propagates. The use of these high-powered microscopes has finally given us some clarity.  The team had to develop a processing scheme for the data masses. There were thousands of electron micrographs, and they had to extract the best images. After three years of working, developing techniques and processing data the results in the paper are a three-dimensional model for the structure of the infectious prion protein.  It is not an atomistic model, so we cannot say which position the atoms are in,  says Wille.  But this is something we hope to do in the future.  The model can give insights into how the infectious prion protein propagates. The structure argues against existing theories of prion conversion and suggests how the process might actually work. The study suggests how infectious prions replicate by converting non-infectious, cellular versions into copies of themselves. Moving forward, the researchers want to go into more depth. This study used model system prions, but they are now using the prions that infect cows (BSE), wild animals (Chronic Wasting Disease) and humans (Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease).  Ultimately, if we know how the prion propagates, we could come up with clinical interventions to treat or prevent disease,  says Wille.","Published: September 12, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/measuring-the-forces-within-dna-200466,Measuring the Forces Within DNA  Scientists have successfully measured the stacking forces between base pairs giving stabilisation to the DNA structure  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.DNA, our genetic material, normally has the structure of a twisted rope ladder. Experts call this structure a double helix. Among other things, it is stabilized by stacking forces between base pairs. Scientists at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have succeeded at measuring these forces for the very first time on the level of single base pairs. This new knowledge could help to construct precise molecular machines out of DNA. The researchers published their findings in the journal ""Science"". Over 60 years ago, the researchers Crick and Watson identified the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, which is more commonly known as DNA. They compared the double helix to a rope ladder that had been twisted into a spiral. The rungs of this ladder consisted of guanine/cytosine and thymine/adenine base pairs. But what keeps the DNA strands in that spiral structure?  Special measuring system for molecular interactions  Prof. Hendrik Dietz from the Chair of Experimental Biophysics uses DNA as construction material to create molecular structures. Hence, he is greatly interested in gaining a better understanding of this material. ""There are two types of interactions which stabilize double helices"", he explains. For one, DNA contains hydrogen bonds.  For another, there are what experts call base pair stacking forces, which act between the stacked base pairs along the spiral axis. The forces of the hydrogen bonds, on the other hand, act perpendicular to the axis. ""So far, it is not quite clear to which extent these two forces each contribute to the overall stability of the DNA double helix , explains Dietz.  Directly measuring the weak stacking forces between base pairs was a big technical challenge for the researchers, who worked on the problem for six years. In collaboration with the TUM Chair of Molecular Biophysics (Prof. Matthias Rief) and the TUM Chair of Theoretical Biophysics - Biomolecular Dynamics (Prof. Martin Zacharias), they succeeded in developing a special experimental setup that now makes it possible to measure extremely weak contact interactions between individual molecules.  A trillionth of a bar of chocolate  To put it simply, the measurement system is designed hierarchically and involves microscopic beams, at the tips of which one or more double helix structures running in parallel are located. These have been modified such that each end carries one base pair. Two of these microscopic beams are connected with a flexible polymer. On the other side, the beams are coupled to microscopic spheres which can be pulled apart using optical laser tweezers. In solution, the base pairs on the end of one of the beam can now interact with the base pairs on the end of the other beam. This also makes it possible to measure how long a stacking bond between them lasts before they fall apart again, as well as the force acting between the base pairs.  The forces measured by the researchers were in the range of piconewtons. ""A newton is the weight of a bar of chocolate"", explains Dietz. ""What we have here is a thousandth of a billionth of that, which is practically nothing."" Forces in the range of two piconewtons are sufficient to separate the bond created by stacking forces. Furthermore, the scientists also observed that the bonds spontaneously broke up and formed again within just a few milliseconds. The strength and the lifetime of the interactions depends to a great extent on which base pairs are stacked on each other.  Creating DNA machines  The results of the measurements may help to better understand mechanical aspects of fundamental biological processes such as DNA replication, i.e. the reproduction of genetic material. For example, the short life of the stacking interactions could mean that an enzyme tasked with separating the base pairs during this process just needs to wait for the stacking bonds break up on their own   instead of having to apply force to separate them.  However, Dietz also intends to apply the data directly to his current research: He uses DNA as programmable building material to construct machines on the order of nanometers. When doing so, he draws inspiration from the complex structures which can e.g. be found in cells and, among other things, serve as molecular ""factories"" to synthesize important compounds such as ATP, which stores energy. ""We now know what would be possible if we could just build structures that were sufficiently sophisticated"", says Dietz. ""Naturally, when we have a better understanding of the properties of the molecular interactions, we are better able to work with these molecules.""  At the moment, the lab is building a molecular rotational motor out of DNA, the components of which interlock and are held together via stacking forces. The goal is to be able to control a directed rotation via chemical or thermal stimuli. ","Published: September 12, 2016"

The results of the study are published by eLife. Dr. Espinosa's paper shows the unequivocal impact of trisomy 21 (the triplication of chromosome 21 that causes Down syndrome) on interferon (IFN) signaling. Specifically, cells with trisomy 21 produce high levels of interferon-stimulated genes and lower levels of genes required for protein synthesis. See Also: Astroglial 'support cells' in brain play important role in Down syndrome Interferons are molecules produced by cells in response to viral or bacterial infection, and which act on neighboring cells to prevent the spread of the infection, shut down protein synthesis, and activate the immune system. The paper posits that if interferons are constantly activated, then the body is constantly fighting a viral infection even when such infection does not exist; this would likely cause many damaging side-effects. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two, and since four of the six interferon receptors the proteins that sense the presence of interferons are encoded on chromosome 21, cells with trisomy 21 react more strongly to small amounts of interferons in their microenvironment.

See Also: Video game technology helps measure upper extremity movement in patients with muscular dystrophy""Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients have limited treatment options and a desperate need for effective therapies,"" said University of Rochester Medical Center neurologist Robert Griggs, MD, lead author of the study. ""This study shows that deflazacort may provide an important treatment for delaying the progression of the disease."" Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a condition found almost exclusively in boys. The disease is characterized by muscle weakness which begins to appear at a young age and progresses rapidly leading to significant disability. Boys with the disease often end up in a wheelchair by age 9 or 10 because of weakness in their legs. The symptoms eventually spread to other parts of the body, including the heart and muscles responsible for breathing, and the disease is often fatal by the time the individual reaches his late teens. An estimated 28,000 people in the U.S. suffer from the disease. While there is currently no ap proved treatment for DMD, the corticosteroid prednisone is often used ""off label"" to treat the condition. Several studies, beginning with research conducted by Griggs and his colleagues more than 20 years ago, have shown that daily use of corticosteroids can increase muscle mass and slow muscle degeneration in DMD patients, prolonging their ability to walk and preserving respiratory function. However, many DMD patients in the U.S. are not prescribed corticosteroids, primarily due to concern over the side effects of prolonged drug use in children. While deflazacort is approved for use in Europe and elsewhere to treat DMD, the drug has never gone through the approval process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Studies of the drug abroad have shown that it is effective and has fewer side effects compared to other corticosteroids, namely less associated weight gain. Deflazacort was involved in a Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. in the mid-1990s. However, soon after the trial was completed, the company sponsoring the research lost interest in the drug, the study results were never published, and efforts to obtain FDA approval were abandoned. At the urging of patients and their families, Griggs and others spent decades attempting to get access to the original study data. In the intervening years, another company Marathon Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to the deflazacort and began a new push to gain FDA approval for the drug. The researchers were never able to obtain the data from the original clinical trial sponsor and in the end had to painstakingly reconstruct the study results from the information collected at each individual study site. This data forms the basis for the new Neurology study. The study, which involved 196 DMD patients, showed that deflazacort was safe, effectively preserved muscle strength, and was associated with less weight gain than prednisone. Learn More: Stem cell gene therapy could be key to treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy The data from the study is the foundation for two New Drug Applications currently pending before the FDA for use of the drug to treat DMD.

Griggs is also heading up another international study that seeks addresses the variation in care that DMD patients currently receive by establishing a universal and effective standard of care. The new study, called FOR-DMD (Finding the Optimum Regimen of Corticosteroids for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), will determine whether daily steroid treatment or an alternative regime is more effective in slowing the disease progression and managing side effects.

The team published their work in Biological Psychiatry. Although medications are available for treating symptoms sometimes associated with ASD, such as anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and irritability, there are no medications currently approved for treatment of the core social interaction deficits in ASD, and the brain basis of these social interaction symptoms are still not well understood. ""This research could significantly change our understanding of the causes and brain changes in autism and could lead to new treatment approaches for the harder-to-treat social aspects of ASD,"" said senior author Edward Brodkin, MD, an associate professor of Psychiatry and director of the Adult Autism Spectrum Program. See Also: New insights into the male bias of autism Behavioral symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder have been attributed, in part, to aberrant connections between neurons, but the molecular underpinnings of ASD-related behavioral and brain physiology are largely unknown. Previous studies on human genetics have implicated a little-studied gene called Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) in ASD. PCDH10 is a neural cell adhesion molecule that is involved in brain development and the maintenance of synapses, the points of connections between neurons where neurotransmitters are released. The PCDH10 protein is expressed at high levels in particular brain regions, including the amygdala, which mediates emotion and motivation and is implicated in the social deficits of ASD. When one of the two copies of the Pcdh10 gene was deleted in mice, these animals called Pcdh10+/- mice showed reduced social approach behavior, which resembled the social withdrawal of humans with ASD. This effect was seen more prominently in males than in females, which is consistent with the male predominance of ASD in humans. In addition, the male Pcdh10+/- mice had anomalies in the structure and function of amygdala circuitry, as well as lower levels of certain types of glutamate receptor subunits (called NMDA receptor subunits) in the amygdala. Social approach deficits in these male mice were rescued by giving them a medication called d-cycloserine, which binds to the glycine binding site on the NMDA receptor. This, in turn, boosts glutamate signaling at these receptors. ""By enhancing NMDA-receptor signaling, the mice went from social avoidance to more typical social approach behavior,"" Brodkin said. This finding in the mouse model is also consistent with preliminary clinical studies in humans. D-cycloserine has been shown, in recent small studies, to significantly improve social interactions in older adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders. The new study in Pcdh10+/- mice may give additional impetus to pursue these initial results in human studies with larger-scale clinical studies of d-cycloserine or related medications. Learn More: Can autism be measured in a sniff?Along with collaborator Ted Abel, PhD, the Brush Family Professor of Biology at Penn, Brodkin is planning future studies with the mouse model to explore the biological mechanisms that cause the male Pcdh10+/- mice to show more severe social withdrawal than female Pcdh10+/- mice. This may elucidate the biology underlying the male preponderance of autism and will involve more detailed analysis of amygdala circuit functioning. These future studies may point to additional potential treatment approaches for social withdrawal in certain ASD subtypes. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

From infancy, we learn by watching other people, then use those memories to help us predict outcomes and make decisions in the future. Now a University of California (UCLA) and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) study has pinpointed the individual neurons in the brain that support observational learning. See Also: The brain watched during language learningPublished in Nature Communications, the findings could provide scientists with a better understanding of how the brain goes awry in conditions like learning disorders and social anxiety disorder. In a secondary finding, the research team also discovered that neurons in the same region fire in response to schadenfreude the pleasure of seeing someone else make a blunder or lose a game. ""Observational learning is the cornerstone for our ability to change behavior,"" said senior author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. ""It's human nature to want to learn from other people's mistakes rather than commit your own."" Said lead author Michael Hill, a former UCLA and Caltech scientist now based at the Swiss National Science Foundation: ""The ability to quickly learn from others can give humans a critical edge over other species. The skill also contributes to someone feeling he or she is a member of one culture versus another."" Prior to the study, Fried implanted electrodes deep inside the brains of people with epilepsy being treated at UCLA a standard medical procedure used to identify the origins of epileptic seizures prior to surgery. The researchers used the electrodes to record the activity of individual neurons in the brains of 10 people playing a card game. Related: Learning impacts how the brain processes what we see Players were instructed to draw a card from one of two decks. One deck included 70 percent of the winning cards, while the other deck contained only 30 percent of the winning cards. Each person took turns choosing cards on his or her own and then watched two other players draw cards from the same decks. By learning from the results of their own and the other players' choices, the participants quickly zeroed in on the deck containing better cards. The research team was surprised to discover that individual neurons deep in the frontal lobe reacted as the patient considered whether they or their opponents would pick a winning card. Called the anterior cingulate cortex, the region plays an important role in high-level functions like decision making, reward anticipation, social interaction and emotion. ""The firing rate of individual neurons altered according to what the patient expected to happen,"" Hill said. ""For example, would their opponents win or lose? The same cells also changed their response after the patient discovered whether their prediction was on target, reflecting their learning process."" The findings suggest that individual nerve cells in the person's brain used the details gleaned by observing the other players to calculate which deck to choose a card from next. Read Next: Learning in the absence of external feedback""The anterior cingulate cortex acts as the central executive of human decision-making, yet we know little about the neuronal machinery at this level,"" said Fried, who is also a professor of neurosurgery at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University. According to the authors, the findings will help scientists better understand the organization of neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex and exactly what they do. Fried and Hill propose that active stimulation of the neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex could influence human behavior and have possible benefits for people struggling with learning disabilities or difficulty reading social cues. The researchers observed that the cells in the same region fired vigorously each time a person won or the other players lost, and decreased their activity whenever the person lost or the other players won. ""While obviously we don't know precisely what it is that these neurons encode, it's fascinating to see something like schadenfreude reflected in the activity of individual neurons in the human brain,"" Hill said.

See Also: New test detects toxic prions in blood The infectious prion protein is a misfolded protein, which makes it very difficult to purify and study. Since it clumps together, standard structural biology techniques cannot be used to study it. Since the protein was first purified in the 1980s researchers have made limited insights into the structure of the protein. The collaborative study, published in PLoS Pathogens, used electron cryomicroscopy to collect high-resolution electron micrographs. This was the first time this technology has been used on amyloid fibrils of the infectious prion, which are a special form of clumped-together proteins that form fibrils. ""The recent advances to electron cryomicroscopy technology are certainly a breakthrough,"" says Holger Wille, co-principal investigator and an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. ""We know the structure of the healthy normal cellular form of the protein, but we knew very little about the infectious prion protein and how it propagates. The use of these high-powered microscopes has finally given us some clarity."" The team had to develop a processing scheme for the data masses. There were thousands of electron micrographs, and they had to extract the best images. After three years of working, developing techniques and processing data the results in the paper are a three-dimensional model for the structure of the infectious prion protein. ""It is not an atomistic model, so we cannot say which position the atoms are in,"" says Wille. ""But this is something we hope to do in the future."" The model can give insights into how the infectious prion protein propagates. The structure argues against existing theories of prion conversion and suggests how the process might actually work. The study suggests how infectious prions replicate by converting non-infectious, cellular versions into copies of themselves. Read Next: Solving the next step in the mystery of prions Moving forward, the researchers want to go into more depth. This study used model system prions, but they are now using the prions that infect cows (BSE), wild animals (chronic wasting disease) and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). ""Ultimately, if we know how the prion propagates, we could come up with clinical interventions to treat or prevent disease,"" says Wille. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/keeping-up-with-hiv-mutations-199074,Keeping Up with HIV Mutations Team develops technology to increase the speed of HIV development in mice to model and quickly test vaccination strategies  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. AIDS vaccines able to fight any HIV strain have thus far eluded science. HIV frequently mutates its coat protein, dodging vaccine makers  efforts to elicit sufficiently broadly neutralizing antibodies. Sometimes HIV-infected people can produce such antibodies on their own. But this usually requires years of exposure to the virus, allowing the immune system to modify its antibodies over time to keep up with HIV mutations, and generally occurs too late to prevent infection.  Only a small fraction of patients are able to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies, and by the time they do, the virus has already integrated into the genomes of their T-cells,  said Ming Tian, lecturer on genetics at Harvard Medical School and a research associate in the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine (PCMM) at Boston Children s Hospital. Tian is part of a group led by HMS Professor of Genetics and PCMM Director Frederick Alt that has developed a technology to greatly speed up HIV development. Described Sept. 8 in Cell, the group s method generates mouse models with built-in human immune systems. The models recapitulate what the human immune system does, only much more rapidly, enabling researchers to continuously test and tweak potential HIV vaccines. An enhanced human immune system People exposed to HIV (or any pathogen) first make precursor antibodies, which then mature via mutation and natural selection an evolution-like process that makes the antibodies more protective over time.  This is a long-term process involving many intermediate antibodies, making it very challenging to design HIV vaccines to protect uninfected individuals,  said Alt, who is also the Charles A. Janeway Professor of Pediatrics at Boston Children s and co-senior author on the paper.  To facilitate this effort, we wanted to design a new type of humanized mouse model that would be more physiological and allow us to very quickly test new vaccination strategies,  he said. How do broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV naturally arise? The team began with the basic components of the known human antibody response to HIV. Building a diverse immune repertoire  Our immune system s B lymphocytes assemble antibody genes from building blocks known as V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) segments. Through various V-D-J combinations, our B lymphocytes are able to produce enormous numbers of different antibodies enough to recognize almost any invader. After a B cell recognizes a pathogen, it further mutates the V-D-J sequence, often in successive steps, enabling its progeny B cells to produce even stronger antibodies. Prior work had revealed the structure of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV and deduced the V-D-J combinations that constituted their precursors. The team inserted the corresponding DNA into mouse embryonic stem cells. The researchers then used the modified embryonic stem cells to rapidly generate mice whose B cells were primed to assemble a highly diverse set of HIV antibody precursors combining the human precursor broadly neutralizing antibody V segment with various D or J segments. An iterative process The mice began by making immature  ancestor  antibodies. Collaborators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  Vaccine Research Center, together with colleagues at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, the Scripps Research Institute, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and other institutes, then sequentially exposed the Alt lab s test mice to a series of specially designed HIV antigens. Through this sequential exposure, the animals  B cells  learned  to produce ever more diverse and effective humanized antibodies that eventually were able to neutralize some HIV viral strains.  Rather than go through generations of mouse breeding to make models, our approach allows us to quickly delete and replace genomic elements to create changes in B cells,  explained Alt.  Thus, we can rapidly reprogram this mouse model with the intermediate antibody genes selected from the first successful immunizations and expose them to new antigens,  said Alt.  Over time, we hope this process will lead to the generation of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies.  As the engineered antigens engaged the system, upping the ante each time, the researchers could watch the antibodies acquire mutations.  You move the B cells in a direction and find out what works and the potential hang ups,  said Alt.  You then work to figure out how to next adapt the mouse model and the immunogens to eventually get to a broadly neutralizing antibody stage.  Speeding up AIDS vaccine development There s still a long way to go, but Alt believes the technology could hasten the search for a truly effective HIV vaccine, as well as vaccines against other viruses. It may also allow researchers to generate highly specific therapeutic antibodies.  We re hoping it will be broadly useful,  Alt said.","Published: September 9, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/linking-rna-structure-and-function-199744,Linking RNA Structure and Function Biologists have deciphered a lncRNA structure and used the information to investigate its cellular protein interactions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Several years ago, biologists discovered a new type of genetic material known as long noncoding RNA. This RNA does not code for proteins and is copied from sections of the genome once believed to be  junk DNA.  Since then, scientists have found evidence that long noncoding RNA, or lncRNA, plays roles in many cellular processes, including guiding cell fate during embryonic development. However, it has been unknown exactly how lncRNA exerts this influence. Inspired by historical work showing that structure plays a role in the function of other classes of RNA such as transfer RNA, MIT biologists have now deciphered the structure of one type of lncRNA and used that information to figure out how it interacts with a cellular protein to control the development of heart muscle cells. This is one of first studies to link the structure of lncRNAs to their function.  Emerging data points to fundamental roles for many of these molecules in development and disease, so we believe that determining the structure of lncRNAs is critical for understanding how they function,  says Laurie Boyer, the Irwin and Helen Sizer Career Development Associate Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering at MIT and the senior author of the study, which appears in the journal Molecular Cell on Sept. 8. Learning more about how lncRNAs control cell differentiation could offer a new approach to developing drugs for patients whose hearts have been damaged by cardiovascular disease, aging, or cancer. The paper s lead author is MIT postdoc Zhihong Xue. Other MIT authors are undergraduate Boryana Doyle and Sarnoff Fellow Arune Gulati. Scott Hennelly, Irina Novikova, and Karissa Sanbonmatsu of Los Alamos National Laboratory are also authors of the paper. Probing the heart Boyer s lab previously identified a mouse lncRNA known as Braveheart, which is found at higher levels in the heart compared to other tissues. In 2013, Boyer showed that this RNA molecule is necessary for normal development of heart muscle cells. In the new study, the researchers decided to investigate which regions of the 600-nucleotide RNA molecule are crucial to its function.  We knew Braveheart was critical for heart muscle cell development, but we didn t know the detailed molecular mechanism of how this lncRNA functioned, so we hypothesized that determining its structure could reveal new clues,  Xue says. To determine Braveheart s structure, the researchers used a technique called chemical probing, in which they treated the RNA molecule with a chemical reagent that modifies exposed RNA nucleotides. By analyzing which nucleotides bind to this reagent, the researchers can identify single-stranded regions, double-stranded helices, loops, and other structures. This analysis revealed that Braveheart has several distinct structural regions, or motifs. The researchers then tested which of these motifs were most important to the molecule s function. To their surprise, they found that removing 11 nucleotides, composing a loop that represents just 2 percent of the entire molecule, halted normal heart cell development. The researchers then searched for proteins that the Braveheart loop might interact with to control heart cell development. In a screen of about 10,000 proteins, they discovered that a transcription factor protein called cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) binds strongly to this region. Previous studies have shown that mutations in CNBP can lead to heart defects in mice and humans. Further studies revealed that CNBP acts as a potential roadblock for cardiac development, and that Braveheart releases this repressor, allowing cells to become heart muscle.  This is one of the first studies to relate lncRNA structure to function,  says John Rinn, a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University, who was not involved in the research.  It is critical that we move toward understanding the specific functional domains and their structural elements if we are going to get lncRNAs up to speed with proteins, where we already know how certain parts play certain roles. In fact, you can predict what a protein does nowadays because of the wealth of structure-to-function relationships known for proteins,  Rinn says. Building a fingerprint Scientists have not yet identified a human counterpart to the mouse Braveheart lncRNA, in part because human and mouse lncRNA sequences are poorly conserved, even though protein-coding genes of the two species are usually very similar. However, now that the researchers know the structure of the mouse Braveheart lncRNA, they plan to analyze human lncRNA molecules to identify similar structures, which would suggest that they have similar functions.  We re taking this motif and we re using it to build a fingerprint so we can potentially find motifs that resemble that lncRNA across species,  Boyer says.  We also hope to extend this work to identify the modes of action of a catalog of motifs so that we can better predict lncRNAs with important functions.  The researchers also plan to apply what they have learned about lncRNA toward engineering new therapeutics.  We fully expect that unraveling lncRNA structure-to-function relationships will open up exciting new therapeutic modalities in the near future,  Boyer says.","Published: September 9, 2016"

The FULFIL study was designed to evaluate the effects of once daily FF/UMEC/VI compared with twice daily Symbicort  Turbohaler  (budesonide/formoterol 400/12 mcg) in patients with advanced COPD. The study met its two co-primary endpoints. At 24 weeks, there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p<0.001) benefit for FF/UMEC/VI in both lung function, measured as mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 (171mL, 95% confidence interval [148, 194]) and health-related quality of life, measured as mean change from baseline in St George s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (-6.6 units for closed triple versus -4.3 units for budesonide/formoterol, difference of -2.2 units, 95% confidence interval [-3.5, -1.0]). In addition, the proportion of patients who responded with the minimum clinically important difference in SGRQ (-4 units) was 50% on closed triple and 41% on budesonide/formoterol (odds ratio 1.41; p<0.001). This benefit of treatment with closed triple therapy was also observed in the subset of patients who received treatment for up to 52 weeks, with a statistically significant improvement of 179mL in trough FEV1 and a numerical improvement of -2.7 units in SGRQ total score at Week 52 with closed triple therapy compared with budesonide/formoterol. The study also showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations with closed triple therapy compared to budesonide/formoterol, with closed triple therapy showing a 35% reduction versus budesonide/formoterol based on data up to 24 weeks (p=0.002) and a 44% reduction in the subset of patients that received treatment for up to 52 weeks (p=0.006). The safety profile of the closed triple combination up to 24 weeks and in the subset of patients up to 52 weeks was consistent with the known profile of the individual medicines and their combinations. Up to both 24 weeks and 52 weeks, the most common adverse events in both treatment arms were nasopharyngitis, headache and COPD worsening. The incidence of investigator-reported serious adverse events for closed triple and budesonide/formoterol, respectively, was 5.4% and 5.7% up to 24 weeks, and 10.0% and 12.7% up to 52 weeks. Up to 24 weeks, the incidence of pneumonia was 1.0% in the closed triple arm and 0.3% in the budesonide/formoterol arm. Up to 52 weeks, it was 1.9% in the closed triple arm and 1.8% in the budesonide/formoterol arm. Dave Allen, Head of Respiratory R&D at GSK, commented:  Exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity in COPD and reducing these symptomatic and potentially life-threatening episodes is a priority for physicians. To observe such significant reductions in exacerbations with closed triple therapy versus budesonide/formoterol is encouraging and supports our belief that a convenient, once-daily triple therapy dosing option delivered via a single inhaler could provide compelling and clinically important treatment benefits in this more severe patient population.  Mike Aguiar, CEO of Innoviva, Inc, added:  The results of the FULFIL study confirm that the closed triple therapy of FF/UMEC/VI is superior to dual therapy of budesonide/formoterol on the key measures of lung function, quality of life and exacerbation reduction. These results contribute to the medicine s positive benefit/risk profile and increase understanding of the clinical value of triple therapy in those patients that physicians decide would benefit from triple therapy versus dual therapy alone.  GSK s plans are on schedule for regulatory submissions of the closed triple combination therapy for COPD in the US and Europe by the end of 2016.","Published: September 9, 2016"

Two antibodies developed with this strategy blocked the invasion of human cells by all five ebolaviruses, and one of them protected mice exposed to lethal doses of Ebola Zaire and Sudan, the two most dangerous. The team included scientists from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Integrated Biotherapeutics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and The Scripps Research Institute. Ebola viruses cause a highly fatal disease for which no approved vaccines or treatments are available. About two dozen Ebola outbreaks have been documented since 1976, when infections first occurred in villages along the Ebola River in Africa. The largest outbreak in history the 2014-2015 Western Africa epidemic caused more than 11,000 deaths and infected approximately 29,000 people. Monoclonal antibodies, which bind to and neutralize specific pathogens and toxins, have emerged as the most promising treatments for Ebola patients. A critical problem, however, is that most antibody therapies target only one specific ebolavirus. For example, the most promising experimental therapy ZMappTM, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies is specific for Ebola virus Zaire, and doesn t work against the other two viruses (Sudan and Bundibugyo), which have both caused major outbreaks. The broad-spectrum antibodies developed by the research team represent an important advance against one of the world s most dangerous pathogens.  It s impossible to predict where the next ebolavirus outbreak will occur or which virus will cause it,  said co-senior author Jonathan R. Lai, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry at Einstein.  So the best therapy would be a monoclonal antibody that is active against the glycoproteins of all five ebolaviruses and until our study, no such antibody had demonstrated the ability to do that. We hope that further testing will establish our antibodies as safe and effective for treating those exposed to any ebolavirus.  Exploiting Ebola s Achilles  Heel In 2011, a team that included co-senior authors Kartik Chandran, Ph.D., professor of microbiology & immunology at Einstein, and John M. Dye, Ph.D., chief of viral immunology at USAMRIID, discovered that all filoviruses (the family to which ebolaviruses and the more distantly related Marburg virus belong) have an Achilles  heel: To infect and multiply in human cells, they must all bind to a host-cell protein called Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). But capitalizing on that knowledge required a completely new approach to targeting viruses: exploiting the fact that Ebola and many other viruses must enter host cell compartments called lysosomes. Once safely inside the lysosomes, the viruses transform and expose key portions of their exterior that the research team successfully targeted using monoclonal antibodies. Ebola Virus Entry Into Cell To gain entry to cells, filoviruses bind to the host cell s outer membrane via glycoproteins (proteins to which carbohydrate chains are attached) that bristle from the virus s surface. A portion of the cell membrane then surrounds the virus and pinches off, eventually developing into a lysosome a membrane-bound, intracellular compartment filled with enzymes to digest foreign and cellular components. Filoviruses then use the host cells  resources to break out of their lysosomal  prisons  so they can enter the host cell s cytoplasm to multiply. Enzymes in the lysosome slice a  cap  from the virus s glycoproteins, unveiling a site that binds to the NPC1 embedded in the lysosome membrane. NPC1, which normally helps transport cholesterol within the cell, offers Ebola virus its only means of escaping the lysosome and multiplying. By fitting its protein  key  into the NPC1  lock,  the virus fuses itself to the lysosome membrane. Now the virus can propel its RNA from the lysosome and into the cell s cytoplasm, where it can finally replicate itself. Penetrating an Invisibility Cloak The research team realized that monoclonal antibodies could potentially thwart all filovirus infections by neutralizing the viral protein that binds to NPC1, or by neutralizing NPC1 itself. There was just one problem: Reflecting Ebola s ingenuity, both targets reside only in lysosomes deep within cells making them invisible to the immune system and shielded from attack by conventional antibodies. Co-senior authors Drs. Chandran, Dye and Lai an expert in engineering antibodies devised a clever  Trojan horse  strategy for overcoming the virus s invisibility cloak: Just as the citizens of Troy unwittingly pulled a wooden horse filled with Greek soldiers into their walled city, the researchers tricked the viruses into carrying the means of their own destruction along with them into host cells. To do so, the research team synthesized two types of  bispecific  antibodies, each consisting of two monoclonal antibodies combined into one molecule. One bispecific antibody was devised to neutralize the viral protein that binds to NPC1, the other to target NPC1. Both had one monoclonal antibody in common: antibody FVM09, which binds to the surface glycoproteins of all ebolaviruses while the virus is outside cells, allowing the bispecific antibodies to hitch a ride with the virus into the lysosome. FVM09 was developed by co-senior author M. Javad Aman, Ph.D. at Integrated Biotherapeutics. Once in the lysosome, the bispecific antibodies are released from the viral surface when enzymes in the lysosome slice off the glycoprotein caps allowing the business ends of the bispecific antibodies to swing into action. One bispecific antibody combined FVM09 with antibody MR72, which was isolated from a human survivor of Marburg virus infection by co-senior author James E. Crowe Jr., M.D., at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. MR72 targets the NPC1-binding viral protein that is unveiled by all filoviruses in lysosomes. The second bispecific antibody links FVM09 to antibody mAb-548, developed at Einstein, which zeroes in on NPC1. With one bispecific antibody targeting the  lock  (NPC1) and the other targeting the  key  (the virus s NPC1-binding protein), both had the potential for preventing Ebola virus from interacting with NPC1 and escaping from the lysosome into the cytoplasm. Putting Antibodies to the Test The researchers then tested their bispecific antibodies against ebolaviruses in the lab. They initially used a harmless virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) that had been genetically engineered to display glycoproteins from all five ebolaviruses on its surface. The researchers incubated the bispecific antibodies with the Ebola-like viruses and then added the mixtures to human cells in tissue culture. Both bispecific antibodies successfully neutralized all five viruses. Work in the high-containment facilities at USAMRIID confirmed that these antibodies also blocked infection by the actual Zaire, Sudan, and Bundibugyo ebolaviruses. Next came studies at USAMRIID to test whether the two bispecific antibodies could protect mice infected with the two most dangerous ebolaviruses, Zaire and Sudan. Researchers, led by Dr. Dye, administered the bispecific antibodies two days after mice were exposed to a lethal dose of virus. Co-first authors Anna Wec, M.S., Elisabeth Nyakatura, Ph.D.The bispecific antibody that targeted the viral binding protein provided good protection to mice exposed to both viruses. As expected, the bispecific antibody that targeted NPC1 did not protect mice. It was designed to bind specifically to human NPC1, which differs slightly in structure from the NPC1 protein found in mice.  We would love to extend this approach to Ebola s distant cousin, Marburg virus, to create a true pan-filovirus therapeutic antibody,  said Dr. Chandran.  Furthermore, we hope that our 'Trojan horse' antibody strategy of targeting viruses in lysosomes might work against other disease-causing viruses like flu, dengue, or Lassa, which, like Ebola, also enter host-cell lysosomes as part of their life cycles.  As a next step, both bispecific antibodies will need to be tested in nonhuman primates, the current gold standard for anti-Ebola therapeutics.","Published: September 9, 2016"

This award will allow us to strengthen our collaboration with clinical key opinion leaders and industry partners, with the goal of further solidifying the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of ImmunoXpert  in reducing antibiotic misuse.  Bacterial and viral infections are often clinically indistinguishable, leading to antibiotic overuse. This promotes the spread of drug-resistant bacteria   one of the leading global healthcare challenges of our time. As part of the solution, ImmunoXpert  is an innovative diagnostic test that uses the body s own immune system to accurately distinguish between bacterial and viral infections, thereby empowering physicians to make better informed antibiotic treatment decisions. ImmunoXpert  has been validated in a series of clinical studies enrolling thousands of patients worldwide, is regulatory cleared for use in Europe (CE-IVD), and is currently in use in select centers of excellence.  ""This award complements two previous highly competitive grants of over  9 million received from the European Commission, including the 2015 Small and Medium-sized Enterprise instrument awarded to support the development of ImmunoPoC , our second-generation product for rapid point-of-care testing,"" said Dr. Kfir Oved, CTO of MeMed. The new grant will facilitate introduction of ImmunoXpert  at additional leading medical centers, with the goal of monitoring the management of 1,200 children with respiratory tract infections (RTI) or fever without source, in collaboration between University of Milan, University Hospital Mannheim, Tecan, Quantify Research, and MeMed.  In children, RTIs account for almost 50% of doctor visits and hospitalizations, with unexplained fever responsible for as much as 25% of pediatric ED visits. ""A key intervention for reducing antibiotic overuse in respiratory infections is development and adoption of improved diagnostics,"" says Prof. Susanna Esposito, pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Milan and President of the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders. ""The EU grant will help us to further validate an innovative diagnostic to push the boundaries of the field.""  Prof. Tobias Tenenbaum, Head of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pulmonology Unit at the University Hospital Mannheim, states, ""We welcome the opportunity to further evaluate the impact of ImmunoXpert  on the management of febrile children in real working conditions.""

As part of this collaboration, twoXAR will make disease-to-candidate predictions using the company s software-driven discovery platform. These candidates will be validated through preclinical studies by researchers at the Asian Liver Center, under the direction of Mei-Sze Chua, PhD, Senior Scientist in the laboratory of Samuel So, MD, FACS. HCC is a primary malignancy of the liver and occurs predominantly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, often caused by hepatitis B or C virus infection. HCC is generally refractory to chemotherapy, and only one targeted treatment, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, is indicated for HCC. However, sorafenib has been shown to marginally extend survival and can elicit severe side effects.   New drugs in development for HCC primarily target tyrosine kinases, but they have demonstrated mixed success in clinical trials, suggesting a need for new therapies targeting a more diverse set of biomarkers,  said Andrew A. Radin, co-founder and CEO of twoXAR.  We are very pleased to be working with Dr. So and his colleagues at the Asian Liver Center who are dedicated to improving outcomes for patients and raising awareness of chronic hepatitis B infection and its connection to liver cancer through efforts such as the JOINJADE initiative.  twoXAR has developed patent pending algorithms that enable it to find unanticipated associations between disease and drug candidates orders of magnitudes faster than wet lab based approaches. The company s integrative biomedical software platform rapidly evaluates massive public and proprietary datasets to identify and rank high probability disease to candidate matches. These matches can then be used to prioritize existing candidates, perform targeted searches and identify novel drug candidates for further preclinical and clinical testing. The platform is disease agnostic and has been tested on more than 60 conditions to date in therapeutic areas including autoimmune, oncologic, and neurologic disorders.

Genetic analyses of the samples they gathered turned up antimicrobial chemicals and antibiotic-resistance genes. That both were in the dust doesn't necessarily mean one caused the other, but finding them together provides probable cause for a more research, says Erica M. Hartmann, who led the project while a postdoctoral fellow in the UO's Biology and the Built Environment Center and Institute of Ecology and Evolution. One of the antimicrobials is triclosan, which is the most commonly used antibacterial ingredient in personal care products. It is among antimicrobials that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled Sept. 2 must be removed from hand and bar soaps within the next year. Triclosan has previously been linked with a gene that alters the ribosome   a complex of RNA and protein in cells that is responsible for RNA translation   in a way that makes bacteria resistant to antibiotics. The new study is now online ahead of print in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Hartmann joined the faculty at Northwestern University in Chicago this month. ""We might be tempted to think of the antimicrobial chemicals as being guilty by association,"" Hartmann said. ""We don t really know how the genes or the chemicals got there. They may have arrived by completely different routes and their being found together is a coincidence. However, we know that antimicrobial chemicals can cause an increase in antibiotic resistance in other situations, so I think these results provide a good reason to take a closer look at what s going on in dust."" The FDA's ruling, she added, does not yet require that antimicrobials be removed from many other products, such as paints, baby toys, bedding and kitchen utensils. ""We don t have solid proof that putting antimicrobials in these products makes them any healthier, but we do know that triclosan in the environment can be harmful,"" she said. The study is the first to document the co-existence of the chemicals and genes in indoor dust. In all, the paper reports six significant associations, with the levels of triclosan being comparable to those seen at some wastewater treatment plants. Overall, Hartmann's team identified several antibiotic resistance genes, the most common of which conferred resistance to tetracycline antibiotics. The chemicals and genes came from 44 samples from 31 varied-use spaces, using vacuum-fitted collectors. The building, built in 1921, has window ventilation but also experiences infiltration of outdoor air through cracks around doors and windows. DNA processing was done in the UO Genomics Core Facility with data-processing assistance from collaborators of Harvard University's School of Public Health. People don't need to be particularly alarmed, Hartmann said. Antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, for example, are 10 to 100 times less abundant than in the human gut, she said. In infants, the genes occur naturally in the absence of antibiotics when microbes first colonize the gut. ""Antibiotic resistance is common in a lot of different places,"" she said. ""Just because we find it in a certain building doesn t mean that everyone who goes into that building is going to get a (drug-resistant) infection. The building is still as safe as it was before the study, but now we have a better idea of how many antibiotic resistance genes there are, and we have reason to believe that the amount of antibiotic resistance genes may be tied to the amount of antimicrobial chemicals."" Triclosan and antibiotic resistance have been found in other places and in the environment, Hartmann said, but finding them in indoor dust brings the threat closer to home. Average concentrations of triclosan found in the dust were much less than those found as the active ingredient in toothpaste, where it helps to reduce plaque and gum disease. The new FDA ban does not include toothpaste.","Published: September 9, 2016"

The Soviet Union produced anthrax spores on an industrial scale but repeatedly denied the existence of their biological weapons program. This study, to be published in the September issue of the journal mBio, represents a precise and detailed examination of the anthrax strain used in their weapons development, and includes an anthrax genetic database that puts the weapons strain into a global context. ""I have been studying this anthrax outbreak and these specimens for more than 20 years. Finally, using genomic technology, we could comprehensively characterize this pathogen genome,"" said Dr. Paul Keim, a Regents Professor of Biology and the Cowden Endowed Chair of Microbiology at NAU, Director of TGen's Pathogen Genomics Division, and the study's lead author. ""This is the signature agent of the world's largest biological weapons program and now we have it in our genetic databases. Anywhere this strain shows up again, we will be able to identify it and track it back to its source. This is now an essential part of our forensic arsenal,"" said Dr. Keim, who also is Director of NAU's Microbial Genetics & Genomics Center (MGGen). The anthrax bacterium produces small capsules, or spores, that can lie dormant for decades. After settling inside the human lung, for example, it can cause a severe disease that, if not treated with antibiotics, kills 90 percent of those it infects. Anthrax is found in many parts of the globe and dispersed through the human movement of animal parts contaminated with spores. Wool and hair from goats and sheep are moved globally as textiles or their precursors. When these originate in anthrax endemic regions, they can carry the spores, which are long-lived. While this bacterium has little variation from strain to strain, whole genome sequencing has identified DNA fingerprints that enable molecular epidemiology, tracing it to its source. When anthrax outbreaks occur, their whole genome profile are now routinely compared to the genetic database to identify possible sources and exclude others. This type of analysis was used by the FBI to track the spores in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks, which infected 22 people and killed five. The Soviet Union had signed the Biological Weapons convention that prohibited the use of biological agents, including anthrax, as weapons. The United States' biological weapons program was eliminated in a decree by President Richard Nixon in 1969, but the Soviet program was maintained and expanded in a covert fashion for decades. In 1992, an investigative team from the United States led by noted Harvard biologist Dr. Matt Meselson characterized the 1979 Sverdlovsk outbreak by interviewing local physicians, visiting cemeteries and examining autopsy specimens. This investigation, along with accounts by Ken Alibek, a former Soviet scientist, revealed that the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak was due to an industrial accident.  A faulty filter at a Soviet spore production facility allowed anthrax spores, in a silent plume, to drift with the wind over the city and into the nearby countryside. Nearly 70 Sverdlovsk inhabitants died as far as three miles downwind from the facility, but more anthrax-susceptible farm animals died over 25 miles away. It remains the world's deadliest human outbreak of inhalation anthrax. The bacterial genomes were generated from autopsy tissue specimens of two Sverdlovsk anthrax victims. These tissues were moved to the United States with permission of Sverdlovsk pathologists to continue the investigation into the disease outbreak. From these, it was established that the anthrax pathogen was detected within their tissues and the victims died from inhaling the spores. The Sverdlovsk anthrax genome was compared to the global genome database maintained by NAU to identify its close relatives and to look for evidence of genetic engineering. The Flagstaff research team found that this strain was closely related to other Asian isolates with very few differences to naturally occurring anthrax. There were no signs of genetic engineering. Dr. Keim notes that the Soviets had to be very meticulous to avoid mutant variants from dominating their production stock. Invariably when wild anthrax strains are grown extensively in the laboratory, they adapt to those conditions and lose the killing power. ""The Sverdlovsk strain's genome looked very much like those of wild strains we see across Asia,"" Dr. Keim said. Dr. Meselson, who was not part of the current paper, notes: ""If this strain had been grown repeated in the laboratory, it would have mutated to a form that had less virulence and less capacity to cause anthrax. The Soviet scientists must been very meticulous in their maintenance of the natural form.""","Published: September 9, 2016"

These short-term results, the latest from this closely watched study in blood cancer of these modified cells, called CAR T cells, were released Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Thirty-two participants in the trial received an infusion of CAR T cells following chemotherapy (called lymphodepletion) that was given to make space in the patient s body for the infused CAR T cells. The team found that the CAR T cells most effectively knocked out the cancer in a group of 11 patients who received a two-drug combination chemo followed by an intermediate dose of the engineered T cells. Seven of these participants, or 64 percent, went into complete remission    which is very high  given the advanced stage of these patients' cancers, said Dr. Cameron Turtle, an immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and one of the study leaders.  These data demonstrate how dialing in the treatment parameters can make these cells more effective cancer-fighters in patients with this particular type of cancer, Turtle said.  The main message is that you can treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma with CAR T cells and get very good response rates with optimization of the CAR T-cell dose and lymphodepletion,  Turtle said. The addition of a chemo drug called fludarabine in the lymphodepletion step helped the CAR T cells multiply more and survive longer in these patients than in those who had just been prepped with a chemo regimen without fludarabine, the researchers found. Among the 20 patients who received the  chemo regimen with fludarabine, half of them achieved a complete remission, regardless of T-cell dose. (Of the remaining 12 patients who received a different lymphodepletion regimen, only one of them went into complete remission after CAR T-cell infusion.)  Strategies like modifying the lymphodepletion in conjunction with suitable CAR T-cell dosing can have a big impact on clinical outcome,  Turtle said. One of several ongoing trials of CAR T cells around the nation, this study s hallmark is its use of a 1-to-1 ratio of helper and killer CAR T cells, which join forces to kill CD19-positive tumor cells. By controlling the mixture of T cells that patients receive, the researchers can see relationships between cell doses and patient outcomes that were previously elusive.  The idea   is that by doing that, we would get more reproducible data around the effects of the cells   both beneficial effects against the cancer and also any side effects they might cause the patient,  said the Hutch s Dr. Stan Riddell, one of the senior authors on the paper, along with Hutch colleague Dr. David Maloney.  And then by adjusting the dose, we could improve what we call the therapeutic index: the benefit against the tumor, without too much toxicity.  On average, patients on the trial had undergone five previous rounds of cancer treatments, and half of them had even had blood stem transplants. Despite this, their cancers had still come back by the time they joined the trial.  They really had very few treatment options at the time they enrolled in our study,  Riddell said. The study team extracted disease-fighting T cells from patients  bloodstreams and sent them to a specialized lab at Fred Hutch to be reengineered. There, technicians inserted DNA instructions for making a synthetic, cancer-targeting chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, into the cell s genomes. The CARs used in the study, which were developed in Riddell s lab at Fred Hutch, target a molecule called CD19 that is found on the surface of certain white blood cells, including some types of lymphoma cells. After reengineering, the cells were multiplied in the lab using a process unique to Fred Hutch, in which cells undergo an extra growth-stimulating step. The team found that they were able to successfully generate CAR T-cell products even for patients who naturally had very few T cells. After chemo, the study team transferred the freshly engineered T cells back into the patients through an IV. There, the cells encountered their CD19 targets, began to multiply, and went to work. Some patients experienced serious toxicities due to CAR T-cell infusion. The researchers found that reducing the dose of T cells helped to reduce the occurrence of severe side effects. Currently, there is no reliable way to predict which patients are most likely to be hit by these serious side effects, which limits doctors  options for preventing or managing them. In this study, the researchers found that high levels of certain immune-signaling chemicals, or cytokines, in patients  bloodstreams the day after CAR T-cell infusion were linked to the subsequent development of serious toxicities. It s not yet clear what an early intervention for CAR T-cell related toxicity might look like, the investigators said.  But at least we now have the first bit of information that allows us to design those types of studies,  said Riddell. Improving a promising strategy The complete remission rates seen so far in this study do not reach the astoundingly high 93 percent rate the team published earlier this year on CD19-targeted CAR T cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Turtle suspects that the fact that leukemia flows as a liquid in the blood and marrow makes it easier for the CAR T-cells to attack that cancer.  In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we still have very good complete remission rates, but they re lower than those seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,  Turtle said.  And that may relate to the fact that lymphoma often grows as lumps, so it may be a more complex tumor microenvironment.  The factors in lymphoma tumors that may impede T-cell activity   and ways to circumvent them   still need to be pinpointed, Turtle said.","Published: September 9, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/stem-cell-transplant-without-radiation-or-chemotherapy-210355,Stem Cell Transplant Without Radiation or Chemotherapy Researchers have successfully performed stem cell transplants without using radiation or chemotherapy  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a proof-of-concept study in mice, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine successfully performed hematopoietic (blood) stem cell (HSC) transplants (also called bone marrow transplants) without first using radiation or chemotherapy. Instead of these toxic conditioning regimens, which are normally used to clear existing stem cells in the bone marrow before transplantation, the researchers used two biological agents that selectively eliminated HSCs in the host mice but left other tissues and organs undamaged. If the technique can be translated to humans,  hematopoietic cell therapy could potentially be expanded to those who currently cannot safely tolerate the preparative therapy for bone marrow transplant,  including frail, elderly patients, said Richard Little, M.D., of NCI's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, who was not involved in the study. The results were published August 10 in Science Translational Medicine. Clearing the Way for New Stem Cells Stem cell transplantation can be a lifesaving treatment for patients with some types of cancer, primarily blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. However, the procedure is sometimes grueling for patients and potentially dangerous. Prior to the transplant, patients are often treated with radiation and chemotherapy to kill existing stem cells in the bone marrow so the transplanted donor stem cells have a safe harbor in which to grow and repopulate the body with healthy blood cells (a process called engraftment). And, in the case of HSCs from a genetically similar but not identical donor (an allogeneic transplant), these conditioning treatments help to suppress an immune response against the transplanted cells. But the conditioning regimen can damage a patient s healthy cells and tissues as well as their HSCs, resulting in side effects, including infections, respiratory problems, and organ damage that can be fatal in a small percentage of patients. If the preparation for transplantation could be made less toxic to healthy cells, explained Judith Shizuru, M.D., Ph.D., the study s senior author, the procedure could potentially be used not just for cancer but for other indications. These include treating diseases caused by malfunctioning blood and immune cells, including autoimmune diseases and blood disorders marked by abnormal hemoglobin (such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia), as well as improving gene therapy and organ transplantation. Previous research, by the Stanford team and others, has shown that biological agents that target c-kit, a protein that HSCs use for many of their normal cellular functions, can deplete HSCs in mice lacking a functioning immune system. However, in earlier studies, targeting this single protein did not deplete the HSCs in mice with a functioning immune system. So the Stanford researchers tested whether targeting a second protein, called CD47, in addition to c-kit could eliminate HSCs in mice with a healthy immune system. CD47 serves as a  marker of self  for HSCs and some other types of cells, telling the immune system not to attack them. By blocking CD47 with a specially designed molecule, the researchers hoped to make HSCs vulnerable to treatment with an agent targeting c-kit. The combination worked. In mice with healthy immune systems that were treated with both agents, the researchers saw a 10,000-fold reduction in the targeted HSCs, to the point where  we could no longer measure them,  said the study s lead author, Akanksha Chhabra, Ph.D. In further experiments, mice with healthy immune systems were treated with both agents or with a c-kit-targeting agent alone and then underwent a modified form of an autologous stem cell transplant. The mice that received both agents showed 100 times more engraftment of the donor stem cells in their bone marrow than mice treated with the anti-c-kit agent alone, and healthy cells derived from the transplanted HSCs were found in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, and thymus. The researchers also tested in mice whether the general approach would work in a type of allogeneic transplant. They treated mice with the two-agent conditioning regimen and with additional biological agents to deplete immune cells (T cells) to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted cells. The transplant was successful, with the donor cells successfully establishing themselves in the recipient s bone marrow and producing healthy blood and immune cells. Toward Human Trials Agents that target c-kit and CD47 have already been tested in human studies in healthy volunteers and cancer patients, respectively, explained Dr. Shizuru, and no major side effect have been observed. The team has also recently begun enrolling patients in a clinical trial using an agent that targets c-kit for children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In mice, added Dr. Chhabra, researchers have seen some graying of the fur and drops in sperm counts due to the c-kit antibody, but  when the treatment stopped, the sperm counts did go [back] up,  she said. The current study did not look at long-term effects on fertility. The next step is to test the drug combination as a conditioning regimen for HSC transplantation in nonhuman primates, said Dr. Shizuru. Since the drugs have already begun human safety studies as single agents, she thinks early human trials of the combination for HSC transplantation could begin in the next 3 to 5 years.  The goal of this study, and what we re hoping we ve shown, is that we re going to change the way that blood and marrow transplants will be done in the near future,"" Dr. Shizuru said. ""We foresee that transplants will be safer to perform and that many more patients can be treated with this potentially curative cellular therapy. ","Published: September 9, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/device-improves-measurement-of-water-pollution-192350,Device Improves Measurement of Water Pollution Researchers have developed a device that makes it easier to measure contaminant levels in water  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. With help from UConn s National Science Foundation Innovation Corps program, Accelerate UConn, marine geochemist Penny Vlahos and graduate student Joe Warren are now well on their way to commercializing their technology. Access to clean water is a major concern for nations around the globe. The new device can measure pollution in oceans, lakes, and rivers, and even in the home.  I was frustrated that we weren t measuring contaminants as often or as well as we should, just because it was too labor-intensive and costly,  says Vlahos.  This device lets us test more bodies of water quickly, easily, and inexpensively, and yields results that better reflect the overall situation. The potential environmental impact is huge.  Currently, if the quality of a body of water needs testing, a large sample is collected   between five and 20 liters of water   and is then transported to a lab for analysis. This process, known as  grab sampling,  is labor-intensive and can be prohibitively expensive. As a result, small-scale testing by citizens who want to measure contaminants in a local stream or in their private wells isn t feasible. In contrast, Vlahos says her technology is so easy a child could do it. In fact, the device doesn t require collecting a water sample at all, because it uses a process called  passive sampling.  The small, ecofriendly sampling device is placed directly into the body of water being tested, where it stays for a few hours and is then removed. Once back in the lab, it takes a little over two hours to conduct a full analysis of the water s target contaminant levels. Another important feature of the new technology is that it provides continuous sampling over time, which isn t possible with grab sampling. Since the device remains in the water, it gives a more representative picture of an aquatic environment s overall health, instead of the limited snapshot from grab sampling. Because of their low cost, a greater number of the semi-disposable passive samplers can be simultaneously deployed over a larger area to yield more comprehensive and informative data.The device currently measures a host of organic contaminants, such as industrial chemicals like PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), pesticides, synthetic chemicals that mimic hormones like estrogen, and even munition compounds from unexploded weapons that find their way into bodies of water. Vlahos has already tested the technology in a variety of aquatic and sedimentary environments, both nationally and internationally. Although Vlahos was confident in her technology s ability to improve on standard industry practices, she wasn t sure how to commercialize it or who the target customer would be. So she and Warren turned to Accelerate UConn, a program that helps entrepreneurial faculty and students at all UConn campuses validate their technology business ideas. Learning the Ropes of Starting a Business The program was launched in May 2015, and is jointly operated by the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CCEI), housed in the School of Business.  Many UConn innovations have valuable, real-world applications, but our faculty and students need the right tools to successfully commercialize them,  says Jeff Seemann, UConn vice president for research.  Accelerate UConn provides those tools, and helps promising technologies take those critical first steps towards the market, where they can benefit the state s citizens and economy.  Warren, who has long aspired to be an entrepreneur, acted as the team s  entrepreneurial lead.  He was responsible for attending weekly webinars, making presentations, and conducting interviews with potential customers to validate the researchers  assumptions about their technology and the market. He says he could relate to the program s Lean Launchpad methodology because of his background in science.  Even though commercializing a technology was totally new to me, the framework they provided was familiar,  says Warren.  By running small iterations of  experiments  on products or services with potential customers, you can really shape your business before you have to fully launch, and do a lot of the learning before you spend lots of time and money.  The knowledge that participants gain from completing the Accelerate UConn program can serve as a stepping stone for additional funding through internal sources, like the UConn SPARK Technology Commercialization Fund, as well as external sources like federal Small Business Innovation Research grants. Warren recently won a $15,000 Summer Fellowship offered by CCEI, where he and Vlahos were able to build upon the progress they had made in Accelerate UConn. As a result, he was also selected to compete for an additional $15,000 provided through the Wolff New Venture Competition this September. Timothy B. Folta, UConn professor of business and CCEI faculty director, says entrepreneurs like Vlahos and Warren gain a new outlook on their products from participating in Accelerate UConn, and this can be important for their success as entrepreneurs.  One of the most potent criticisms of university technology commercialization is that technologists do not have a good understanding about whether customers really want their technology, because they are enamored with it,  Folta says.  Accelerate UConn aims to correct this bias.  Vlahos and Warren are not slowing down. They are actively seeking additional internal and external funding, are continuing to develop new applications for their device, and plan to conduct more pilot tests on the technology in the coming months.","Published: September 9, 2016"

Antibiotic resistant bacteria cause at least 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Antimicrobial Resistance Diagnostic Challenge will award $20 million in prizes over all phases of the competition for new, innovative and novel laboratory diagnostic tests. The diagnostic tests being sought are those that identify and characterize antibiotic resistant bacteria and those that distinguish between viral and bacterial infections to reduce unnecessary uses of antibiotics, a major cause of drug resistance. The prize is sponsored by two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services components, the National Institutes of Health and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in support of the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria.  The growing incidence of serious infections from antibiotic resistant bacteria presents a critical risk to the public health of our nation,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  My hope is that this competition will spur exceptional innovators to rise to the challenge and deliver effective tools to help manage this significant problem.  With real-time detection, healthcare providers would be able to identify infecting pathogens and resistance factors within hours, rather than the two to three days or longer that the standard microbiological culture processes require. Such knowledge would allow tailoring of treatments, minimizing the broad-spectrum antibiotic approach used by many clinicians today.  This effort even goes beyond public health,  said Nicole Lurie, M.D., M.S.P.H., assistant secretary for preparedness and response.  Combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a priority issue for economic and national security.  Concepts must be submitted by Jan. 9, 2017, for the first phase of the competition. Up to 20 semi-finalists will be selected from the applicant pool, each receiving up to $50,000. In the second phase of the competition, on Dec. 3, 2018, up to 10 finalists will be selected to each receive up to $100,000.

But, according to the most inclusive genetic analysis of giraffe relationships to date, giraffe actually are not one species, but four. For comparison, the genetic differences among giraffe species are at least as great as those between polar and brown bears. The unexpected findings reported in Current Biology highlights the urgent need for further and in-depth study of the four genetically isolated species and for greater conservation efforts for the world s tallest mammal, the researchers say.  We were extremely surprised, because the morphological and coat pattern differences between giraffe are limited,  says Dr. Axel Janke, a geneticist at the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre and Goethe University in Germany.  Giraffe are also assumed to have similar ecological requirements across their range , he added,  but no one really knows, because this megafauna has been largely overlooked by science.  Giraffe are in dramatic decline across their range in Africa. Their numbers have dropped substantially over the last three decades, from more than 150,000 individuals to fewer than 100,000. Despite that, the researchers say that there has been relatively little research done on giraffe in comparison to other large animals, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, gorillas, and lions. About five years ago, Dr. Julian Fennessy of Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF) based in Namibia approached Dr. Janke to assist with genetic testing of the giraffe. Dr. Fennessy wanted to know how similar (or not) giraffe living in different parts of Africa were to each other, whether past translocations of giraffe individuals had inadvertently  mixed  different species or subspecies, and, if so, what should be done in future translocations of giraffes into parks or other protected areas. In the new study, the collaborative research team examined the DNA evidence taken from skin biopsies of 190 giraffe collected by Dr. Fennessy and partners all across Africa, including regions of civil unrest. The extensive sampling includes populations from all nine previously recognised giraffe subspecies. The genetic analysis shows that there are four highly distinct groups of giraffe, which apparently do not mate with each other in the wild. As a result, they say, giraffe should be recognised as four distinct species. Those four species are:    Northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis)   Subspecies: Kordofan (G. c. antiquorum), West African giraffe (G. c. peralta), and the Nubian (G. c. camelopardalis), which is confirmed to be identical to Rothschild s giraffe.   Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa)   Subspecies: Angolan (G. g. angolensis) and South African giraffe (G. g. giraffa)   Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata)   Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), confirmed to be identical to Thornicroft s or Rhodesian giraffe The discovery has significant conservation implications, the researchers say, noting that the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group recently submitted an updated proposed assessment of the giraffe for the IUCN Red List (still under review by IUCN) taking into consideration their rapid decline over the last 30 years.  With now four distinct species, the conservation status of each of these can be better defined and in turn hopefully added to the IUCN Red List in time.  Dr. Fennessy says.  Working collaboratively with African governments, the continued support of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation and partners can highlight the importance of each of these dwindling species, and hopefully kick start targeted conservation efforts and internal donor support for their increased protection.  As an example,  he adds,  northern giraffe number less than 4,750 individuals in the wild, and reticulated giraffe number less than 8,700 individuals as distinct species, it makes them some of the most endangered large mammals in the world and require doubling of protection efforts to secure these populations. The conservation implications from this work are immense and our findings will hopefully help put giraffe conservation on the global map. It is important to note that in addition to this work GCF has monitored the decline of giraffe populations throughout Africa as well as the continued and increasing threats they face. Based on a combination of all these findings we are increasing our support on the conservation of targeted giraffe species and populations and need your support to make this a reality.  says Dr Fennessy.","Published: September 9, 2016"

The Phase 1b studies will evaluate the clinical response, safety and tolerability of the combination of these therapies, as well as multiple pharmacodynamic parameters, in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Under the agreement, Genentech will sponsor and conduct several Phase 1b trials in multiple solid cancer indications. In addition, BioLineRx will sponsor and conduct a Phase 1b study in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The studies are planned as open-label, multicenter, single-arm trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of BL-8040 and Atezolizumab. Upon completion of the studies, both parties will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a pivotal registration study. Additional details of the collaboration were not disclosed. BL-8040, BioLineRx s lead oncology platform, is a CXCR4 antagonist that has been shown in several clinical trials to be a robust mobilizer of immune cells and to be effective at inducing direct tumor cell death. Additional findings in the field of immuno-oncology suggest that CXCR4 antagonists may be effective in inducing the migration of anti-tumor T cells into the tumor micro-environment. Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1. Atezolizumab is designed to bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7-1 (CD80) receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Atezolizumab may enable the activation of T cells, whose migration into the tumor may be enhanced by BL-8040.

""Mapping perception to a future action seems simple,"" UCSB neuroscientist Michael Goard. ""We do it all the time when we see a traffic light and use that information to guide our later motor action. However, how these associations are mapped across time in the brain is not well understood."" See Also: What salamanders can teach us about baseballIn a new paper, published in the journal eLife, Goard and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology make progress in mapping brain activity in mice during simple but fundamental cognitive tasks. Although a mouse's brain is much smaller than a human's, remarkable structural similarities exist. The mouse brain is composed of about 75 million nerve cells or neurons, which are wired together in complex networks that unerlie sophisticated behaviors. The researchers used large-scale calcium imaging to measure the responses of individual neurons in multiple areas of the brain while mice performed a delayed response task. First, they trained mice to respond to visual stimuli drifting bars by either licking or withholding licking, depending on whether the bars moved vertically or horizontally. While the mice performed the task, the investigators recorded neural activity from multiple brain regions thought to be involved including visual, parietal and frontal motor cortices. Using a powerful laser-scanning microscope, the team was able to detect the signals from calcium indicators expressed in the neurons well below the brain's surface. Neurons normally have very low concentrations of intracellular calcium, but when they become active, calcium levels rise, increasing the fluorescence of the indicator and enabling measurement of neuron activity. In this way, the scientists were able to see which neurons were active while the mice performed the delayed response task. ""As expected, we found many neurons that responded only during the visual stimulus or the licking action, but we also found a lot of neurons that responded during other parts of the task,"" said Goard, an assistant professor in UCSB's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences and Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. ""In the frontal motor cortex, we found quite a few neurons that were active during the delay period between the visual stimulus and motor response. This led us to several new interpretations of the role that different brain regions were playing during performance of the task."" Learn More: A sixth sense protects drivers except when textingBased on the neural activity in the different brain areas, Goard and his team then used optogenetics a method of manipulating the nerve cells with light to inactivate neurons in a temporally precise manner to identify those that function during different parts of the task. This allowed them to figure out which areas were necessary for performing the task. For example, the team determined that the visual and parietal areas are involved in perceiving the stimulus and transforming that into a motor plan, but only the frontal motor cortex is necessary for maintaining the motor plan over the delay period. ""Using this general approach, we hope to map the essential regions for different types of cognitive tasks,"" Goard explained.

The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, paves the way for understanding cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular and cellular levels. See Also: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning The study focuses on the dynamics of dendritic spines, the thorny structures that allow neurons to communicate with each other. When a spine receives a signal from another neuron, it responds by rapidly expanding in volume an event called transient spine expansion. Transient spine expansion is one of the early events leading up to learning and memory formation. It consists of a cascade of molecular processes spanning four to five minutes, beginning when a neuron sends a signal to another neuron. Many of the molecular processes leading up to transient spine expansion have already been identified experimentally and reported in the literature. Here, the authors built a map of many of these known processes into a computational framework. ""Spines are dynamic structures, changing in size, shape and number during development and aging. Spine dynamics have been implicated in memory, learning and various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and autism. Understanding how the different molecules can affect spine dynamics can eventually help us demystify some of these processes in the brain,"" said Padmini Rangamani, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of California San Diego and first author of the study. ""This work shows that dendritic spines, which are sub-micrometer compartments within individual neurons, are the prime candidates for the initial tag of transient, millisecond synaptic activity that eventually orchestrates memory traces in the brain lasting tens of years,"" said Shahid Khan, senior scientist at the Molecular Biology Consortium at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a co-author on the paper. In this study, researchers constructed a mathematical model, based on ordinary differential equations, linking the different molecular processes associated with spine expansion together. They identified the key components (molecules and enzymes) and chemical reactions that regulate spine expansion. As a result, they observed an interesting pattern that the same components could both turn on and off some of the steps in the sequence a phenomenon called paradoxical signaling. Further, they linked the chemical reactions of the different molecules to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which gives the cell its shape. Both of these features paradoxical signaling and linking spine expansion to actin reorganization make this model robust, Rangamani explained. ""By putting all these complicated pieces together in a simple mathematical framework, we can start to understand the underlying mechanisms of spine expansion. This is one of the benefits of combining mechanics of the cytoskeleton and biochemistry. We can bring together pieces of experimental work that are often not seen. However, we should note that we are only at the beginning stages of understanding what spines, neurons and the brain can do.""

But sometimes, the loosely connected plates of a baby's skull fuse too early, a disorder known as craniosynostosis. Variants of this disorder can produce facial and skull deformities, and put potentially damaging constraints on a young brain. See Also: Researchers observe brain development in uteroA research team led by Rockefeller University President Richard P. Lifton, then at Yale University, has identified mutations responsible for a type of craniosynostosis that affects the suture running along the top of the skull. The results appear in eLife. ""While this discovery will immediately help us diagnose and counsel patients, it also has much broader relevance for understanding the genetics of complex traits, including many human diseases,"" says Lifton, who is head of Rockefeller's Laboratory of Human Genetics and Genomics and was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator prior to moving to Rockefeller. He and his team at Yale, including John Persing and colleagues in the Section of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that rare mutations in one gene collaborate with common variants near a second to cause midline craniosynostosis. As such, this disorder is a unique example of how an interaction between genes can contribute to disease. Midline craniosynostosis occurs when the suture in front of or behind the soft spot atop a baby's skull closes early, producing a ridge or other distortions and, in some cases, neurological problems. First author Andrew Timberlake, an MD-PhD student in Lifton's lab at Yale, used social media to recruit many of the 191 families who participated in this study. Read Next: Brain power: Gene critical for human brain development identified By plotting out the inheritance of the disorder through the families, the team noticed that it showed up unpredictably within them. Clearly, they thought, something more than simple dominant or recessive inheritance was at play. When they sequenced the participants' protein-coding genes, or exomes, mutations in one gene, SMAD6, caught their attention. This made sense; SMAD6 is a protein that inhibits so-called BMP signaling, which promotes bone formation. But not everyone carrying these rare SMAD6 mutations had midline craniosynostosis. In fact, none of the parents who shared the SMAD6 mutation with their affected children had a history of craniosynostosis--a finding that initially surprised researchers. The team then looked to find mutations that might affect the same bone formation pathway. Some previous work implicated common changes near one such gene, BMP2, so they looked for these variations among the families. ""It was amazing to then find that the affected children had inherited both the SMAD6 mutation and the common BMP2 variant. In each case, the SMAD6 mutation came from one parent and the BMP2 risk variant came from the other parent, explaining why neither parent had craniosynostosis,"" Timberlake says. The researchers believe that the risk variants near BMP2 increase the levels of the bone-promoting BMP signaling, thereby amplifying the effect of the loss of SMAD6's ability to inhibit the process. The result: The gap between the skull bones fuses ahead of schedule. Learn More: Cracking the code of brain development Among the families studied, those who carried the rare, damaging SMAD6 mutation plus a common BMP2 risk variant always had midline craniosynostosis, while those with only a SMAD6 mutation, but no BMP2 risk allele, were much less likely to suffer from the disorder. This knowledge should help doctors and genetic counselors better assess the risk within families. The researchers suggest that a similar dynamic may be at play in other rare genetic disorders that don't appear to follow classical Mendelian inheritance patterns. ""Our results offer a clear demonstration of the interaction between rare and common variants,"" Lifton says, ""offering one explanation to a lingering question in genetics: Why do some individuals with potent rare mutations develop disease, while others with the same mutations do not?""

Patients who have higher levels of several nuclear transport genes   particularly the protein XPO1   are more likely to be resistant to tamoxifen, resulting in the development of incurable metastatic cancer, according to a new study led by researcher Zeynep Madak-Erdogan at the University of Illinois.   However, combining tamoxifen with the drug selinexor, which inhibits the activity of XPO1, enhances patients  sensitivity to tamoxifen and prevents breast tumors from recurring, the researchers reported in a paper published online by the journal Molecular Endocrinology. The researchers also identified a  signature  of 13 nuclear transport genes, including XPO1, which provides clinicians with a biomarker to predict which patients are likely to be endocrine resistant and choose alternative treatments that may achieve better outcomes for these patients, said Madak-Erdogan, a professor of food science and human nutrition. Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer accounts for about 70 percent of all clinical cases of breast cancer. In these forms of the disease, the nuclei in patients  breast cells overproduce a protein that binds with and grows in response to estrogen. Tamoxifen, an endocrine therapy that has been widely used since the 1970s, blocks this binding process, constraining the growth and dissemination of the cancer cells. However, up to one-third of patients with hormone-responsive breast cancer don t respond efficiently or eventually stop responding to tamoxifen, conditions known as endocrine resistance. While tamoxifen is still very effective compared with other endocrine-targeting agents, determining which patients will respond effectively to the drug has perplexed physicians and researchers for some time, Madak-Erdogan said. The current study built upon prior research at Illinois that identified the hormone ERa as the agent that activates and regulates the kinase ERK5, a protein that relays signals from outside cells to their nuclei, triggering either increased cell proliferation or metastasis. Madak-Erdogan was a co-author on that study, which was led by Swanlund Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Benita S. Katzenellenbogen and co-written by then-undergraduate students Rosa Ventrella and Luke Petry. Based upon those findings, Madak-Erdogan and her co-authors on the current study hypothesized that nuclear transport genes, particularly XPO1, might be involved in exporting ERK5 from cells  nuclei, promoting invasive, aggressive tumors. The scientists conducted a multiphase, mixed-methods study, which included meta-analyses of genetic data on breast tumors, monitoring gene expression in laboratory cultures of human breast cancer cells and experiments using mice that developed estrogen receptor-positive breast cell tumors. In analyzing data on genes that were differentially expressed in ERa-positive and ERa-negative tumors, the researchers ultimately identified 13 genes that were over-expressed in the most aggressive, difficult-to-treat types of breast tumors.  When we looked into the gene signature further, we found that if a patient had higher expression of XPO1, their survival time was less, they had metastases earlier on and endocrine-resistant tumor cells proliferated more rapidly when treated with tamoxifen,  Madak-Erdogan said. In the laboratory, the researchers mimicked endocrine resistance by growing tamoxifen-responsive breast cancer cells from 33 patients in a tamoxifen solution for 100 weeks. When they examined the activity of ERK5 at three intervals, they found that transportation of ERK5 to cells  nuclei increasingly diminished as endocrine resistance progressed. Hypothesizing that a combination treatment might help restore endocrine sensitivity, the researchers treated tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells in mice with both increasing doses of the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor and tamoxifen.  When we treated those tamoxifen-resistant tumors with the inhibitor for XPO1 in combination with tamoxifen, we were able to completely block tumor progression,  Madak-Erdogan said.  Even weeks after the treatment was done, we didn t see any tumor recurrence.   If we use this combination   targeting the estrogen receptors with tamoxifen, and XPO1 with the inhibitor selinexor   we can delay the development of endocrine resistance, effectively killing the tumor cells and at the same time reducing the dose of tamoxifen that s needed,  said Madak-Erdogan, who also holds an appointment in the Division of Nutritional Sciences. Selinexor, which is already in clinical trials for treating leukemia and therapy-resistant prostate cancer, is tolerated well, and patients experience very mild side effects that wear off as therapy continues, Madak-Erdogan said.","Published: September 8, 2016"

Photosynthesis is the pivotal biological reaction on the planet, providing the food we eat, the oxygen we breathe and removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Photosynthesis in plants and algae consists of two reactions, the light-reactions absorb light energy from the sun and use this to split water (H2O) into electrons, protons and oxygen and the dark-reactions which use the electrons and protons from the light reactions to  fix  CO2 from the atmosphere into simple sugars that are the basis of the food chain. Importantly, the light reactions have a much higher capacity than the dark reactions resulting in much of the absorbed light energy being wasted as heat rather than being used to  fix  CO2. Co-author Dr Adokiye Berepiki, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow from Ocean and Earth Sciences at the University of Southampton, said:  In our study, we used synthetic biology methods to engineer an additional enzyme in-between the light-reactions and before the dark-reactions. We have therefore  rewired  photosynthesis such that more absorbed light is used to power useful chemical reactions. This study therefore represents an innovation whereby a range of additional valuable chemical reactions can be powered by the sun in plants and algae.  In the study, published in ACS Synthetic Biology, the  wasted  electrons were rewired to degrade the widespread environmental pollutant atrazine (a herbicide used in agriculture). Atrazine was banned from the EU over 20 years ago but is still one of the most prevalent pesticides in groundwater. The photosynthetic algae designed by the researchers may be used in the efficient bioremediation of such polluted wastewater areas. Dr Berepiki said:  By taking a synthetic biology approach   combining science, technology and engineering to facilitate and accelerate the design, manufacture and modification of genetic materials in living organisms   we rewired electrons by introducing an enzyme from a brown rat into the photosynthetic machinery. This enzyme, which was encoded by a gene that was produced de novo using chemical synthesis rather than being taken from rat, was then able to serve as an electron sink that used photosynthetic electrons to power its activity.  Co-author Professor Tom Bibby, Professor of Biological Oceanography from Ocean and Earth Sciences at the University of Southampton, said:  There has been much recent research into the potential of using photosynthetic species as sources of sustainable biofuels. While promising, this potential is not yet economically feasible. The  added value  we have introduced into algal may therefore be a critical step toward the commercial realisation of using photosynthetic species to generate  biofuels  that may one day replace our current dependence on fossil fuels.

In collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer, researchers from Charit    Universit tsmedizin Berlin have been able to show that high blood selenium levels are associated with a decreased risk of developing liver cancer. In addition to other risk factors, the study also examines in how far selenium levels may influence the development of other types of cancer. Results from this study have been published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Selenium (Se) is found in foods like fish, shellfish, meat, milk and eggs; certain South American nuts, such as Brazil nuts, are also good sources of selenium. It is a trace element that occurs naturally in soil and plants, and enters the bodies of humans and animals via the food they ingest. European soil has a rather low selenium concentration, in comparison with other areas of the world, especially in comparison to North America. Deficiencies of varying degrees of severity are common among the general population, and are the reason why German livestock receive selenium supplements in their feed.  While in Europe, neither a selenium-rich diet nor adequate selenium supplementation is associated with adverse effects, selenium deficiency is identified as a risk factor for a range of diseases.  We have been able to show that selenium deficiency is a major risk factor for liver cancer,  says Prof. Dr. Lutz Schomburg of the Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, adding:  According to our data, the third of the population with lowest selenium status have a five- to ten-fold increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma   also known as liver cancer.  In this case-control study, the team of European researchers investigated a cohort of 477,000 participants, and selected individuals who had developed hepatocellular carcinoma during a 10-year follow up. Blood samples were also chosen from healthy participants and subsequently analyzed to determine their selenium status.  Our study does not show that selenium supplementation has a direct protective effect against liver cancer. However, it does confirm the importance of a balanced diet, of which selenium forms an integral part,  explains Prof. Schomburg. Previous studies had suggested a similar relationship between a person's selenium status and their risk of developing colon cancer, as well as their risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease.","Published: September 8, 2016"

The report was presented by the BRP to the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB), and it was subsequently considered and accepted by the NCAB with revisions that reflect the NCAB s discussion. An overview of the report was published today in the journal Science.  The bold but feasible cross-cutting initiatives in this report will improve outcomes for patients with cancer, prevent cancer and increase our understanding of cancer,  said Dr. Lowy.  NCI stands ready to accelerate cancer research in the critical areas identified by the Blue Ribbon Panel.  In January 2016, during his State of the Union address, President Obama announced the Cancer Moonshot  for the loved ones we ve all lost, for the families we can still save.  The NCI s scientific road map outlined by the BRP is one component of the Cancer Moonshot s broader effort focused on accelerating progress on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Under the Vice President s leadership, a full set of recommendations for leveraging federal investments, private sector efforts, patient initiatives and more under the mission will be announced later this fall.   The 10 transformative approaches poised for acceleration are:   Engage patients to contribute their comprehensive tumor profile data to expand knowledge about what therapies work, in whom, and in which types of cancer.   Establish a cancer immunotherapy clinical trials network devoted exclusively to discovering and evaluating immunotherapy approaches.   Identify therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance through studies that determine the mechanisms that lead cancer cells to become resistant to previously effective treatments.   Create a national ecosystem for sharing and analyzing cancer data so that researchers, clinicians and patients will be able to contribute data, which will facilitate efficient data analysis.   Improve our understanding of fusion oncoproteins in pediatric cancer and use new preclinical models to develop inhibitors that target them.   Accelerate the development of guidelines for routine monitoring and management of patient-reported symptoms to minimize debilitating side effects of cancer and its treatment.   Reduce cancer risk and cancer health disparities through approaches in development, testing and broad adoption of proven prevention strategies.   Predict response to standard treatments through retrospective analysis of patient specimens.   Create dynamic 3-D maps of human tumor evolution to document the genetic lesions and cellular interactions of each tumor as it evolves from a precancerous lesion to advanced cancer.   Develop new enabling cancer technologies to characterize tumors and test therapies.  Thanks to the coalescence of new scientific insights and technological innovations, cancer research is poised to make unprecedented advances,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  The approaches identified by the Blue Ribbon Panel offer exceptional promise in tipping the odds in favor of cancer patients.  In addition to the 10 scientific approaches, the road map has specific, special projects. These include a demonstration project to test for Lynch syndrome, a heritable genetic condition that increases risk of several types of cancer, to improve early detection and prevention; the establishment of a nationwide pediatric immunotherapy clinical trials network to enhance the speed with which new immunotherapies can be tested in children; exploring patient-derived organoids; and  microdosing  devices to test drug responses in living tumors. The Cancer Moonshot scientific road map creates a vision for the future of cancer research and treatment in which:   Patients contribute their data, obtain genomic profiling information about their tumor, learn about what treatments might work best given their tumor s genomic profile and find other relevant information, including clinical trials that may be appropriate.   Researchers can identify possible targets for the development of new treatments and preventive interventions, including immunotherapies, as well as learn more about how to avoid or counter drug resistance.   Doctors have access to information that better predicts treatment outcomes and helps control patients  symptoms and side effects. Dr. Lowy will share the report with the Cancer Moonshot Task Force.  NCI greatly appreciates Vice President Biden s leadership of and passion for the Cancer Moonshot. The Vice President has galvanized the community to move forward so we can greatly improve our ability to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer,  said Dr. Lowy.  The efforts of the BRP and working group members have been extraordinary, and I thank them for their time, energy and ideas.  I am confident that the cancer community will build on this effort and seize this unprecedented opportunity to accelerate progress. ","Published: September 8, 2016"

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/sickle-cell-gene-therapy-passes-test-209371,Sickle Cell Gene Therapy Passes Test Researchers found a precision engineered gene therapy virus reduced sickle induced red cell damage in mice with sickle cell disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A precision-engineered gene therapy virus, inserted into blood stem cells that are then transplanted, markedly reduced sickle-induced red-cell damage in mice with sickle cell disease, researchers from Dana-Farber/Boston Children s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center report in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The work sets the stage for bringing a decades-old discovery about sickle cell disease to the bedside. A clinical gene therapy trial, using a virus rendered harmless in the laboratory, is expected to launch in the coming year. Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, which causes the usually pliant cells to stiffen and assume a curved or  sickled  shape. These sickled cells live less long than those with healthy hemoglobin, leading to anemia. They also bind together, leading to a blockage of blood flow that can cause severe pain and organ damage throughout the body. The new gene therapy is the culmination of research going back to the 1980s, which found that sickle cell disease is milder in people whose red blood cells carry a fetal form of hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin normally tails off after birth, but in 2008, Dana-Farber/Boston Children s researchers Stuart Orkin, MD, and Vijay Sankaran, MD, PhD, showed that suppressing a gene called BCL11A   which acts as an  off  switch   could restart fetal hemoglobin production. In 2011, using this approach, they corrected sickle cell disease in mice, replacing much of the defective beta ( adult ) hemoglobin that causes sickling with healthy fetal hemoglobin. To turn this insight into a therapy, a team led by Dana-Farber/Boston Children s researchers David A. Williams, MD, Christian Brendel, PhD, and Swaroopa Guda, PhD,  faced a major problem: BCL11A, they discovered, has an important role in blood stem cells. When it is silenced in mice with the sickle cell mutation, blood stem cells cannot engraft long-term in the animals  bone marrow and eventually become depleted. This failure to engraft could render gene therapy ineffective and also cause serious problems with blood development in general. To circumvent this problem, the team performed some intricate engineering, creating a gene therapy virus that silences BCL11A selectively   only in precursors of red blood cells. Blood stem cells treated with this gene therapy, transplanted into the mice, engrafted successfully and reduced signs of sickle cell disease (hemolytic anemia and increased numbers of reticulocytes).   Moreover, in red blood cells from the mice and from four patients with sickle cell disease, fetal hemoglobin crowded out the sickling beta hemoglobin, making up at least 80 percent of the total hemoglobin in the cell. This exceeded the researchers  original goal of 50 percent fetal hemoglobin   likely more than enough to avoid clinical sickle cell disease.   The tendency for a red blood cell to sickle is proportional to how much non-sickling versus sickling hemoglobin it has,  explains Williams, the study s senior author and president of Dana-Farber/Boston Children s.  BCL11A represses fetal hemoglobin, which does not lead to sickling, and also activates beta hemoglobin, which is affected by the sickle-cell mutation. So when you knock BCL11A down, you simultaneously increase fetal hemoglobin and repress sickling hemoglobin, which is why we think this is the best approach to gene therapy in sickle cell disease.  Precision engineering Selectively knocking down BCL11A involved several layers of engineering. As the core of their gene therapy vector, the researchers used a snippet of genetic code called a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that inactivates the BCL11A gene. To get it into cells, they embedded the shRNA in another bit of code, a microRNA, that cells generally recognize and process. To make this assembly work in the right place at the right time, they hooked it to a promoter of beta hemoglobin expression, together with regulatory elements active only in precursors of red blood cells. Finally, they inserted the whole package into a lentivirus engineered for safe use in humans.  Blood stem cells from mice and the sickle-cell patients were then exposed to the manipulated virus, taking up the new genetic material. The genetically engineered red-blood-cell precursors began producing fetal hemoglobin rather than the mutated beta hemoglobin, just as intended. A double benefit Other gene therapy trials for sickle cell disease are underway or are being developed. Rather than interfering with BCL11A, these approaches are introducing genes that encode fetal hemoglobin itself or a corrected beta hemoglobin that doesn t sickle. Williams believes the BCL11A-based approach to gene therapy for sickle cell disease will substantially increase the ratio of non-sickling versus sickling hemoglobin. He notes that this approach may also be beneficial in beta-thalassemia, another blood disorder involving defective beta hemoglobin. Williams has launched multiple other gene therapy trials at Dana-Farber/Boston Children s, which has become a world-leading hub of gene therapy for pediatric genetic diseases. His team is now taking the final steps toward FDA clearance for a clinical gene therapy trial in sickle cell disease that is expected to begin in early 2017.","Published: September 8, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cell-repulsion-engulf-to-escape-190091,Cell Repulsion  Engulf to Escape Researchers discover a signalling pathway that enables cells to reach their destinations through repulsion  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.When cells grow and divide, they come into contact with other cells. This happens not only during development and regeneration and after injury, but also during cancer growth and the formation of metastases. When cells come into contact with each other in this way, information is exchanged by proteins, which are embedded in the cell membranes and form tight lock-and-key complexes with each other. These connections must be severed if the cells want to transmit a repulsion signal. It appears that the fastest way to do this is for the cells to engulf the protein complex from the membrane of the neighbouring cell. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried have now identified the molecules that control this process. Development is an extremely rapid process. Increasing numbers of cells are formed which must find their correct position in the body, clearly demarcate themselves from each other to form tissue, or   as is the case in the nervous system   establish contact with partner cells in remote locations.  The crowding is accompanied by orderly pushing and shoving,  says R diger Klein, whose Department at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology studies how cells get their bearings.  A popular way for one cell to show another which direction to take is for it to repel the other cell following brief contact.  According to the scientists  observations, the cells do not exactly treat each other with kid gloves and even go so far as to engulf entire pieces from the membranes of other cells. When cells come into contact with each other, ephrin and Eph receptors are often involved. These proteins are located on the surface of almost all cells. When two cells meet, their ephrin and Eph receptors connect to form tight ephrin/Eph complexes. These complexes then trigger the repulsion process through intracellular signalling pathways.  This is where the problem arises, as it appears that the cells then want to separate as quickly as possible   however, the two cells are attached to each other through the tight ephrin/Eph complex,  explains Klein. So the cells do something else: they extend their own cell membranes so far over the individual complexes that the complex and the surrounding membrane detaches from the neighbouring cell and is fully incorporated into the cell. The Max Planck researchers discovered as early as 2003 that cells can use this process, known as endocytosis, to separate from each other. Thanks to progress made in molecular biology since then, they have now managed to show how the process is controlled in detail. With the help of a series of genetic modifications and the targeted deactivation of individual cell components, the scientists succeeded in demonstrating that Tiam signalling proteins are activated through the formation of the ephrin/Eph complex. As a result, Rac enzymes become active which, in turn, cause the engulfment of the ephrin/Eph complexes by the cell membrane through the local restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton. If one of these components is missing, this engulfing process through endocytosis is blocked and the cells do not repel each other but remain attached. The clarification of this signalling pathway is important, as it provides a better understanding of the development of neuronal networks and other organ systems. The findings are also of considerable interest for cancer research: thanks to their ability to control cell repulsion, ephrin and Eph receptors play a major role in the penetration of tissue by cancer cells and in the formation of metastases. For this reason, receptors and their connection partners are the focus of current medical research. Better understanding of this signalling pathway, through which cell repulsion is controlled, could enable the development of new drugs to combat cancer.","Published: September 8, 2016"

This report researchers from the Swiss Nanoscience Institute, the University of Basel and the University Hospital Basel in first clinical tests with genetic mutations in patients with malignant melanoma. The journal Nano Letters has published the study. According to estimates by the American Skin Cancer Foundation, today more people develop skin cancer than breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer together. Although malignant melanoma accounts for only about 5 percent of skin cancers, these are the most serious cases and can result in death. Around half of all patients who develop malignant melanoma exhibit a particular genetic change (mutation). This involves a change in the BRAF gene (B gene for Rapid Acceleration of Fibrosarcoma) that leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. There are now drugs that exploit these specific mutations and fight the cancer, significantly extending patients  life expectancy. However, they work only if the corresponding genetic mutation is actually present. Where it is not, they give rise to severe side effects without producing the desired effect.  It is therefore essential that we are able to identify the mutations reliably in tissue samples. That is the only way of ensuring that patients get the right treatment and successful outcomes,  explains the paper s co-author, Professor Katharina Glatz of the Institute of Pathology at University Hospital Basel. Coated microcantilevers In a clinical pilot study, the team led by Professor Ernst Meyer and Professor Christoph Gerber at the Swiss Nanoscience Institute and the Department of Physics at Basel University used nanosensors for the first time to detect the mutations in tissue samples from patients with malignant melanoma. To do so, the researchers employed tiny cantilevers that were coated in different ways. Some of them carried a recognition sequence for the mutation the researchers were targeting. Then genetic material (RNA) from the patients  tissue samples was isolated and applied to the cantilevers. If the genetic change is present, the patient s RNA binds to the recognition sequence on the cantilever. The resulting surface stress leads to bending of the cantilever, which can be measured. If the mutation is absent from the RNA sample, this bending does not occur   in other words, only a specific binding produces a signal.

Data characterizing the mitotoxicity assay was presented Tuesday at EUROTOX 2016, the 52nd Congress of the European Societies of Toxicology. Mitochondrial toxicity is a major adverse mechanism of toxicity for many drugs assigned black box warnings. When cells encounter stress, such as exposure to toxic drugs, they utilize reserve respiration capacities, which are quantified in the assay as spare respiratory capacity (SRC). A decrease in SRC is one of the first detected consequences of mitochondrial impairment, and the assay compares dose-dependent changes in SRC and cellular viability to assess the likelihood a drug will impair mitochondrial function. The new service combines the organotypic liver functionality and 28-day in vitro lifespan of 3D InSight  Human Liver Microtissues with analysis of mitochondrial respiration using the Agilent XFe96 Analyzer. The long-term metabolic competence of 3D liver microtissues enables flexible drug exposures of up to 14 days, while the XFe96 Analyzer allows assessment of mitochondrial function through sensitive and precise measurement of cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) on a single microtissue level. Dr. Jens M. Kelm, InSphero Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder, says the service capitalizes on the in vivo-like biology of 3D human liver microtissues. Kelm says,  Mitochondrial SRC serves as the cell s energy safety net, a reserve that helps cells respond to stress. When grown in 3D, primary human liver cells have a 4-times greater SRC than when grown in 2D. Using 3D microtissues in the assay not only enables us to expose primary human liver cells to drugs for up to 14 days, but also to measure the drug s impact on mitochondria in a model that more accurately reflects the cellular response to stress in vivo. By comparing the cellular viability to the mitochondrial function after drug treatment, we can determine if mitochondrial impairment is more likely the primary mechanism of toxicity, or rather a secondary effect. A tutorial featuring the 3D InSight  Mitochondrial Toxicity Service is scheduled to appear in the September 15th issue of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News (GEN). It is the latest addition to InSphero s suite of 3D InSight  In Vitro Toxicology Services, utilized by the world s largest pharmaceutical and chemical companies to evaluate drug safety.","Published: September 8, 2016"

The ~1 Megadalton L-shaped protein complex is the largest protein assembly of the respiratory chain and now the largest asymmetric membrane protein assembly solved to date. Professor Leonid Sazanov and his British collaborators published the nearly complete atomic structure of the ovine (mammalian) mitochondrial complex I at 3.9   resolution, solved by cryo-electron microscopy aided by crosslinking/mass-spectrometry mapping in the scientific journal Nature.  The respiratory chain is responsible for most energy production in humans. Several large protein assemblies are embedded in the mitochondrial lipid membrane. The mitochondrial Complex I is the first and largest complex in this chain. Metabolites derived from food are processed by this enzyme complex in order to contribute to the electron transfer and proton translocation. So far, research groups were only able to reveal mostly poly-alanine models lacking necessary full atomic details due to the fact that huge and complex molecules are difficult to examine with current methods. Cryo-electron microscopy made huge advances in recent years due to the development of new direct electron detectors, allowing high-resolution studies. The resolution of the structure at an atomic level now allows the understanding of the intricate arrangements and interactions of all 45 subunits (14 conserved core and 31 mitochondria-specific supernumerary subunits) with implications for the coupling mechanism and its regulation. The insight into mechanism, assembly, maturation, and dysfunction of Complex I allows a detailed molecular analysis of disease-causing mutations and affected enzyme activity. Therefore the publication in Nature is expected to serve as reference source of information in medicine, bioenergetics and other research areas. ","Published: September 8, 2016"

It s a rare, sometimes deadly, immune disorder. Now new research may help those with advanced mastocytosis and possibly many more people, too.  This is the first drug that s shown to be effective in this very rare disease,  says Tracy George, MD, at the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center. George was part of the international team that recently published the results of its study on mastocytosis in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Mast cells are normal cells in the body that mediate the body s allergic and inflammatory responses,  says George.  But people with mast cell disease have too many mast cells and they re abnormal.  Too many abnormal mast cells can cause allergic reactions and inflammation. Different subtypes of the disease differ in the how serious these responses are. People with indolent mastocytosis may have mild symptoms and lead normal lives. Others with indolent mastocytosis may have flushing and diarrhea and other symptoms severely enough that they can t hold a job or do things that most people can do. People with other subtypes of the disease can have life-threatening reactions, such as anaphylactic shock and organ damage. And people with advanced mastocytosis   the most deadly subtype is called mast cell leukemia   live less than six months after their diagnosis. The Food and Drug Administration has approved only one drug, called imatinib, to treat advanced mastocytosis. Imatinib blocks the action of a cellular protein called a tyrosine kinase receptor. But people with a mutation in a gene called D816V KIT do not respond to imatinib. The D816V KIT gene codes for a tyrosine kinase receptor, says George. And, she says, most people with advanced mastocytosis have the D816V KIT mutation. Research on the new treatment began at Stanford University, where George worked with a colleague, Jason Gotlib, MD, whose patient had mast cell leukemia. They gave that woman a drug called midostaurin under the FDA s compassionate use policy.  Midostaurin is a multi-kinase inhibitor,  says George.  Midostaurin was being evaluated in a clinical trial for a different disease, acute myeloid leukemia. And this lady with mast cell leukemia remarkably improved within weeks, within days.  Gotlib and George began a small clinical trial to test midostaurin in people with advanced mastocystosis. That clinical trial expanded into an international clinical trial after Gotlib and George shared their preliminary results at an international conference. George brought the clinical trial to UNM when she joined the Pathology department and the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center. The clinical trial included treatment for three subtypes of advanced mastocytosis. Still, it took years to enroll enough people because the disease is so rare. Mastocytosis affects only about one person in 10,000. In comparison, breast cancer affects more than 12 times as many people and prostate cancer affects more than 13 times as many, according to the American Cancer Society. But even though the clinical trial was small, the results were astounding. People with advanced mastocytosis on the clinical trial lived an average of 28 months longer. This average includes the 40 percent of people who did not respond to midostaurin. The 60 percent who did respond, though, responded within two or three months of starting treatment. Responders had mild side effects like diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, if they had any at all. Sixteen people in the clinical trial had mast cell leukemia.  For those patients who did respond,  says George,  their median survival has not been reached. So that means [some are] still living, which is unbelievable.  The clinical trial has spurred more research. Scientists around the world are now studying how midostaurin affects mast cells and how to combine it with other drugs to create an even more potent treatment. Novartis, the maker of midostaurin, and other drug companies are investing in research on multi-kinase inhibitors. Clinical trials to test midostaurin for controlling symptoms in people with indolent mastocytosis have opened. And more research into using midostaurin to treat asthma, skin diseases and allergies is in the planning stages. George, who is the American expert in mastocytosis pathology, says,  I do think this [mastocytosis] is under-diagnosed. Even though patients with advanced mastocytosis are rare, indolent [mastocytosis] is more common. And there are lots of diseases for which unhappy mast cells are a pathogenesis.  Now, with the potential for a treatment, people with unhappy mast cells may feel better.","Published: September 8, 2016"

There is currently only one solution for patients: avoid allergy-triggering products. Fraunhofer researchers are making an important contribution to consumer protection by developing methods to specifically and reliably detect allergenic substances in foods. In addition, they are helping to establish processes that reduce the allergy-triggering properties of food ingredients. Their research work focuses on soy. Eating is not a pleasurable experience for everyone. After a meal, many people suffer from abdominal pain, itchiness or diarrhea. These complaints are often caused by a food allergy. Particularly peanuts, fish, milk, cereals containing gluten, eggs, celery, crustaceans, edible nuts, mustard, sesame seeds and soy proteins trigger the undesired reactions. Those affected have no other choice but to avoid food with  their  allergen. However, this is no easy task   even the smallest quantities of allergens can get into food unintentionally, for instance when different products are processed in one machine. Since these traces are not an ingredient, they are not always listed on the packaging. The hidden allergens in foods pose a health risk for people with food allergies. In the LowAllergen project, several Fraunhofer institutes are joining forces to improve the situation of those with food allergies. The four institutes   The Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI, for Process Engineering and Packaging IVV, for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME and for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine ITEM   are working together on the development of innovative food allergy analyses, the reliable evaluation of allergens, the reduction of the allergenic potential of foodstuffs and detection methods that exactly determine this. The aim is to identify allergenic proteins and establish technologies to remove these during food production or treat them so that they no longer cause allergies. They are cooperating with Leipzig University Hospital for this purpose. Hardly any non-allergenic foodstuffs on the shelves  To date there are no food products, except for baby food, that are hypoallergenic and contain few allergens. The production of such products is very complex. One reason for this is that although the allergenic components of food ingredients can generally be detected, to date, it is not possible to determine their specific allergenicity,  says Dr. Michael Szardenings, group manager at IZI. Yet, taking soy as an example, the researcher and his team have now succeeded in doing exactly this.  The human body can develop antibodies against all kinds of foreign substances. According to our findings, in the case of soy, this occurs in more places in the allergenic proteins than expected.  Now the scientists have established a method that can be used to identify the allergenic components/regions of proteins recognized by the patient s antibodies   experts call these epitopes   directly in the antibodies in the blood serum.  Antibodies activated in a person with an allergy are directed against specific molecular sections of the allergens. Patients react to these molecular sections, known as epitopes. We were able to identify 374 allergy-relevant epitopes,  said the subproject manager. To this end, the researchers analyzed 50 blood sera of patients with a soy allergy. During the process, they used a peptide phage display refined at the institute, a method which, among other things, is used for studying proteins and for clarifying antibody interactions. Soy proteins that trigger fewer allergies In addition, colleagues at Fraunhofer IVV in Freising showed that soy proteins can be modified so that they are less allergenic. Soy protein isolates were produced and modified using a wide variety of methods. Various heating methods were applied, such as treatment with plasma, pulsed UV light, gamma radiation and high pressure as well as chemical, enzymatic and fermentative processes. Scientists were able to extract soy protein ingredients with especially low immune reactivity, particularly via the combination of enzymatic hydrolysis and a microbial fermentation.  Enzymatic hydrolysis aims to reduce the epitopes, the allergenic components of the proteins. Special epitopes, known as conformational epitopes, can also be eliminated through the folding and unfolding of the protein structure or the amino acid sequence of the proteins is destroyed,  explains Dr. Peter Eisner, a scientist at Fraunhofer IVV and project coordinator. The soy proteins produced in this manner also have improved sensory properties, including better taste.  We have already filed a patent application for the production of hypoallergenic protein preparations,  says Eisner. New allergy test   a drop of blood suffices Through the FoodAllergen project, the scientists want to build on their research results and apply established methods to other food allergies. To continue improving patient diagnostics, Fraunhofer researchers at IVV, IZI and IME are planning to examine the sera of allergy sufferers on a large scale in cooperation with Leipzig University Hospital. One aim is a biobank with more than 500 sera of those affected.  We are working on a test that will enable a broad range of food allergies to be detected with just one drop of the patient s blood,  according to Szardenings. This would also allow for better detection of cross reactions that typically occur in the skin test  known as the prick test   used in medical practices and that cannot be separated. For example, if someone is allergic to birch pollen, his or her antibodies often react to soy proteins. This means the prick test finding would be positive although the person concerned is not actually allergic to soy.  With our test, one can precisely determine whether there is a risk of a soy allergy. It could even be evaluated immediately at the medical practice,  says Szardenings. Another idea from the researchers is to combine the evaluation with an app in the future.  A person takes a photo of the test with his smartphone. He receives the result shortly after via the app, which is connected with the evaluation software. ","Published: September 8, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/guided-needles-hit-the-mark-196611,Guided Needles Hit the Mark New sensor could help anesthesiologists place needles for epidurals and other medical procedures   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. More than 13 million pain-blocking epidural procedures are performed every year in the United States. Although epidurals are generally regarded as safe, there are complications in up to 10 percent of cases, in which the needles are inserted too far or placed in the wrong tissue. A team of researchers from MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital hopes to improve those numbers with a new sensor that can be embedded into an epidural needle, helping anesthesia doctors guide the needle to the correct location. Currently, anesthesiologists must guide a four- to six-inch needle through multiple layers of tissue to reach the epidural space surrounding the spinal cord. They know when the needle has reached the right spot based on how the tissue s resistance changes. However, some patients  tissues vary from the usual pattern, which can make it more difficult to determine whether the needle is in the right place.  The needle is placed essentially blindly,  says T. Anthony Anderson, an anesthesiologist at MGH and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.  The needle can go too far or into the wrong tissue, which means the patient doesn t get the positive effect that you want or is injured.  In most cases, these complications lead to reduced effectiveness of the pain-killing drug, or an excruciating post-procedure headache. In rare cases in which the needle goes too far or into a blood vessel, a stroke or spinal cord injury can occur. Distinguishing tissues To improve the accuracy of epidural needle placement, Anderson teamed up with researchers at MIT s Laser Biomedical Research Center, headed by Peter So, a professor of mechanical engineering and biological engineering. So and MIT research scientist Jeon Woong Kang designed and tested several types of optical sensors that could be placed at the tip of an epidural needle and determined that the best is one that relies on Raman spectroscopy. This technique, which uses light to measure energy shifts in molecular vibrations, offers detailed information about the chemical composition of tissue. In this case, the researchers measured the concentrations of albumin, actin, collagen, triolein, and phosphatidylcholine to accurately identify different tissue layers. This sensor, which the researchers described in the journal Anesthesiology, provides immediate feedback telling the anesthesiologist which tissue the needle is in. As an epidural needle is inserted, it passes through five layers   skin, fat, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and ligamentum flavum   before reaching the epidural space, which is the target. Beyond that space lies the dura mater, a stiff membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid.  The sensor is continuously measuring Raman spectroscopy signals, which tells you the chemical composition of the tissue. From the chemical composition you can identify all tissue layers, from skin to spinal cord,  Kang says. The team found that Raman spectroscopy could distinguish each of the eight tissue layers around the epidural space with 100 percent accuracy. Two other techniques that they tested, fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy, could distinguish some layers but not all eight.  Blind procedures  The researchers have tested the sensor in pig tissue and now plan to do further animal studies before testing it in human patients. They also plan to reduce the diameter of the sensor slightly, from 2 millimeters, which is too large to fit in the most commonly used epidural needles, to 0.5 mm. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish, chief of anesthesia and critical care at MGH, says this type of sensor could greatly improve safety for epidurals, as well as other procedures involving needles.  The era of blind procedures is one we need to move away from, because we re very interested in improving safety and quality,  says Wiener-Kronish, who was not involved in the research.  This sensor could allow us to take a fairly blind procedure and be able to get more information about where the needle is.  The researchers have started a company, Medisight Corp., to continue developing the technology, which they believe could also be applied to medical procedures, such as cancer biopsies or injecting drugs into the joints, which can be difficult to do accurately. This commercialization effort is supported by MIT entrepreneurship programs, including the MIT Translational Fellows Program, MIT Venture Mentoring Service, and MIT Innovation Initiative. The team also received support from the National Science Foundation in the form of a Small Business Technology Transfer program grant.","Published: September 8, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/identifying-people-using-human-hair-proteins-197594,Identifying People Using Human Hair Proteins In an important breakthrough for the forensic science community  researchers have developed the first ever biological identification method that exploits the information encoded in proteins of human hair  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and a Utah startup company have developed the ground-breaking technique, providing a second science-based, statistically validated way to identify people and link individuals to evidence in addition to DNA profiling. The new protein identification technique will offer another tool to law enforcement authorities for crime scene investigations and to archaeologists, as the method has been able to detect protein in human hair more than 250 years old. Aim to identify people using only one hair Once the method is optimized, the researchers believe they could use protein markers from a small number of human hairs, possibly as little as one, to distinguish an individual among the world s population.  We are in a very similar place with protein-based identification to where DNA profiling was during the early days of its development,  said LLNL chemist Brad Hart, the director of the Lab s Forensic Science Center and co-author of a paper detailing the work.  This method will be a game-changer for forensics, and while we ve made a lot of progress toward proving it, there are steps to go before this new technique will be able to reach its full potential.  The work of LLNL scientists, a researcher with Utah-based Protein-Based Identification Technologies, LLC and other collaborators is described in a paper published today in PLOS ONE, a San Francisco-based peer reviewed online scientific journal. The team s collaborators and advisers include researchers from seven universities   Utah Valley University, the University of Utah, Montana State University, the University of California, Davis, the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom, George Mason University and the University of Washington. In the PLOS ONE study, the researchers examined male and female hair samples for 66 European-Americans, 5 African Americans, 5 Kenyans and six skeletal remains from the 1750s and 1850s, finding a total of 185 protein markers so far. Each person s number of hair protein markers, combined with their pattern of protein markers, is unique. The researchers believe that the number of individual protein markers that can be used to differentiate people could go as high as 1,000 markers. Protein markers also can be found in other tissue types, such as shed skin cells, bones and teeth, and the scientists have started studying how people can be identified using the latter two tissues. Using their current sample sizes, the researchers are able to find enough markers to provide a unique pattern for an individual that would distinguish that person among a population of one million people. The new method, in effect, addresses a 2009 National Research Council report on forensic science that detailed the weaknesses of many current approaches and reported an urgent need for new science-based forensic methods.  Nuclear DNA is the gold standard for human identification, but it is quite fragile,  Hart said.  When the DNA molecule degrades from light, heat exposure, or other environmental conditions, it becomes useless for identification.  Proteins more robust than DNA Proteins are chemically more robust than nuclear DNA. That point was illustrated by the team s work as the researchers found protein markers in human hair from six skeletal remains taken from cemeteries in the greater London area dating back about 150 and 250 years ago. Proteins are long molecular chains formed from amino acids   the basic building blocks of life. DNA is the pattern or template the body uses to produce proteins. In the research, the protein markers used by the scientists have been variants in the proteins resulting from amino acid substitutions that stem from DNA mutations, and are known as single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs). The team s research kicked into high gear in March 2013 when biochemist Glendon Parker, the inventor of the protein identification concept and then an associate professor at Utah Valley University, came to work at LLNL. Parker is the lead author of the PLOS ONE paper.  Glendon s clever invention was to realize that the uniqueness of SAPs could be used to identify individual people, and the robustness of the technique relies on its link back to DNA,  said Deon Anex, an LLNL chemist and co-author. Although people do not inherit proteins, they do inherit the DNA that produces their proteins.  As a result, there is a link between the protein markers that we find and a person s DNA. There are two reasons why this is particularly important: the DNA is unique to each individual and it is inherited from a person s parents,  Anex said. Currently, the sample preparation, instrument run time and analysis period for the protein identification method requires about 2   days, Anex said, noting the team expects the cost to be competitive with other similar technologies.  The discovery phase has been quite complex, but once the technique is established, we believe it can be made into a routine procedure for use in crime labs.  The researchers are seeking to establish a set of 90-100 protein markers that would be sufficient to distinguish an individual among the world s population using a single hair. Current research funding comes from the Department of Defense and LLNL s Laboratory Directed Research & Development program, which supports high-risk, potentially high-payoff projects at the forefront of science and technology. In addition to Hart, Parker and Anex, other LLNL researchers who have worked on the project are biochemist and postdoc Katelyn Mason, bioinformaticist Marisa Torres and biologists Bonnee Rubinfeld and Cheryl Strout.","Published: September 8, 2016"

The ctDx platform was designed to be a distributable kit in order to move the technology as close to the patient as possible. Shipping specimens to a central lab adds unnecessary time to return actionable results to clinicians and patients, not to mention the potential for sample loss. A fast turnaround time, measured in days, not weeks, is one of the major benefits of the technology. The Frederick National Laboratory, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, is the first group that Resolution Bio is enabling with its ctDx liquid biopsy platform. The company is in discussions to enable select CROs, reference labs, and research institutions worldwide to access this technology.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hacking-microbes-196685,Hacking Microbes Startup s engineered yeast helps clients produce fragrances and flavors more efficiently  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Biology is the world s greatest manufacturing platform, according to MIT spinout Ginkgo Bioworks. The synthetic-biology startup is re-engineering yeast to act as tiny organic  factories  that produce chemicals for the flavor, fragrance, and food industries, with aims of making products more quickly, cheaply, and efficiently than traditional methods.  We see biology as a transformative technology,  says Ginkgo co-founder Reshma Shetty PhD  08, who co-invented the technology at MIT.  It is the most powerful and sophisticated manufacturing platform on the planet, able to self-assemble incredible structures at a scale that is far out of reach of the most cutting-edge human technology.  Similar to how beer is brewed   where yeast eats sugars and creates alcohol and flavors through fermentation   Ginkgo s  hacked  yeast eats fatty acids and produces desired chemicals that recreate certain scents and flavors during fermentation. Those chemicals can then be extracted and used in a number of different products. Co-founded in 2008 by famed MIT synthetic biologist Tom Knight  69, SM  79, PhD  83, Ginkgo s microbes now serve as the basis for perfumes, cosmetics, organic pesticides, and sweeteners for more than 20 big-name clients. A major partner, French fragrance manufacturer Robertet, for example, contracted Ginkgo to design yeast that produces a rose scent. Doing so is cheaper and less time-consuming than the traditional method of finding and squeezing oils from the flower s petals. The  cultured rose  is still under development, along with an expanded palette of other scents under contract, such as apricot, mango, and coconut. Ginkgo s most recent partnership, finalized in June, is a collaboration with California-based bioproduct firm Amyris. Both companies will combine forces to rapidly scale up the production of more than 20 ingredients for new products, such as skin care products, industrial lubricants, and jet fuel, over the next few years. In addition to Shetty and Knight, who is a former researcher in MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the other Ginkgo co-founders are Jason Kelly PhD  08, Barry Canton PhD  08, Austin Che PhD  08. Big facilities for tiny  factories  To engineer yeast on a grand scale, Ginkgo last year built an 18,000-square-foot foundry with automated robotics and equipment, called the Bioworks1, dedicated solely to rapid prototyping. Inside the foundry, Ginkgo engineers use software and a database of thousands of unique enzymes to design new biological instructions for yeast. To produce certain scents, for instance, the engineers choose a precise chain of enzymes that are inserted by a custom-built robot into a yeast cell, and a fatty acid for the yeast to eat. If the combination is right, the yeast will produce a target lactone, a type of compound that comes from plants and is used often to make perfumes. That compound can be extracted by a chromatography column, which purifies the chemical. Ginkgo then licenses the organisms to partners, who, in turn, use fermentation to manufacture and extract the chemicals for their own clients. Ginkgo s clients often use ingredients, such as rose petals, that are expensive, not always available, or have environmental sustainability issues. Shetty says Ginkgo helps make the client s  supply chain more stable, more efficient, and more sustainable.  Ginkgo s engineers are constantly designing different enzyme pathways and different genetic architectures, and amassing data on each sample. In that way, the foundry serves as a giant platform for designing yeast for a wide variety of applications.  We have always approached biological engineering and the foundry as generalists, not specializing in a particular organism or process, but building out automated tools that give our organism designers the broadest access to the power of biology,  Shetty says.  If we can learn how to design with biology well, then there is potential for tremendous impact across all technologies.  In the fall, Ginkgo plans to open a second foundry with upgraded technologies that s 25,000 square feet, called Bioworks2.  We re really excited by how the technology has evolved and excited for what s coming and what we ll be able to do with an expanded capacity from the addition of the new foundry,  Shetty says. Making synthetic biology easier The Ginkgo co-founders came together during the mid-2000s while doing their PhDs in synthetic biology, which  just a handful of people were talking about  at the time, Shetty says. All four were working under Knight, who is considered by many to be the  godfather of synthetic biology  for his pioneering work in the field starting in the late 1990s, and former MIT professor of biological engineering Drew Endy. By 2001, Knight had invented a better way to engineer microbes, with a standardized method to piece together DNA, called BioBricks. Up until then, scientists would manually use specialized enzymes to stitch together genes with specific functions and insert those genes inside bacteria. BioBricks, on the other hand, tagged segments of DNA on both sides with chemical connectors that allowed those pieces to be quickly and easily interchanged and combined, like building blocks. Today, the BioBricks database contains more than 20,000 DNA parts. Ginkgo doesn t use the BioBricks standard, but the idea of simplifying and scaling up synthetic biology became a catalyst for the startup.  All of us fell in love with the idea of being able to design biology,  Shetty says,  but knew that what was holding back progress was the lack of good tools and technologies with which to engineer organisms. So we started Ginkgo with the mission to make biology easier to engineer.  At first, the co-founders tried scraping together seed money to build new tools and facilities for synthetic biology, but investors weren t biting. They also entered ideas for new synthetic-biology tools into the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition but never made it past the first round. However, inspired by a fellow MIT alumnus who had started a company from scratch with friends,  We decided to just go for it,  Shetty says.  Everyone thought you needed a bunch of money to start a biotech company. We, instead, just bootstrapped Ginkgo from scratch.  In 2008, the four alumni and Knight   who had left his position at MIT   set up Ginkgo in Boston s Seaport District, where its headquarters remains today. Bootstrapping for several years, the startup built a series of automated tools for assembling DNA, transforming cells, and collecting data on microbes. In 2015, they built their massive foundry around those new advances   the culmination of nearly a decade of work.  [The foundry] has finally become a reality, and it s a bit surreal to actually see it in action,  Shetty said in a 2015 interview with the Huffington Post shortly after the foundry s launch. Soon, investors took notice. In 2015, Ginkgo scored a first funding round for $9 million from venture capitalists, and went on to raise an additional $45 million that year. This June, it raised another $100 million.

A new study in mice shows this link may be possible. Attention-grabbing experiences trigger the release of memory-enhancing chemicals. Those chemicals can etch memories into the brain that occur just before or soon after the experience, regardless of whether they were related to the event, according to researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center s Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. The findings, published in Nature, hold intriguing implications for methods of learning in classrooms as well as an array of potential uses in the workplace and personal life, researchers said. The trick to creating long-lasting memories is to find something interesting enough to activate the release of dopamine from the brain s locus coeruleus (LC) region.  Activation of the locus coeruleus increases our memory of events that happen at the time of activation and may also increase the recall of those memories at a later time,  said Dr. Robert Greene, the study s co-senior author and a Professor of Psychiatry and Neurosciences with the O Donnell Brain Institute. The study explains at the molecular level why people tend to remember certain events in their lives with particular clarity as well as unrelated details surrounding those events: for instance, what they were doing in the hours before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; or where they were when John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  The degree to which these memories are enhanced probably has to do with the degree of activation of the LC,  said Dr. Greene, holder of the Sherry Gold Knopf Crasilneck Distinguished Chair in Psychiatry, in Honor of Mollie and Murray Gold, and the Sherry Knopf Crasilneck Distinguished Chair in Psychiatry, in Honor of Albert Knopf.  When the New York World Trade Center came down on 9/11, that was high activation.  But life-changing events aren t the only way to trigger the release of dopamine in this part of the brain. It could be as simple as a student playing a new video game during a quick break while studying for a crucial exam, or a company executive playing tennis right after trying to memorize a big speech.  In general, anything that will grab your attention in a persistent kind of way can lead to activation,  Dr. Greene said. Scientists have known dopamine plays a large role in memory enhancement, though where the chemical originates and how it s triggered have been points of study over the years. Dr. Greene led a study published in 2012 that identified the locus coeruleus as a third key source for dopamine in the brain, besides the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra. That research demonstrated the drug amphetamine could pharmacologically trigger the brain s release of dopamine from the LC. The latest study builds upon those findings, establishing that dopamine in this area of the brain can be naturally activated through behavioral actions and that these actions enhance memory retention. The new study suggests that drugs targeting neurons in the locus coeruleus may affect learning and memory as well. The LC is located in the brain stem and has a range of functions that affect a person s emotions, anxiety levels, sleep patterns, memory and other aspects of behavior. The study tested 120 mice to establish a link between locus coeruleus neurons and neuronal circuits of the hippocampus   the region of the brain responsible for recording memories   that receive dopamine from the LC. One part of the research involved putting the mice in an arena to search for food hidden in sand that changed location each day. The study found that mice that were given a  novel experience    exploring an unfamiliar floor surface 30 minutes after being trained to remember the food location   did better in remembering where to find the food the next day. Researchers correlated this memory enhancement to a molecular process in the brain by injecting the mice with a genetically encoded light-sensitive activator called channelrhodopsin. This sensor allowed them to selectively activate dopamine-carrying neurons of the locus coeruleus that go to the hippocampus and to see first-hand which neurons were responsible for the memory enhancement. They found that selectively activating the channelrhodopsin-labeled neurons with blue light (a technique called optogenetics) could substitute for the novelty experience as a memory enhancer in mice. They also found that this activation could cause a direct, long-lasting synaptic strengthening   an enhancement of memory-relevant communication occurring at the junctions between neurons in the hippocampus. This process can mediate improvement of learning and memory. Some next steps include investigating how big an impact this finding can have on human learning, whether it can eventually lead to an understanding of how patients can develop failing memories, and how to better target effective therapies for these patients, said Dr. Greene. Dr. Greene and Dr. Richard G. Morris, Professor of Neuroscience at the Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems at the University of Edinburgh, were co-senior authors of this study. Other UTSW colleagues who carried out experiments are Alex Sonneborn in the UTSW neuroscience graduate program and Dr. Caroline Smith.

It can take six weeks for a person to respond to pharmacotherapy. And with remission rates at about only one-third, the majority of patients with depression could also benefit from better overall response to medication. See Also: Weekend catch-up sleep can reduce diabetes risk associated with sleep lossResearchers at the University of Michigan (U-M) who specialize in both psychiatry and sleep medicine found a potential way to help. A precise sleep schedule could affect antidepressant remission rates and response time, researchers found. But not in the way they thought. Previous studies, mostly in inpatient settings, found that total or partial (four- to five-hour) sleep deprivation on a single night improved mood the following day for about 60 percent of patients. This extreme amount of sleep deprivation is not, however, practical or safe for patients in their own homes. In the new U-M study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 68 adults were assigned to spend either six or eight hours in bed each night during their first two weeks on the antidepressant fluoxetine. It's the first study to assess the mood effects of a modest time-in-bed restriction on outpatients. Sleep and mood were measured daily for the first two weeks, and mood measurement continued weekly for six more weeks after the patients returned to their preferred sleep schedules and continued fluoxetine. ""It's important to find practical and safe strategies that can enhance our traditional depression therapies, so we decided to evaluate a more modest amount of sleep deprivation that could easily be implemented alongside medication treatment,"" says J. Todd Arnedt, PhD, principal investigator and U-M associate professor in psychiatry and neurology. Learn More: Common antidepressant may change brain differently in depressed and non-depressed people ""Although we predicted the group with restricted time in bed would have a better response, based on previous sleep deprivation research in depression, we actually found the opposite."" Surprisingly, the group who spent the full eight hours in bed each night showed greater improvements on all fronts. The subjects were almost twice as likely to achieve symptom remission after the full eight weeks of antidepressant treatment 63 percent compared with 33 percent in the six-hour group. They also experienced a faster response to treatment. ""This is the first study to demonstrate that adequate sleep might accelerate and augment antidepressant treatment response,"" Arnedt says, ""but more research is necessary."" Of the subjects who spent six hours in bed, one group was told to stay up two hours later and the other to wake up two hours earlier. The researchers wanted to assess whether changes in deep slow-wave sleep or REM (dream) sleep affected response or remission rates. Previous studies had produced contradictory findings about whether treatment response was related to changes in particular sleep stages. After two weeks on the six-hour schedule, overnight polysomnography verified that the subjects who woke up two hours earlier experienced a significant reduction in REM sleep while those who stayed up later experienced an increased amount of slow-wave sleep. But no differences in treatment response were found between the two six-hour groups. ""This research did not support the specific role of either slow-wave sleep or REM sleep as critical to treatment response,"" Arnedt says. Wearable technology allowed the researchers to know just how well their subjects were following their time-in-bed instructions. Read Next: Research shows hypnosis extends restorative slow-wave sleep The ActiGraph devices, similar to a Fitbit but able to detect sleep more accurately, use movement sensors to determine if patients spent their assigned hours in bed. The group tasked with eight hours in bed mostly adhered to the schedule. But the six-hour group had great difficulty. The early-rise-time group spent nearly an hour more time in bed than instructed. ""These findings tell us that, even if the six-hour condition had yielded better results in terms of treatment response, patients would be unlikely to follow a clinical recommendation to spend only six hours in bed during the initial two weeks of antidepressant therapy. So, this is a strategy that is not practical for implementation in outpatient settings,"" Arnedt says. Because this study was designed to primarily evaluate the effects of restricting time in bed on antidepressant treatment response, the next step, Arnedt says, is to directly assess whether optimizing or extending sleep time while initiating antidepressant therapy improves response. Optimization of the sleep schedule would involve considering not only how much people are sleeping but also individual factors such as a subject's preferred sleep and wake times and sleep quality. The team is also interested in more sophisticated measurement techniques, such as brain imaging and high density EEG, to further examine the impact of directly manipulating REM, slow-wave sleep and other aspects of sleep as well as factors implicated in treatment response. In the meantime, Arnedt recommends paying closer attention to how, and how much, patients are sleeping when they begin antidepressants. Patients beginning a new antidepressant should be cautioned against restricting their time in bed because it could influence how quickly and effectively they respond to the medication.

See Also: Study identifies two genes that boost risk for PTSD Professor Hanli Liu was the primary investigator on the project. Her team of graduate students and a research associate, Fenghua Tian, worked with co-investigators Alexa Smith-Osborne, a UTA social work associate professor; Francisco Gonzalez-Lima, a psychology professor at University of Texas (UT) Austin; and Fu Lye Martin Woon, a former assistant professor of psychiatry at UT Southwestern; to show potential intervention using light in brain disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder. Their research is funded in part by a UT System BRAIN or Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies seed grant. With the UT System's support, Liu's interdisciplinary collaborative team has not only investigated the brain imaging capability of light but also revealed the therapeutic rationale for potentially improving cognitive functions of patients with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The first paper resulting from the seed funding is now published. As in the first study, the team used a human forearm as a biological model instead of the human brain to avoid confounding factors due to such anatomical structures as the scalp and skull. The paper outlines their discovery that shining near-infrared light on the subject's forearm increases production of cytochrome-c-oxydase, a protein inside the neurons that stimulates blood flow. This discovery shows great potential that NIR or infrared light also will work within the brain. Related: Trauma experiences change the brain even in those without PTSD ""This is the first time that effects of light stimulation have been quantified on living human tissue,"" Liu said. ""The next challenge is to apply what was learned in a simpler system to the brain, where the light must pass through the scalp and the skull, as well as the brain. In the past several years, we have used the knowledge gained in the NIR field to detect, monitor and understand certain brain disorders, such as PTSD. But we have never utilized NIR light for treatment."" Now the team is moving to report and publish its findings of transcranial NIR stimulation on the human brain by quantifying production of cytochrome-c-oxydase and increase of blood flow. It would support a novel, non-invasive treatment with imaging ability, especially for memory, which could really help veterans who suffer from PTSD. Eight days prior to that paper, Liu and her team published another paper in Scientific Reports. That paper outlined Liu's work to understand how the brains of people suffering from PTSD are different from a healthy group of non-PTSD sufferers using a Stroop test. Stroop tests are attention tests that are commonly used in psychology. Liu measured blood flow in the left side of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex of subjects' brains and found that those suffering from PTSD don't have the ability to pay attention and also have insufficient blood flow in that area of the brain. Michael Cho, chair of UTA's Bioengineering Department, says that Liu's continuing focus on using NIR light to detect, monitor and potentially treat brain injuries underscores the UTA's focus on health and the human condition. ""Dr. Liu and her collaborators have made incredible strides in identifying how the brain is affected by trauma, as well as how to treat disorders such as PTSD noninvasively with light,"" Cho said. ""This is truly innovative, groundbreaking research, and the results are a testament to Hanli and the input of her collaborators."" Don't Miss: Psychedelic therapy re-emerging for anxiety, PTSD and addiction Liu has studied PTSD extensively with Smith-Osborne and Tian, and they have applied a portable brain-mapping device that allows them to ""see"" where memory fails student veterans with PTSD. That research led the team to connect with Gonzalez-Limam and further discovered that shining low-level light on the brain by placing the light source on the forehead can stimulate and energize neurons to function more effectively. When cells are stimulated with light, they remain stimulated for a lengthy period of time even after the light is removed. The approach differs from other therapies that use magnets or electric shocks and has the potential to yield effective, longer-lasting treatments.

E.coli can be transmitted in contaminated food and water, posing particular risks to children and the elderly. In the late spring of 2011 a serious outbreak of E.coli bacteria sickened thousands of people in Germany and killed more than 50. A team of researchers from the Photonics Research Center  at the University of Quebec in Outaouais, Canada, under direction of Professor Wojtek J. Bock and collaborators from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, have built a new sensor that can quickly and cost-effectively detect E.coli over a wide temperature range. The researchers describe the sensor in a paper in the journal Optics Letters, from The Optical Society.  ""Using currently available technologies, which are mostly based on amplification of the sample, it takes several hours to days to detect the presence of bacteria. A fast and accurate detection alternative is, therefore, preferable over the existing technology,"" said Saurabh Mani Tripathi, a physicist at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. Faster tests for the bacteria could lead to faster treatment of patients, as well as to cheaper and easier environmental monitoring, he said. The new sensor uses bacteriophages   viruses that can naturally latch onto and kill bacteria. The viruses are bonded to the surface of an optical fiber and will grab E.coli bacteria from a sample and keep them attached. When a beam of light strikes the surface, the presence of E.coli shifts the wavelength in a telltale sign of bacterial contamination. One of the challenges of using optical fibers for bacteria detection is that temperature changes can alter the optical properties of the materials. Sensors are therefore often designed to work at a particular temperature and give inaccurate readings if the sample gets much hotter or colder. Tripathi and his colleagues overcame this challenge by adding an additional optical component and in effect canceling out temperature-induced shifts. Their device is temperature insensitive over an approximately 20-degree Celsius / 68-degree Farenheight range, starting at room temperature and going up to 40-degrees Celsius / 104-degrees Farenheight. The temperature insensitivity makes the sensor more practical for outdoor applications, like on-site monitoring of water reservoirs, Tripathi said.  He also noted that the food industry and pathology labs are other possible users of the new sensors. The sensor can be modified to detect other strains of bacteria by changing the bacteriophage. The research group is currently collaborating with Security and Protection International, Inc., a Canadian company, to explore commercialization of their device. Bock said that costs are hard to estimate at this stage of the research, but that the team hopes to deliver portable units for a few thousand dollars. ""Pathogenic bacterial infection is one of the biggest causes of death, and a fast response time is much needed for timely detection and subsequent cure of bacterial infection,"" Tripathi said. ""I'm excited by the very low time [our sensor needs] to accurately detect the presence of E. coli bacteria in water collected from environments at different temperatures.""","Published: September 7, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/changing-ocean-chemistry-due-to-human-activity-190360,Changing Ocean Chemistry Due To Human Activity More anthropogenic carbon in the northeast Pacific means weaker shells for many marine species  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Oceanographers from MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution report that the northeast Pacific Ocean has absorbed an increasing amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide over the last decade, at a rate that mirrors the increase of carbon dioxide emissions pumped into the atmosphere. The scientists, led by graduate student Sophie Chu, in MIT s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, found that most of the anthropogenic carbon (carbon arising from human activity) in the northeast Pacific has lingered in the upper layers, changing the chemistry of the ocean as a result. In the past 10 years, the region s average pH has dropped by 0.002 pH units per year, leading to more acidic waters. The increased uptake in carbon dioxide has also decreased the availability of aragonite   an essential mineral for many marine species  shells. Overall, the researchers found that the northeast Pacific has a similar capacity to store carbon, compared to the rest of the Pacific. However, this carbon capacity is significantly lower than at similar latitudes in the Atlantic.  The ocean has been the only true sink for anthropogenic emissions since the industrial revolution,  Chu says.  Right now, it stores about 1/4 to 1/3 of the anthropogenic emissions from the atmosphere. We re expecting at some point the storage will slow down. When it does, more carbon dioxide will stay in the atmosphere, which means more warming. So it s really important that we continue to monitor this.  Chu and her colleagues have published their results in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans. Tipping the scales The northeast Pacific, consisting of waters that flow from Alaska s Aleutian Islands to the tip of southern California, is considered somewhat of a climate canary   sensitive to changes in ocean chemistry, and carbon dioxide in particular. The region sits at the end of the world s ocean circulation system, where it has collected some of the oldest waters on Earth and accumulated with them a large amount of dissolved inorganic carbon, which is naturally occurring carbon that has been respired by marine organisms over thousands of years.  This puts the Pacific at this already heightened state of high carbon and low pH,  Chu says. Add enough atmospheric carbon dioxide into the mix, and the scales could tip toward an increasingly acidic ocean, which could have an effect first in sea snails called pteropods, which depend on aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate) to make their protective shells. More acidic waters can make carbonate less available to pteropods.  These species are really sensitive to ocean acidification,  Chu says.  It s harder for them to get enough carbonate to build their shells, and they end up with weaker shells, and have reduced growth rates.  Protecting shells Chu and her colleagues originally set out to study the effects of ocean acidification on pteropods, rather than the ocean s capacity to store carbon. In 2012, the team embarked on a scientific cruise to the northeast Pacific, where they followed the same route as a similar cruise in 2001. During the month-long journey, the scientists collected samples of pteropods, as well as seawater, which they measured for temperature, salinity, and pH. Upon their return, Chu realized that the data they collected could also be used to gauge changes in the ocean s anthropogenic carbon storage. Ordinarily, it s extremely difficult to tease out anthropogenic carbon in the ocean from carbon that naturally arises from breathing marine organisms. Both types of carbon are classified as dissolved inorganic carbon, and anthropogenic carbon in the ocean is miniscule compared to the vast amount of carbon that has accumulated naturally over millions of years. To isolate anthropogenic carbon in the ocean and observe how it has changed through time, Chu used a modeling technique known as extended multiple linear regression   a statistical method that models the relationships between given variables, based on observed data. The data she collected came from both the 2012 cruise and the previous 2001 cruise in the same region. She ran a model for each year, plugging in water temperature, salinity, apparent oxygen utilization, and silicate. The models then estimated the natural variability in dissolved inorganic carbon for each year. That is, the models calculated the amount of carbon that should vary from 2001 to 2012, only based on natural processes such as organic respiration. Chu then subtracted the 2001 estimate from the 2012 estimate   a difference that accounts for sources of carbon that are not naturally occurring, and are instead anthropogenic. Sinking carbon The researchers found that since 2001, the northeast Pacific has stored 11 micromoles per kilogram of anthropogenic carbon, which is comparable to the rate at which carbon dioxide has been emitted into the atmosphere. Most of this carbon is stored in surface waters. In the northern part of the region in particular, anthropogenic carbon tends to linger in shallower waters, within the upper 300 meters of the ocean. The southern region of the northeast Pacific stores carbon a bit deeper, within the top 600 meters. Chu says this shallow storage is likely due to a subpolar gyre, or rotating current, that pushes water up from the deep, preventing surface waters from sinking. In contrast, others have observed that similar latitudes in the Atlantic have stored carbon much deeper, due to evaporation and mixing, leading to increased salinity and density, which causes carbon to sink. The team calculated that the increase in anthropogenic carbon in the upper ocean caused a decrease in the region s average pH, making the ocean more acidic as a result. This acidification also had an effect on the region s aragonite, decreasing its saturation state over the last decade.   Richard Feely, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that the group s results show that this particular part of the ocean is  highly sensitive to ocean acidification.   Our own work with pteropods, and that of others, indicates that some marine organisms are already being impacted by ocean acidification processes in this region,  says Feely, who did not contribute to the study.  Laboratory studies indicate that many species of corals, shellfish, and some fish species will be impacted in the near future. As this study, and others, has shown, the region will soon become undersaturated with respect to aragonite later this century.  While the total amount of anthropogenic carbon appears to be increasing with each year, Chu says the rate at which the northeast Pacific has been storing carbon has remained relatively the same since 2001. That means that the region could still have a good amount of  room  to store carbon, at least for the foreseeable future. But already, her team and others are seeing in the acidification trends the ocean s negative response to the current rate of carbon storage.  It would take hundreds of thousands of years for the ocean to absorb the majority of CO2 that humans have released into the atmosphere,  Chu says.  But at the rate we re going, it s just way faster than anything can keep up with. ","Published: September 7, 2016"

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer among men and women in the United States, and the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women worldwide. The incidence of colorectal cancer has increased over the last few years, with about one million new cases diagnosed annually. Non-targeted chemotherapy is the most common therapeutic strategy available for colon cancer patients, but this treatment method is unable to distinguish between cancerous and healthy cells, leading to poor therapeutic effects on tumor cells and severe toxic side effects on healthy cells. Enabling chemotherapeutic drugs to target cancer cells would be a major development in the treatment of colon cancer. In this study, the researchers isolated a specific nanoparticle population from edible ginger (GDNP 2) and reassembled their lipids, naturally occurring molecules that include fats, to form ginger-derived nano-lipids, also known as nanovectors. To achieve accurate targeting of tumor tissues, the researchers modified the nanovectors with folic acid to create FA-modified nanovectors (FA nanovectors). Folic acid shows high-affinity binding to the folate receptors that are highly expressed on many tumors and almost undetectable on non-tumor cells.  The FA nanovectors were tested as a delivery platform for doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat colon cancer. The researchers found that doxorubicin was efficiently loaded into the FA nanovectors, and the FA nanovectors were efficiently taken up by colon cancer cells, exhibited excellent biocompatibility and successfully inhibited tumor growth. Compared to a commercially available option for delivering doxorubicin, the FA nanovectors released the drug more rapidly in an acidic pH that resembled the tumor environment, suggesting this delivery strategy could decrease the severe side effects of doxorubicin. These findings were published in the journal Molecular Therapy.  Our results show that FA nanovectors made of edible ginger-derived lipids could shift the current paradigm of drug delivery away from artificially synthesized nanoparticles toward the use of nature-derived nanovectors from edible plants,  said Dr. Didier Merlin, a professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State and a Research Career Scientist at the VA Medical Center.

These are the findings of a new study from Uppsala University, which was published in the scientific journal EBioMedicine. Until now, medical research has taken into account age, sex and health factors of the person providing the sample, but it turns out that storage time is just as important.   This discovery will change the way the entire world works with biobank blood , says researcher Stefan Enroth, who presented the new findings along with Professor Ulf Gyllensten.  All research on, and analysis of, biobank blood going forward should also take into account what we have discovered, namely the time aspect. It is completely new.  In their research on the treatment and diagnosis of uterine cancer, the researchers looked at large volumes of protein samples. The samples come from the V sterbotten Intervention Programme at Ume  University, and were collected from 1988 to 2014. They analysed 380 different samples from 106 women between the ages of 29 and 73. To study the impact of storage time, only samples from 50-year-old women were used in order to isolate the time effect. 108 different proteins were analysed. In addition to how long a sample had been frozen, the researchers also looked at what year the sample was taken and the age of the patient when the sample was taken.  We suspected that we d find an influence from storage time, but we thought it would be much less , says Professor Ulf Gyllensten.  It has now been demonstrated that storage time can be a factor at least as important as the age of the individual at sampling.  Blood from biobanks has been used in research aimed at producing new drugs and testing new treatment methods. The results of this study are important for future drug research, but it is not possible or necessary, to repeat all previous biobank analyses.  Most of the previous inaccuracies have most likely involved the tested preparation or treatment providing a false negative result , says Stefan.  Differences between groups, for example, may not have been seen because cases were collected over a long period, whereas controls were collected at a single point in time.  The other major finding of the study is that the protein levels in the blood plasma vary depending on the season or month in which the samples were taken. Some of these differences can be explained by the amount of sunlight subjects were exposed to at the time of sampling.  There are earlier studies exploring how proteins are affected by storage time, but they have dealt with individual proteins and small groups of patients , says Ulf.  We have done the largest study ever, on the most people and over the longest period of time. ","Published: September 7, 2016"

The stem cell lines scientists created in the lab, which are believed to closely resemble human heart tissue, have already yielded insights into unexpected disease mechanisms, including the involvement of cells that have never before been linked to pathogenesis in a human stem-cell model of HCM.  The research was published in the journal Stem Cell Reports.  The genetic disorder discussed in the new study is called cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), which is caused by a mutation in a gene called BRAF.  The condition is rare and affects fewer than 300 people worldwide, according to the National Institutes of Health.  It causes abnormalities of the head, face, skin, and major muscles, including the heart. To learn more about HCM associated with various genetic diseases, Mount Sinai scientists took skin cells from three CFC patients and turned them into highly versatile stem cells, which were then converted into cells responsible for the beating of the heart.  This model has relevance for research on several related and more common genetic disorders, including Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by unusual facial features, short stature, heart defects, and skeletal malformations.  At present, there is no curative option for HCM in patients with these related genetic conditions,  said Bruce D. Gelb, MD, Director of The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute and Professor in the Departments of Pediatrics, Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  If our findings are correct, they suggest we might be able to treat HCM by blocking specific cell signals which is something we know how to do.  Dr. Gelb says that about 40 percent of patients with CFC suffer from HCM (two of the three study participants had HCM).  This suggests a pathogenic connection, though the link has never been fully explored or explained. The primary goal of the current research was to understand the role of a cell-signaling pathway called RAS/MAPK in the cascade of events leading to HCM in patients with CFCs   and by association, with Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and other similar illnesses. Observing the disease progression in these heart cells, called cardiomyocytes, Dr. Gelb and his team found that some of the changes were caused by interactions with cells that resemble fibroblasts   the same kinds of cells that produce collagen and other proteins. Fibroblasts make up a significant portion of total heart tissue, although it is the cardiomyocytes that are primarily responsible for pumping blood.  These fibroblast-like cells seem to be producing an excess of a protein growth factor called TGF-beta, which, in turn, caused the cardiomyocytes to hypertrophy, or grow larger,  Dr. Gelb said.  We believe this is the first time the phenomenon has been observed using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model of the disease.  Prior to this observation, Dr. Gelb and his team assumed hypertrophy was  cell autonomous,  meaning intrinsic to the cardiomyocytes themselves.  Based on our cell culture model, we saw that fibroblasts are playing a key role in giving the heart cells the signal that causes them to get big,  Dr. Gelb said.  That was quite unexpected.  The therapeutic implications may also be profound.  We were able to block TGF-beta in vitro using antibodies that bind to the protein. When we did that, the cardiomyocytes no longer hypertrophy,  Dr. Gelb said. It s not certain the same effect would be seen in the many clinical cases of HCM that are not influenced by BRAF or the RAS pathway essentially a chain of cellular proteins that help transmit signals from surface receptors on the cell to DNA in the nucleus  but researchers believe this could be the case. The bigger surprise, said Dr. Gelb,  is that we may be talking about a signaling circle  in which fibroblasts trigger the release of a growth factor, which causes cardiomyocytes to hypertrophy, which in turn, prompts fibroblasts to release more of the growth factor.  Dr. Gelb didn t witness this last part of the circle in his stem cell culture, but evidence of fibroblast stimulation has been reported in mouse models that don t express the RAS mutation. If the circle theory is validated, Dr. Gelb said, there could be new and broad therapeutic interventions for HCM in both RAS and non-RAS contexts.  In theory, at least, a therapy could be useful for both,  he said.","Published: September 7, 2016"

Reported in the September 5, 2016 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) Early Edition, the researchers used the computing power of Gordon and Comet, based at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UC San Diego; and Stampede, at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin, to perform an unprecedented survey of protein structures using accelerated molecular dynamics or aMD   a method that performs a more complete sampling of the myriad shapes and conformations that a target protein molecule may go through. The computing resources were provided by the National Science Foundation-funded Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program, one of the most advanced collections of integrated digital resources and services in the world.  The supercomputing power of Gordon, Comet, and Stampede allows us to run hundreds-of-nanosecond aMD simulations, which are able to capture millisecond timescale events in complex biomolecules,  said the study s first author Yinglong Miao, a research specialist with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at UC San Diego and research scientist with the UC San Diego Department of Pharmacology. Though effective in most cases, today s heart medications   many of which act on M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors or M2 mAChRs that decrease heart rate and reduce heart contractions   may carry side effects, sometimes serious. That s because the genetic sequence of M2 mAChR s primary  orthosteric  binding site is  highly conserved,  and found in at least four other receptor types that are widely spread in the body, yielding unwanted results. For this reason, drug designers are seeking a different approach, homing in on molecular targets or so-called  allosteric binding sites  that reside away from the receptor s primary binding site and are built around a more diverse genetic sequence and structure than their counterpart  orthosteric  binding sites. Essentially, allosteric modulators act as a kind of cellular dimmer-switch that, once turned on,  fine tunes  the activation and pharmacological profile of the target receptor.  Allosteric sites typically exhibit great sequence diversity and therefore present exciting new targets for designing selective therapeutics,  said the study s co-investigator J. Andrew McCammon, the Joseph E. Mayer Chair of Theoretical Chemistry, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology, all at UC San Diego. McCammon was named the winner of the 2016-17 Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in Theoretical Chemistry, awarded by the Theoretical Chemistry Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, last week. In particular, drug designers have begun to aggressively search for allosteric modulators to fine-tune medications that bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest and most diverse group of membrane receptors in animals, plants, fungi and protozoa. These cell surface receptors act like an inbox for messages in the form of light energy, hormones and neurotransmitters, and perform an incredible array of functions in the human body. In fact, between one-third to one-half of all marketed drugs act by binding to GPCRs, treating diseases including cancer, asthma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease, and heart disease. More Targeted Therapies Though many of the GPCR drugs have made their way to the medicine cabinet, most -- including M2 mAChR targeted drugs -- exhibit side effects owing to their lack of specificity. All these drugs target the orthosteric binding sites of receptors, thus creating the push to find more targeted therapies based on allosteric sites.  The problem here is that molecules that bind to these allosteric sites have proven extremely difficult to identify using conventional high-throughput screening techniques,  said McCammon, also a chemistry and biochemistry professor in UC San Diego s Division of Physical Sciences. Enter accelerated molecular dynamics and supercomputing. As described in this latest study,  Accelerated structure-based design of chemically diverse allosteric modulators of a muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor , some 38 lead compounds were selected from a database of compounds from the National Cancer Institute, using computationally enhanced simulations to account for binding strength and receptor flexibility. About half of these compounds exhibited the hallmarks of an allosteric behavior in subsequent in vitro experiments, with about a dozen showing strong affinity to the M2 mAChR binding site. Of these, the researchers highlighted two showing both strong affinity and high selectivity in studies of cellular behavior. These cutting-edge experiments were performed by collaborators from the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.  To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time an unprecedented successful structure-based approach to identify chemically diverse and selective GPCR allosteric modulators with outstanding potential for further structure-activity relationship studies,  the researchers wrote. The next steps will involve an investigation of the chemical properties of these novel molecules by the molecular chemists from Monash, led by Celine Valant and her colleague Arthur Christopoulos.  This is just the beginning. We believe that it will be possible to apply our combined cutting-edge in silico and in vitro techniques to a wide array of receptor targets that are involved in some of the most devastating diseases,  said Valant, the study s co-lead investigator from Monash.","Published: September 7, 2016"

Whole-genome sequencing analyzes all the 6 billion DNA bases in a person's genome. Another approach, called whole-exome sequencing, focuses only on DNA that code for proteins. Such regions make up about 1% of the human genome, but contain many disease-causing variants. In order to study sequence variants and their consequences in human DNA, researchers need access to large data sets. The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) an international group led by scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard built on previous efforts and assembled the largest data set of human exomes to date. The effort was supported by several NIH components as well as funding agencies around the world. The team demonstrated the benefits of this massive data set in a report published on August 17, 2016, in Nature. ExAC scientists assembled a data set of more than 60,000 human exomes from diverse populations. Significantly, the DNA had been sequenced deeply that is, each nucleotide was sequenced enough times to ensure the data s accuracy. The researchers discovered more than 7.4 million DNA variants across the exome. These corresponded to an average of one variant for every 8 DNA base pairs. The majority of these occurred at very low frequency and weren t detected in previous data sets. Patterns of variation differed among people of European, African, South Asian, East Asian, and Latino ancestry. The researchers found that the density of genetic variation isn t uniform across the exome. This is partly because some DNA sequences are more susceptible to mutation than others. Some mutations also have greater consequences than others and are thus more likely to be preserved or eliminated. Using their new findings, the researchers categorized genes according to how resistant they are to change, and thus how crucial they are to function. This knowledge could help investigators make decisions about which genes of interest to prioritize in future studies. The scientists assessed whether the new data set could yield insights into inherited disease. They identified hundreds of suspected disease variants that should be reclassified as benign (harmless) particularly in South Asian or Latino people, who were underrepresented in previous reference databases. These results show that the data set can serve as an important resource for interpreting genetic variants seen in the clinic.  The scale and diversity of the ExAC resource is invaluable,  says senior author Dr. Daniel MacArthur of the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School.  It gives us the ability to discover extremely rare variants and offers an unparalleled window into the roots of rare genetic diseases. ","Published: September 7, 2016"

Testing may be performed to confirm a diagnosis, help tailor treatments, or determine whether someone might pass a genetic disorder on to future generations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (abnormally thick heart muscle) is the most common genetic heart disease in the U.S. and affects about 1 in 500 people globally. The condition may be diagnosed based on the presence of specific DNA variations. More than a third of people with the condition have known genetic misspellings. Some people with the disease experience chest pain and shortness of breath. Others, however, have no symptoms. The disease can cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) that can be life threatening. Thus, a person found to have a genetic variation associated with the condition or whose parents have one may be advised to make lifestyle changes, undergo further testing, and/or undergo treatment. A team led by Dr. Isaac Kohane at Harvard Medical School more closely examined the connection between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the DNA variants that previous studies in the medical literature had associated with the disease. The study was funded by NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and National Library of Medicine (NLM). Results appeared on August 18, 2016, in New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists analyzed DNA sequences from national databases that included more than 8,000 people. They identified 5 common DNA variants that were previously linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. All 5 of these, the analysis found, were much more common in black Americans than in white Americans. All 5 were initially misclassified as disease-causing, they concluded; the new analysis found them likely to be harmless. The team next reviewed clinical records from a genetic testing laboratory. They found that the 5 variants were present in many people who didn t have the disease. Several patients, most of African ancestry, had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on the variants. Simulations showed that such misclassification of genetic variations could be avoided by ensuring that even modest numbers of people from diverse populations are included in sequence databases used for evaluating the likelihood of disease. The researchers noted the need to keep clinicians and genetic counselors updated on variant reclassification.  Our study powerfully illustrates the importance of racial and ethnic diversity in research,  Kohane says.  Racial and ethnical inclusiveness improves the validity and accuracy of clinical trials and, in doing so, can better guide clinical decision-making and choice of optimal therapy. This is the essence of precision medicine. ","Published: September 7, 2016"

In a paper published in this week s issue of Nature Microbiology, the researchers report that they had uncovered  hidden sequence patterns in the major surface protein and virulence factor  of group A Strep, called the M protein, that limit the body s immune response against these bacteria.  At present, there is no vaccine against group A Strep, and our discovery of hidden sequence patterns has offered up a novel way to devise such a vaccine,  said Partho Ghosh, chair of UC San Diego s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, who headed the team of researchers. Ghosh said that one of the biggest obstacles to the development of a vaccine against these bacteria is the  hyper-variability  of the M protein. Group A Streptococcus bacteria have a multitude of different strains, each of which displays a different protein on its surface. Because our immune systems must recognize these different proteins before launching an immune response with antibodies specific to the outer protein coat, the hyper-variability of the M proteins make it difficult for our immune systems to attach antibodies specific to each these proteins from different strains.  When we become infected with a particular strain of group A Strep, we generally mount an immune response against the particular M protein displayed by that strain,  explains Ghosh.  But this immunity works only against the infecting strain. We remain vulnerable to infection by other group A Strep strains that display other types of M proteins on their surfaces. This is because the antibody response against the M protein is almost always specific to the sequence of that M protein, and M proteins of different types appear to be unrelated in sequence to one another.  The key to resolving the problem was the recognition that a human protein called C4BP had been discovered by another group of researchers to be recruited to the surface of Group A Strep by many different protein types.  This was a puzzle, because the antibody response is specific and limited to a single M protein type, while C4BP binds a broad variety of M protein types, perhaps up to 90 percent of them,  said Ghosh.  Group A Strep brings C4BP to its surface to dampen the immune response. We wanted to combat this recruitment by blocking the interaction between M proteins and C4BP, but equally as importantly, we wanted to take advantage of the broad recruitment of C4BP by M proteins that would pave a path to the development of a vaccine.  To determine if this was possible, a graduate student in Ghosh s lab, Cosmo Buffalo, collaborated with another graduate student, Sophia Hirakis, in the laboratory of Rommie Amaro, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry who uses computers to study protein structures, to first study the complex interactions between M protein and C4BP.  This allowed us to understand some detailed features of the interaction,  said Ghosh. The research team, which also included an undergraduate researcher, Adrian Bahn-Suh, collaborated extensively with Victor Nizet, an expert in infectious diseases who is a professor at UC San Diego s School of Medicine and Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In their experimental and computational study, the biochemists painstakingly detailed four crystal structures of four different M protein types, each bound to human C4BP.  These structures revealed that even though the different M protein types appeared to be unrelated in sequence, there were common sequence patterns hidden within the differences that linked all these M proteins together,  said Ghosh.  These common patterns are what is used to recruit C4BP to the surface of group A Strep by the different M protein types.   The idea now is to have antibodies do the same thing as C4BP   that is, recognize many different M protein types,  he added.  That way, the antibody response will not be limited to one M protein type and one strain of group A Strep, but will extend to most, if not all, M protein types and most, if not all strains, of group A Strep.  The UC San Diego chemists, in collaboration with Nizet, are now working on developing a vaccine that, they hope, will be protective against most, if not all, strains of group A Strep.","Published: September 7, 2016"

In addition, they investigate a thermal activation process that requires high temperature capability. In turn, a high temperature experimental set up allows the study of thermal stability under various conditions.  Since choosing the Linkam TS1500 high temperature stage for their work, the group has used the stage multiple times to study different material systems with the goals of understanding the effects of substrate on 2D materials to reveal the intrinsic properties of the materials and control and modify them with substrate engineering. These include black phosphorus[1], monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) [2], tungsten disulphide (WS2) [3] and graphene. Other materials, such as copper-zinc-tin selenide (CZTSe), a new solar cell materialhave resulted in publications.  Professor Zhang has noted several key findings from this research. He says  We have made some important findings which are common among 2D materials. Firstly, we saw that film properties are sensitive to not only the substrate type (e.g. SiO2 vs. sapphire) but also the bonding situation (e.g. epitaxially grown vs. transferred). Second, we found that high temperature studies reveal how film morphology impacts the material properties and how morphology changes with heating. We also saw that the sensitivity of the substrate influence on the film thickness depends on the material property of interest. For instance, the effect of the substrate remains significant for thermal conductivity of the film even the film is already relatively thick, but is much less significant for electronic properties.

See Also: Brain structure varies depending on how trusting people are of others, study shows A team led by researchers from University of New South Wales (UNSW) Medicine analyzed the MRI scans of 322 individuals from the Older Australian Twins Study. The objective was to map the genetic relatedness (or heritability) of cortical and subcortical structures in their brains. These structures are responsible for functions ranging from memory and visual processing, to motor control. ""We know that genes strongly underpin brain development,"" says lead researcher Associate Professor Wei Wen from the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA) at UNSW. ""But we still don't understand which specific genes are implicated, or how they contribute to different brain structures."" ""In order to identify these genes, we need to first know whether they are shared by different parts of the brain, or unique to a single structure,"" he says. ""This is the first attempt to examine genetic correlations between all of the brain's structures, using the twin design."" The UNSW-led team analysed MRI scans of 93 sets of identical twins and 68 sets of fraternal twins. These participants were all Caucasian men and women without dementia, with an average age of 70, living in the Eastern states of Australia. The scientists measured the volume of their brain structures (12 in total) and, using statistical and genetic modelling, determined the heritability for each. Heritability is the extent to which genes contribute to phenotypic, or physical, differences.

""It gives us a blueprint for forming a new model of the brain, subdivided into genetically linked structures. This we can apply to the analysis of big data, and use to more effectively hunt for the specific genes involved in brain development."" Sachdev says the classical twin design is an important tool for understanding whether physical or behavioural traits have a genetic determinant. Twin studies compare the similarity of a given trait (or characteristic) between monozygotic (identical) twins, who share 100% of their DNA, and dizygotic (fraternal) twins, who share 50% of their DNA. In these studies, if a physical trait is considerably more similar for identical twins than fraternal twins, this suggests a strong genetic contribution. Despite finding strong genetic contributions across all structures examined, Sachdev says he was surprised by the low genetic correlation between cortical and subcortical structures. These structures tended to have unique genetic determinants, and were only weakly related.

The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to a diverse group of conditions in which memory problems and other impairments of mental function result from inadequate blood flow through the brain. Vascular dementia is a severe form of VCI. See Also: Pilot study: Training helps those with mild cognitive impairmentConfirmation of the clinical diagnosis of most diseases that cause dementia depends on post-mortem examination of the brain. The finding of brain tissue damaged by impaired blood supply, or of widespread hardening of the arteries in the brain suggests that the cognitive impairment was caused by vascular disease. However, these pathological abnormalities are also often found in combination with other dementing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and, until recently, the contribution of different vascular abnormalities to cognitive impairment was difficult to quantify, as there were no validated criteria for determining this. A large group of UK neuropathologists and other scientists, led by the University of Bristol Dementia Research Group and supported by Alzheimer's Society and Alzheimer's Research UK, has developed a set of Vascular Cognitive Impairment Neuropathology guidelines (VCING) for assessing vascular pathologies in post-mortem brain tissue. The researchers, using brains that had been donated through a scheme called Brains for Dementia Research (BDR), have identified a set of neuropathological determinants that can reproducibly be used to assign a low, intermediate or high likelihood that vascular disease contributed to cognitive impairment in an individual case. Seth Love, Professor of Neuropathology in the University of Bristol's School of Clinical Sciences, said: ""VCING represent a major advance in our ability to assess the contribution of vascular pathology to cognitive impairment and open the way to a range of studies of the determinants of VCI, including of processes that are potentially preventable or modifiable. Learn More: Current screening methods miss worrisome number of persons with mild cognitive impairment""More accurate determination of the contribution of cerebrovascular disease to cognitive impairment and dementia is likely to inform healthcare policy and prioritisation of resources for patients with VCI, and lead to more funding of VCI-related research. It also opens the way to a range of mechanistic studies of pathophysiological determinants of VCI, with a view to identifying processes that are potentially preventable or modifiable."" Dr. Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, added: ""This collaborative effort has produced a common approach for researchers working to understand the changes that take place in blood vessels that can contribute to cognitive decline. The guidelines developed through this project have the potential to help researchers and clinicians across the globe to streamline their research into dementia, taking a step forward in improving the accuracy and reliability of their work. With a growing international focus on dementia research, it's crucial that researchers are co-ordinated in their approach to studying the condition to ensure we make progress as quickly as possible for the millions affected worldwide.""

A study from Boston Children's Hospital, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, finds that certain neurons in the hypothalamus play a central, previously unknown role in triggering anxiety. Targeting them, rather than the whole brain, could potentially provide a more effective treatment for anxiety and perhaps other psychiatric disorders, say researchers Joseph Majzoub, MD, and Rong Zhang, PhD, in the Division of Endocrinology. See Also: Social anxiety is highly heritable but is affected by environment Experiments in mice showed that blocking the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) selectively in this group of neurons erased the animals' natural fears. Mice with the deletion readily walked elevated gangplanks, explored brightly lit areas and approached novel objects things normal mice avoid. CRH, discovered nearly 40 years ago, coordinates our physical and behavioral stress response, often termed the ""fight-or-flight"" response. This response helps us survive in the face of threats, but when it is activated at the wrong time or too intensely, it can lead to anxiety and/or depression. For this reason, several drug companies have developed CRH-blocking drugs as possible alternatives to SSRIs and benzodiazepines, which have side effects, for treating anxiety disorders. However, the results have been disappointing: of the eight completed phase II and III trials of CRH antagonists for depression or anxiety, six have been published, with largely negative findings, says Majzoub. Zhang had a hunch that blocking CRH throughout the brain, as was done in the above drug trials, isn't the best approach. ""Blocking CRH receptors all over the brain doesn't work,"" she says. ""We think the effects work against each other somehow. It may be that CRH has different effects depending on where in the brain it is produced."" Learn More: Anxiety and the ability to predict an outcome Using genetic engineering, Zhang and her colleagues selectively removed the CRH gene from about 1,000 nerve cells in the hypothalamus of mice. (To do this, they used a genetic trick, knocking out the gene only in cells expressing another gene called SIM1.) The targeted cells were in the paraventricular nucleus, an area of the hypothalamus known to control the release of stress hormones (such as cortisol). But to Zhang's surprise, the loss of CRH in those cells affected not only hormone secretion, but also dramatically reduced anxiety behaviors (vigilance, suspicion, fear) in the mice. ""We already knew that CRH controlled the hormonal response, but the big surprise was that the behavioral response was completely blunted,"" says Majzoub. ""It was a very robust finding: Every parameter we looked at indicated that this animal was much less inhibited."" In the ""gangplank"" experiment, for example, the genetically altered mice were perfectly willing to venture onto an elevated maze, even the ""open"" section whose protective walls were removed. Similarly, when the mice were presented with an open field, the modified mice explored much more of its center, rather than hang out at the periphery like the control mice. Another surprise was that CRH secreted in the paraventricular nucleus goes to more places in the brain than originally thought including areas that control the behavioral stress response. ""It was a total surprise to us that the locus of control is in a tiny part of the hypothalamus,"" says Majzoub. Don't Miss: Mindfulness treatment as effective as CBT for depression and anxiety Majzoub acknowledges that blocking CRH production in just a subset of neurons would be technically challenging in humans. But if this could be done, it could be helpful for treating severe anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ""Blocking just certain neurons releasing CRH would be enough to alter behavior in a major way,"" he says. ""We don't know how to do that, but at least we have a starting point.""

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/sleepwake-cycle-brain-circuit-identified-209648,Sleep Wake Cycle Brain Circuit Identified Inhibiting nerve cells in a brain area known to guide goal directed behavior makes mice build nests and fall asleep  a new study shows  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Stanford University School of Medicine scientists have identified a brain circuit that s indispensable to the sleep-wake cycle. This same circuit is also a component of the reward system, an archipelago of interconnected brain clusters crucial to promoting behavior necessary for animals, including humans, to survive and reproduce. It makes intuitive sense that the reward system, which motivates goal-directed behaviors such as fleeing from predators or looking for food, and our sleep-wake cycle would coordinate with one another at some point. You can t seek food in your sleep, unless you re an adept sleepwalker. Conversely, getting out of bed is a lot easier when you re excited about the day ahead of you. But until this study, no precise anatomical location for this interaction between the brain s reward and arousal systems has been pinpointed, said Luis de Lecea, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. The researchers  findings were published online Sept. 5 in Nature Neuroscience. De Lecea is the senior author. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Ada Eban-Rothschild, PhD.  This has potential huge clinical relevance,  de Lecea said.  Insomnia, a multibillion-dollar market for pharmaceutical companies, has traditionally been treated with drugs such as benzodiazepines that nonspecifically shut down the entire brain. Now we see the possibility of developing therapies that, by narrowly targeting this newly identified circuit, could induce much higher-quality sleep.  Some 25 to 30 percent of American adults are affected by sleep disturbances of one type or another, according to the National Institutes of Health. In addition, disruption of the sleep-wake rhythm typifies many different neuropsychiatric disorders and is understood to exacerbate them. One of the first questions a psychiatrist asks a patient, said de Lecea, is,  How s your sleep?  Similarity across vertebrates The reward system s circuitry is similar in all vertebrates, from fish, frogs and falcons to fishermen and fashion models. A chemical called dopamine plays a crucial role in firing up this circuitry. Neuroscientists know that a particular brain structure, the ventral tegmental area, or VTA, is the origin of numerous dopamine-secreting nerve fibers that run in discrete tracts to many different parts of the brain. A plurality of these fibers go to the nucleus accumbens, a forebrain structure particularly implicated in generating feelings of pleasure in anticipation of, or response to, obtaining a desired objective.  Since many reward-circuit-activating drugs such as amphetamines that work by stimulating dopamine secretion also keep users awake, it s natural to ask if dopamine plays a key role in the sleep-wake cycle as well as in reward,  Eban-Rothschild said.  But, in part due to existing technical limitations, earlier experimental literature has unearthed little evidence for the connection and, in fact, has suggested that this circuit probably wasn t so important.  For the new study, the investigators employed male laboratory mice bioengineered in several respects to enable the use of advanced technologies to remotely excite, suppress and monitor activity in the dopamine-secreting nerve cells from the mice s VTA. They also measured the mice s overall brain activity and muscle tone to determine the mice s relative stages of asleep or arousal. The researchers used video cameras to view the mice s behavior. Observed in mice Overall, activity in the dopamine-secreting nerve cells emanating from the VTA rose on waking and stayed elevated when mice were awake. Conversely, this activity ramped down when mice transitioned into sleep, remaining low while they slumbered. Activating this nerve-cell population was enough to rouse the animals from a sound sleep and keep them awake for long periods, even during a point in the mice s diurnal cycle when they d ordinarily be bunking down. Control animals, whose VTA activity wasn t similarly jacked up, built little nests from pellets of materials placed in all the mice s cages and promptly dropped off. When instead the scientists suppressed activity in the same nerve-cell population during the typically active period of the mice s 24-hour cycle, the mice conked out, snoozing through the presence of surefire arousal triggers: delicious high-fat chow, a female or fear-inducing fox urine. Mice in an unfamiliar cage ordinarily explore their new surroundings energetically. And indeed, VTA-suppressed mice stayed awake for the first 45 minutes of the hour they spent in a new cage. But Eban-Rothschild noticed something: They spent that waking time building nests.  They were really careful about it,  she noted. Once they were satisfied with what they d built, they dozed off. This wasn t just some stereotyped behavior guaranteed to emerge when VTA activity was inhibited, Eban-Rothschild added.  If we put the nest they d already built in their usual cage into the novel cage, they climbed in and went right to sleep.  Control mice in the unfamiliar cage ran around, either ignoring the pellet of nesting materials placed inside or scattering those materials all over the cage. Nest-making activities Eban-Rothschild analyzed video footage of the animals  behavior in their novel environments, and correlated 1-second video segments with recorded brain activity during the corresponding time frame. She saw that actions directly connected to building nests were marked by reduced VTA activity, while actions that weren t were associated with higher levels of VTA activity.  We knew stimulating the brain s dopamine-related circuitry would increase goal-directed behaviors such as food- and sex-seeking  said Eban-Rothschild.  But the new study shows that at least one complex behavior is induced not by stimulating, but by inhibiting, this very circuit. Interestingly, this behavior   nest building   is essential to a mouse s preparation for sleep.  Nobody had noticed that before, said de Lecea.  This is the first finding of a sleep-preparation starter site in the brain. It s likely we humans have one, too. If we re disrupting this preparation by, say, reading email or playing videogames, which not only give off light but charge up our emotions and get our VTA dopaminergic circuitry going, it s easy to see why we re likely to have trouble falling asleep.  Noting that this anticipatory phase is often at the root of many people s sleeping problems, de Lecea suggested that the newly identified circuit could be a target for pharmacological intervention to help people ease into sleep.  We have plenty of drugs that counter dopamine,  he said.  Perhaps giving a person the right dose, at just the right time, of a drug with just the right pharmacokinetic properties so its effect will wear off at the right time would work a lot better than bombarding the brain with benzodiazepines, such as Valium, that knock out the entire brain.  He said he also sees the possibility that drugs targeting the VTA s dopamine-secreting nerve cells could benefit those suffering from neurological conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder that are characterized by sleep-wake cycle disturbances.  It could be that merely solving the sleep-wake part will clear up a lot of symptoms,  de Lecea said.","Published: September 6, 2016"

The findings are published online September 5 in the journal PNAS.    Our experimental design provides an invaluable system for studying important cellular and molecular events underlying Huntington s disease,  said first author Xiaobei Zhao, PhD, a post-doctoral scientist in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.    Atrophy of the corticostriatal pathway, which connects neurons in the cortex with those in the striatum, is a pathological hallmark of Huntington s disease. We ve shown in this HD cellular model that dysfunction in cortical neurons drives dysfunction in striatal neurons because the gene mutation responsible for Huntington disease causes deficits in the production, transport and release of a growth factor called BDNF.  Importantly, using this model provided evidence that expression of a single subunit of the TRiC protein, which inhibits the aggregation of mutant huntingtin proteins, rescued atrophy of striatal neurons. The next step is to test this in vivo. If the phenotype of the HD mouse model can be rescued, it s possible that TRiC could be used to treat Huntington s disease.  The corticostriatal pathway is a neuronal circuit connecting two parts of the brain: the outer, folded cerebral cortex where memory, thought, language and consciousness occur, and the underlying striatum   a region responsible for, among other things, behavior and voluntary movement in response to social stimuli. Corticostriatal decline is a telltale indicator of HD, a fatal genetic disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of physical and mental abilities.  In their study, Zhao, with senior author William Mobley, MD, PhD, chair and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Neurosciences, and colleagues cultured cortical and striatal neurons from an HD transgenic mouse model that expresses the human mutant huntingtin gene in a microfluidic chamber that allowed the cortical neurons to connect via axons to striatal neurons.  They found that the resulting circuits recapitulated several salient features of HD pathology, including reduced synaptic density and BDNF. Zhao stated  The new model and the ability to recreate the abnormal circuit is more physiologically relevant than many other models. Most important, it facilitates study of disease mechanisms and possible new disease-modifying treatments.   ","Published: September 6, 2016"

This discovery, published in Nature Genetics, could help find drugs that target specific weaknesses in each subtype of the disease, which could make treatment more effective and boost survival. The scientists, funded by Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council, looked at the complete genetic make-up of 129 oesophageal cancers and were able to subdivide the disease into three distinct types based on patterns detected in the DNA of the cancer cells called signatures. The first subtype they found had faults in their DNA repair pathways. Damage to this pathway is known to increase the risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. Patients with this subtype may benefit from a new family of drugs called PARP inhibitors that kill cancer cells by exploiting this weakness in their ability to repair DNA. The second subtype had a higher number of DNA mistakes and more immune cells in the tumours, which suggests these patients could benefit from immunotherapy drugs already showing great promise in a number of cancer types such as skin cancer. The final subtype had a DNA signature that is mainly associated with the cell ageing process and means this group might benefit from drugs targeting proteins on the surface of the cancer cells which make cells divide. Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, lead researcher based at the MRC Cancer Unit at the University of Cambridge, said:  Our study suggests we could make changes to the way we treat oesophageal cancer. Targeted treatments for the disease have so far not been successful, and this is mostly down to the lack of ways to determine which patients might benefit from different treatments. These new findings give us a greater understanding of the DNA signatures that underpin different subtypes of the disease and means we could better tailor treatment.  The next step is to test this approach in a clinical trial. The trial would use a DNA test to categorise patients into one of the three groups to determine the best treatments for each group and move away from a one-size-fits-all approach.  Each year around 8,800 people are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in the UK and just 12 per cent survive their disease for at least 10 years. Cancer Research UK has prioritised research into oesophageal cancer to help more people survive the disease by bringing people together, building infrastructure and developing the next generation of research leaders. Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK s chief clinician, said:  Being able to distinguish distinct types of oesophageal cancer is a genuinely new discovery from this work. For the first time we may be able to identify and test targeted treatments designed to exploit the cancer s specific weaknesses. Although survival rates from oesophageal cancer have been slowly rising in the last few years they are still far too low, and this research points the way to a completely new way of understanding and tackling the disease.

Dr Farid Tariq is a Research Associate at Imperial College where he is part of a research team led by Professor Nigel Brandon in the Department of Earth Science & Engineering focussing on improving fuel cells and batteries. Dr Tariq leads the effort to study 3D multiscale imaging and modelling of these devices. The group is focused on these electrochemical energy devices which range in use from consumer electronics, to cars up to grid level energy storage applications. They apply 3D imaging and advanced quantification of these structures at fine length scales approaching tens of nanometers. The goal is to develop an ability to control and understand how porous electrodes in these devices operate at these fine levels and how this ultimately scales up to observed performance when in use.  Dr Tariq selected micromanipulators from Kleindiek Nanotechnik (EM Resolutions, UK) to help to enable the understanding of microstructure and property relationships together, all at a fine scale. This is combined with 3D imaging to understand the structure in greater depth. In this respect, rather than just observing different features, he is able to measure and characterise their influence within the microstructure. In doing so, the aim is to mitigate or reduce sources of failure or degradation. The end result is to ultimately make batteries or fuel cells with longer lifetimes and better performance.  Describing his reasons for selecting Kleindiek, Dr Tariq said  We have been aware of some small alternative companies for manipulators and others that produce in-situ stages. Some of these were too large for the applications we were considering and not tailored to our type of work. The alternative was to perform our nano-indentation experiments and correlate those with FIB-SEM imaging. My vision is to integrate different instruments and capabilities that we have developed.

The stem-cell-derived bone tissue helped repair cranial bone defects in mice without developing tumors or causing infection. The work could lead to regenerative treatments for patients with critical bone defects and soldiers who have suffered traumatic bone injuries. The findings, published Aug. 31 in the journal Science Advances, could also lead to a simple, scalable and inexpensive way to manufacture a pure population of bone-building cells.  One of the broader goals of our research is to make regenerative treatments more accessible and clinically relevant by developing easy, efficient and cost-effective ways to engineer human cells and tissues,  said Shyni Varghese, a bioengineering professor at UC San Diego and senior author of the study. Pluripotent stem cells are capable of becoming any type of cell in the body, such as muscle, heart, skin or bone a process called differentiation. Because of this ability, pluripotent stem cells have promising therapeutic uses to repair or regenerate various tissues and organs. But getting pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into a particular type of cell that can function inside the body is not simple. Directing stem cell differentiation is like following a complex recipe, involving a long list of ingredients and steps that make the process costly and inefficient. Another challenge is producing stem-cell-derived tissues or organs that don t develop teratomas tumors that contain a variety of tissues found in different organs when transplanted. Teratomas are what can happen when some of the pluripotent stem cells go rogue and differentiate uncontrollably. Varghese and her team showed that they could control the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into functional osteoblasts bone-building cells simply by adding the molecule adenosine to their growth medium. Like living bone cells in the body, the resulting osteoblasts built bone tissues with blood vessels. When transplanted into mice with bone defects, the osteoblasts formed new bone tissues in vivo without any signs of teratoma formation.  It s amazing that a single molecule can direct stem cell fate. We don t need to use a cocktail of small molecules, growth factors or other supplements to create a population of bone cells from human pluripotent stem cells like induced pluripotent stem cells,  Varghese said. This work stems from a previous study by Varghese s group to understand how calcium phosphate minerals found in bone tissue induce stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. Her team discovered that stem cells take up calcium phosphate to produce ATP, a metabolic molecule, which then breaks down into adenosine and signals the stem cells to become osteoblasts.  We wondered what would happen if we bypassed the steps and just supplemented the medium with adenosine. That s what inspired this current study,  Varghese said. Varghese s team is now investigating exactly how adenosine signaling promotes bone formation. So far, they ve attributed the signaling to a receptor on the stem cells  surface, called the A2bR receptor, which binds to adenosine. But this mechanism still requires further study, she said.","Published: September 6, 2016"

The protein   called STRA6   sits in the membrane of our cells and is responsible for transporting vitamin A into the cell interior. Vitamin A is essential to all mammals and is particularly important in making the light receptors in our eyes, and in the placenta and fetus where it s critical for normal development.  Being able to visualize this protein, and understand how it works to move Vitamin A, is a really fantastic leap,  said one of the paper s co-authors, David J. Weber, PhD, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM).  And there is so much more we can do with this technique. It s exciting.  Images of the protein, which revealed several unusual features, were published in the August 26 issue of the journal Science. The work is a collaboration among several scientists around the country. Structural biologist Filippo Mancia, PhD, assistant professor of physiology and cellular biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center, led a team of other scientists, including Dr. Weber of UM SOM, along with Wayne Hendrickson, Larry Shapiro, Joachim Frank and Bill Blaner at Columbia University Medical Center, Loredana Quadro at Rutgers University, and Chiara Manzini at George Washington University. Until the new study, the way STRA6 transports vitamin A into the cell had been a mystery. Unlike most transporters, which interact directly with the substances they transport, STRA6 uses an intermediary protein that carries vitamin A in the bloodstream. Revealing the structure of STRA6 may provide insight into how other, related transporters work. A new type of camera technology was a key element to getting the STRA6 images. When paired with an electron microscope, the camera allows biologists to see tiny, never-seen-before structural details of the inner machinery of our cells.  We can now get near atomic resolution because the new camera is much faster and allows us to take a movie of the molecules,  says Oliver Clarke, PhD, an associate research scientist in the Hendrickson lab at Columbia University Medical Center.  Even under the electron microscope, the molecules are moving around by a tiny amount, but when you take a picture of something moving, it comes out blurry. With such a movie, we can align the frames of the movie to generate a sharper image.  The researchers used approximately 70,000 individual pictures of STRA6 to generate a 3-dimensional map of the protein, which was used to construct an extremely accurate atomic model. The images and model reveal that STRA6 is  a bit of a freak,  says Dr. Clarke.  Though this needs to be verified, the mechanism may be a way to protect cells from too much vitamin A.  Vitamin A is actually somewhat toxic,  says Dr. Mancia.  Trapping vitamin A inside the membrane may keep control of the amount inside the cell.  The research may help researchers understand how other, still mysterious cellular components, work.","Published: September 6, 2016"

Now, scientists are investigating whether some treatments can cause another long-term side effect: premature aging of important disease-fighting cells. University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers, by tracking a molecular marker that has been shown to increase in white blood cells as people age, have uncovered clues that suggest that stem cell transplant is linked to a marked increase in the  molecular age  of these immune cells in a group of patients with blood cancer. The researchers report in the journal EBioMedicine that patients treated with an autologous stem cell transplant   a procedure that uses a reserve of a patient s own stem cells to regenerate healthy, non-cancerous blood cells   had elevated levels of expression of messenger RNA (mRNA), a type of genetic code used to make proteins, for this age-related marker. Strikingly, they found expression levels increased to a degree comparable to an additional 30 years of chronological age. Despite the risk for significant short- and long-term side effects, the researchers say stem cell transplant is an extremely important treatment option. They believe their findings could lay the foundation for future studies into using this age marker to enable physicians to better quantify a patient s potential risk and benefit associated with a stem cell transplant.  We know that transplant is life-prolonging, and in many cases, it s life-saving, for many patients with blood cancers and other disorders,  said the study s lead author William Wood, MD, a UNC Lineberger member and an associate professor in the UNC School of Medicine Division of Hematology and Oncology.  At the same time, we re increasingly recognizing that survivors of transplant are at risk for long-term health problems, and so there is interest in determining what markers may exist to help predict risk for long-term health problems, or even in helping choose which patients are best candidates for transplantation.  Researchers are interested in objective measures of molecular or functional age as a person s age in years is not always a good indicator of his or her health or fitness to receive a treatment. UNC Lineberger researchers examined mRNA levels for a protein called p16. MRNA expression of the gene coding for the p16 protein has been found to exponentially increase with chronological age.  It s a well-known concept in geriatric oncology that different people age biologically at different rates and that their overall health status may or may not correspond with chronological age,  Wood said.   On the one hand, we would not want to use chronological age itself to exclude patients from transplant since there are now patients up to the age of 80 who would benefit from transplant if they are otherwise appropriate candidates. A measure of biological age could help us to identify appropriate older candidates who might have previously been excluded from transplant. On the other hand, there are other, potentially younger patients who may be less physiologically fit because of prior treatment or comorbid illness, for whom transplant carries increased risks.  UNC Lineberger researchers studied the impact of two different transplant types: autologous stem cell transplant, which uses a patient s own stem cells, and allogeneic stem-cell transplant, which uses a stem cells from a donor, on 63 patients treated at UNC Hospitals for myeloma, lymphoma or leukemia.   The researchers reported higher expression of mRNA coding for p16 in the T-cells of both patients who received allogeneic and autologous transplant, but patients receiving autologous transplant had a larger increase -- three times their pre-transplant levels. They also noted that autologous stem cell transplant, as measured by p16 mRNA expression, had the strongest impact on molecular aging of T-cells -- even greater than cytotoxic chemotherapy. A previous study had found that cytotoxic chemotherapy in breast cancer led to an approximately two-fold increase in p16 mRNA expression, equivalent to about 10 years of chronological aging. To try to explain why autologous stem cell transplant might age T-cells faster, they speculated that the forced regeneration of bone marrow that accompanies re-engraftment may contribute to stem cell aging. Chemotherapy prior to transplant may also contribute to increased p16 mRNA expression   so recipients of autologous transplant are in effect aged twice. While the researchers did not have data showing a clear connection between changes in p16 mRNA expression levels and the actual function of the T-cells, they did argue that expression of this marker is  arguably one of the best in vivo marker of cellular senescence and is directly associated with age-related deterioration.   Many oncologists would not be surprised by the finding that stem cell transplant accelerates aspects of aging,  said the study s senior author Norman Sharpless, MD, director of UNC Lineberger and the Wellcome Distinguished Professor in Cancer Research.  We know that years after a curative transplant, stem cell transplant survivors are at increased risk for blood problems that can occur with aging, such as reduced immunity, increased risk for bone marrow failure, and increased risk of blood cancers. What is important about this work, however, is that it allows us to quantify the effect of stem cell transplant on molecular age. ","Published: September 6, 2016"

The launch of this unique centre is set to boost the UK s world-leading science and technology infrastructure.  Oxfordshire s cutting-edge electron Physical Sciences Imaging Centre (ePSIC) is the result of collaboration between a research facility, academia and industry. Diamond Light Source, the UK s synchrotron, partnered with the University of Oxford and the global speciality chemicals company, Johnson Matthey to bring a unique set of tools to the centre. Funding for the construction of the new Diamond building housing ePSIC included contributions from the Wellcome Trust, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and a  2M contribution from the Science and Technology Facilities Council.  The internationally leading centre for UK science contains two state-of-the-art electron microscopes for the physical sciences, designed to provide scientists with atomic level images in a range of technologically important materials.  Robert MacLeod, Chief Executive of Johnson Matthey said:  We are excited to be part of this unique collaboration for UK science. R&D is at the heart of our future success and this new electron microscope will enable Johnson Matthey s scientists to actually  see  and analyse individual atoms in real time within the structure of our materials. This unrivalled capability in physical sciences is crucial for us in driving innovation in new and existing products for our customers.  This information can be used to develop enhanced  smart  materials for use in consumer technology, next-generation transportation and engineering. The advanced tools can not only give a way to visualise at atomic-resolution scales but could also help address some of the great technology and engineering challenges of our time.  Angus Kirkland, Professor of Materials at the University of Oxford and Science Director at ePSIC, said:  This centre will provide a world class capability for materials imaging and the collaboration with Johnson Matthey will bring technologically important problems into focus and answer fundamental research questions.  The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Professor Louise Richardson, said:  ePSIC is a powerful expression of what we can achieve when universities, research facilities and industry work in close partnership. Hosting these path-breaking technologies here in Oxfordshire will assist scientists with their pioneering research, helping them translate their ideas into breakthroughs which benefit us all.  ePSIC s two electron microscopes will provide top of the line resolution down to 0.5 Angstroms for research groups looking to determine the atomic structure and characteristics of materials. Advanced tools such as this are expensive so it is important that they become accessible in a centralised way and thereby provide tangible benefits to the wider science community. Academic scientists from around the world will be able to access the centre s tools following peer review. This will ensure that ePSIC is attracting the best science and supporting some of the most promising research projects in the field.  Prof Andrew Harrison, CEO at Diamond, explained:  Diamond is a world-leading centre for visualising physical and biological materials at the atomic and molecular level and it makes sense to complement our capabilities with electron microscopy. Information gained will give us microscopic properties and valuable insight into the electronic structure of materials, strength and much more. The centre will be opened to all and will operate like our beamlines, through both academic peer review and proprietary access. As a result, the Diamond synchrotron will become the first in the world to house such a complementary set of techniques.  Unveiling a plaque to commemorate the official opening; Sir John Meurig Thomas, formerly Director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain said; ""This unique facility brings together academia, industry and government research laboratories in a fantastically advanced manner and marks an exceptionally exciting period for British, European and World science.  It is highly appropriate that these new state of the art electron microscopes are located, not more than 17 miles away, from where in 1664 Robert Hook published his 'Micrographia', the first important work on microscopy (the study of minute objects by means of a microscope). He stated that it is the prerogative of all humans above all creatures to behold, consider, compare, alter, asses and improve on the works of nature. This is the recipe for going from pure to applied science. This facility will continue his work and give us many new and invaluable insights into the invisible world."" Accompanying the two microscopes for the physical sciences, the facility will also contain microscopes to support research in the life sciences. Known as eBIC (the electron Bio-Imaging Centre), this complementary centre will provide similar tools to ePSIC for cryo-electron microscopy research into biological matter, such as viruses and bacteria.  The microscopes will be housed alongside Diamond s I14 hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline which uses X-rays to probe similar materials. The close proximity of the three separate research endeavours   ePSIC, eBIC and I14   will promote a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to nanoscale research, promoting synergies and opportunities for collaboration between the different disciplines across academic and industrial users.  Angus Kirkland concluded:  The combination of electron microscopes for both the life and physical sciences together with the I14 hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline will provide a unique capability and the location at Diamond will provide the best possible environment to promote scientific interaction.

This is the conclusion of a doctoral thesis from Link ping University. Since heredity plays such a large role, it is important that ADHD is treated at an early stage, and that measures are taken to prevent individuals developing these disorders later in life.  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has received most attention in children, but 2.5-5% of the global adult population also has ADHD. Andrea Johansson Capusan, consultant in psychiatry, focuses in her thesis on binge eating and alcohol dependence in adults with ADHD symptoms. Both disorders are more common in adults with ADHD than in the general population. Andrea Johansson Capusan has investigated in particular how much of the correlation between the disorders can be explained by hereditary factors and how much by environmental factors. The Swedish Twin Registry has enabled her to compare identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, with fraternal twins, whose genetic makeups are no more similar to each other than any pair of siblings. Twin pairs grow up in the same environment, but are affected by individual environmental factors, such as diseases and their circles of friends. In twin studies, researchers investigate whether correlations are stronger in identical twins than in fraternal twins. This can help them to determine whether the correlation between different conditions can best be explained by a person s genetic background giving higher susceptibility to a condition, or whether environmental factors are significant. The four studies that are included in the thesis have examined more than 18,000 twin pairs aged between 20 and 46 years. The twins have completed questionnaires about the ADHD symptoms they have experienced, their consumption of alcohol and other substances, and binge eating behaviour.  We have shown for the first time that the correlation between ADHD symptoms and binge eating in women depends mainly on a common hereditary susceptibility for the two disorders. Much of the correlation between alcohol dependence and ADHD can also be explained by genetic factors. The remainder of the correlation is explained by environmental factors that are particular for the individual, which is interesting. It seems that having a common environment while growing up is not significant,  says Andrea Johansson Capusan. Since her research suggests that certain individuals inherit susceptibility for both ADHD symptoms and dependency disorders or binge eating, Andrea Johansson Capusan believes that these problems must be treated in parallel.  When treating adults who come with dependency disorder or substance-abuse behaviour, it's important to remember that ADHD is very common in these patients. And conversely it s important to treat ADHD early in order to prevent alcohol dependence and binge eating later in life,  says Andrea Johansson Capusan.","Published: September 6, 2016"

Driven by the fact that cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for about one third of all deaths and that biomarkers for assessing cardiovascular risk still have a limited applicability, there is much potential for research into new solutions. High levels of fibrinogen, a protein essential for the blood clotting process, have been identified as a potential risk factor for these diseases and it is this topic that the group has applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study.  Applying a NanoWizard  AFM system from JPK Instruments, the group has evaluated the interaction between fibrinogen and erythrocytes from patients with chronic heart failure, understanding how fibrinogen influences the aggregation of these cells. Dr Santos takes up the story to date:  We showed that the force required to break the bond between fibrinogen and erythrocyte is higher in patients with chronic heart failure than in healthy donors. Erythrocytes from these patients also showed changes in their elasticity and behavior while in the blood stream. Subsequently, during a one-year clinical follow-up, it was found that patients, where a higher force was initially required to release the binding between fibrinogen and erythrocytes, were more likely to be hospitalized due to cardiovascular complications in the following 12 months. We have been able to demonstrate a connection between nanotechnology and the identification of cardiovascular problems.  In this study, AFM-based methodology proved to be a promising nanotool to evaluate changes in the interaction between fibrinogen and human blood cells, pinpointing patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Fibrinogen-erythrocyte binding forces, measured at the single molecule level, are thus a potential biomarker for chronic heart failure severity and may eventually be used also for the clinical prognostic assessment of other cardiovascular diseases.  Describing why he chose the NanoWizard , Dr Santos continued:  Atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy using the NanoWizard  II from JPK instruments was our first choice to study the interaction between fibrinogen and red blood cells and evaluated the cell elasticity in chronic heart failure disease. This has provided us with a robust and user-friendly system for this research.  Lastly, the group has recently had a publication in Nature Nanotechnology.

Crohn s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease in which the intestines of some patients can become blocked by thickened and scarred connective tissue a condition known as fibrosis. When fibrosis occurs, surgical intervention is required to restore proper digestion. Repeated surgeries are not uncommon in Crohn s patients. In research outlined today in Science Immunology, scientists discovered a mutation that prevented mice from developing fibrosis after they were infected with a type of salmonella that mimics the symptoms of Crohn s. The mutation had switched off a hormone receptor responsible for stimulating part of the body s immune response.  We found what we think are the inflammatory cells that drive fibrosis,  said co-author Kelly McNagny, professor of medical genetics and co-director of the UBC Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).  The gene that was defective in those cells is a hormone receptor, and there are drugs available that may be able to block that hormone receptor in normal cells and prevent fibrotic disease.  What s more, McNagny and his colleagues are hopeful that their discovery could be applied to other types of tissue that experience fibrosis.  Fibrosis is a response to chronic inflammation, but it is also a process that occurs during normal aging. If you can reverse this, you ve essentially found a way to promote regeneration rather than degeneration,  said lead author Bernard Lo, a PhD candidate at BRC. Liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, scarring from heart attacks and muscle degeneration all result in tissue fibrosis, noted McNagny.  We think that we can potentially block complications of all these age-related fibrotic diseases by dampening these particular inflammatory cell types,  he said. The next step for McNagny s lab will be to test drugs to find out whether they can stop or reverse fibrosis in mice.","Published: September 5, 2016"

The researchers engineered neural stem cells, which can develop into any type of brain cell, to carry mutations thought to drive this particular subtype of medulloblastoma. When implanted into mice, the engineered cells successfully replicated how medulloblastoma develops and spreads in patients. Using a computer algorithm, the researchers then matched the engineered cells  genetic profile with a drug sensitivity database representing hundreds of cancer cell lines and identified a class of drugs that would likely have anticancer activity in similar tumors. One of these drugs, palbociclib (Ibrance ), proved to extend survival in mice implanted with medulloblastoma cells. Creating a Cancer Cell More than 60% of children with medulloblastoma can be cured. But medulloblastoma is not a single disease. Researchers have identified four subtypes of the cancer, defined by the genetic mutations they carry, that respond differently to treatment. One of these subtypes, Group 3 medulloblastoma, has a very poor prognosis. Even with intensive treatment, few children with this subtype survive more than a few years after diagnosis. Treatments that target the genetic mutations driving Group 3 medulloblastoma are urgently needed for this group of patients, said Eric Raabe, M.D., Ph.D., a pediatric oncologist and lead author of the study. But to identify potentially effective drugs, he and his colleagues wrote, genetically accurate laboratory models of Group 3 medulloblastoma are needed to test those drugs. Existing models all have limitations. For example, cells from many patients  tumors cannot be grown in the laboratory. For those that can be grown in culture, laboratory conditions can select for genetic changes that, over time, can make the cultured cells too different from the original tumor to be useful as models. And human tumors grown in animals can be so genetically complex that it can be difficult to tell which mutations are actually responsible for tumor growth. To circumvent these shortcomings, Dr. Raabe and his colleagues engineered human neural stem cells to create a new model of medulloblastoma. They altered a set of genes that previous studies suggested help drive Group 3 tumors MYC, TP53, hTERT, and AKT by using genetically engineered viruses to replace copies of the normal genes with mutated copies. When they injected the engineered stem cells into the brains of mice, the cells formed aggressive tumors, which continued to express the mutated genes. About 20% of these tumors spread to the spine, similar to the pattern of metastasis seen in some Group 3 tumors. DiSCoVERing Drugs Dr. Raabe s team also developed a computer-based method to identify drugs that might be effective against medulloblastoma, called Disease-model Signature vs. Compound-Variety Enriched Response (DiSCoVER). The DiSCoVER tool compared the gene expression profile (or  molecular signature ) of the engineered medulloblastoma cells with the profiles of all the cancer cell lines in a large database. Because the cell lines in the database had been treated with a wide range of drugs,  we could figure out which cell lines were most closely related to our neural stem-cell model of medulloblastoma, and then use that information to predict which drugs might also be active in this model,  explained Dr. Raabe. DiSCoVER predicted that a class of drugs called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors would be effective against the engineered medulloblastoma cells. The researchers tested one such CDK inhibitor palbociclib, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in mice bearing tumors derived from their engineered stem cells. Treatment with the drug extended median survival of the mice by almost 50%, from 25 to 37 days. Analysis of tumor samples taken from the mice showed that the drug had crossed the blood-brain barrier, penetrated the tumor, and inhibited tumor cell growth. More than Just Medulloblastoma Based on this study, and others awaiting publication, the Children s Oncology GroupExit Disclaimer is exploring the possibility of including a CDK inhibitor in a clinical trial currently being planned for patients with relapsed medulloblastoma, said Dr. Raabe. He and his colleagues are now using their methods to engineer a model of another medulloblastoma subtype.  We ve used pediatric cancer as a model because we re pediatric oncologists, but we think this could be done with other cancer types as well,  he said.  When testing therapies on patients with rare tumors, it becomes increasingly important to prioritize which therapies go into clinical trials, due to the limited patient population,  said Karlyne Reilly, Ph.D., head of the Genetic Modifiers of Tumorigenesis Section in NCI's Center for Cancer Research, who was not involved in the study.  The approach taken by Dr. Raabe and his colleagues has the potential to accelerate candidate therapy identification for many rare tumors and subtypes of more common tumors, particularly as the increased use of genomic characterization of tumors identifies genetic drivers that can be used to help design models for drug testing,  she concluded.","Published: September 5, 2016"

Scientists have identified 11,000 genes that occur in the human genome in variants that can cause disease. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl n and the Harvard Medical School have studied why such high-risk genes persist in the human genome instead of being eliminated by selection. Their analyses suggest that the continuous adaptation to new pathogens in the course of evolution has increased the diversity of our immune genes but also comes at a price. According to the researchers, such diversity also extends to neighbouring DNA segments, where it results in the persistence of harmful gene variants. Diversity in the genome is a good thing: it has allowed us humans to adjust to changing environmental conditions during the course of evolution. Such genetic variety generates diverse combinations with each new generation and can bring with it survival advantages. Besides the many variants that have no effect or even a beneficial effect on health, there are others that make their carriers susceptible to certain diseases. These harmful gene variants represent a survival disadvantage and should therefore have been weeded out by natural section in the course of evolution. Instead, some high-risk gene variants, such as those for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, have persisted in the population for a long time without disappearing. A group of researchers led by Tobias Lenz and Shamil Sunyaev has studied this phenomenon and found evidence that the occurrence of harmful gene variants could be the price we pay for the genetic diversity that is otherwise highly beneficial to our survival. They analyzed a group of immune system proteins that help detect foreign molecules. The genes for these proteins contain many variable sites and occur in a number of alternative forms in the population. This diversity ensures that our immune system is able to recognize a broad range of pathogens. A special form of selection preserves this variation within the group of immune proteins: scientists describe it as balancing selection. It arises, for example, when several alternative variants of a gene confer a survival advantage, and are therefore not eliminated by selection. Harmful mutations don't get lost The scientists suspect that balancing selection may sometimes also lead to the conservation of harmful gene variants. They ran computer simulations of different types of selection using the example of immune system genes. During these tests they discovered that balancing selection not only increases the diversity of immune proteins but also affects neighbouring DNA segments. There, while reducing the total number of variable sites, it increases the frequency with which these variants occur in the population   even if they are harmful. They then compared the simulation results with data from a genetic analysis of 6,500 people. And the analysis confirmed their suspicions: As in the simulation, fewer variable sites occurred in the immediate vicinity of the immune system genes; however, the remaining variants, including harmful mutations, were relatively more common in the population. Harmful genes are therefore able to evade natural selection.  I did expect that higher resistance to pathogens might lead to an accumulation of some harmful mutations. But the extent to which such mutations persist in the population really surprised me. It would be interesting to know how many genetic diseases in humans can be traced back to contact with pathogens we have encountered in the course of our evolution,  says Tobias Lenz, group leader at the Max Planck Institute in Pl n and member of the newly founded Kiel Evolution Center. In the next step, the researchers want to examine whether balancing selection at other sites in the genome are responsible for the fact that harmful gene variants occur so frequently in the population.","Published: September 5, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-sheds-new-light-on-autism-genetics-210677,Study Sheds New Light on Autism Genetics Scientists find new autism linked gene  and discover that autistic siblings don t always have the same disease related mutations  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new study led by UCLA scientists shows that in families with multiple children on the autism spectrum, the pattern of genetic factors is different from that seen in families with just one affected child. The study focused on genetic changes known as copy-number variations (CNVs), which are losses or gains of normal DNA. Previous research has linked non-inherited CNVs, which originate as defects in the sperm or egg cell from which the affected child is conceived, to autism spectrum disorder in children whose siblings are not affected. The research findings included the discovery of more than a dozen promising new candidates for genes linked to the risk of autism spectrum disorders, highlighting the complexity of genetic factors in the disorders. The findings provide a better picture of how genetic variation contributes to autism disorders, and could perhaps point to a possible new target for future therapies. The study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics. The researchers found that, among children with an autism spectrum disorder who have siblings with autism disorders, inherited copy-number variations had a stronger influence than non-inherited CNVs. This was expected, but had previously not been demonstrated. Although the researchers expected inherited factors to appear to play a greater role in families in which more than one child has an autism spectrum disorder, they were surprised by another observation in these families: When an affected child has an inherited genetic variation that is known to be an autism spectrum disorder risk factor, it is seldom the case that all his affected siblings have that same variation.  It s actually the exception rather than the rule,  said principal investigator Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  So for example, there are families in which only two of three kids have the rare CNV inherited from the parent, yet they all have been diagnosed with an autism disorder. One might have expected all three to inherit this major risk factor.  The study arose from a long-running project by Geschwind and collaborators to gather DNA and clinical data on families with more than one child with autism spectrum disorder. These are known as  multiplex families.  Most autism genetics studies have focused on families with just one affected child, known as  simplex families,  because researchers predicted that certain types of disease-related DNA changes were in principle easier to detect in such families. The relative exclusion of multiplex families, which account for about 11 percent of families with children who have an autism spectrum disorder, may have distorted the picture of how DNA changes contribute to autism disorders. Most obviously, cases of autism spectrum disorder diagnosed in siblings, which appear to run in the family, would be expected to result more from heritable genetic variations than non-inherited CNVs. Heritability is the extent to which genetic differences contribute to observed physical differences. One possible explanation for the finding that autistic siblings in a family usually do not all have the same disease-linked genetic variation, Geschwind said, is that lightning has indeed struck twice   in the form of an unlucky non-inherited mutation that accounts for an autism spectrum disorder in a child who lacks inherited risk factors found in siblings. Another possibility is that the autism spectrum disorder arises in the siblings mostly from other, harder-to-find factors, for example common or rare inherited variation in many genes, so that the presence or absence of a large, inherited copy-number variation influences only the severity of the disorder. The analysis is based on the final collection of data on 1,532 ASD families, which is known as the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange. About 80 percent of the families in the database are multiplex.  This is the largest study of its kind in families with multiple autism spectrum disorder children, and it shows that looking at such families can provide significant new insights,  said Geschwind, who is also a professor of neurology and psychiatry. Of the potential new autism spectrum disorder risk genes discovered by the researchers, one of them, NR4A2, is linked to some rare cases of autism disorder with delays in language ability. The language connection, Geschwind said, fits with a previous finding from his laboratory that NR4A2 is expressed in the human brain in areas involved in language development, specifically the temporal lobe. Geschwind emphasized that the complex genetic underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder in multiplex families need to be better characterized with larger studies of these families.  There are a lot of multiplex families out there waiting to be studied, but unfortunately it seems there is no effort now to study these families on a larger scale,  Geschwind said.","Published: September 5, 2016"

The discovery, published online in Genes & Development, clarifies the role of this basic feature of cell biology and adds to the scientific understanding of the different steps in heterochromatin formation. Disruption of these steps is associated with numerous diseases, including many cancers. Dissecting the mechanisms that cells use to build heterochromatin will help scientists therapeutically target the affected steps in these diseases, such as how disease-causing transposons can become active in cells.  The repression of transposon mobilization is necessary to maintain genome stability, and we now think this repression may be the major developmental function of heterochromatin, rather than a role in controlling gene expression and cell proliferation,  said Robert Duronio, PhD, professor of biology and genetics and senior author of the study.  This finding was very much unexpected.  Chromatin, essentially, is the spooled structure DNA takes when packaged inside cells. The two broad forms of chromatin are euchromatin, a loose structure normally considered permissive for gene activity and the encoding of proteins; and heterochromatin, a tighter, denser packaging of DNA thought principally to suppress gene activity. The tightest and most stable form of heterochromatin, known as constitutive heterochromatin, is found mostly at the constricted region of chromosomes, which is the region important for chromosome movement during cell division.  Although various functions have been attributed to heterochromatin, these functions have not been easy to confirm with definitive experiments. The standard experimental approach has been to observe what happens when heterochromatin formation is blocked, but the process that triggers the formation of heterochromatin is hard to block precisely. The current model holds that heterochromatin forms when a protein called histone H3 is chemically modified   or methylated   at a key site. In principle, replacing normal histone H3 genes with mutant versions that can t be methylated at the key site would block heterochromatin formation and be an important test of the current model. In practice, however, it is virtually impossible to do this experiment in higher animals such as lab mice.  Mice, as well as humans, have three different clusters of histone genes on different chromosomes, and so creating genetic manipulations at those different spots is very difficult, especially because there are other essential genes within those histone gene clusters,  said Taylor J. R. Penke, a graduate student in the Duronio Lab who was first author of the study. Fortunately, another standard lab animal, the Drosophila fruit fly, has a more targetable set of histone genes.  The histone H3 genes we wanted to change are clustered in one location in the genome of a fruit fly, without other essential genes in the cluster, so they can all be removed at once and replaced with mutant histone H3 genes,  said Penke. For the new study, Penke, Duronio, and their colleagues used an advanced Drosophila genetics platform they developed last year to replace these histone H3 genes with mutant versions that don t permit the methylation that triggers heterochromatin formation. The first surprise was that the Drosophila mutants did not all die before adulthood; about two percent survived. Among the surviving flies, there was a sharp drop in signs of heterochromatin in their chromosomes, especially where the histone H3 methylated proteins are normally concentrated. Moreover, despite the long-held assumption that heterochromatin regulates gene activity, the UNC scientists found that gene expression in the mutants was mostly unchanged, even in the regions where the tight heterochromatin packaging of DNA had been relaxed. There was one big change in the mutants, however. The regions of their chromosomes that would normally be strongly heterochromatic showed a jump in the activity of transposons. These DNA elements   whose evolutionary origins are murky but make up large fractions of plant and animal genomes   have a virus-like tendency to make copies of themselves by snipping themselves out of their original locations and re-inserting themselves elsewhere in the genome. Along with an increase in transposon activity, the team found signs that a key anti-transposon defense mechanism had been activated. That is, levels of piRNA transcripts   the precursors to small RNA molecules that bind to transposons to block their activity   were sharply increased. Although transposons are thought to benefit their hosts in certain circumstances, they clearly can cause harm. Duronio, Penke, and colleagues suspect that the 98 percent mortality among their Drosophila mutants and the high death rate thereafter among surviving flies were due largely to the effects of transposons inserting themselves in the genome and disrupting key genes.  It seems that the major role for the methylation of histone H3 that triggers this type of heterochromatin is to keep transposons from jumping around and screwing up the genome,  Duronio said. Human histone H3 genes are quite similar to those in Drosophila, suggesting that their function has largely been conserved despite the evolutionary gulf between flies and humans. This suggests that Drosophila is a good model for the study of human histone function. Understanding better how the genome normally defends itself from transposons should help scientists get a better handle on transposon-related diseases. Transposons can directly trigger cancerous changes in a cell, for example, by disrupting a tumor-suppressor gene or by causing a DNA break that destabilizes a large section of the chromosome. Cases of many other diseases, including hemophilia, have been linked to transposons  disruption of important genes.  During embryonic and fetal development, there is normally a high-fidelity replication of the genome, and that is a significant mechanism for repressing cancer and other diseases. With studies like these, we re understanding how heterochromatin does its job in that respect,  said Duronio, who is also associate dean for research at the UNC School of Medicine. His lab plans to follow up with further studies of Drosophila histone genes, in particular a set of slightly different histone H3-family genes that exist apart from the main cluster and appear to have a role outside constitutive heterochromatin.","Published: September 5, 2016"

The discovery can help in the search for a broader vaccine able to protect against all types of pneumococci. The bacterium S. pneumoniae or the pneumococcus exists naturally in the noses of children and adults, but is also one of the most common causes of infectious diseases in the world, with meningitis and pneumonia being amongst the most severe. Pneumococci cause more severe infections in humans than in other mammals, something that has hitherto remained a mystery. Nasal mucus contains a special sugar molecule   sialic acid   which pneumococci use as a source of energy for its growth and survival. With the help of an enzyme this acid is released by the bacteria and taken up into the bacterial cells for conversion to energy. In this present study, the researchers show that the sialic acid found in humans make pneumococci able to both grow better and become more resistant to the immune defence than the variant commonly found in other mammals. A broader vaccine in sight Using mice with a mutation that causes them to produce the human form of the sugar, the researchers found that these mice were more prone to acquire a severe pneumococcal infection than the controls.  We found that the human variant of the sugar molecule caused the bacteria to produce more of the enzyme that releases the sugar that pneumococci need as a source of energy,  says principal investigator Professor Birgitta Henriques-Normark at the Department of Microbiology, Tumour and Cell Biology.  This can enhance the growth of pneumococci in the human mucosa. Moreover, the increased uptake of sialic acid by the bacteria triggers their production of a protein [htrA] that counters the oxidative stress that the body s immune system uses to fight the infection.  The finding gives the researchers a clearer idea of how and why pneumococci can cause such severe infections in humans. This knowledge makes scientists better placed to develop more effective vaccines able to protect against all types of pathogenic pneumococci in humans, something current vaccines cannot do.","Published: September 5, 2016"

""Our study shows that genetic polymorphisms, structural location of mutation and effect for phenotype correlate with each other in the human population. This implies that metabolic individuality and susceptibility for diseases are possibly resulted from the moderate variants and much more deleterious, but rare, variants."" In their analyses, researchers found the following results:   The relationship between structural variants of enzymes and metabolic phenotypes in the human population was surveyed in the association study of metabolite concentrations with whole genome sequence analysis data.   Five associations between metabolites and gene variants were identified. Four of the gene variants are known to be related to metabolic diseases. The residues substituted by these variants are located in peripheral regions of the catalytic sites or related regulatory domains of enzymes.   Two people have larger changes of metabolite levels of phenylalanine. They had rare gene variants, which substitute residues located near the catalytic site.   These data demonstrate that variant frequency, structural location and effect for phenotype correlate with each other in the human population. ToMMo will study environmental and genetic influence on individual differences of proteomics and metabolomics. ToMMo aims to discover useful biomarkers for disease prevention and early diagnosis through the identification and quantification of metabolites in blood. Such studies can contribute to the advancement of personalized prevention and treatment of diseases, as well as the identification of disease mechanisms and development of new therapeutics.

A new study published in the journal Environmental Research now shows that pregnant women s exposure to a particular endocrine-disrupting chemical called diethylhexyl pthalate (DEHP) is directly linked to abnormalities in newborn boys  reproductive organs. Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a pediatric environmental health researcher at Seattle Children s Research Institute who led the study, sat down with On the Pulse to answer some questions about the findings. Q: What did this study show about how phthalates can influence genital development in newborn boys? This study showed a clear connection between a pregnant woman s exposure to the endocrine-disrupting chemical DEHP and subsequent anomalies in a baby boy s reproductive organs. We discovered this association by collecting urine samples from pregnant women and testing them for phthalates and doing physical exams of newborns. While doctors and researchers have known that endocrine-disrupting chemicals interfere with hormones, it s been difficult to prove clear health outcomes. Now, for the first time, we ve shown that the higher the DEHP concentration in a mother s urine, the more likely her boy would be born with of a genital anomaly. Q: What complications did you identify in newborn boys? The most common abnormality we found was hydrocele, a condition in which fluid builds up in the sac inside a boy s scrotum. A newborn boy was more than twice as likely to develop this condition if his mother had high concentrations of DEHP in her urine. While hydrocele is rarely a problem for boys who have it, this is significant because it is the first time that we have been able to show that exposure to an endocrine-disrupting chemical can result in changes to the reproductive system. Q: Were there any findings about baby girls? For this study we focused on newborn baby boys because the genital anomalies are easier to identify and record. More research is needed to understand how endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be impacting fetal development of females. Q: Should pregnant women avoid exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals? Yes. Pregnant women and families can take easy, common sense steps to reduce exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. These chemicals, called phthalates, are most commonly found in plastics, personal care products like shampoos, makeup and perfumes, and in the U.S. food supply from things like jars, packaging, and other storage. Tips to avoid endocrine-disrupting chemicals   Buy low-fat dairy products like skim milk and low fat cheeses instead of high fat dairy products like cream and whole milk.   Buy fresh or frozen fruits whenever possible, and avoid canned and processed foods.   Look for items that are labeled phthalate or BPA-free.   Minimize personal care products, and focus on simple products with clear ingredients.   Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic or wood to hold and store foods instead of plastics, and do not microwave food in plastic.   Do not heat a baby s milk or food in plastics or put hot liquids in plastic products such as sippy cups.   Check plastic symbols and avoid plastics known to contain these chemicals including numbers 3 (PVC and vinyl), 6 (polystyrene foam) and 7 (other, can contain BPA).   Encourage frequent handwashing.

See Also: Study provides more evidence that sleep apnea is hurting the brain Dr. William Abraham, co-lead author and director of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, presented findings from the study at the recent European Society of Cardiology Congress in Rome (August 27-31, 2016). The study is published in The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep. ""CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,"" Abraham said. ""Currently, we don't have good treatments available. Positive airway pressure devices have been used, but many patients don't tolerate them well and a recent study showed them to be harmful."" Abraham, along with lead author Dr. Maria Rosa Costanzo at Advocate Heart Institute in Naperville, Illinois, led the study at 31 hospitals in the United States, Germany and Poland. The research team tested the safety and effectiveness of a transvenous phrenic nerve stimulator made by Respicardia Inc. Much like a pacemaker, it sends a regular signal telling the diaphragm to breathe during sleep. In the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Ten were excluded due to non-study related medical issues or deaths, exiting the study or missing visits. During the first six months of evaluation, 68 devices were activated for treatment, while 73 were left inactive as the control group. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment. Leslie McGuire was one of the first patients in the U.S. To have a device implanted in his chest to help with sleep apnea. After having a device implanted in his chest to help control his central sleep apnea, at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Leslie McGuire (left) says he now sleeps through the night and has more energy during the day to spend time with his wife. Credit: Ohio State University  At the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device. Learn More: Brain damage caused by severe sleep apnea is reversible ""Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,"" Abraham said. ""This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.""

New results from Uppsala University show that such cells are not always what they are assumed to be. Using genetic analyses, the researchers showed that a commonly used cell line which was established in Uppsala almost fifty years ago does not originate from the patient it is claimed to stem from. The findings are published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine. A cell line consists of cultured cells that often originate from a tumour. In contrast to other cultured cells, such tumour cells can divide indefinitely and a cell line can therefore be cultured for many years. It is also easy to study, simple to handle and results can be obtained with high reproducibility. Cell lines are therefore indispensable in medical research and a large number of cell lines exist that originate from many different tumour types.  Researchers studying the brain tumour type glioma often use a cell line called U87MG that was established at Uppsala University almost fifty years ago. It is presently publicly available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), where researchers can order it to use it in their studies. Bengt Westermark is senior professor at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, which is the present name for the department where U87MG was established. His research group has often used the original U87MG line and their experience led them to question the authenticity of the ATCC cell line. Marie Allen, an expert in DNA fingerprinting, works at the same department. DNA fingerprinting is an important tool for determining genetic identity, for instance in crime scene investigations.   Marie and her colleagues helped us genetically compare the cell lines with each other. We found that the U87MG cell line from ATCC had a different DNA profile than the original cell line in Uppsala , says Bengt Westermark. When the cell line was established in the 1960s, material from the original tumour was saved as thin sections on microscope slides. Using a very sensitive DNA analysis technique that can also be employed when only very small amounts of DNA from old tissue are available, the researchers could compare the two current cell lines with the tumour from which the cell line was established.  The comparison showed that the Uppsala cell line was genetically identical with the original tumour whereas the U87MG cell line from ATCC had a different, unknown origin. We don t know at which point during the fifty years of culturing the mix-up occurred but we have been able to show that the ATCC U87MG line is most likely from a human glioma tumour , says Bengt Westermark. Many scientific journals require researchers who report results based on cell line experiments to use DNA profiling to establish the identity of the used cells. The new findings show that proper identification of a cell line also requires that the DNA profile matches the tissue of origin. This is essential if one wants to claim that the cells, and thereby the research results, are true representatives of the original tumour.","Published: September 2, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/absolute-quantification-of-mitochondrial-metabolites-184844,Absolute Quantification of Mitochondrial Metabolites Scientists have developed a method to quickly isolate and systematically measure metabolite concentrations within mitochondria  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Whitehead Institute scientists have developed a method to quickly isolate and systematically measure metabolite concentrations within the cellular organelles known as mitochondria, often referred to as the  powerhouses of the cell.  Prior attempts at such measurements have yielded unreliable results, either by taking too long to isolate mitochondria or by contaminating mitochondrial metabolites with contents from other cellular components.  The advantage of this new method is that it offers a combination of both increased speed and specificity,  say Whitehead Member David Sabatini, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a professor of biology at MIT.  We are quite excited about applying this workflow in vivo and to other organelles such as lysosomes."" Through precisely controlled chemical reactions, the mitochondria produce energy in the form of ATP and play a critical role in cellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is found in several disorders, including Parkinson s disease, cardiovascular disease, and mitochondrial diseases. Until now, peering into the inner metabolic workings of these vital organelles has been challenging at worst and inaccurate at best. One conventional method of profiling mitochondrial metabolites involves purifying mitochondria using several rounds of centrifugation, a process that can take more than an hour to complete. According to Walter Chen, a graduate student in Whitehead Member David Sabatini s lab, time is a significant issue when studying metabolites.  Even if you keep your sample at 4 degrees or 0 degrees Celsius to slow down any reactions, you re still gradually getting distortion of the mitochondrial metabolite profile because the enzymes are still going and so are the transporters,  says Chen, who is also a third-year medical student at Massachusetts General Hospital.  As time goes on, the mitochondria are getting less happy outside the cell.  The other commonly used method for profiling mitochondrial metabolites relies on abbreviated forms of centrifugation to isolate mitochondria. Although faster, this protocol also brings down non-mitochondrial material and other organelles, thereby distorting the true mitochondrial signal with metabolites from extra-mitochondrial sources. To reduce the time needed to isolate mitochondria and increase the accuracy of the metabolite analysis, Chen took a completely different tack  rapid immunopurification. He coated the exterior of mitochondria with epitope tags and added tiny beads covered in antibodies specific for the tags. By locking onto the tags, the antibodies link the mitochondria to the beads, allowing Chen to isolate the mitochondria easily, break them open, and stop all enzymatic activity within 10 minutes. According to his analysis, this quicker method yields results that better reflect the actual mitochondrial metabolite levels found within a living cell. Chen s work is described in the journal Cell.  From the data we have so far, profiling mitochondria with this method definitely gives you greater resolution than what you would obtain using traditional methods to profile whole cells,  says Chen, who is a co-author of the Cell paper.  On the in vivo front, I think this is going to be quite powerful, and that s what I m most excited about. But I can already see that this can lead people in new and interesting directions.  Chen says the method is potentially very versatile and could be adapted to analyze the metabolite contents of other organelles and to compare mitochondria in cells affected by mitochondrial dysfunction such as neurons damaged by Parkinson s disease with normal cells or other cell types seemingly unaffected by disease.","Published: September 2, 2016"

The transaction has received unanimous approval by the Board of Directors of both companies and values Cynapsus at approximately US$ 624 million (or approximately CAN$ 820 million). The acquisition will be funded with cash on hand. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 (third quarter of Sunovion s fiscal year). This agreement reflects Sunovion s global strategy to expand and diversify its portfolio in key therapeutic areas, including neurology.  Through this transaction, Sunovion would acquire Cynapsus   product candidate, APL-130277, which is designed to be a fast-acting, easy-to-use, on-demand treatment option for managing OFF episodes associated with Parkinson s disease (PD).   Parkinson s disease is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects more than four million people around the world, and there is a significant need for new options to treat the OFF episodes associated with it,  said Nobuhiko Tamura, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sunovion.  We believe that APL-130277 is a novel late-stage candidate with the potential to make a real difference for patients and their families.   The acquisition of Cynapsus is well-aligned with Sunovion s focus on the innovative application of science and medicine to help people with serious medical conditions and complements our robust product pipeline,  added Mr. Tamura.  We have high regard for the Cynapsus team and their work with the APL-130277 program.   With its leadership in therapies for central nervous system disorders and commercial experience specific to neurology, we believe Sunovion is best suited to advance APL-130277 in the United States and other key markets,  said Anthony J. Giovinazzo, President and CEO, Cynapsus.  This transaction culminates years of dedicated work by the Cynapsus team and represents significant value creation for our security holders.  The board of directors of Cynapsus, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors and based, in part, upon the unanimous recommendation of an independent special committee of the board of directors, has determined that the arrangement is in the best interest of Cynapsus and the consideration to be received by shareholders of Cynapsus is fair to such shareholders. The board of directors unanimously recommends that Cynapsus shareholders and warrantholders vote in favour of the transaction at a special meeting expected to be held on or about October 13, 2016.  The proposed sale of Cynapsus follows a full consideration of alternatives aimed at optimizing shareholder value for the company.  We believe that the proposed transaction with Sunovion results in the best outcome for our shareholders,  said Rochelle Stenzler, chair of the board of Cynapsus.  The transaction with Sunovion represents a significant premium to the current share price and we are recommending that our shareholders and warrantholders vote in favour of the transaction.  Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, upon closing of the proposed transaction, shareholders of Cynapsus will receive US$40.50 per common share in cash, and holders of warrants and stock options will receive a cash payment equal to the difference between US$40.50 and the exercise price of such warrant or stock option. The offer of US$40.50 per common share in cash represents a premium of 123 percent based on the volume weighted average closing price of Cynapsus  common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market for the last twenty trading days. The companies expect to close the transaction following required securityholder, court and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.  The transaction will be completed by way of a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The arrangement will require approval of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Cynapsus shareholders and warrantholders voting together as a single class at a special meeting of such securityholders of Cynapsus. Voting and Support Agreements in support of the transaction have been signed by all directors and officers of Cynapsus and the company s largest shareholder representing in the aggregate, approximately 18.33 percent of the Cynapsus securities entitled to vote to approve the transaction.

Researchers at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center report that as developing blood cells are triggered by a multitude of genetic signals firing on and off, they are pulled back and forth in fluctuating multi-lineage states before finally becoming specific cell types. Although the scientists still don t understand exactly what decides the cells eventual fate, their work suggests that competing gene networks induce dynamic instability, resulting in mixed-lineage states that are necessary to prime newly forming cells for that decision. It is somewhat chaotic but from that chaos results order. It s a basic finding that helps us address a fundamental question of developmental biology   what are the nature of the intermediate states and the networks of regulatory genes that underlie cell-type specification,  said Harinder Singh, PhD, study co-author and Director of Immunobiology and the Center for Systems Immunology at Cincinnati Children s. Although the findings require extensive additional study to better understand the back-and-forth nature of this genetic process, the research may eventually provide new insights into developmental miscues that cause disease, according to H. Leighton Grimes, PhD, study co-author and Investigator in the Divisions of Immunobiology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology at Cincinnati Children s.  How do blood cells know to become neutrophils or monocytes?  Grimes asked.  Two thirds of your bone marrow is taken up with this activity and the number of cells has to be exquisitely balanced. Too many or too few of either can kill you.  In the current study the research team looked specifically at the formation of neutrophil and monocyte (macrophage) blood cells   critical components of the immune system. The researchers studied mouse cells as they developed in a natural state using a new and rapidly expanding technology called single-cell RNA sequencing   which identifies the genetic expression programs of individual cells and their presumptive regulators.  Big Data Biology  The authors blended laboratory biology with a new bioinformatics computer program (ICGS) developed at Cincinnati Children s with study co-author Nathan Salomonis, PhD, Division of Biomedical Informatics. ICGS (Iterative Clustering and Guide-Gene Selection) gives researchers a comprehensive view of the overwhelming amount of data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing. ICGS takes the additional step of giving researchers an intuitive platform that can process and analyze all of the sequencing and biological data to identify the various transitioning or shifting genomic and cellular states of cells   in this instance developing blood cells.  Dynamic Instability Prior to the current study it already had been proposed that neutrophil and macrophage blood cells result from a bi-stable gene regulatory network (one that can manifest either of two stable states). But the different cellular transition states and underlying molecular dynamics of development have remained unknown. Repeatedly working back and forth between laboratory biology and computational analysis, authors of the current paper say their analysis of developing blood cells captured a prevalent mixed-lineage intermediate. These intermediates expressed a combination of genes including those typical of stem cells that can give rise to all blood cell types as well as some genes that are specific for red blood cells, platelets, macrophages and neutrophils. This seemed to reflect competing genetic programs. The research team also found the developing cells moving through a rare state where they encountered turbulence termed  dynamic instability.  This was seen to be caused by two counteracting myeloid gene regulatory networks. Two key components of the counteracting gene networks were Irf8 and Gfi1, genes that are involved in blood cell formation. Both genes encode transcription factors, which mean that their protein product controls what genetic information is used in the formation of a cell. When Irf8 and Gfi1 were eliminated from the picture, researchers showed that the rare cells could be trapped in an intermediate state. As they continue their research, the authors want a clearer understanding of what finally causes cells in intermediate states of dynamic instability to assume specific fates. They suggest that the influence of two simultaneous and counteracting gene networks generates internal oscillations that are eventually stabilized by unknown mechanisms to generate one of two different cell fates.","Published: September 2, 2016"

The projects are part of the National Eye Institute (NEI) Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a targeted effort to restore vision by regenerating neurons and their connections in the eye and visual system. These projects will receive a total of $12.4 million over three years, pending availability of funds.  Understanding factors that mediate the regeneration of neurons and the growth of axons is crucial for the development of breakthrough therapies for blinding diseases. What we learn through these projects will have a health impact beyond vision,  said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of NEI, part of NIH. Most irreversible blindness results from the loss of neurons in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. Many common eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, put these cells at risk. Once these neurons are gone, humans have little if any capacity to replace them. These six projects will add to the knowledge base from several recent key advances. Researchers recently reported a technique that increases the regenerative capacity of retinal axons in a mouse model of optic nerve injury, a model commonly used to study glaucoma and other optic neuropathies. Progress also has been made in identifying factors that either stimulate or inhibit regeneration of neurons required for vision. The newly-funded projects will further this area of research by identifying cues that guide axons to appropriate targets in the brain, allowing functional connections to re-establish between the eye and the visual processing system. The six projects include: Molecular discovery for optic nerve regeneration (EY027261-01) Principal investigators: Jeffrey L. Goldberg, M.D., Ph.D., Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D., Stanford University, Palo Alto, California; Larry Benowitz, Ph.D., Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Hollis Cline, Ph.D., Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California  Goldberg and colleagues have demonstrated through a series of interventions in mice with optic nerve injury that they can successfully regenerate retinal ganglion cells axons, which form the optic nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. In this next research phase they hope to identify genes and proteins that help or hinder this ability of retinal ganglion cells to regenerate, grow axons to a target and become functional in mice. Promising molecular candidates will be investigated in longer-term animal studies designed to assess changes in the animals  vision. Screening for molecules that promote photoreceptor synaptogenesis (EY027266-01) Principal investigators: Donald J. Zack, M.D., Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore; David Gamm, M.D., Ph.D., University of Wisconsin, Madison Zack, Gamm, and their teams plan to study precursor photoreceptor cells derived from human stem cells to determine what factors help coax them into becoming fully developed and connected photoreceptor cells. They expect their studies to identify a list of small molecules and candidate genes that contribute to the ability of photoreceptor cells to home in on their appropriate target cells in the retina, known as bipolar cells. In a healthy eye, bipolar cells receive signals from photoreceptor cells across a synapse and then transmit this information either directly or indirectly to retinal ganglion cells. Generating appropriate synapses between photoreceptor and bipolar cells is an essential step in restoring vision through photoreceptor transplantation. Evaluation of novel targets for retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration (EY027256-01) Principal investigator: Stephen M. Strittmatter, M.D., Ph.D., Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut Strittmatter and his team also are searching for genes that contribute to the regeneration of axons from retinal ganglion cells. Starting with 450 candidate genes, culled from more than 17,000, they will test each candidate in a mouse optic nerve injury model, to see if any act as mediators of regeneration. Positive genes will then be validated by looking to see if they are also active in the C. elegans worm, an indication that a gene s function is preserved across species. The strongest gene candidates will then be analyzed in greater detail to better understand their molecular action. Novel activators of regeneration in Muller glia (EY027265-01) Principal investigators: Edward M. Levine, Ph.D.; James G. Patton, Ph.D.; David J. Calkins, Ph.D. Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee Levine and his colleagues are investigating exogenous and endogenous factors   that is, factors with an external or internal origin   that contribute to the successful reprogramming of supportive cells in the retina called Muller glia. In zebrafish, Muller glia can give rise to photoreceptor cells after injury to the retina. First, the investigators plan to test a novel combination of pharmacological agents and genetic manipulation for the ability to reprogram Muller glia in mice. If the therapy is successful, they will then study the conditions that support regeneration by determining which genes are turned on or off in regenerating zebrafish and mouse Muller glia. A second component of their project will look at the role of exosomes, tiny cell-secreted vesicles commonly found in blood and other bodily fluids, in promoting regeneration. Comparative transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of Muller glia reprogramming (EY027267-01) Principal investigators: David R. Hyde, Ph.D., University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana; John D. Ash, Ph.D., University of Florida, Gainesville; Andy J. Fischer, Ph.D., Ohio State University, Columbus; Seth Blackshaw, Ph.D., and Jiang Qian, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore In zebrafish and chicks, retinal damage induces Muller glia to reprogram and re-enter the cell cycle to produce neuronal progenitor cells, which are capable of moving to damaged retinal tissue and turning into the missing neuronal cell types. While Muller glia can initiate a regenerative response in the damaged zebrafish and chick retinas, mammalian Muller glia cannot, thereby preventing retinal regeneration and restoration of vision in humans and other mammals. Hyde and his colleagues are comparing the capacity of Muller glia cells from zebrafish, chicks and mice to perform this type of reprogramming. From the Muller glia in each animal, they will determine what gene activity is upregulated or downregulated (transcriptomics), as well as look for modifications to the genomic DNA (epigenomics), during retinal development and in response to different forms of retinal damage. These types of cross-species comparisons are designed to detect differences in gene expression, as well as to identify potential regulators that control Muller glia reprogramming. This work will shed light on why some species possess the ability to regenerate their damaged retinas while humans cannot. Novel targets to promote RGC axon regeneration: Insights from unique retinal ganglion cell cohorts (EY027257-01) Principal investigators: Kevin Park, Ph.D.; Vance Lemmon, Ph.D.; Sanjoy Bhattacharya, Ph.D., University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Park and Lemmon are using RNA sequencing in cultured mouse retinal ganglion cells to identify differences in the expression of genes in regenerative versus non-regenerative retinal ganglion cells. In parallel, Park and Bhattacharya will use mass spectrometry to determine what lipids (or fat molecules) may give subclasses of retinal ganglion cells more robust regenerative capacities. The researchers will then perform a set of experiments aimed at understanding the function of the genes found to be involved in regeneration. The most promising gene candidates will be used as a therapy aimed at regenerating the optic nerve in a mouse model with optic nerve injury.","Published: September 2, 2016"

The respiratory collaboration brings MRC Technology, Asthma UK, AstraZeneca, and the British Lung Foundation together to investigate the link between epigenetics and respiratory disease. Epigenetics are changes in the expression of genes, which could be attributed to lifestyle and other external factors affecting the body. Epigenetics do not change the DNA sequence. Until now epigenetics research has mostly focused on cancer, but it presents a promising avenue for respiratory research which, it is hoped, will help speed up the delivery of new treatments.   The collaboration is combining resources and expertise in drug discovery and clinical development, funding, and access to research networks and patient groups to enable early stage scientific research to be translated into potential new therapies for respiratory diseases. The collaboration is calling on researchers to join them to accelerate epigenetic respiratory research, particularly into asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Kay Boycott, Chief Executive at Asthma UK, said:  Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially fatal asthma attack, and frighteningly, for those with severe asthma, treatments often don t work, so the need for new and effective treatments is urgent. We are therefore delighted to be providing funding for this collaboration which will help us better understand the relationship between epigenetics and respiratory diseases, including asthma, and ultimately develop new, effective treatments.  Maarten Kraan, Head of the Respiratory and Inflammation Innovative Medicines Unit at AstraZeneca, said:  With novel therapeutic strategies directed against epigenetic changes, this collaboration represents an important step forward in AstraZeneca's commitment to the fundamental research needed to find transformative medicines for the hundreds of millions of patients afflicted by these conditions.  Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said:  We re delighted to be sharing our expertise, promoting this opportunity to our research networks, and looking to contribute funding to the initiative. We must ensure that the best scientific ideas are identified and developed into real-world improvements to treat the millions of people who have lung disease.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director, Drug Discovery, at MRC Technology said:  Our collaboration improves the likelihood that promising research will be translated into potential new patient treatments. The funding and support from Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation will enable us to identify innovative science to progress in our own laboratories, while AstraZeneca s expertise is invaluable to get therapies into the clinic.

Exchanging hydrogen atoms in such molecules for more useful elements is difficult without damaging or destroying the rest of the molecule. The new method described by Liu and Stahl gives chemists prospecting for bioactive molecules a new tool in the search for novel drugs or chemicals for agriculture.  We need more efficient ways to convert feedstocks into useful molecules,  explains Stahl, a UW Madison professor of chemistry.  Selective functionalization of carbon-hydrogen bonds is one of the holy grails of modern chemistry.  Although chemists have ways of making biologically active molecules now, the current routes are often laborious and create large amounts of waste. The new method removes many of the intermediate steps and will make the process far easier for medicinal chemists. An important feature of the new method is that it provides access to so-called chiral molecules that are a match for enzymes targeted in disease. Chiral molecules have mirror-image versions of themselves, similar to a pair of human hands. For drug molecules to be effective, they must fit   like a hand into a glove   the targeted molecular niche of an enzyme.  The three-dimensional shape and chirality of molecules often correlates with the efficacy or potency of a pharmaceutical,  notes Stahl. The two mirror-image forms of drug molecules can have vastly different effects. An infamous example is thalidomide, first prescribed as a sedative in the 1950s. The reverse image of the molecule, however, was later linked to severe birth defects.  It is important to be able to synthesize only one of two mirror images of the molecule, and development of new catalytic methods that achieve this goal, starting with carbon-hydrogen bonds, is highly desired,  says Liu, a professor of chemistry at SIOC.","Published: September 2, 2016"

Scientists at Oregon State University have used X-ray crystallography, a powerful technique that can reveal structures down to their individual atoms, to study the fundamental nature and behavior of this peroxiredoxin. Their findings were announced today in the journal Structure. Peroxiredoxin is needed by all cells to help eliminate hydrogen peroxide, a toxin, and in normal cells this process is healthy and valuable. But peroxiredoxins inside bacteria also help provide protection from our immune cells and increase the virulence of bacterial cells that cause infections. The researchers were able to visualize peroxiredoxin chemistry in action. They found that when it s restrained and loses its mobility, it also loses its function. And if the normal function is lost, it can lead to cell death. If a molecule can be found that selectively blocks the motions of peroxiredoxin only in bacterial cells   which the researchers believe may be possible   it could function as an entirely new way to kill those cells. This would leave normal cells undamaged and set the stage for new types of antibiotics. With the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance to many existing drugs, this approach could have significant value, researchers said. It might also work in synergy with existing antibiotics to improve their efficacy, they said.  Peroxiredoxins are found in animals, plants, and bacteria, and are proteins that are crucial for cell survival,  said Arden Perkins, the lead author on this study which was done at OSU, in collaboration with Andrew Karplus, a distinguished professor of biochemistry in the OSU College of Science.  The main function of peroxiredoxins is to eliminate hydrogen peroxide in cells by converting it to water,  Perkins said.  This toxin is a byproduct of normal cell metabolism, and hydrogen peroxide has to be removed so it doesn t damage the cell. If peroxiredoxin doesn t do its job, cells will die.  With the extraordinary images provided by X-ray crystallography, the research also discovered that there are special regions on bacterial peroxiredoxins, different from those found in humans, which could be specifically targeted. If compounds could aim at those targets and selectively shut down the protective function of peroxiredoxin just in bacteria, it would weaken or kill those cells.  There s a lot of potential for this to be foundational work, something we can build on to create a new class of antibiotics,  Perkins said.  The key concept is selectively restraining the motions of peroxiredoxins in some cells, inactivating its function and leading to the death of the cells you want to kill.  In related approaches, Perkins said, the concept may also hold some value against certain non-bacterial pathogens, like those that cause malaria or African sleeping sickness, which increasingly are difficult to treat.","Published: September 2, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/tumor-dna-in-blood-signals-immunotherapy-response-212506,Tumor DNA in Blood Signals Immunotherapy Response  Research suggests that tumor DNA circulating in blood may be a biological marker for T cell transfer immunotherapy   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A pilot study by NCI researchers suggests that tumor DNA circulating in the blood of patients with cancer might be a biological marker for determining, soon after the treatment has started, whether a form of immunotherapy is likely to work for a given patient. The results further suggest that doctors could use information about circulating tumor DNA to quickly identify patients who are responding (or are not responding) to the treatment, the researchers reported in the August 1 Clinical Cancer Research. This information, in turn, could allow doctors to modify a treatment plan accordingly.  The findings are from a retrospective analysis of blood samples from patients who received a treatment known as T-cell transfer immunotherapy, also called adoptive cellular therapy. Using the patients  samples and information about treatment outcomes, the researchers identified patterns of changes in the blood levels of tumor DNA that were associated with complete responses, partial responses, or no responses.  By looking at the circulating tumor DNA in blood, we were able to determine whether a treatment was working within the first 2 weeks,  said study coauthor Steven Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Surgery Branch in NCI s Center for Cancer Research (CCR). When cancer cells are eliminated from the body, DNA released from these cells may enter the bloodstream and circulate, Dr. Rosenberg explained. Rising blood levels of DNA from cancer cells that are targeted by immunotherapy may indicate that the treatment is hitting its targets.  This approach gives you a very rapid indication of whether a particular therapy is causing the death of tumor cells that bear the gene you are targeting,  noted Dr. Rosenberg. The results are preliminary, he added, and need to be confirmed by larger studies. A Need for Biomarkers In the study, the researchers analyzed blood samples from 39 patients with advanced melanoma who had received T-cell transfer immunotherapy during clinical trials at NCI in the 2000s.  This particular treatment involved several steps. First, immune cells that had infiltrated a patient s tumors were collected. These tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were then activated in the lab and grown in large batches. Finally, these expanded killer T cells were infused into the patient.  About 20 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma who receive this treatment have a complete response, but there has not been a way to identify patients who will respond to this therapy.   It would be helpful if we could use circulating tumor DNA to determine earlier whether a patient is responding to treatment,  said coauthor Richard M. Sherry, M.D., also of CCR s Surgery Branch.  If a treatment is not working, you want to change directions to help the patient.  Patterns in Circulating Tumor DNA For the study, the researchers used a mutated form of the BRAF gene as a circulating marker. Mutations in this gene drive half of all malignant melanomas and were present in all 39 patients.  Dr. Rosenberg s team had collected and stored blood samples from these patients over the course of treatment, including before and soon after therapy began. Of the 39 patients, 10 had complete responses, 14 had partial responses, and 15 did not respond.  We looked at early time points after the initiation of treatment and saw patterns in the levels of circulating tumor DNA in patients who responded and patients who did not respond,  said coauthor Mark Raffeld, M.D., of CCR s Laboratory of Pathology.  For example, in 9 of the 10 patients who had complete responses, blood levels of the mutated BRAF DNA increased sharply during the first 2 weeks after treatment and then fell to zero.   Most of the tumor cell killing as judged by the peak of circulating tumor DNA occurred within 5 to 9 days of starting treatment, and then the patient s blood levels of circulating tumor DNA would drop to zero in patients who developed a complete response,  said Dr. Raffeld, explaining the pattern.  By contrast, with one exception, patients whose blood showed no early spike in circulating tumor DNA failed to achieve an objective response, the researchers noted.  The results of this pilot study suggest that patients without these  peaks  are unlikely to respond and might need a different therapy,  said Dr. Raffeld. The Serial Testing of Blood Samples Clinical indications of a response to T-cell transfer immunotherapy can often be seen within 2 months of a patient starting treatment.  With this approach, we are trying to analyze tumor responses to treatment at the level of DNA,  said Dr. Sherry.  Circulating markers are already being used to monitor patients with various types of cancer for recurrences. The new findings suggest that the approach could be explored for this type of immunotherapy as well, the researchers noted. For instance, they reported that, for a patient who had a recurrence, a blood sample collected before the recurrence had been identified with standard clinical tests had elevated levels of mutated BRAF DNA.   This is a very exciting study,  commented Anirban Maitra, M.B.B.S., a professor of pathology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who investigates the use of what are often called  liquid biopsies  for patients with cancer. Liquid biopsies are blood tests that provide genetic and molecular information about cancer cells that are more typically obtained by analyzing a piece of tumor that has been removed surgically.  The longitudinal, or serial, testing of blood samples from patients receiving targeted or immune-based therapies is critical for developing new ways to assess the effectiveness of treatments or the emergence of resistance, said Dr. Maitra, who was not involved in the NCI study.  This research provides important supportive evidence for that approach.  The spike in the mutated BRAF DNA that correlated with treatment response would not have been apparent with one-time sampling, he noted. Furthermore, the short interval between each liquid biopsy  would be inconceivable for tissue-based serial sampling.  Future Directions Measuring tumor responses to immunotherapy can be challenging, Dr. Maitra noted, citing the example of the  pseudo-progression  of tumors. This occurs when tumors that are being infiltrated by immune cells in patients who are receiving immunotherapy appear to be progressing when evaluated using standard imaging tools.   Liquid biopsy-based approaches can potentially circumvent this artifact and provide a more objective measure of treatment response,  he said.  Circulating tumor DNA represents an additional source of information about tumors, noted Dr. Raffeld.  This approach gives you a window into how much tumor is present in a patient, and that information could supplement information from radiology techniques,  he said.   At NCI, Dr. Rosenberg has begun to test the use of circulating tumor DNA in patients receiving immunotherapy for colon cancer.  This is a very important investigational tool, and we have just begun to use it to test the effectiveness of immunotherapies in patients,  he said.","Published: September 2, 2016"

While the reference material will undergo formal WHO review in October, the agency has given the go-ahead for the strain s use given the urgent need of medical products to diagnose and treat Zika. The sequence is published September 1st in Genome Announcements, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.  WHO s go-ahead before it s expert committee meeting in October reflects the urgent need for researchers and companies to access valid reference material to diagnose Zika virus infection,  said principal investigator Sally Baylis, PhD, senior scientist, Virus Safety section, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.  This will facilitate the development of sensitive, better performing tests to detect Zika in patients.  Zika virus has been spreading across South and Central America since early 2015 and has now emerged in Florida. While most infections are mild and asymptomatic, the World Health Organization declared the current Zika epidemic a public health emergency of international concern because of complications that may arise in newborns when pregnant mothers contract the infection.  Microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities have been detected in large numbers of fetuses and neonates since the epidemic struck Latin America. Guillain-Barr  syndrome, a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system, is also thought to be caused by Zika infection in a small number of adults. Reference standards from the World Health Organization are used to harmonize assays for diagnostic testing, particularly in the case of acute infection, as well as assays that might be used to screen blood for transfusions, and to define regulatory requirements for test sensitivity where screening is implemented, explained Baylis.","Published: September 2, 2016"

The screen sheds light into the vast, unstudied reaches of parasite genomes, uncovering for instance a protein common to all apicomplexans.  There s never been a really good way of looking at the function of all genes in any apicomplexan parasite,  says Whitehead Fellow Sebastian Lourido.  We ve introduced a method to assess the function of the entire genome. This technology can be used to study a variety of topics, from nutrient acquisition and responses to immune pressures to epistasis and genetic interactions. This is an important leap forward in what s possible to investigate in these parasites.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 60 million people in the United States are infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Transmission can occur by ingesting oocytes from infected cat feces or by eating undercooked meat containing Toxoplasma cysts. After infection, some healthy people experience a month or more of flu-like symptoms, but the disease can cause seizures and potentially fatal encephalitis in the immunocompromised, including patients receiving transplants, those with HIV/AIDS, cancer patients, the elderly, and young children. If a mother is infected during pregnancy, she can transmit the parasite to her fetus, which can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, brain or eye damage, or hearing loss in her child. Although toxoplasmosis can be a serious disease, another apicomplexan, the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum, killed more than 400,000 people in 2015, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Because T. gondii and P. falciparum are closely related, T. gondii can serve as a model organism for researching its more deadly cousin. However, studies of T. gondii have been hampered by scientists  inability to knock down genes quickly and efficiently. RNA interference (RNAi), an effective tool to assess gene function in many organisms, is largely ineffective in apicomplexans, while random mutagenesis is difficult to interpret because the altered gene is difficult to identify. Genetic crosses are also hard to implement because the parasite s sexual stages only occur in cats. Further, altering the T. gondii genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system was curtailed by the Cas9 enzyme s toxicity. To overcome this hurdle, scientists in Lourido s lab created a  decoy  single-guide RNA that effectively reduces Cas9 s hyperactivity on the genome. Using this  subdued  CRISPR/Cas9 system, the researchers were able to disrupt each of T. gondii s 8,158 genes and study their individual functions. The approach identified roughly 200 genes present in all apicomplexans that contribute to the parasites  fitness during infection of human cells. One of these genes codes for a protein that the team dubbed claudin-like apicomplexan microneme protein (CLAMP), which has a strong effect on the parasite s invasion of host cells. To further analyze the protein s role and confirm its necessity for another apicomplexan, the team worked with the lab of Jacquin Niles at MIT to knock the protein down in P. falciparum. Without functional CLAMP, the malaria parasites were unable to grow in red blood cells. The team s findings are described online this week in the journal Cell. Although the genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 system works well in T. gondii, an equivalent strategy is still missing for P. falciparum.  Malaria is really difficult to manipulate in the same way,  says Diego Huet, a postdoctoral researcher in the Lourido lab and co-author of the Cell paper.  Because its genome is adenine (A)- and thymine (T)-rich, it is difficult to generate the cuts where you want. Malaria parasites also lack the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA repair, requiring a repair template when making cuts with CRISPR/Cas9. These issues represent a technical hurdle to similar genome-wide approaches in this parasite, making Toxoplasma an even more important model for malaria. There is so much we can study.  Saima Sidik, who co-authored the study and is a research assistant in the Lourido lab agrees, adding,  Now we can start altering the environment the parasites are in and see how they react. We can permute the environment by adding drugs, adding immune pressures, or trying different cell types for the parasites to invade. We can knock down the whole genome in a week, whereas before we could only do maybe one gene a month. With CRISPR screening, the possibilities are endless. ","Published: September 2, 2016"

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/extreme-temperatures-could-increase-preterm-birth-risk-194226,Extreme Temperatures Could Increase Preterm Birth Risk Researchers at NIH have found more preterm births among women exposed to extremes of hot and cold  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Extreme hot or cold temperatures during pregnancy may increase the risk of preterm birth, according to study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. The study authors found that extremes of hot and cold during the first seven weeks of pregnancy were associated with early delivery. Women exposed to extreme heat for the majority of their pregnancies also were more likely to deliver early. The researchers found more consistent associations with early delivery after exposure to extreme heat than to extreme cold weather. They theorized that, during cold spells, people are more likely to seek shelter and so could more easily escape the cold s effects. But during extreme heatwaves, people are more likely to endure the temperature, particularly when the cost of or access to air conditioning is an impediment. The study was published in Environmental Health Perspectives.  Our findings indicate that it may well be prudent to minimize the exposure of pregnant women to extremes in temperature,  said the study s senior author, Pauline Mendola, Ph.D., an epidemiologist in the Division of Intramural and Population Health Research at the NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). A pregnancy is considered full term at between 39 and 40 weeks. Preterm birth occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy and increases the risk for infant death and long term disability. It is unknown why extremes of hot or cold might influence preterm birth risk. However, the researchers theorize that the stress of temperature extremes could hinder the development of the placenta or alter blood flow to the uterus, both of which could potentially lead to early labor. To conduct the study, the researchers linked electronic medical records from 223,375 births at 12 clinical centers throughout the United States to hourly temperature records for the region surrounding each center. The researchers noted that what constitutes a hot or cold temperature varies from person to person and place to place. To compensate for local climate variability and personal susceptibility, the researchers evaluated temperatures in the surrounding regions. They defined extreme cold temperatures as below the 10th percentile of average temperatures, and defined extreme heat as above the 90th percentile. The researchers found that women who experienced extreme cold for the first seven weeks of their pregnancies had a 20 percent higher risk for delivering before 34 weeks of pregnancy, a nine percent increased risk for delivering from 34-36 weeks, and a three percent increased risk for delivering in weeks 37 and 38. Women whose first seven weeks of pregnancy coincided with extreme heatwaves had an 11 percent increase in risk before 34 weeks, and a four percent increased risk at 37 to 38 weeks. Exposure to extreme heat during weeks 15-21 increased the risk for delivery at 34 weeks and at 34-36 weeks by 18 percent and for delivery from 37 to 39 weeks by four percent. Hot exposures during weeks 8-14 increased the risk for birth at 37 to 38 weeks by 4 percent. Overall, exposure to extreme heat for the duration of pregnancy was associated with increases in risk for delivery at 34 weeks and 36-38 weeks by 6 to 21 percent.

The research, published in the journal Science, analysed all publicly available clinical trial data for the vaccine. The results suggest that in people who have never been exposed to dengue before, the vaccine primes the immune system so that if they are subsequently infected, the infection is more severe. However in people who are have been exposed to the virus before vaccination, the vaccine reduces the severity of future infections. The researchers recommend testing people before they receive the vaccine, to establish if they have previously been exposed to the dengue virus. This would help avoid triggering an increase in serious cases of the disease. Dengue is a viral infection that causes just under 400 million cases per year. According to the latest estimates, around half of the world s population are thought to be at risk. The virus is spread by mosquitoes, and causes fever, headache, muscle and joint pain. In some cases, it can lead to a life-threatening condition called haemorrhagic fever which is a leading cause of death and serious illness among children in some Asian and Latin American countries. Unlike most infectious diseases, the second time a person is infected with dengue is usually far more serious than the first. This may be why the vaccine appears to amplify the illness in some individuals, particularly young children. Normally, when a person is infected with a virus their immune system builds defences against it. This means when they are infected a second time, the virus is destroyed before triggering symptoms. However, with dengue, the virus primes the immune system to work against the body. So when a person is infected a second time, a component of the immune system   called antibodies   help the virus infect the cells, leading to a more severe infection. This has serious implications for the vaccine, explains Professor Neil Ferguson, co-lead author, who is the Director of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College London:  If someone has never been exposed to dengue, the vaccine seems to act like a silent infection. The initial exposure to the virus from the vaccine primes the immune system, so when they are infected again, the symptoms are more likely to be severe.  The vaccine, produced by the company Sanofi-Pasteur, is available in six countries and has been trialled on around 30,000 people from ten countries. After analysing the data, the research team formulated a computer model to predict the effectiveness of the vaccine if used more widely. Professor Neil Ferguson said:  Having a licensed dengue vaccine available is a significant step forward for dengue control. However, we should be careful in considering where and how to use this vaccine as there is still uncertainty about the impact.  The team stress the vaccine stills holds benefits   but only if used in areas heavily affected by dengue, where individuals being vaccinated are likely to have encountered the virus before. Derek Cummings, Professor of Biology at the University of Florida and co-author of the study added:  In places with high transmission intensity, most people have been already exposed to dengue at the time of vaccination, and the vaccine has higher efficacy on average. However, in places with lower transmission intensity, were individuals haven t been previously exposed, the vaccine can place people at risk of severe disease and overall, increase the number of hospitalized cases.  Dr Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer, joint first author of the research from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, explained:  Our results indicate that screening potential vaccine recipients could maximize the benefits and minimise the risk of negative outcomes.  The World Health Organization recommends that countries consider introduction of the dengue vaccine only in geographic settings (national or subnational) where data suggests a high burden of disease. Professor Ferguson added:  Our model refines estimates of which places would see a decline in dengue incidence with large scale vaccination programmes, and which places should not implement programmes at this point in time. These results present the first published, independent predictions of the potential impact of vaccination that take account of recent data showing that the vaccine can increase the risk of severe dengue disease in young children.  The authors hope their analysis can help inform policy-makers in evaluating this and other candidate dengue vaccines.

It's a common problem that affects more than 1 person in every 10. While many learn to live with it, tinnitus can become much more than a minor ringing or buzzing sound. It can seriously disturb sleeping, concentration and daily living to the point of causing depression and anxiety. See Also: Study: Emotion processing in the brain changes with tinnitus severity""Our study in mice proposes the first gene related to tinnitus,"" says Christopher Cederroth, an assistant professor at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. He and his team want to identify the molecules behind tinnitus, in an effort to find a treatment to silence the phantom noises. ""We discovered that without normal function of the GLAST gene, animals are more prone to develop tinnitus,"" says Cederroth. The gene codes for a glutamate transporter, a protein that works to take the neurotransmitter glutamate away from the synaptic space, where neural communication occurs, back into the cells. ""Removing excess glutamate from the synapse is vital for healthy neural function, as uncontrolled glutamate levels outside neural cells overexcites neurons and has toxic effects,"" he explains. ""Dysfunctions in glutamate transporters has been previously associated with seizures and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and now, tinnitus."" The results, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, point beyond the known predominance of GLAST in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as its protective effects could happen in the ear. ""Our study opens the possibility that higher expression of GLAST in the cochlea could create the resistance of mice to auditory insults, by preventing ototoxicity."" Since his first tinnitus studies in mice in 2009, Cederroth saw the need to improve the detection of tinnitus in this species, which offers facilitated behavioral and genetic manipulations for our understanding of the mechanisms behind the auditory disorder. ""Curiously, mice appeared to be resistant to developing tinnitus,"" says Cederroth. ""Only 20 to 50 percent of mice show behavioral changes that point to tinnitus after known risk factors, compared to 70 to 75 percent rats, for example."" That posed a technical problem to scientists like Cederroth, who are looking for biological causes of the disturbance. Don't Miss: Magnetic pulses to the brain deliver long-lasting relief for tinnitus patientsTesting behavioral detection of a sound gap, in different mouse strains, turned out to be their smart idea. ""We found a solution that involved identifying the right mouse strain and the right stimulus timing. This improved the range of responses we could detect from animals with tinnitus in a mouse strain that is widely used in other field for genetic testing, giving the entire community a robust model for further testing of biological mechanisms of tinnitus."" This is a big step forward. Each mouse strain has a certain genetic background and shows a different level of baseline sensitivity to silent gaps. So modifying a certain gene in a sensitive strain and being able to observe a range of behavioral functions can point to the genes, and related molecules, that are required for specific types of tinnitus. ""When the GLAST gene is knocked-out of mice on the C57 genetic background, the animals developed more tinnitus when exposed to salicylate, a derivative of aspirin known to be transiently toxic to ear cells."" Experimental models of tinnitus are normally made by exposing animals to loud noise or to drugs toxic to ear cells, such as salicylate, and then presenting animals with various behavioral tasks to measure their perception of non-existing sounds. One such behavioral test is GPIAS, which stands for gap pre-pulse of the acoustic startle reflex. The principle behind this task is the normal and involuntary ability of animals to suppress a startle reflex in response to certain loud pulse, if the startling pulse is preceded by a silent gap in the background noise. ""In a way, the pre-pulse gap normally serves to prepare the animal for the upcoming startling pulse, such that they startle less,"" explains the researcher. ""An animal that does not show this normal behavioral inhibition by the pre-pulse gap is showing a less efficient gap detection, in the form of a greater reflex response. This could happen when the animal perceives a phantom sound, interfering with the ability of sensing the gap properly that is, like tinnitus,"" explains Cederroth. ""As we change the frequency of the background noise to closely match an animal's ringing in the ear, the startle reflex is less efficiently suppressed by the pre-pulse gap."" Because of the improved sensitivity of the behavioral task in detecting tinnitus and clear candidate molecules, the GLAST deficiency model may very well serve to distinguish more subtle, yet unidentified mechanisms on how tinnitus is triggered and maintained. ""We need to now investigate in more details what happens in the ear and in the brain to identify where GLAST is truly acting and how"". ""There is a current need to standardize tinnitus diagnosis and how treatments are assessed, and our work points to the value of changing timing and frequency parameters to better diagnose cases using this methodology. These improvements will have to be tested in humans with tinnitus, as it is of outmost importance for drug discovery to have comparable read-outs between animal models and humans."" Read Next: Ringing in the ears and chronic pain enter by the same gate ""A method that can objectively quantify a decrease in tinnitus perception after a given treatment would be a major break-through in the field,"" says Cederroth. ""When coupled with human genetic studies, this endeavor could ultimately improve the drug development process and lead to the preventive or curative treatment of tinnitus."" The work is important to help such a large number of people, 70 million only in Europe and over 25 million in the US. ""Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease itself, as it can result from various potential causes, such as hearing loss due to damage of hair cells in the ear, head injury or infection, toxic drugs, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders or circulatory problems."" So, understanding tinnitus is a multi-disciplinary affair, and current knowledge is scattered, explains Cederroth. ""This work is part of an effort to gather all the expertise to solve problems of heterogeneity, in how tinnitus becomes a problem to some but not all people and why they respond differently to treatments."" By bringing together the global state of the art in tinnitus research, he hopes awareness will increase.

But that tiny 0.1 percent variation has big consequences, influencing the color of your eyes, the span of your hips, your risk of getting sick and in some ways even your earning potential. Although variants are scattered throughout the genome, scientists have largely ignored the stretches of repetitive genetic code once dismissively known as  junk  DNA in their search for differences that influence human health and disease. A new study shows that variation in these overlooked repetitive regions may also affect human health. These regions can affect the stability of the genome and the proper function of the chromosomes that package genetic material, leading to an increased risk of cancer, birth defects and infertility. The results appear online in the journal Genome Research.  Variation is not only important for how genes and proteins function, but it can also occur in the noncoding, repetitive portions of the genome,  said Beth A. Sullivan, Ph.D., senior author of the study and associate professor of molecular biology and microbiology at Duke University School of Medicine.  What we found in this study is probably the tip of the iceberg,  Sullivan said.  There could be all sorts of functional consequences to having variation within the complex, repetitive portion of the genome that we don t know about yet.  Even though the sequence of the human genome was declared complete more than a decade ago, it retains several glaring gaps, especially in the repetitive sequences around centromeres, the twisty ties that hold a pair of chromosomes together in a floppy X shape and coordinate their movement during cell division. These centromere sequences -- called satellite DNA -- are made up of blocks of exactly 171 A s, C s, T s and G s, repeated over and over for millions of base-pairs. Researchers once believed that each chromosome contained a single stretch of this satellite DNA, which determined where its centromere would reside. But a few years ago, Sullivan s lab discovered that many human chromosomes possessed more than one of these regions, and depending on the individual, the centromere could form at either site. In this study, Sullivan wanted to see how the chromosome decides where to put its centromere, and whether one site builds a  better  centromere than the other. Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, she focused on chromosome 17, which is structurally rearranged or mutated in many different cancers and birth defects. First, Sullivan and her team combined molecular and visual assays, stretching the chromosome out into long chromatin fibers that were painted with fluorescent probes to map the variation in genomic sequence at the two different regions of satellite DNA. Then they looked at each satellite region for the presence of proteins necessary to construct a fully functioning centromere. The researchers found that genomic variation at one of these satellite DNA regions -- either in the size or sequence of its repeated 171 base pair units -- ultimately determines whether the centromere is built at the primary site or the alternate site. When they interrogated samples from a human DNA bank, they found that about 70 percent of humans have little genomic variation at the primary site, while 30 percent have differing degrees of variation. Most of the time, the centromeres aren t built at the primary site if it contains variation and instead are assembled at the  backup  site nearby. But when this happens, the result may be a dysfunctional centromere that is architecturally unsound and an unstable chromosome that may be present in too many or too few copies.  It is immensely fascinating to think that there are so many people walking around who are essentially centromere mosaics,  said Sullivan.  One of their centromeres, on one of their chromosomes, has the potential to be dangerously unstable, and it could affect their ability to reproduce, or predispose them to cancer.

This so-called cancer cachexia is accompanied by a poor prognosis with regard to disease progression, quality of life, and mortality. After sepsis, cachexia is the most frequent cause of death in cancer patients. It is not entirely clear which biochemical mechanisms play a role. To date there have also not been any pharmacological possibilities for selectively influencing tumor-associated wasting syndrome.   Stopping energy wasting molecularly   Researchers at the Institute for Diabetes and Cancer (IDC) at Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen have identified the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as the central enzyme in cancer cachexia. AMPK is normally responsible for protecting cells from energy deficiency. In the case of cancer cachexia, however, AMPK activity is inhibited due to the illness, resulting in a pointless waste of the body's own energy store.   Selective AMPK reactivation was successfully carried out in tumor models. The therapeutic manipulation took place through a specific peptide which prevents the interaction between AMPK and the lipid droplet-associated protein Cidea, and which consequently can stop the increased fat breakdown (lipolysis) found in tumor diseases.   ""Our data suggest that the preservation of ""healthy"" adipose tissue can promote not only the quality of life, but also the response to treatment and the survival of cancer patients,"" says Prof. Stephan Herzig, IDC Director. ""The interaction between AMPK and Cidea can be taken as a starting point for developing new lipolysis inhibitors which could then prevent the breakdown of energy stores in the fat of tumor patients."" He furthermore sees possibilities for transferring the acquired insights to other wasting disorders, such as with sepsis or burn injuries.  ","Published: September 1, 2016"

The approach, called a  metronomic dosage regimen,  uses significantly lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs but at more frequent time intervals. This would have multiple goals of killing cancer cells, creating a hostile biological environment for their growth, reducing toxicity from the drug regimen and avoiding the development of resistance to the cancer drugs being used. A system just published in Chemistry of Materials by a group of researchers from Oregon and the United Kingdom offers an even more effective way to deliver such drugs and may be able to greatly improve this approach, scientists say. Further testing is needed in both animals and humans for safety and efficacy.  This new system takes some existing cancer therapy drugs for ovarian cancer, delivers both of them at the same time and allows them to work synergistically,  said Adam Alani, an associate professor in the Oregon State University/Oregon Health & Science University College of Pharmacy, and lead author on the new study.  Imagine if we could manage cancer on a long-term basis as a chronic condition, like we now do high blood pressure or diabetes. This could be a huge leap forward.  This approach is still in trial stages, Alani said, but shows promise. In some prior work with related systems in animal tests, OSU and collaborating researchers have been able to completely eradicate tumors. Total remission, Alani said, may be possible with metronomic dosage, but the initial goal is not only to kill cancer cells but to create an environment in which it s very difficult for them to grow, largely by cutting off the large blood supply these types of cells often need. Most conventional cancer chemotherapy is based on the use of  maximum tolerable doses  of a drug, in an attempt to completely eliminate cancer or tumors. In some cases such as ovarian cancer, however, drug-free intervals are needed to allow patient recovery from side effects, during which tumors can sometimes begin to grow again or develop resistance to the drugs being used. The types of cancers this approach may best lend itself to are those that are quite complex and difficult to treat with conventional regimens based on  maximum tolerable dose.  This includes ovarian, sarcoma, breast, prostate, and lung cancers. One example of the new metronomic regimen, in this instance, is use of two drugs already common in ovarian cancer treatment   paclitaxel and rapamycin   but at levels a tenth to a third of the maximum tolerable dose. One drug attacks cancer cells; the other inhibits cancer cell formation and the growth of blood vessels at tumor sites. The new system developed in this research takes the process a step further. It attaches these drugs to polymer nanoparticles that migrate specifically into cancer cells and are designed to release the drugs at a particular level of acidity that is common to those cells. The low doses, careful targeting of the drugs and their ability to work in synergy at the same time appeared to greatly increase their effectiveness, while almost completely eliminating toxicity.  Our goal is to significantly reduce tumors, slow or stop their regrowth, and allow a person s body and immune system time to recover its health and natural abilities to fight cancer,  Alani said.  I m very optimistic this is possible, and that it could provide an entirely new approach to cancer treatment. ","Published: September 1, 2016"

Salvatore Oddo, a researcher at the Biodesign Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center (NDRC) has been investigating the underpinnings of this devastating illness.  In new research appearing in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, Oddo and his colleagues examine p62 a critical protein associated with tell-tale symptoms of Alzheimer s. The findings offer new insights that may help researchers unravel the mysteries of one of the most intractable and shattering human illnesses. The multi-purpose protein p62 has already been associated with one of the two classic neurological symptoms of Alzheimer s. Known as neurofibrillary tangles, these twisted strands of tau protein form inside dying cells, destroying vital pathways for nutrients. Now, Oddo and his colleagues have shown that p62 is associated with the other hallmark of Alzheimer s disease, the accumulation in the brain of plaques formed from deposits of another critical protein, known as amyloid beta (A ). The study demonstrates for the first time that p62 regulates the degradation or turnover of A  in living systems, which may help reverse the effects of damaging plaques in the brain. The association of p62 with both plaques and tangles points to a central role in the onset and trajectory of Alzheimer s disease and may offer clues leading to successful treatment of the disease. Currently, there is no effective therapy for Alzheimer s.  These exciting finding suggest that compounds aimed at increasing p62 may have beneficial effects for Alzheimer s disease,  Oddo says. Unremitting destruction Alzheimer s is on a rapid and devastating assent, due in part to an aging US population and greater average lifespans. One in 3 seniors die with Alzheimer s or a related form of dementia. New cases of the ailment occur every 66 seconds, with the pace accelerating to 1 every 33 seconds by 2050. Environmental factors ranging from diet and exercise to long-term health conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes may also play a role. Alzheimer's disease causes nerve cell death and tissue loss throughout the brain. During the course of the disease, the brain shrinks dramatically, affecting nearly all its functions. Shrinkage of the brain is acute in the cortex, damaging areas critical for thinking, planning and remembering. Atrophy is particularly severe in the hippocampus, an area of the cortex that plays a crucial role in formation of new memories. By contrast, the fluid-filled spaces in the brain known as ventricles grow larger. In addition to the catastrophic effects of Alzheimer s on the lives of patients, the disease places overwhelming stress on immediate caregivers, often leading to depression and in some cases, economic bankruptcy. In 2015, 15.9 million family and friends of those suffering from Alzheimer s and other forms of dementia provided a staggering 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care with an economic value of $221.3 billion. While commonly described as a disease of old age, early-onset forms can strike in mid life. Further, an increasing body of research suggests the ravaging of the brain caused by the disease actually begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Nothing less than a sea change in the understanding of this pitiless affliction will interfere with its frightening advance. A clue emerges The protein p62 is known to perform an array of vital functions in cells. Of particular interest is p62 s role in the aggregation and degradation of a pair of proteins long recognized as hallmarks of Alzheimer s disease tau and A . The authors demonstrate, for the first time, that a modified strain of mice generated to display human-like symptoms of Alzheimer s show significant cognitive improvements, including a reversal of spatial memory deficit, when the brain s expression of p62 is restored. The study further shows that the improvement is associated with reduced levels of A  and associated plaques in the brain. Finally, the new research describes the mechanism by which p62 activity improves Alzheimer s disease symptoms in mice  by a process known as autophagy. The term refers to the degradation or disassembly of unnecessary or dysfunctional components of cells a form of biological recycling essential for cellular health.   Reduce, Reuse, Recycle  Maintenance of human health requires intensive and ongoing cleanup operations. Proteins essential to life processes must be degraded after fulfilling their assigned tasks, which range from providing structural support to cells and tissues to protecting the body from pathogenic foreign invaders.  If the body s housekeeping operations are stalled or inefficient, the results can be disastrous. Previous research has revealed how imbalances between protein production and degradation can lead to accumulations of protein products associated with several deadly neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer s disease. During the process of autophagy, unwanted constituents of cells are isolated and walled-off in specialized double-membraned compartments, known as autophagosomes. The packaged protein detritus then fuses with lysosomes, organelles in the cell s cytoplasm whose digestive enzymes break down protein components. Recycling is completed when constituent amino acids from degraded proteins become the raw material for new proteins. The study observed the behavior of mice genetically bred to lack the p62 protein, resulting in age-dependent cognitive deficits. Earlier observations pointed to the underlying role of p62 in regulating the accumulation of tau protein in the brain. As the authors note, p62 binds strongly to these tau tangles in Alzheimer s, most likely in order to mark them for degradation. Memory and cognition were assessed through a simple test in which the mice had to mentally recall the locations of submerged platforms in a circular water maze. P62 was introduced to the transgenic mice through a virus specifically designed to carry it into the mouse brain. Mice received four training trials per day in the water maze for five consecutive days. While all the mice improved over the 5-day trials, those expressing p62 performed markedly better, displaying restoration of cognitive skills. The mode of action of p62 appears to be the induction of autophagy and the delivery of A  to lysosomes for processing and breakdown, thereby reversing the buildup of A  associated with cognitive impairment. This data indicates that p62 leads to the induction of autophagy and facilitates the delivery of protein byproducts to lysosomes. Loss of p62 function in Alzheimer s disease, perhaps due to oxidative damage of its promoter, is linked with the accumulation of both plaques and tangles. The research results open the possibility of restoring neuronal function through the removal of tau and A  by means of p62-induced autophagy. Future studies should help to further unravel the details of autophagy-lysosomal recycling systems in the onset and progression of Alzheimer s disease. ","Published: September 1, 2016"

The respiratory collaboration brings Asthma UK, AstraZeneca, the British Lung Foundation and MRC Technology together to investigate the link between epigenetics and respiratory disease. Epigenetics are changes in the expression of genes, which could be attributed to lifestyle and other external factors affecting the body. Epigenetics do not change the DNA sequence. Until now epigenetics research has mostly focused on cancer, but it presents a promising avenue for respiratory research which, it is hoped, will help speed up the delivery of new treatments. The collaboration is combining resources and expertise in drug discovery and clinical development, funding, and access to research networks and patient groups to enable early stage scientific research to be translated into potential new therapies for respiratory diseases. The collaboration is calling on researchers to join them to accelerate epigenetic respiratory research, particularly into asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Kay Boycott, Chief Executive at Asthma UK said:  Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially fatal asthma attack, and frighteningly, for those with severe asthma, treatments often don t work, so the need for new and effective treatments is urgent. We are therefore delighted to be providing funding for this collaboration which will help us better understand the relationship between epigenetics and respiratory diseases, including asthma, and ultimately develop new, effective treatments.  Maarten Kraan, Head of the Respiratory and Inflammation Innovative Medicines Unit at AstraZeneca said:  With novel therapeutic strategies directed against epigenetic changes, this collaboration represents an important step forward in AstraZeneca s commitment to the fundamental research needed to find transformative medicines for the hundreds of millions of patients afflicted by these conditions.  Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said:  We re delighted to be sharing our expertise, promoting this opportunity to our research networks, and looking to contribute funding to the initiative. We must ensure that the best scientific ideas are identified and developed into real-world improvements to treat the millions of people who have lung disease.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director, Drug Discovery, at MRC Technology said:  Our collaboration improves the likelihood that promising research will be translated into potential new patient treatments. The funding and support from Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation will enable us to identify innovative science to progress in our own laboratories, while AstraZeneca s expertise is invaluable to get therapies into the clinic.

These bacteria are a common cause of meningitis in newborns and the leading cause of infection in the first three months of life in the UK and globally. The new research, on 183 women in The Gambia and published in the journal Clinical and Translational Immunology, suggests a sugar found in some women s breast milk protect babies against the bacteria. The bug is carried naturally in the vagina and bowels by up to one in three women and can be transferred to the baby during childbirth or in breast milk. In the UK pregnant women deemed high risk are offered a test for the bacteria, or women can pay privately. This test consists of a swab a few weeks before a woman's due date. However there is still a chance of a woman picking up the bacteria in her gut at some point between the tests and giving birth (once the bug gets into the gut of the mother or baby it can trigger an infection). However, the new research, from the Centre for International Child Health at Imperial, found that naturally-occurring sugars in a woman s breast milk may have protective effects against Group B streptococcus.  Each woman s breast milk contains a mixture of many different types of sugar, called human milk oligosaccharides. These are not digested in the baby s tummy and act as food for the 'friendly bacteria' in a baby's intestine.  The type of sugars a woman produces in her breast milk are partly dictated by her genetic make-up. A type of genetic system in particular, called the Lewis antigen system (which is involved in making the ABO blood group); plays an important role in determining breast milk sugars. In the study, the team tested all the mothers  breast milk for the sugars that are known to be controlled by these Lewis genes. They also tested women and their babies for Group B streptococcus at birth, six days later, and then between 60 and 89 days after birth. The team found women who produced breast milk sugars linked to the Lewis gene were less likely to have the bacteria in their gut, and their babies were also less likely to get the bacteria from their mothers at birth. In addition, among the babies who had the bacteria in their guts at birth, the infants whose mothers produced a specific sugar in their breast milk, called lacto-n-difucohexaose I, were more likely to have cleared the bacteria from their body by 60-89 days after birth. This suggests this breast milk sugar, which is linked to the Lewis gene, may have a protective effect. The researchers then went on to show in the laboratory that breast milk containing this particular sugar - lacto-n-difucohexaose I - was better at killing the Group B streptococcus bacteria compared to breast milk without this specific sugar. Around half of all women in the world are thought to produce the sugar lacto-N-difucohexaose I. Dr Nicholas Andreas, lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial said: ""Although this is early-stage research it demonstrates the complexity of breast milk, and the benefits it may have for the baby. Increasingly, research is suggesting these breast milk sugars (human milk oligosaccharides) may protect against infections in the newborn, such as rotavirus and Group B streptococcus, as well as boosting a child s  friendly  gut bacteria.  He added the presence of these sugars allows  friendly  bacteria to flourish and out-compete any harmful bacteria that may be in the youngster's gut, such as Group B streptococcus.  The sugars are also thought to act as decoys, and fool the bacteria into thinking the sugar is a type of human cell that can be invaded. The bacteria latch onto the sugar and are then excreted by the body. This may help protect the baby from infection until their own immune system is more mature to fight off the  bad bugs  at around six months of age. The team hope their findings might lead to new treatments to protect mothers and babies from infections. The researchers raise the possibility of giving specific breast milk sugar supplements to pregnant and breast-feeding women who do not carry the active Lewis gene. This may help prevent harmful bacteria getting into the baby s gut at birth and in the first weeks of life. Some companies are already exploring adding such sugars to formula milk, but Dr Andreas cautioned it would be difficult to replicate the mix of sugars found in breast milk:  These experimental formulas only contain a couple of these compounds, whereas human breast milk contains dozens of different types. Furthermore, the quantity of sugars produced by the mother changes as the baby ages so that a newborn baby will receive a higher amount of sugars in the breast milk compared to a six-month-old."" Dr Andreas, who is a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for International Child Health at Imperial, also suggested that testing new mothers' blood for the Lewis gene may be beneficial: ""If we know whether a mother is colonised with Group B streptococcus and know if she carries an active copy of the Lewis gene, it may give us an indication of how likely she is to pass the bacteria on to her baby, and more personalised preventive measures could be applied.""","Published: September 1, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/decadesold-protein-model-revised-192007,Decades Old Protein Model Revised Using modern techniques to study how proteins are directed to various areas within a cell  scientists are revising the fundamental understanding of cellular mechanisms   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. When things are going right in your body, it s because long strings of brand-new proteins are being folded up into just the right tangles and being delivered to just the right place within the cell at just the right time. Conversely, many human diseases   cancer and neurodegenerative diseases among them   occur because some aspect of this process goes awry. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these processes is central to designing increasingly effective drugs and therapies for these diseases. Now, Stanford scientists are poised to rewrite textbooks after gaining new insight into one of the fundamental mechanisms of protein delivery. A protein s journey begins when a piece of messenger RNA delivers instructions and a command to a ribosome, one of the tiny bulbous protein factories within the cell. The ribosome follows the recipe encoded on the mRNA   which itself was translated from the genes within your DNA   and manufactures the specific protein. The next step is where things get interesting. Research in the early 1970s revealed that the first part of many new proteins is a signal that makes the ribosome pump the product into another cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This critical insight was the basis for the Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology in 1999. A  signal recognition particle  (SRP) latches on to the protein signal to help pilot it to the ER; the SRP also momentarily stops protein production, with the ribosome kicking back into action once it reaches the ER and the SRP has moved along.  Our data supported the role for SRP, but our experiments did not support this model,  said Judith Frydman, a professor of biology and of genetics at Stanford.  This is what is so cool about this study. We found that in fact SRP works through a very different and completely unexpected mechanism.  Using modern techniques and instruments that allowed them to observe the mechanism in higher resolution than previously possible, Frydman and her colleagues found that the mRNA actually contains a little bit of information that the SRP recognizes before protein production begins, and that the SRP actually waits at the exit site of the ribosome before the protein even emerges.  It s almost prescient; it already knows before it comes and just steps right in,  Frydman said. The researchers also found that the SRP didn t halt protein production at all, as was previously believed. The dual discovery is both important and interesting, Frydman said, because how and when proteins reach the membranes within the cell has dire consequences. Very important processes rely on the fidelity of where proteins have to go, Frydman said, and cells need to secrete proteins faithfully. If a particular protein stays in the cytoplasm, it could aggregate and lead to loss of healthy function or the accidental gain of unhealthy function. These gains or losses are typical of a variety of diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, cancer and Alzheimer s disease.  Many proteins that are important pharmaceutically are made in large part by targeting them to this secretory pathway,  Frydman said.  But they have also been designed relying on this classical model. Having a better understanding of this process could really enhance the process of designing new pharmaceuticals. ","Published: September 1, 2016"

With it, cancer driving mutations can be detected and repaired specifically for the targeted mutation, scientists from the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden, the German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) and the Medical Faculty of the TU Dresden have shown. Significant mutations could, in future, be diagnosed faster for personalised therapies for patients.  The CRISPR / Cas-Gene Cutter is one of the most revolutionary tools in biotechnology with enormous implications for biological and medical research. As a programmable DNA cutter, this system allows the selective cutting at predefined points in the genetic material of cells.  Now researchers at the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden, the German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) and the Medical Faculty of the TU Dresden have found a way to use this technology for the diagnosis and inactivation of cancer mutations. ""Mutations in cancer cells are today identified with increasing speed by high-throughput sequencing,"" says Professor Frank Buchholz, Head of the study published in ""Journal of the National Cancer Institute"" (JNCI). ""In most cases, however, it remains unclear what actually promote these genetic alterations in the disease and which have a major impact.""  In the study, the authors aimed to establish how many of the more than 500,000 known cancer mutations can theoretically support targeted attacks. It was found that over 80 percent of the mutations with the CRISPR / Cas9 system are vulnerable. In experiments, the research team then showed that a number of these mutations can be selectively cut and inactivated in cancer cells. In this way, the researchers were able to identify those mutations that are largely responsible for cell growth and viability of cancer cells. ""With this, we now have an instrument in our hands, with which we can quickly distinguish the cancer driven by the less relevant mutations,"" says Frank Buchholz. Since each cancer is unique and has a specific combination of different mutations, this scientific approach could show promise in particular cancer diagnostics. Mutations that are crucial for the rapid growth of cancer could be detected specifically to initiate a targeted therapy based on this information. ","Published: September 1, 2016"

Organic nanotubes (ONTs) are organic molecules with tubular nanostructures. Nanostructures are structures that range between 1 nm and 100 nm, and ONTs have a nanometer-sized cavity. Various  applications of ONTs have been reported, including molecular recognition materials, transmembrane ion channel/sensors, electro-conductive materials, and organic photovoltaics. Most ONTs are constructed by a self-assembly process based on weak non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and  -  interactions between aromatic rings. Due to these relatively weak interactions, most non-covalent ONTs possess a relatively fragile structure (Figure 1). Covalent ONTs, whose tubular skeletons are cross-linked by covalent bonding (a bond made by sharing of electrons between atoms), could be synthesized from non-covalent ONTs. While covalent ONTs show higher stability and mechanical strength than non-covalent ONTs, the general synthetic strategy for covalent ONTs was yet to be established (Figure 2). A team led by Hideto Ito and Kenichiro Itami has succeeded in developing a simple and effective method for the synthesis of robust covalent ONTs (tube) by an operationally simple light irradiation of a readily accessible helical polymer (helix). This so-called ""helix-to-tube"" strategy is based on the following steps: 1) polymerization of a small molecule (monomer) to make a helical polymer followed by, 2) light-induced cross-linking at longitudinally repeating pitches across the whole helix to form covalent nanotubes (Figure 3). With their strategy, the team designed and synthesized diacetylene-based helical polymers (acetylenes are molecules that contain carbon-carbon triple bonds), poly(m-phenylene diethynylene)s (poly-PDEs), which has chiral amide side chains that are able to induce a helical folding through hydrogen-bonding interactions (Figure 4). The researchers revealed that light-induced cross-linking at longitudinally aligned 1,3-butadiyne moieties (a group of molecules that contain four carbons with triple bonds at the first and third carbons) could generate the desired covalent ONT (Figure 5). ""This is the first time in the world to show that the photochemical polymerization reaction of diynes is applicable to the cross-linking reaction of a helical polymer,"" says Maeda, a graduate student who mainly conducted the experiments. The ""helix-to-tube"" method is expected to be able to generate a range of ONT-based materials by simply changing the arene (aromatic ring) unit in the monomer. ""One of the most difficult parts of this research was how to obtain scientific evidence on the structures of poly-PDEs and covalent ONTs,"" says Ito, one of the leaders of this study. ""We had little experience with the analysis of polymers and macromolecules such as ONTs. Fortunately, thanks to the support of our collaborators in Nagoya University, who are specialists in these particular research fields, we finally succeeded in characterizing these macromolecules by various techniques including spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microscopy.""  ""Although it took us about a year to synthesize the covalent ONT, it took another one and a half year to determine the structure of the nanotube,"" says Maeda. ""I was extremely excited when I first saw the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, which indicated that we had actually made the covalent ONT that we were expecting,"" she continues (Figure 6). ""The best part of the research for me was finding that the photochemical cross-linking had taken place on the helix for the first time,"" says Maeda. ""In addition, photochemical cross-linking is known to usually occur in the solid phase, but we were able to show that the reaction takes place in the solution phase as well. As the reactions have never been carried out before, I was dubious at first, but it was a wonderful feeling to succeed in making the reaction work for the first time in the world. I can say for sure that this was a moment where I really found research interesting."" ""We were really excited to develop this simple yet powerful method to achieve the synthesis of covalent ONTs,"" says Itami, the director of the JST-ERATO project and the center director of ITbM. ""The ""helix-to-tube"" method enables molecular level design and will lead to the synthesis of various covalent ONTs with fixed diameters and tube lengths with desirable functionalities."" ""We envisage that ongoing advances in the ""helix-to-tube"" method may lead to the development of various ONT-based materials including electro-conductive materials and luminescent materials,"" says Ito. ""We are currently carrying out work on the ""helix-to-tube"" methodology and we hope to synthesize covalent ONTs with interesting properties for various applications.""","Published: September 1, 2016"

But even the most compelling evidence of cell death in a dish isn t enough to push a drug into human clinical trials, even for triple-negative breast cancer, which has a high mortality rate and remains largely without targeted treatment options. Clinical trials are commonly guided by the knowledge of how a drug works   an understanding that can allow researchers to tweak a drug s effectiveness or explore rational combinations of multiple drugs to maximize antitumor responses. Now a study published in the journal Oncogenesis offers compelling evidence that AMPI-109 works by flipping the switch on an enzyme called PRL-3 that initially puts cancer cells to  sleep  or senescence, and shortly thereafter leads to their death, or apoptosis.  For decades, we ve known about a paradoxical signaling pathway called TNF-R1 whose activation can either help a cell survive or lead to cell death. However, the signals that lead to this pathway promoting survival or promoting death have been poorly understood, especially in the context of cancer cells. We have observed that one regulator of this process in triple-negative breast cancer cells may be the activity of PRL-3. With this gene active, cells survive. With PRL-3 inactivated, cells senesce and eventually die,  says Hamid Gari, PhD, who studied the mechanism of PRL-3 while working as a doctoral candidate in the lab of CU Cancer Center investigator James R. Lambert, PhD. Gari is first author and Lambert is senior author of the current study which was performed in collaboration with Scott Lucia, MD in the department of Pathology. Gari explains that PRL-3 sets in motion a set of genes that recruits elements of the immune system to boost cancer growth during good times and allows cancer cells to sleep through bad times, for example those caused by anti-cancer therapies.  Hamid s studies knocked down the gene PRL-3 in triple-negative breast cancer cells using genetic techniques, but the drug does something analogous by blocking PRL-3 function. Our studies suggest AMPI-109 reprograms the cell to enter senescence but then they keep going past this state and into apoptosis,  Lambert says. The finding comes at a time when cancer immunotherapies are becoming first-line treatments for many forms of the disease. Basically, the strategy is to teach the immune system to recognize and attack tumor tissue. However, some cancers may be particularly good at  hiding  from the immune system, allowing them to subsist and thrive in challenging tumor tissue conditions. For this reason, many immunotherapies result in holding cancer at bay rather than wiping it out completely. In fact, some immunotherapies treat cancer as a chronic condition, with therapy continuing indefinitely with the goal of simply keeping cancer in check.  Our studies propose that by inhibiting PRL-3 activity, such as with AMPI-109, it may serve as a  flag  to signal the immune system where the tumor is, and in essence could sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. The result is a two-hit strategy to expose the tumor and then allow the immune system combat it,  Gari says. The group has applied for NIH funding and is also working toward company funding for studies of the drug s safety. If results remain promising, AMPI-109 could become an important tool in an oncologist s kit to target triple-negative breast cancer with immunotherapy. ","Published: September 1, 2016"

Funded by the Alzheimer's Society, the group of researchers from Cardiff University, King's College London and the University of Oxford studied blood from 292 individuals with the earliest signs of memory impairment and found a set of biomarkers (indicators of disease) that predicted whether or not a given individual would develop Alzheimer's disease. Learn More: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein Professor Paul Morgan, Director of Cardiff University's Systems Immunity Research Institute, said: ""Our research proves that it is possible to predict whether or not an individual with mild memory problems is likely to develop Alzheimer's disease over the next few years. We hope to build on this in order to develop a simple blood test that can predict the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease in older people with mild, and possibly innocent, memory impairment."" The study took blood samples from individuals presenting with very common symptoms of memory impairment and measured a large number of proteins belonging to a part of the immune system which is known to drive inflammation and has previously been implicated in brain diseases. When the individuals were re-assessed a year later, about a quarter had progressed to Alzheimer's disease and three of the proteins measured in their blood showed significant differences from the blood of participants that did not go on to develop the disease. Professor Morgan added: ""Alzheimer's disease affects around 520,000 people in the UK and this number is continually growing as the population ages. As such it is important that we find new ways to diagnose the disease early, giving us a chance to investigate and instigate new treatments before irreversible damage is done.""

The experimental therapy, which involves administering a drug currently used in cancer therapy trials, treats cocaine addiction by inhibiting memories responsible for cravings. See Also: Cocaine addiction, craving, relapse: Paradigm shift in treatment holds promise, thanks to epigenetics Professor Riccardo Brambilla from Cardiff University's School of Biosciences said: ""We have demonstrated that a single administration of a trial drug from the pharmacompany Pfizer can completely obliterate cocaine associated memories and significantly accelerate the end of drug seeking behaviour in animals. With this drug currently being used in cancer trials, it could be easily repositioned for treatment of cocaine addiction and other drugs of abuse."" Cocaine produces its addictive effects partially by acting on the brain's limbic system - a set of interconnected regions that regulate pleasure and motivation. When a person uses cocaine, memories of the intense pleasure felt and the things associated with it are newly created. It is these long lasting memories and drug-associated cues, key to the transition from recreational drug taking to compulsive drug use, which the new treatment inhibited when tested on mice. Dr Stefania Fasano from Cardiff University added, ""With drug use recently on the rise, new treatments for breaking addiction are much needed. The availability of a powerful drug from Pfizer, already validated in humans, could speed up the clinical development of our findings.""

See Also: Study shows association between migraine and carpal tunnel syndrome The low-frequency brainwave linked to migraines and epilepsy is known as cortical spreading depression (CSD) and is currently best studied by placing electrodes directly on the surface of the brain. But researchers from UBC, Germany and Iran have found that EEGs produced by placing electrodes only on the scalp can produce equally reliable data if a specially designed amplifier is used in tandem. ""Using this method, we found that the electrical signals acquired from the skin of the scalp were very similar to those acquired from the surface of the brain,"" said lead researcher Zoya Bastany, a master's student in the faculty of applied science at UBC. Bastany designed an AC/DC amplifier to acquire electrical signals from scalp electrodes used on anesthetized rats. The amplifier detects signals in a much broader frequency range than the standard clinical EEG system. CSD was then induced in the rats, and the recordings from scalp electrodes were compared with recordings from electrodes placed on the rats' brains. Cortical spreading depression has never before been accurately measured using EEGs, according to UBC electrical and computer engineering professor Guy Dumont, Bastany's supervisor and study co-author. ""The new method opens up uses for EEGs in studying cortical spreading depression in a non-invasive manner and without a significant increase in diagnostic costs compared to standard EEG,"" said Dumont. Ali Gorji, a professor of neuroscience at the University of M nster in Germany and a study co-author, said the new analysis technique could contribute to the development of migraine drugs that target CSD, and to better understanding of other neurological disorders.

One such disease is Senior L ken Syndrome, a rare condition that can involve both a severe kidney disease and the blinding disease Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA. A decade ago, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and colleagues identified a dog with a similar blinding condition, and in 2013 they reported the causative gene.  Now the Penn scientists report that they ve directly compared the disease course between humans and dogs and found remarkable similarities. Given the crucial role that animal models play in pushing disease therapies forward, the researchers are optimistic about developing therapies that treat the condition first in dogs, and eventually in people.   When we started characterizing the disease, we found striking similarities between a subset of human patients with LCA and dogs with this mutation,  said Gustavo D. Aguirre, a co-senior author and professor of medical genetics and ophthalmology at Penn s School of Veterinary Medicine.  We re very enthused about the potential to narrow down a therapeutic window for this disease and begin testing translational therapies.  The research is published in the journal Human Molecular Genetics and included a cross-disciplinary team from Penn. In addition to Aguirre, Penn Vet contributors included co-senior author William A. Beltran, co-first authors Louise M. Downs and Erin M. Scott, Simone Iwabe, Valerie Dufour, Kristin L. Gardiner, Sem Genini and Luis Felipe Marinho. As part of a long-standing collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine s Scheie Eye Institute, Aguirre and Beltran s team partnered with Artur V. Cideciyan and Samuel G. Jacobson as well as Alexander Sumaroka, Mychajlo S. Kosyk and Malgorzata Swider. Geoffrey K. Aguirre of the Perelman School of Medicine rounded out the research team, contributing his expertise in neurology, as neurological factors can present in the human form of the syndrome. When the Penn team helped discover the ciliopathy in dogs, they noticed something unusual.  What is striking about the canine disease is that although the dogs lack functional vision in daylight,  said Aguirre,  the cone cells, which are the photoreceptor cells that function in daylight, are still there.   They re there but they are structurally very compromised,  added Beltran, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Penn Vet.  The key question to be answered now is whether therapeutic intervention will not only halt the degenerative process but repair these abnormal cones and restore day vision. We have exciting preliminary gene therapy results that seem to confirm that this is indeed possible.  In a 2011 study, the Vet researchers  Scheie Institute colleagues, Cideciyan and Jacobson, both professors of ophthalmology at Penn Medicine, had observed something similar in some of their human patients with LCA. Their central retina contained cone cells that were preserved but lacked function. The rod photoreceptors, responsible for dim light vision, deteriorated early in life. In these people and in the dogs with the ciliopathy, the same gene was involved: NPHP5.  To find out how the genetic mutation was affecting cone cell function and rod deterioration, the researchers turned to the canine model. Erin Scott, at the time a veterinary student who was a research Merck/Merial scholar in Beltran s lab, and Louise Downs, a postdoctoral researcher in Aguirre s lab, tracked the disease in dogs, finding similar patterns as in humans. The cone cells remained present, though non-functional and structurally altered, until very late in disease, around 42 weeks of age, when they progressively degenerated. They observed that fairly early in life, around six weeks, the majority of cone cells in the affected dogs had failed to form the outer segment, which is connected by the cilia to the inner segment, and is the light capturing structure of the photoreceptors. The inner segment, too, appeared disordered, similar to what had been reported in human patients.  The researchers examined the expression of 112 genes in the retina that are known to play a direct role in vision, or that are involved in cell death or survival to see if and how NPHP5 mutation influenced them. They found in NPHP5 mutant dogs there were changes in expression in 33 of these genes some of which also altered in two other canine forms of retinal degeneration.  Finally, the researchers assessed whether, as in humans with mutations in NPHP5, kidney function or structure was affected, but found that dogs did not appear to be affected by these other features of the ciliopathic syndrome.  Research to deliver via gene therapy a normal copy of the NPHP5 gene in the canine model of disease is already underway, with promising early results.","Published: August 31, 2016"

In a summary of their work, published in Nature Medicine on Aug. 29, the investigators say they screened 6,000 existing compounds currently in late-stage clinical trials or already approved for human use for other conditions, and identified several compounds that showed the ability to hinder or halt the progress of the Zika virus in lab-grown human neural cells. The research collaboration includes teams from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health and Florida State University.  It takes years if not decades to develop a new drug,  says Hongjun Song, Ph.D., director of the Stem Cell Program in the Institute of Cell Engineering at Johns Hopkins.  In this sort of global health emergency, we don t have that kind of time.   So instead of using new drugs, we chose to screen existing drugs,  adds Guo-li Ming, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  In this way, we hope to create a therapy much more quickly.  The new findings are an extension of previous work by the research team, which found that Zika mainly targets specialized stem cells that give rise to neurons in the brain s outer layer, the cortex. The researchers observed Zika s effects in two- and three-dimensional cell cultures called  mini-brains,  which share structures with the human brain and allow researchers to study the effects of Zika in a more accurate model for human infection. In the current study, the research team exposed similar cell cultures to the Zika virus and the drugs one at a time, measuring for indicators of cell death, including caspase-3 activity, a chemical marker of cell death, and ATP, a molecule whose presence is indicative of cell vitality. Typically, after Zika infection, the damage done to neural cells is  dramatic and irreversible,  says Hengli Tang, Ph.D., professor of biological sciences at Florida State University. However, some of the compounds tested allowed the cells to survive longer and, in some cases, fully recover from infections. Further analysis of the surviving cells, says Ming, showed that the promising drugs could be divided into two classes: neuroprotective drugs, which prevent the activation of mechanisms that cause cell death, and antiviral drugs, which slow or stop viral infection or replication. Overall, Song says, three drugs showed robust enough results to warrant further study: PHA-690509, an investigational compound with antiviral properties; emricasan, now in clinical trials to reduce liver damage from hepatitis C virus and shown to have neuroprotective effects; and niclosamide, a drug already used in humans and livestock to combat parasitic infections, which worked as an antiviral agent in these experiments. Song cautioned that the three drugs  are very effective against Zika in the dish, but we don t know if they can work in humans in the same way.  For example, he says, although niclosamide can safely treat parasites in the human gastrointestinal tract, scientists have not yet determined if the drug can even penetrate the central nervous system of adults or a fetus inside a carrier s womb to treat the brain cells targeted by Zika. Nor, he says, do they know if the drugs would address the wide range of effects of Zika infection, which include microcephaly in fetuses and temporary paralysis from Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults.   To address these questions, additional studies need to be done in animal models as well as humans to demonstrate their ability to treat Zika infection,  says Ming.  So we could still be years away from finding a treatment that works.  The researchers say their next steps include testing the efficacy of these drugs in animal models to see if they have the ability to combat Zika in vivo. Zika was first identified in 1947 and garnered little scientific interest until an outbreak began in South America in mid-2015. This outbreak is now known to be responsible for an increase in cases of microcephaly   a severe birth defect in which afflicted infants are born with underdeveloped brains. In the continental United States, there have been a total of 2,260 reported cases of Zika. Though most cases are associated with travel, 43 cases of local transmission have been reported in Florida, in the Miami area. In addition, Puerto Rico has reported 7,855 locally transmitted cases, spurring the Obama administration to declare a public health emergency in the territory on Aug. 12. From these reports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that up to 270 babies may be born with microcephaly by 2017. The CDC is advising preventive measures for people in these areas, including eliminating standing water where mosquitos breed and creating a barrier from bites with clothing and wearing insect repellents. The Florida Department of Health has a robust mosquito-borne illness surveillance system. It has partnered with local groups and the CDC to fight Zika infections, and is providing free Zika testing to all pregnant women. The Puerto Rico Department of Health has put an active Zika surveillance system in place to coordinate reporting from health care providers and weekly mosquito spraying in many areas. The Zika virus is commonly transmitted from mosquito bites or from an infected person to an uninfected person through sexual contact. Despite the potential effects of infection, only one in four infected people will present symptoms if Zika infection, allowing the virus to spread rapidly in areas with local transmission. Because of this, the CDC recommends all pregnant women with ongoing risk of Zika infection, including residence or frequent travel to areas with active Zika virus transmission, receive screening throughout their pregnancy. Many research groups are fast tracking the development of vaccines, treatments and mosquito control measures to combat further spread of the virus.","Published: August 31, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/type-o-blood-increases-cholera-severity-212658,Type O Blood Increases Cholera Severity Research shows that cholera toxin is more potent in people with most common blood type  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.People with blood type O often get more severely ill from cholera than people of other blood types. New research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis may explain why. In people with blood type O, scientists found that cholera toxin hyperactivates a key signaling molecule in intestinal cells. High levels of that signaling molecule lead to excretion of electrolytes and water   in other words, diarrhea. Cholera is marked by severe diarrhea that can lead to dehydration, shock and even death.  We have shown that blood type influences how strongly cholera toxin activates intestinal cells, leading to diarrhea,  said James Fleckenstein, MD, the study s senior author and an associate professor of medicine and molecular microbiology. The findings are available online in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Cholera sickens 3 million to 5 million people around the world every year, leading to 100,000 to 120,000 deaths, many of them in the Indian subcontinent, where cholera has been endemic for centuries. Closer to home, a cholera epidemic has persisted in Haiti since 2010. The disease was brought by United Nations workers from Nepal. They had traveled to Haiti to help rebuild the country in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. The disease is caused by Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that infects cells of the small intestine. Epidemiologists first noticed four decades ago that people with blood type O were more likely to be hospitalized for cholera than people of other blood types, but the reasons for the difference had never been determined. Although the blood group antigens   A, B, AB and O   are best known for their presence on red blood cells, they also are found on the surface of many other cell types, including the cells that line the intestine. To find out what effect cholera toxin had on intestinal cells carrying different blood group antigens, Fleckenstein, F. Matthew Kuhlmann, MD, Matthew Ciorba, MD, and colleagues used clusters of intestinal epithelial stem cells, called enteroids, that can be grown in the lab and differentiated into mature intestinal cells. Washington University is a leading center in building a biobank of enteroids derived from patients for investigations in personalized medicine. Since these clusters of stem cells are derived from normal intestinal cells from many individuals, they are an improvement over traditional cell lines, which are derived from cancer cells from a single individual and carry mutations that may make them behave differently than normal cells. As part of the study, the researchers treated four groups of enteroids with cholera toxin   two derived from people with blood type A and two from people with blood type O   and measured the amount of a key signaling molecule inside the cells. Enteroids from the other two blood types   B and AB   were not available at the time the study was done. The researchers found that levels of the signaling molecule were roughly twice as high in the cells with the type O antigen than in the cells with type A antigen, suggesting that people with type O antigen who were exposed to cholera toxin would suffer more severe diarrhea.  It is well-established that high levels of this molecule lead to diarrhea, so we re making the assumption that higher levels lead to even more diarrhea,  said Kuhlmann, an instructor in medicine and the lead author on the study.  Unfortunately, we have no way directly to link the responses to the volume of diarrhea and, therefore, the severity of disease.  The researchers confirmed their results in an intestinal cell line originally derived from a person with blood type A. The cell line was modified to produce the type O antigen instead. They found that cholera toxin induced roughly double the amount of the key signaling molecule in cells with type O antigen than in those with type A. Fleckenstein isn t sure why cholera toxin induces different responses in cells with different blood group antigens on their surfaces.  The cholera toxin is known to bind weakly to the ABO antigens, so they may be acting as decoys to draw the toxin away from its true target,  Fleckenstein said.  It may be that the type O antigen just isn t as good of a decoy as the type A antigen.  In the Ganges River delta region of India and Bangladesh, where cholera is highly endemic, blood type O is less common than in the rest of the world. About 37 percent of Indians and 33 percent of Bangladeshis have blood type O, as opposed to 45 percent of people worldwide, according to published research. It is thought that the deadliness of the disease made having the type O antigen a liability, causing the proportion of type O people in endemic regions to drop. The study also illustrates that enteroids, clusters of intestinal stem cells that were developed only in the last few years, can be an important tool for studying infectious diseases of the gut.  The beautiful thing about this research is that we ve taken intestinal cells from people here in Missouri and used them to understand the pathophysiology of a disease that affects people worldwide,  said Ciorba, an assistant professor of medicine and one of the study s authors.  In this particular situation, we knew that the epidemiologists thought that blood type mattered, but using enteroids, we re actually able to see those differences in different people. It s a proof of principle that this system can answer questions of global impact. ","Published: August 31, 2016"

Using this new approach, the scientists have discovered unique genome variants, some of which are linked to cancer development. Studying mutant peptides will help to detect weaknesses in tumor cells in search for more effective drug treatments. The results have been published in the journal Proteomics. Proteomics and Big Data It seems as if the term  big data  is relatively new. However, it is impossible to imagine any science that would not use large amounts of data. In biology, big data enables scientists to, on the one hand, conduct large-scale experiments and extract more useful data from biological material. On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reveal important patterns of high specificity within the large amount of information. To cope with this problem, scientists are increasingly focusing on developing complex algorithms and/or the workflows for filtering and analyzing the data. Proteomics   the large-scale study of proteins of cells and entire organisms   is no exception. Generally, proteins, peptides, and their fragments can be analyzed using mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry provides peptide fragmentation information specific to the amino acid sequence and, thus, allows scientists to identify proteins present in the original sample. A number of algorithms called a search engine are currently available for protein identification. These algorithms take the peptide fragmentation patterns provided by mass spectrometry, match them with a protein database and return the list of proteins corresponding to the experimental data. However, this approach is not entirely suitable for proteins that are not encoded in a reference genome. If a mutant protein from a cancer cell does not present in the search database, then the so-called variant peptide corresponding to the mutated part of the protein  would not be identified. This is where proteogenomics comes in   a rapidly growing area of biological research at the intersection of genomics and proteomics. Variant peptides identified using the proteogenomic approach provide invaluable information for gene annotation   information which is difficult or impossible to ascertain using standard annotation methods. Expansion of the protein database In their paper, the Russian scientists describe a workflow for searching variant peptides from mutant proteins enabling them to compare the mass spectrometry results of different groups and laboratories for unambiguous marking of cancer mutations. The effectiveness of their approach has been tested using HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 (Human Embryonic Kidney 293) cells are a specific cell line originally derived from human embryonic kidney cells grown in a tissue culture. HEK-293 cells have been widely used in cell biology research for many years because of their reliable growth and propensity for transfection. In addition to their own experimental data, the researchers used the mass spectrometry results from two recent  studies analysing HEK-293 cell proteomes. They generated the so-called customized database for proteogenomic analysis based on exome sequencing of HEK-293 cells. An exome is formed by exons (part of a gene that codes an amino acid sequence). As a result, the customized protein database now has 1336 sequences of mutant proteins in addition to the reference database of human proteins.  This simply means that the protein  dictionary  has grown. Without this improvement it would be impossible to find the  wrong  mutant proteins. A cancer cell mutates more often than a regular cell, which is why known differences between proteins in cancer and  reference  cells will help scientists to find out more about tumor cells. With the mass spectrometry data available from two previous studies and the own experimental results, the Russian scientists identified peptides and the corresponding proteins contained in the cell. Using the proteogenomic analysis with an expanded peptide database, the authors discovered 113 unique variant peptide sequences in HEK-293 cells referring to the exons of 103 genes.  Some of the mutations discovered had previously been proven to be connected with different types of cancer. These mutant proteins could possibly facilitate the survival and multiplication of the cells. In particular, one of the variants identified is related to the p53 protein which is known to suppress the malignant transformations.  Our approach may be used to search for cancer-associated mutations based on proteomic analysis. This will help in studying the protein expressions in tumors and provide further basis for developing drugs targeting the mutant proteins produced in tumor cells,  says Dr. Michael Gorshkov, one of the collaborators in the project, the Head of the Laboratory of Physical and Chemical Methods for Structure Analysis at the Institute for Energy Problems of Chemical Physics, and a member of MIPT s Department of Chemical Physics.","Published: August 31, 2016"

The research team suggests that restricting consumption of sharks can have positive health benefits for consumers and for shark conservation, since several of the sharks analyzed in the study are threatened with extinction due to overfishing. Fins and muscle tissue samples were collected from 10 shark species found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans for concentrations of two toxins mercury and  -N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA).  Recent studies have linked BMAA to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  said Deborah Mash, Professor of Neurology and senior author of the study. Researchers at the UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and UM Miller School of Medicine detected concentrations of mercury and BMAA in the fins and muscles of all shark species at levels that may pose a threat to human health. While both mercury and BMAA by themselves pose a health risk, together they may also have synergistic toxic impacts.  Since sharks are predators, living higher up in the food web, their tissues tend to accumulate and concentrate toxins, which may not only pose a threat to shark health, but also put human consumers of shark parts at a health risk,  said the study s lead author Neil Hammerschlag, a research assistant professor at the UM Rosenstiel School and UM Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy. Shark products including shark fins, cartilage and meat are widely consumed in Asia and globally in Asian communities, as a delicacy and as a source of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, dietary supplements containing shark cartilage are consumed globally. Recently scientists have found BMAA in shark fins and shark cartilage supplements. The neurotoxic methyl mercury has been known to bioaccumulate in sharks over their long lifespans. About 16 percent of the world s shark species are threatened with extinction. The shark species sampled in this study range in threat status from least concern (bonnethead shark) to endangered (great hammerhead) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Our results suggest that humans who consume shark parts may be at a risk for developing neurological diseases.  said Mash.  People should be aware and consider restricting consumption of shark parts.  Limiting the consumption of shark parts will have positive health benefits for consumers and positive conservation outcomes for sharks, many of which are threatened with extinction due in part to the growing high demand for shark fin soup and, to a lesser extent, for shark meat and cartilage products.  said Hammerschlag.  The study, titled  Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin BMAA and Mercury in Sharks,  was published in Aug. 16 in the journal Toxins. The study s coauthors include: Neil Hammerschlag; David A.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/vitamin-c-may-boost-leukemia-treatment-213734,Vitamin C May Boost Leukemia Treatment Studies show that supplementing an epigenetic cancer drug with vitamin C enhanced the drug s effectiveness  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A simple adjustment to patients  therapeutic regimen may improve the effectiveness of the standard epigenetic treatment for myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). New findings published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed in lab studies that supplementing an epigenetic cancer drug called decitabine with vitamin C enhanced the drug s ability to impede cancer cell growth and trigger cellular self-destruction in cancer cell lines. A pilot clinical trial based on this work is ongoing in adult patients with MDS or AML at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark. It combines a similar drug called azacitidine  the standard of care therapy with vitamin C. Many cancer patients are deficient in vitamin C; the proposed approach seeks to correct this deficiency rather than overload patients with the vitamin.  If the pilot trial is successful, we plan to pursue a larger trial to explore this strategy s potential as a straightforward and cost-effective way to improve the existing therapy for AML and MDS,  said Peter Jones, Ph.D., D.Sc., co-senior author of the PNAS study, chief scientific officer at Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) and co-leader of the Van Andel Research Institute Stand Up To Cancer (VARI SU2C) Epigenetics Dream Team.  At the same time, we must urge patience and caution. Only a clinical trial that combines azacitidine with the blinded addition of either vitamin C or a placebo will give the true answer as to whether or not vitamin C increases the efficacy of azacitidine in patients. At the same time, we must emphasize that our trial is limited to a certain subset of patients with MDS or AML on a specific therapeutic regimen. We do not have evidence that this approach is appropriate for other cancers or chemotherapies.  The proposed strategy reflects a continuing move toward combination therapies, particularly when it comes to epigenetic approaches, which target the mechanisms that control whether genes are switched  on  or  off.  In cancer, these switches inappropriately activate or silence important genes, such as those that regulate cell growth and life cycle, ultimately leading to tumors. Epigenetic therapies are thought to work in two ways to fix these errors in cancer cells by correcting the  position  of the gene switches and by making the cell appear as though it s infected by a virus, triggering the immune system. The trial is led by Kirsten Gr nb k, M.D., DMSc., chief hematologist and professor at University of Copenhagen s Rigshospitalet and member of the VARI SU2C Epigenetics Dream Team, which is supporting the trial and associated research. It will include 20 patients; preliminary results are expected by spring or summer 2017.  This type of combination therapy is promising but more work is needed to determine its safety and efficacy,  Gr nb k said.  It is truly exciting to consider that there could be a simple and elegant approach to help patients fight MDS and AML. However, as a physician, I strongly urge patients to wait for the results of the clinical trial and to discuss all dietary and supplemental changes with their doctors. ","Published: August 31, 2016"

They examined the effect of meditation on gene expression patterns in both novice and regular meditators. The researchers found that a resort vacation provides a strong and immediate impact on molecular networks associated with stress and immune pathways, in addition to short- term improvements in well-being, as measured by feelings of vitality and distress. A meditation retreat, for those who already used meditation regularly, was associated with molecular networks characterized by antiviral activity. The molecular signature of long-term meditators was distinct from the non-meditating vacationers. The study was published today in Springer Nature's journal Translational Psychiatry. The study involved 94 healthy women, aged 30-60. Sixty-four women were recruited who were not regular meditators. Participants stayed at the same resort in California for six days, and randomized so that half were simply on vacation while the other half joined a meditation training program run by the Chopra Center for Well Being. The meditation program included training in mantra meditation, yoga, and self reflection exercises. It was designed by Deepak Chopra, MD, who did not participate in data collection or analysis. For greater insight into the long-term effects of what scientists dubbed the ""meditation effect"" compared to the ""vacation effect,"" the team also studied a group of 30 experienced meditators who were already enrolled in the retreat that week. Researchers collected blood samples, and surveys, from all participants immediately before and after their stay, as well as surveys one month and ten months later. ""In the spirit of other research efforts we have pioneered with other groups, this work underscores the importance of studies focused on healthy people,"" said Eric Schadt, PhD, senior author on the paper and the Jean C. and James W. Crystal Professor of Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Founding Director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology. ""By combining an interrogation of gene networks with advanced data analysis and statistics, we have generated clinically meaningful information about stress and aging that is relevant to the broader population."" The research team examined the changes in 20,000 genes to determine which types of genes were changing before and after the resort experience. Scientists performed an integrative transcriptomic analysis, comparing gene expression networks across all three groups of participants and finding unique molecular profiles and pathway enrichment patterns. Study results show that all groups   novice meditators, experienced meditators, and vacationers   had significant changes in molecular network patterns after the week at the resort, with a clear signature distinguishing baseline from post-vacation biology. The most notable changes in gene activity were related to stress response and immune function. Researchers assessed self-reported measures of well being. While all groups showed improvements up to one month later, the novice meditators had fewer symptoms of depression and less stress much longer than the non-meditating vacationers. The psychological effects appear to be enduring and it is unknown how much of this longer lasting benefit may be due to continued practice or lasting changes in how people view events in their lives. ""It's intuitive that taking a vacation reduces biological processes related to stress, but it was still impressive to see the large changes in gene expression from being away from the busy pace of life, in a relaxing environment, in such a short period of time. These findings will have to be replicated to see if the changes are reliably invoked under the same circumstances, in future studies, and compared to an at-home control group,"" said Elissa S. Epel, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry at University of California, San Francisco and first author of the study. ""Based on our results, the benefit we experience from meditation isn't strictly psychological; there is a clear and quantifiable change in how our bodies function,"" said Rudolph Tanzi, PhD, the Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy Professor of Neurology at Harvard University, and Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Meditation is one of the ways to engage in restorative activities that may provide relief for our immune systems, easing the day-to-day stress of a body constantly trying to protect itself. The prediction is that this would then lead to healthier aging.""","Published: August 31, 2016"

The work, published in Nature Communications, suggests some Tasmanian devil populations are evolving genetic resistance to DFTD that could help the species avoid extinction.  Additionally, the genomic data will support future medical research exploring how animals evolve rapidly in response to cancer and other pathogens.  Our study suggests hope for the survival of the Tasmanian devil in the face of this devastating disease,  Storfer said.  Ultimately, it may also help direct future research addressing important questions about the evolution of cancer transmissibility and what causes remission and reoccurrence in cancer and other diseases.  Disease kills 80 percent Tasmanian devils are the largest carnivorous marsupials in the world and an integral part of Australia s natural heritage. Devils display significant aggression toward one another, which often involves biting on the face. This sometimes transmits DFTD, one of only three known forms of transmissible cancer and by far the most deadly. Twenty years since its discovery, DFTD has wiped out an estimated 80 percent of devils in Tasmania, the only place in the world where the animals live. By comparison, canine transmissible venereal tumor, a sexually transmitted form of cancer that only affects dogs, has been around for at least 11,000 years and is generally not fatal to domesticated animals. Collections offer unique research opportunity Despite models that predicted extinction, populations of Tasmanian devils at long-diseased sites persist. Storfer, an evolutionary geneticist who has studied DFTD for nearly a decade, teamed up with colleagues in the United States, Great Britain and Australia to investigate whether there was a genetic component to some of the devils  survival.  If a disease comes in and knocks out 90 percent of the individuals, you might predict the 10 percent who survive are somehow genetically different,  said study co-author Paul Hohenlohe, assistant professor of biology at the University of Idaho.  What we were looking for were the parts of the genome that show that difference.  The researchers mined a vast trove of devil DNA collected and stored before and after the outbreak of DFTD by wildlife ecologist and associate professor Menna Jones, study co-author, and her research team at the University of Tasmania. Hopeful of breeding resistant devils The frequency of genes in specific regions of the old DNA were compared to the frequency of genes in corresponding regions of DNA collected following DFTD emergence at three sites on Tasmania. Storfer and colleagues identified two small genomic regions in the DNA samples from all three sites that exhibited significant changes in response to the strong selection imposed by the disease. Five of seven genes in the two regions were related to cancer or immune function in other mammals, suggesting that Tasmanian devils are indeed evolving resistance to DFTD. The researchers are in the process of determining the specific functionality of the genomic regions identified in the study. They are hopeful that disease free devils with the apparently DFTD resistant DNA can be bred to enhance the genetic diversity of an off-island captive insurance population in case devil reintroductions are needed in the future.","Published: August 31, 2016"

This could be a prime example for creating new non-natural metabolic pathways inside living cells, as reported today in Nature. The artificial metalloenzyme, termed biot-Ru SAV, was created using the biotin streptavidin technology. This method relies on the high affinity of the protein streptavidin for the vitamin biotin, where compounds bound to biotin can be introduced into the protein to generate artificial enzymes. In this study the authors introduced an organometallic compound, with the metal ruthenium at its base. Organometallic compounds are molecules containing at least one bond between a metal and a carbon atom, and are often used as catalysts in industrial chemical reactions. However, organometallic catalysts perform poorly, if at all, in aqueous solutions or cellular-like environments, and need to be incorporated into protein scaffolds like streptavidin to overcome these limitations.  The goal was to create an artificial metalloenzyme that can catalyse olefin metathesis, a reaction mechanism that is not present among natural enzymes,  says Thomas R Ward, Professor at the Department of Chemistry, University of Basel, and senior author of the study. The olefin metathesis reaction is a method for the formation and redistribution of carbon-carbon double bonds widely used in laboratory research and large-scale industrial productions of various chemical products. Biot-Ru SAV catalyses a ring-closing metathesis to produce a fluorescent molecule for easy detection and quantification. Periplasm as reaction compartment However, the environment inside a living cell is far from ideal for the proper functioning of organometallic-based enzymes.  The main breakthrough was the idea to use the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction compartment, whose environment is much better suited for an olefin metathesis catalyst,  says Markus Jeschek, a researcher from the team of co-supervising author Sven Panke at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich in Basel. The periplasm, the space between the inner cytoplasmic membrane and the bacterial outer membrane in gram-negative bacteria, contains low concentrations of metalloenzymes inhibitors, such as glutathione. Having found ideal in vivo conditions, the authors went a step forward and decided to optimize biot-Ru SAV by applying principles of directed evolution, a method that mimics the process of natural selection to evolve proteins with enhanced properties or activities.  We could then develop a simple and robust screening method that allowed us to test thousands of biot-Ru SAV mutants and identify the most active variant,  Ward explains. Not only could the authors markedly improve the catalytic properties of biot-Ru SAV, but they could also show that organometallic-based enzymes can be engineered and optimized for different substrates, thus producing a variety of different chemical products.  The exciting thing about this is that artificial metalloenzymes like biot-Ru SAV can be used to produce novel high added-value chemicals,  Ward says.  It has a lot of potential to combine both chemical and biological tools to ultimately utilize cells as molecular factories. ","Published: August 31, 2016"

Macrophages are the  guards  that patrol most tissues of the body - poised to engulf infections or destroy and repair damaged tissue. Over the last decade it has been established that macrophages are capable of detecting changes in the microenvironment of human tissues. They can spot pathogen invasion and tissue damage, and mediate inflammatory processes in response, to destroy microbial interlopers and remove and repair damaged tissue. But how do these sentinels of the cell world deal with infection and tissue injury? Dr Anna Piccinini, an expert in inflammatory signalling pathways in the School of Pharmacy at The University of Nottingham, has discovered that the macrophage s  destroy and repair service  is capable of discriminating between the two distinct threats even deploying a single sensor. As a result, they can orchestrate specific immune responses   passing on information in the form of inflammatory molecules and degrading tissue when they encounter an infection and making and modifying molecular components of the tissue when they detect tissue damage. Dr Piccinini s research is published in the academic journal Science Signaling. Her findings could provide future targets for the treatment of diseases with extensive tissue damage such as arthritis or cancer where inflammation plays an increasingly recognised role. Dr Piccinini said:  Although we know macrophages are capable of detecting different threats using a single sensor we have never really understood whether they use the same or distinct defence strategies depending on the kind of threat they are confronted with.  And, what is interesting is that we are also understanding better how macrophage behaviour affects the microenvironment around them.  This research was funded by the Medical Research Council, Arthritis Research UK and the Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research. The work was carried out at the University of Oxford in Professor Kim Midwood s laboratory. Dr Piccinini said:  This research paves the way to identify specific molecular events that arise from the cell s specific response to infection and sterile tissue damage and in future may allow us to find specific targets to manipulate inflammation.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/molecule-prevents-effect-of-chemotherapy-201353,Molecule Prevents Effect of Chemotherapy  Danish researchers from Aarhus University Hospital and Aarhus University have made a possible breakthrough in the treatment of colorectal cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Annually about 2000 Danish patients with colorectal cancer are treated with chemotherapy. Today, a range of different chemotherapeutic regimens are available. However, deciding which regimen to use is not easy. Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to predict which regimen will be most beneficial for the individual patient and for a large number of patients their cancer cells are actually resistant to the chosen treatment. Roughly half of the treated patients do not benefit from their first-line treatment   the cancer cells are not killed   and the patients sometimes only experience the serious side effects of the treatment. ""The challenge is that we do not know beforehand in which 50% the treatment will work. This means we have to treat all patients in the same way   including the 50% who do not benefit, "" says Claus Lindbjerg Andersen, head of the research team at Department of Molecular Medicine at Aarhus University Hospital. For the last three years the research team has been working on the development of a so-called biomarker to predict treatment effectiveness. Now the researchers found a molecule which is closely associated with the effect of Oxaliplatin treatment, an anti-cancer drug widely used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. ""Patients with tumours positive for the molecule actually have a six times higher risk of being treatment-resistant than other patients "", says Mads Heilskov Rasmussen, Postdoc, who together with PhD student Iben Lyskj r has been driving forces in the research project. Normally cells would die when treated with Oxaliplatin, however cancer cells expressing the molecule   a so-called microRNA - do not respond. The research group has shown that it is the microRNA molecule that directly prevents the cancer cells from eliciting the normal response to the drug.  In principle, this discovery opens up for the possibility to examine if a patient's tumour has the microRNA biomarker before treatment is initiated  says Claus Lindbjerg Andersen.  If so, the patient should not be treated with Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy but instead with one of the other anti-cancer drugs available  Mads Heilskov Rasmussen adds. ""It is approximately 20% of the patients who have the microRNA and can start another treatment and thus do not have to go through an ineffective Oxaliplatin treatment,"" says Mads Heilskov Rasmussen. ""In this way the patients can avoid the side-effects of an ineffective treatment"". ""Our discovery also opens up for development of new treatment strategies as we have shown that if the microRNA is eliminated from the tumor, the effect of Oxaliplatin is restored"" says Claus Lindbjerg Andersen. Accordingly, combination therapies could be a way forward.","Published: August 31, 2016"

They hope to reveal universal details about how viruses infect the intestine of animals, including humans, and how to fight them. The five-year award for $1.25 million will help the researchers continue their study of the Orsay virus, the only one known to infect Caenorhabditis elegans, a species of nematode that is ideal for biological study because of its simplicity and transparency. The worm and its virus brought Tao and Zhong together several years ago when they became the first to define the crystal structure of the Orsay virus through X-ray crystallography, a specialty of Tao s lab. The work revealed details of the viral capsid, the hard shell that protects Orsay s infectious contents until it can be delivered to a cell. The virus infects the nematode s digestive tract.  We can t see the virus, but we can see the intestine cells,  said Zhong, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology.  The worm s natural lifespan is only two weeks, so we can watch what happens every day as the infection progresses.   This study will help us to understand how gastrointestinal viruses impact humans,  said Tao, an associate professor of biochemistry and cell biology.  Intestinal cells are very hard to culture because they lose their polarity once you grow them in a petri dish.  C. elegans  intestinal cells have a similar structure to humans , and we can use them as a model to understand how the virus is directed toward the apical membrane of the intestinal cell and gets released without disrupting the cell, causing it to lyse (break down),  she said.  The bigger picture is to try to understand how the virus interacts with the host at different stages of the infection,  Tao said.  For example, we want to know how viruses interact with a receptor and get into the cell, how it interacts with the host cell to ensure replication of the genome and, during the later stage, how it modifies the host system to ensure the release of the viral particle.  Tao and Zhong also plan to map C. elegans  antiviral pathways through computer models and experiments. They expect to shed light on the mechanisms used by such gastrointestinal viruses as rotavirus, astrovirus and norovirus.  Worms are different; humans have innate immunity and acquired immunity,  Zhong said.  We have antigens that help build up antibodies, but worms do not. They only have innate immunity, but not the specialized immune cells.   One of the things we study is how to use host immunity to fight the virus,  she said.  For example, worms can be used to find what genes are involved in antiviral immunity. We can then check whether these genes are homologues of genes that humans also have. It s likely the mechanism of how these worms fight viruses will give us some insight into human-virus interactions. ","Published: August 31, 2016"

In June, Inovio was the first to commence a human Zika trial, with sites in the U.S. and Canada. All 40 subjects for the first clinical study have been fully enrolled and dosed. Inovio expects to report results before the end of this year. There are no approved vaccines or therapies for Zika virus infection. While multiple companies and academic groups have announced development plans for Zika virus vaccines, only Inovio and a US government research center have started human clinical studies. Inovio s second clinical study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 160 healthy adult volunteers (80 subjects will receive vaccine and 80 subjects will receive placebo) to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of GLS-5700 administered with Inovio s CELLECTRA -3P device. This proprietary intradermal DNA vaccine delivery device has been shown to maximize antigen expression and immune responses in multiple human studies.

The disease is caused by the pathogenic fungus Ramularia collo-cygni. Now a team of scientists studying this fungus have sequenced and explored its genome. Their work helps to illuminate how the fungus causes disease in barley, and enables future studies to investigate why Ramularia leaf spot has become a threat to barley production and a serious economic problem. The scientists performed the work at Scotland s Rural College (SRUC), The University of Edinburgh's Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Edinburgh Genomics facility, and Rothamsted Research, which receives strategic funding from BBSRC. The study is published this week in the journal BMC Genomics. The fungus Ramularia collo-cygni can live between the cells inside of barley plants without causing symptoms for many weeks. However, when conditions change inside the plant, the fungus becomes aggressive. It secretes plant toxins that produce brown, rectangular lesions within a yellow ring, which are visible on both sides of the leaves. The leaves die prematurely, reducing photosynthesis, and causing yield losses of up to 70%. How the fungus makes these toxins, and the role the toxins play in colonising the plants, remain largely unknown, but the new study has identified a large number of genes involved in secreting potentially toxic chemicals and proteins. The recent emergence of the disease as a major problem for barley-growers may be due to recent genetic changes to the fungus or to barley plants, or may result from other changes to farming practice. UK farmers produce about 7.3 million tonnes of barley each year, worth around  1Bn. Roughly a quarter of the barley is used to produce beers, whiskeys and other drinks, and the remainder is predominantly used as animal feed. Professor Kim Hammond-Kosack, a senior scientist at Rothamsted Research and one of the study s authors, said:  It is probable that this fungus produces a complex arsenal of toxins to help it to colonise barley plants. By studying the expression of genes at different stages of the life of the fungus and in various environmental scenarios, we may be able to discover toxins that we don t yet know about, and find out more about the mechanisms that regulate the formation of disease symptoms.  The genome also supports current ideas about how the fungus evolved. The scientists confirmed the classification of the fungus within the same group as other plant pathogens, and as a close relative of Zymoseptoria tritici, the cause of Septoria tritici (leaf) blotch in wheat. They found common genes thought to play a role in concealing the fungus from the plant s immune system. Dr Jason Rudd, a senior scientist at Rothamsted Research and another of the study s authors added:  Barley is the UK s second most common crop after wheat, so Ramularia leaf spot has big consequences for farmers here as well as in other important barley growing regions across Europe and South America. The large overall similarity in the genome sequences between Ramularia and Zymoseptoria suggests they may both be open to a common future disease-prevention strategy. The bits which differ will most probably explain why they are particular for barley and wheat crops, respectively. We hope our data will provide the foundation for scientists to try new approaches to treating these diseases. ","Published: August 31, 2016"

The partnerships will see researchers from multiple disciplines at six UK centres of excellence work in collaboration with Chinese counterparts, thanks to match funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) to foster collaboration across borders and between diverse disciplines to help stop the growing global burden posed by AMR. The discovery and introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s gave us the ability to prevent women dying from post-childbirth infection, to treat tuberculosis and for farmers to protect crops and harvest from infection. However, as microorganisms become resistant to antimicrobial treatments, including antibiotics, there is a very real possibility that the drugs we have come to rely upon may become obsolete. Cross border collaboration is a vital step to progress in this global risk. Speaking on behalf of the collaborating UK Research Councils, Mark Palmer, Head of International at MRC, said:  The growing resistance of micro-organisms to antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotics is a public health issue of global importance and it requires an urgent global response. The outcomes of these awards will benefit both the UK and China through the sharing of knowledge, and hopefully lead to significant impacts on health and policy.  Professor Lu Rongkai, Deputy Director General, Bureau of International Cooperation, NSFC, said:  Antimicrobial resistance is now widely recognised as one of the most serious global threat to human health in the 21st centuries. The global spread of some infectious diseases has led to an increase in antibiotics usage, with the inevitable risk of emerging resistance. These jointly awarded grants are expected to combat this problem in both China and UK, and even to promote global progress in human public health science.  The UK Research Councils support research, capability and training to pursue a range of strategies to tackle this global problem. Years of research mean that we are now in a better position than ever to understand microbes such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, how they interact with their hosts, and to identify possible routes for alternative diagnostics and treatments. The UK-Chinese partnerships, as part of the UK-China AMR Partnership Initiative, will bring together leading researchers from both countries, and from multiple scientific disciplines, in order to better understand the emergence and spread of bacteria, develop new interventions, and improve health and agricultural systems.

The research looks to optimise resilience, productivity and sustainability across the food system, ensure resilient supply chains and influence food choices to relieve pressure on global food systems. The successful projects will focus specifically on increasing crop and livestock tolerance to weather, emerging diseases, price volatility and other environmental and social shocks and include the development of models that can be used by the food security community globally. Science Minister Jo Johnson said:  From disease protection to improving management of global food shocks, these research projects will help tackle the serious threat of food shortages. Supporting these exciting and innovative solutions will help the UK food industry be better prepared for external factors and help provide food security to millions around the world.  Professor Tim Benton, Global Food Security Champion, said:  Stability of supply and access is an essential element of food security. Ensuring our food systems are resilient is therefore crucial, especially as the world is changing rapidly   whether from the weather or from social and political change.  Professor Melanie Welham, BBSRC Chief Executive, said:  This investment will help ensure that the UK food system is primed to face challenges in a changing climate by building resilience at all levels.

Using a hand-held, USB-powered sequencing device called the MinION, astronaut Kate Rubins, PhD, sequenced samples of mouse, bacteria and virus DNA. This portable sequencing technology could eventually help diagnose sick astronauts, monitor space station food, water, and environment for microbes, and identify extraterrestrial life forms. As part of a collaboration with NASA on the Biomolecular Sequencer project, Earth-bound researchers   a bicoastal team at UCSF and Weill Cornell Medical College   analyzed the sequencing data from space and compared it to identical samples sequenced on the ground. The analysis would tell whether the journey to space and conditions aboard the space station affected the sequencing results. Charles Chiu, MD, PhD, director of the UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, led the team at UCSF.  Up until recently technology for sequencing in space hasn t been available because sequencers are generally large bulky instruments,  Chiu said. The pocket-sized MinION employs a technology known as nanopore sequencing, which sends an ionic current through tiny pores in natural cell membranes. As DNA molecules pass through these nanopores one by one, the changes in ion flow are recorded and used to decode the DNA sequence. A sequencing run can take as little as 10 minutes. Chiu said a big unknown was whether the microgravity in space would affect the microfluidics of the sequencing device.  It didn t turn out to be a huge problem,  Chiu said. His team s analysis of the space and Earth data found comparable results.  We essentially got equivalent data, and it s of very high quality, probably within the top 20 percent of nanopore runs that we do routinely here on Earth,  Chiu said. Besides its portability, another advantage of nanopore sequencing is its ability to rapidly sequence any and all genetic material in a sample, even from organisms that have never been encountered before. Most conventional sequencing methods are confined to a target approach   researchers have to know what they re looking for and must set up the sequencing accordingly. Chiu has used nanopore sequencing to test for emerging outbreaks like Ebola and Zika without the need to design a custom diagnostic test. The MinION, made by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, has been employed at field laboratories in some of the remotest areas on Earth   and may someday take a trip to Mars. In this initial proof-of-principle experiment, the samples were prepared on Earth. On future missions, sample preparation, sequencing, and real-time analysis on a laptop could all be completed in space, and the capacity to do so would be critical for long-term space exploration, Chiu said.  Onboard sequencing makes it possible for the crew to know what is in their environment at any time,  said project manager and NASA microbiologist Sarah Castro-Wallace, PhD, in a press release.  That allows us on the ground to take appropriate action   do we need to clean this up right away, or will taking antibiotics help or not? We can resupply the station with disinfectants and antibiotics now, but once crews move beyond the station s low Earth orbit, we need to know when to save those precious resources and when to use them.

Princeton University researchers show in a new study how our brains combine complicated observations from our surroundings into a simple assessment of the situation that aids our behavior and decisions. This boiled-down representation also is flexible enough to account for new information as it becomes available. The researchers found that our brains can accurately track the likelihood of several different explanations for what we see around us. They traced these abilities to a region of the brain located just behind our eyes known as the orbitofrontal cortex. This work is published in the Journal of Neuroscience. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making ""When I try to cross the street, I'm not actually analyzing every bit of the scene,"" said Yael Niv, an associate professor of psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) who co-authored the study. ""I'm constructing a narrative that I base my decision on, such as, 'That car is slowing down because of the red light.'"" First author Stephanie Chan, who earned her doctorate in neuroscience from Princeton in 2016, hypothesized that the brain keeps track of these possibilities in a way that is simpler than a comprehensive description of the situation, but more complex than a single explanation. She investigated the idea that the brain calculates a distribution of probabilities for each of many distinct possibilities. To find out where and how the brain tracks these probabilities, the team needed to coax their study participants to compare probabilities without thinking about actual numbers. If participants tried explicitly to do the math, they would fail, said co-author Kenneth Norman, professor of psychology and PNI. ""Our brains are horrible at arithmetic. Our implicit computations are so much better than our explicit computations,"" Norman said. Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisionsTo study these implicit computations, the team tracked the brain activity of participants as they explored a virtual ""safari park"" split into four zones blue, green, pink and yellow. Each zone contained a different assortment of elephants, giraffes, hippos, lions and zebras. The task forced the brain to use previous observations of these animals to decide in which colored zones various arrangements of the animals were likely to be found. Princeton University researchers found that our brains combine complicated observations from our surroundings into a simple assessment of the situation that aids our behavior, is flexible enough to account for new information, and can accurately track the likelihood of several different explanations for what we see (A). They studied the brain while participants played a game (B) that required them to classify five different animals into the correct zones -- blue, yellow, green and pink -- in a safari park. After becoming acquainted with the animal populations in the four zones of the virtual safari park (C), participants saw a series of animal pictures and had to correctly determine in which of two zones the animals were most likely to belong (D), even when neither of the two zones was the most likely choice. Functional magnetic resonance imaging indicated that this is because the brain region known as the orbitofrontal cortex correctly tracked the probabilities that the various animals belonged to different zones. Credit: Safari map by Stephanie Chan. Animals courtesy of Science With Me  First, participants saw a series of pictures of the animals in each zone a collection of 30 to 40 animals shown one after the other. After getting a sense of how the animals were distributed across the different zones, the participants viewed a new series of animal pictures that showed between one and six animals. They were asked which of two zones the animals were more likely to have come from. For example, a participant might be shown two lions and a zebra, and then be asked whether they were more likely in the green zone or the blue. In many cases, these questions did not give the most likely zone as an option. By forcing participants to choose between two zones that were not the most likely overall, the researchers could measure how well participants tracked the relative likelihoods of all four zones. Because every animal appeared at least occasionally in every zone, the participants could not unambiguously point to a single zone, or even eliminate one zone from the options. For instance, a group of two zebras and a lion might point to the green zone, where both animals are most common, but those three animals could conceivably appear in any zone and adding a hippo to the collection might suddenly make the green zone most likely. Participants were consistently able to correctly choose the more likely of the two zones. What's more, participants' accuracy didn't suffer when choosing between two zones which were not the most likely overall, indicating that they could track the relative likelihood of all four zones. To find out where the brain performs this feat, the researchers had participants perform the task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which reveals the regions of the brain that are most active at a given time. The researchers expected the brain to track the situation as a series of four probabilities one for each zone so they looked for brain regions in which the pattern of activity changed together with the four probabilities. The best match for this search was the orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in carrying out complex plans, learning how a setting or situation has changed since last seen, and high-order thinking. The findings refine the previous hypotheses that this region of the brain provides intellectual flexibility, Niv said. ""It's not just the flexibility area, it's your model of how the situation works,"" she said. Don't Miss: ""Memory region"" of the brain also involved in conflict resolution Knowing when to change that model whether you're moving from zone-to-zone in a virtual safari, or place-to-place in the habitats of our evolutionary predecessors would have given our ancestors an advantage over animals that behave by the same rules in all situations. ""There's an adaptive advantage to having a brain that can say that the world works differently in different situations, but then you need to be able to figure out which area is relevant right now,"" Norman said.

Scientists from the Institut Pasteur and the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS, France) set out to shed further light on the properties attributed to nicotine which is known to have an adverse effect on health by determining the precise structure of the nicotinic receptors in the hippocampus region of the brain. Using mouse models for Alzheimer's disease, they identified the  2 subunit of the nicotinic receptor as a target that, if blocked, prevents the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's. These results are published in Neurobiology of Aging. See Also: Study findings challenge a scientific principle about amyloid beta Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two types of lesion: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. Amyloid beta peptide, naturally present in the brain, builds up over the years as a result of genetic and environmental factors until it forms amyloid plaques. This build-up is toxic for nerve cells and leads to a loss of neuronal structure and to what is known as ""neurofibrillary"" degeneration, which in turn results in the death of nerve cells. By the time amyloid plaques appear in the brain, patients' memory loss is already considerable and irreversible. The aim of current research into this disease is therefore to detect amyloid beta peptide at an earlier stage, when it is still soluble, before the plaques appear. In this study, scientists from the Integrative Neurobiology of Cholinergic Systems Unit (Institut Pasteur / CNRS), directed by Uwe Maskos, investigated the toxic effects of a build-up of amyloid beta peptide in the hippocampus and the role of the nicotinic receptor in this same region of the brain. Learn More: Amyloid probes gain powers in search for Alzheimer's causeAcetylcholine receptors, also known as nicotinic receptors, are found in the cell membrane and are sensitive to neurotransmitters. They act like pores for communication between the cell's internal environment and the outside world. These receptors are involved in several functions of the nervous system, especially in controlling voluntary movements, memory, attention, sleep, pain and anxiety. Nicotine is an agonist for these receptors, meaning that it can act on these targets instead of acetylcholine. Nine genes code for nicotinic receptor subunits in the hippocampus, and four of these subunits are part of the receptor involved in this process ( 2 twice,  2,  4 and  5). The scientists are working to determine the exact composition of this pentamer so that they can assess its suitability as a pharmaceutical target on which therapeutic molecules can be tested. They decided to focus specifically on the role of the  2 subunit of the nicotinic receptor. To do this, they created a mouse model in which the  2 subunit was inactivated by blocking the gene coding for it. Memory tests performed on this model showed that the individuals were protected from the toxic effects of amyloid beta peptide and did not develop the cognitive deficit associated with Alzheimer's disease. The scientists were therefore able to prove that the  2 subunit of the nicotinic receptor is the direct target of soluble amyloid beta peptide. Don't Miss: Is the amyloid hypothesis the right path to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease? ""Characterizing this new therapeutic target will enable us to test molecules that are capable of blocking the  2 subunit.

The researchers note that vocabulary learning ""does not appear to be a uniquely human capacity that follows from the emergence of language, but rather a more ancient function that can be exploited to link arbitrary sound sequences to meanings."" See Also: The brain watched during language learningWords are the basic building blocks of human languages, but they are hardly ever found in nonhuman vocal communications. Intonation is another way that information is conveyed through speech, where, for example, praises tend to be conveyed with higher and more varying pitch. Humans understand speech through both vocabulary and intonation. In the work, the researchers whether dogs also depend on both mechanisms. Dogs were exposed to recordings of their trainers' voices as the trainers spoke to them using multiple combinations of vocabulary and intonation, in both praising and neutral ways. For example, trainers spoke praise words with a praising intonation, praise words with a neutral intonation, neutral words with a praising intonation, and neutral words with neutral intonation. Credit: Eniko Kubinyi  Researchers used fMRI to analyze the dogs' brain activity as the animals listened to each combination. Their results reveal that, regardless of intonation, dogs process vocabulary, recognizing each word as distinct, and further, that they do so in a way similar to humans, using the left hemisphere of the brain. Also like humans, the researchers found that dogs process intonation separately from vocabulary, in auditory regions in the right hemisphere of the brain. Lastly, and also like humans, the team found that the dogs relied on both word meaning and intonation when processing the reward value of utterances. Thus, dogs seem to understand both human words and intonation.

While looking for ways to make tomatoes and other crop plants more productive, BTI Assistant Professor Joyce Van Eck and former postdoctoral scientist Sarika Gupta developed a better method for  transforming  a tomato   a process that involves inserting DNA into the tomato genome and growing a new plant. By adding the plant hormone auxin to the medium that supports the growth of the cells, they can speed up the plant s growth, ultimately accelerating the pace of their research. They describe this advance in a study published in Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture. Typically, transformation works by using the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens to insert a new segment of DNA into the cells of tomato seedling tissues. The transformed cells grow on plant regeneration medium, which contains nutrients and hormones that cause the tissue to develop into a tiny new plant. These plantlets are then transferred to root induction medium where they grow roots, before being planted in soil to harden in the greenhouse. In the new method, the Van Eck lab adds auxin to the regeneration and rooting media. The addition reduces the length of the procedure from 17 weeks to just 11.  If you can speed up the plant development, which is what the auxin is doing, you can decrease the time it takes to get genetically engineered lines,  said Van Eck. Researchers in the Van Eck lab perform tomato transformations routinely, as a research method to understand how individual genes affect tomato growth and development. Their new protocol not only saves time, but uses fewer materials and saves money. The researchers can then finish experiments sooner and potentially run more projects at once. The project came out of a collaboration with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to identify gene pathways that could be used to breed crops with higher yields.  We re looking at the genes and gene networks involved in stem cell proliferation, meristem development and flowering and branching,  said Van Eck,  with the end goal being that maybe genes that we identify in tomato, which is strictly being used as a model, might help us understand what can be done to increase yield in other crops.

In a summary of their work, published in Nature Medicine on Aug. 29, the investigators say they screened 6,000 existing compounds currently in late-stage clinical trials or already approved for human use for other conditions, and identified several compounds that showed the ability to hinder or halt the progress of the Zika virus in lab-grown human neural cells. The research collaboration includes teams from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health and Florida State University.  It takes years if not decades to develop a new drug,  says Hongjun Song, Ph.D., director of the Stem Cell Program in the Institute of Cell Engineering at Johns Hopkins.  In this sort of global health emergency, we don t have that kind of time.   So instead of using new drugs, we chose to screen existing drugs,  adds Guo-li Ming, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  In this way, we hope to create a therapy much more quickly.  The new findings are an extension of previous work by the research team, which found that Zika mainly targets specialized stem cells that give rise to neurons in the brain s outer layer, the cortex. The researchers observed Zika s effects in two- and three-dimensional cell cultures called  mini-brains,  which share structures with the human brain and allow researchers to study the effects of Zika in a more accurate model for human infection. In the current study, the research team exposed similar cell cultures to the Zika virus and the drugs one at a time, measuring for indicators of cell death, including caspase-3 activity, a chemical marker of cell death, and ATP, a molecule whose presence is indicative of cell vitality. Typically, after Zika infection, the damage done to neural cells is  dramatic and irreversible,  says Hengli Tang, Ph.D., professor of biological sciences at Florida State University. However, some of the compounds tested allowed the cells to survive longer and, in some cases, fully recover from infections. Further analysis of the surviving cells, says Ming, showed that the promising drugs could be divided into two classes: neuroprotective drugs, which prevent the activation of mechanisms that cause cell death, and antiviral drugs, which slow or stop viral infection or replication. Overall, Song says, three drugs showed robust enough results to warrant further study: PHA-690509, an investigational compound with antiviral properties; emricasan, now in clinical trials to reduce liver damage from hepatitis C virus and shown to have neuroprotective effects; and niclosamide, a drug already used in humans and livestock to combat parasitic infections, which worked as an antiviral agent in these experiments. Song cautioned that the three drugs  are very effective against Zika in the dish, but we don t know if they can work in humans in the same way.  For example, he says, although niclosamide can safely treat parasites in the human gastrointestinal tract, scientists have not yet determined if the drug can even penetrate the central nervous system of adults or a fetus inside a carrier s womb to treat the brain cells targeted by Zika. Nor, he says, do they know if the drugs would address the wide range of effects of Zika infection, which include microcephaly in fetuses and temporary paralysis from Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults.   To address these questions, additional studies need to be done in animal models as well as humans to demonstrate their ability to treat Zika infection,  says Ming.  So we could still be years away from finding a treatment that works.  The researchers say their next steps include testing the efficacy of these drugs in animal models to see if they have the ability to combat Zika in vivo. Zika was first identified in 1947 and garnered little scientific interest until an outbreak began in South America in mid-2015. This outbreak is now known to be responsible for an increase in cases of microcephaly   a severe birth defect in which afflicted infants are born with underdeveloped brains. In the continental United States, there have been a total of 2,260 reported cases of Zika. Though most cases are associated with travel, 43 cases of local transmission have been reported in Florida, in the Miami area. In addition, Puerto Rico has reported 7,855 locally transmitted cases, spurring the Obama administration to declare a public health emergency in the territory on Aug. 12. From these reports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that up to 270 babies may be born with microcephaly by 2017. The CDC is advising preventive measures for people in these areas, including eliminating standing water where mosquitos breed and creating a barrier from bites with clothing and wearing insect repellents. The Florida Department of Health has a robust mosquito-borne illness surveillance system. It has partnered with local groups and the CDC to fight Zika infections, and is providing free Zika testing to all pregnant women. The Puerto Rico Department of Health has put an active Zika surveillance system in place to coordinate reporting from health care providers and weekly mosquito spraying in many areas. The Zika virus is commonly transmitted from mosquito bites or from an infected person to an uninfected person through sexual contact. Despite the potential effects of infection, only one in four infected people will present symptoms of Zika infection, allowing the virus to spread rapidly in areas with local transmission. Because of this, the CDC recommends all pregnant women with ongoing risk of Zika infection, including residence or frequent travel to areas with active Zika virus transmission, receive screening throughout their pregnancy. Many research groups are fast tracking the development of vaccines, treatments and mosquito control measures to combat further spread of the virus.","Published: August 30, 2016"

Looking to accelerate the pace of discovery and the path to sustainable solutions, the team set out to develop a novel bacterial host that will drastically reduce the amount of time scientists spend on each experiment and workflow and to enhance productivity of the resulting new host. After screening for the fastest-growing strain and optimizing methods for introducing DNA into those cells at high efficiencies, the team developed genome engineering tools to improve the performance of Vmax  for common biotech applications, namely, recombinant protein expression and molecular cloning. These breakthroughs build on expertise gleaned during the creation of the first synthetic cell and first minimal cell and again position SGI at the forefront of synthetic biology.  This work provides a game-changing alternative to E. coli, the organism that has been a laboratory staple for decades, and again highlights the rapid and innovative synthetic biology expertise we ve developed at SGI. We are in the process of designing and synthesizing new Vmax  cells that operate at even higher efficiencies and productivity as we move toward a next-generation host for protein production , said Daniel Gibson, Vice President, DNA Technologies, SGI. Commenting on the origin of the research, Todd Peterson, Chief Technology Officer at SGI stated,  Despite the known drawbacks and shortcomings, scientists have been necessitated to use E. coli as a laboratory host primarily because there have been no suitable alternatives. We deployed our synthetic biology expertise to develop a new host strain that will drastically improve upon the traditional methods and tools.  Typical cloning projects using E. coli competent cells span several days starting from the time a cloning process is initiated to the time plasmid DNA is prepared. Cloning strategies employing Vmax  developed by the SGI team shorten that time to as little as one day. The advancements described by the team set the stage for commercialization of these next-generation cells for cloning and protein expression by SGI in the coming months. Vmax  is compatible with most kits, reagents, growth medium, vectors, and procedures already entrenched in laboratories. Making these cells commercially available will accelerate the pace of global biotechnological research, making a far-reaching and lasting impact toward genetic exploration and discovery worldwide.","Published: August 30, 2016"

Experts say that the test needs to be validated with a larger sample group but they are optimistic that it could one day help to improve diagnosis of the disease. Protein clumps The test detects a protein molecule called alpha-synuclein, which forms sticky clumps called Lewy bodies inside the brain cells of people with Parkinson s and some types of dementia. Previous efforts to develop a test for alpha-synuclein have produced inconsistent results because the protein is also found in healthy brains. It is only when the protein clumps together that it causes problems. New technology Researchers at the University of Edinburgh made use of a highly sensitive technology that measures the stickiness of proteins. The approach   called real-time quaking induced conversion   can detect tiny differences in the properties of proteins in the brain that can mean the difference between disease or not. Accurate test In early tests, the technique accurately identified 19 out of 20 samples from patients with Parkinson s disease, as well as three samples from people considered to be at risk of the condition. There were no false positives in any of the 15 control samples from healthy people. ""We have already used this technique to develop an accurate test for Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease, another neurodegenerative condition. We hope that with further refinement, our approach will help to improve diagnosis for Parkinson s patients."" Dr Alison Green National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit at the University of Edinburgh Lewy body dementia The technique also identified patients with a type of dementia caused by Lewy bodies, but not other types of dementia such as Alzheimer s disease. ""We are also interested in whether the test could be used to identify people with Parkinson s and Lewy body dementia in the early stages of their illness. These people could then be given the opportunity to take part in trials of new medicines that may slow, or stop, the progression of disease."" Dr Alison Green National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit at the University of Edinburgh Nerve loss Parkinson s disease is a progressive brain condition caused by the loss of nerve cells. It is not known what causes the condition and there is currently no accurate test for it.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/controlling-genome-editing-with-light-191311,Controlling Genome Editing with Light New technique offers precise manipulation of when and where genes are targeted   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The genome-editing system known as CRISPR allows scientists to delete or replace any target gene in a living cell. MIT researchers have now added an extra layer of control over when and where this gene editing occurs, by making the system responsive to light. With the new system, gene editing takes place only when researchers shine ultraviolet light on the target cells. This kind of control could help scientists study in greater detail the timing of cellular and genetic events that influence embryonic development or disease progression. Eventually, it could also offer a more targeted way to turn off cancer-causing genes in tumor cells.  The advantage of adding switches of any kind is to give precise control over activation in space or time,  says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and its Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. Bhatia is the senior author of a paper describing the new technique in the journal Angewandte Chemie. The paper s lead author is Piyush Jain, a postdoc in MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. Light sensitivity Before coming to MIT, Jain developed a way to use light to control a process called RNA interference, in which small strands of RNA are delivered to cells to temporarily block specific genes.  While he was here, CRISPR burst onto the scene and he got very excited about the prospect of using light to activate CRISPR in the same way,  Bhatia says. CRISPR relies on a gene-editing complex composed of a DNA-cutting enzyme called Cas9 and a short RNA strand that guides the enzyme to a specific area of the genome, directing Cas9 where to make its cut. When Cas9 and the guide RNA are delivered into cells, a specific cut is made in the genome; the cells  DNA repair processes glue the cut back together but permanently delete a small portion of the gene, making it inoperable. In previous efforts to create light-sensitive CRISPR systems, researchers have altered the Cas9 enzyme so that it only begins cutting when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. The MIT team decided to take a different approach and make the binding of the RNA guide strand light-sensitive. For possible future applications in humans, it could be easier to deliver these modified RNA guide strands than to program the target cells to produce light-sensitive Cas9, Bhatia says.  You really don t have to do anything different with the cargo you were planning to deliver except to add the light-activated protector,  she says.  It s an attempt to make the system much more modular.  To make the RNA guide strands light-sensitive, the MIT team created  protectors  consisting of DNA sequences with light-cleavable bonds along their backbones. These DNA strands can be tailored to bind to different RNA guide sequences, forming a complex that prevents the guide strand from attaching to its target in the genome. When the researchers expose the target cells to light with a wavelength of 365 nanometers (in the ultraviolet range), the protector DNA breaks into several smaller segments and falls off the RNA, allowing the RNA to bind to its target gene and recruit Cas9 to cut it. Targeting multiple genes In this study, the researchers demonstrated that they could use light to control editing of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and two genes for proteins normally found on cell surfaces and overexpressed in some cancers.  If this is really a generalizable scheme, then you should be able to design protector sequences against different target sequences,  Bhatia says.  We designed protectors against different genes and showed that they all could be light-activated in this way. And in a multiplexed experiment, when a mixed population of protectors was used, the only targets that were cleaved after light exposure were those being photo-protected.  This precise control over the timing of gene editing could help researchers study the timing of cellular events involved in disease progression, in hopes of determining the best time to intervene by turning off a gene.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful technology that scientists can use to study how genes affect cell behavior,  says James Dahlman, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Georgia Tech, who was not involved in the research.  This important advance will enable precise control over those genetic changes. As a result, this work gives the scientific community a very useful tool to advance many gene editing studies.  Bhatia s lab is also pursuing medical applications for this technique. One possibility is using it to turn off cancerous genes involved in skin cancer, which is a good target for this approach because the skin can be easily exposed to ultraviolet light. The team is also working on a  universal protector  that could be used with any RNA guide strand, eliminating the need to design a new one for each RNA sequence, and allowing it to inhibit CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage of many targets at once.","Published: August 30, 2016"

Credit: The University of Hong Kong. Dr Xuechen Li of HKU Department of Chemistry and his research team, together with his collaborators in University of Central Florida (Dr Yu Yuan), USA and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Dr Sheng Chen), have reported their studies on the synthesis of a newly discovered  game-changing  antibiotic, Teixobactin. This underlies potential application and development of the next-generation teixobactin-based antibacterial drugs. Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise globally and has become a serious threat to human health. For instance, methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as one of the most important pathogens, both in hospital (HA-MRSA) and community-acquired infections (CA-MRSA). It is considered one of the most important super-bugs in Hong Kong as it is extremely infectious and has a high mortality rate. To avoid further aggravation of resistance-related problems, misuse and overuse of antibiotics should be prevented to minimize the emergence of drug-resistant organisms. At the same time, development of novel antibacterial and anti-resistant agents should be actively pursued. Although there is an urgent public need for new antibacterial drugs, very few pharmaceutical companies are interested in investing in the development of these, due to the lower profit margin compared to medicines used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. That no new antibiotics have been introduced to the market over the last decade is evidence of this. To address this issue, researchers in academia should play a more active role in the search for new antimicrobial compounds. A team of researchers led by Dr Xuechen Li of the HKU Department of Chemistry, have taken up the responsibility and challenge and have been continuously working on the development of new antibiotics for the past seven years. In 2013, they developed the first chemical synthesis of an antibiotic daptomycin, which enabled them to search for the next-generation daptomycin-based antibiotics. Recently, his team has had further success by developing a chemical strategy to synthesize another antibiotic, Teixobactin. Last year, the discovery of the antibiotic Teixobactin by researchers in the USA, was considered a breakthrough in antibacterial drug research (Nature, 2015, 517, 455). Teixobactin can kill a range of pathogens without detectable resistance, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As promising as it is, Teixobactin is not perfect yet as a drug and can be further improved for its clinical properties via its structural modification. In the history of antibacterial drug development, modification of the lead compound has successfully led to many generations of improved penicillin-based antibiotics. Indeed, it is only through chemical synthesis and medicinal chemistry that one can flexibly modify the teixobactin structure to generate various teixobactin derivatives from simple materials. Thus, the development of a straetgy to chemically synthesize teixobactin and its derivatives has drawn a lot of attention with intense competition worldwide and more than 15 research groups from different countries have been striving to develop a chemical strategy to synthesize teixobactin. Collaborating with another chemist from University of Central Florida, USA, the HKU team became one of the fastest groups in the world to complete the chemical synthesis of teixobactin, from which they have also generated 10 teixobactin analogues with promising properties (US provisional patent filed). The strategy they developed is very efficient and can generate many teixobactin derivatives in a fast and combinatory manner. Now they are running at a full speed with an aim to synthesize more 100 different teixobactin derivatives within two years to search for analogues with improved pharmacological properties for the clinical development.","Published: August 30, 2016"

Are particularly promising new approaches that are based on the analysis of small fragments of the genome of tumor cells, which will be issued from these in the bloodstream. The genetic material of tumor cells differs from the known by normal cells through changes, mutations, which can affect the functional units called genes, so that they make their task proteins (proteins), no longer or only partially run.So far, the analysis from the blood allowed to draw just conclusions on mutations in the tumor genome, but not how this has also the function of individual genes is altered. Scientists at the Medical University of Graz and the Graz University of Technology, it is now managed to predict by a blood test, the gene expression of individual genes in the tumor tissue of breast cancer patients, which could be significantly expanded the diagnostic possibilities and eventually enable treatment decisions for cancer patients.  ctDNA: Tiny fragments of the tumor genome under the scientists'   The analysis of fragments of the tumor genome in the blood, also known as circulating tumor DNA (Engl .: circulating tumor DNA; ctDNA) referred, currently rapidly developed into an important tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer patients. ""The cost method is a very good alternative to expensive and sometimes invasive examination methods in cancer diagnosis and therapy in the control,"" explains Peter Ulz , Institute of Human Genetics at the Medical University of Graz and author of the study. The background of the method is that dying tumor cells secrete tiny genetic fragments in the blood, from which can be read off tumor-specific mutations. ""It provides the blood test to draw conclusions about the genetic makeup of the tumor and its development during therapy,"" said Peter Ulz. However, the detection of ctDNA has its limits, as currently only static changes at the DNA level can be read, such as point mutations or copy number changes. Important dynamic markers, such as the expression of individual genes, however, could not be analyzed until now. Discovery: First conclusions about gene expression in tumor tissues detected   This fact employed an interdisciplinary team under the inter-university research collaboration BioTechMed-Graz around the Institute of Human Genetics at the Medical University of Graz and the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Technical University of Graz. Starting point is the process of transcription, the first step in gene expression, ie the process by which the genetic information is expressed or the genotype expresses - as healthy tissue or tumor tissue. The circulating in the blood DNA is derived primarily from cells that have undergone apoptosis. The DNA is cleaved by enzymes and there is a typical fragment pattern. Since certain proteins are attached at defined intervals to the DNA (nucleosomes), areas which are linked to proteins, not degraded. ""A certain control range control region of active genes, however, is not protected by such proteins from degradation and thus cleaving DNA enzymes preferably digested,"" Peter Ulz describes the process. The transcription of genes thus always leaves a trace on the DNA in the peripheral blood. ""By sequencing of all fragments in the peripheral blood, can now be concluded due to the lack of individual fragments on gene expression,"" said Peter Ulz. In a first step, the scientists have shown that circulating in the blood DNA fragments are in fact associated with nucleosomes and thus are increasingly being used for sequencing are available. In a further step, it is the researchers succeeded prove that the fragment pattern differs in healthy test subjects between active and non-active genes. Supported by machine learning could the scientists about the absence of these fragments predict which gene is actively expressed, and which does not, the prediction agrees well with experimental values. Dynamic markers in cancer therapy   The technology developed by the researchers analysis was used to study blood samples from breast cancer patients to predict gene expression of individual genes in regions of copy number increases. ""To The comparison with experimental data from the gene expression analysis of primary tumor tissue of the patients we were able to show that our analysis is capable of expressing non-expressed genes differ,"" Peter Ulz summarizes. Thereby, it might be possible also in other types of cancer in the future, in addition to the static information of the tumor genome, functional information, such as gene expression, derived from analysis of ctDNA. This could help to better and more comprehensive to track changes in the tumor genome that arise in the course of cancer in order to get a greater insight into tumor biology. What consequences could have the information gained on the treatment strategies for different cancers, can be even more difficult to estimate, the hope would, however, be able to respond to a change in the tumor quickly and with appropriate, targeted therapies. In the long run this approach could thus pursue personalized medicine further and provide the benefits of ctDNA analyzes further to the fore.","Published: August 30, 2016"

This work represents a major step forward in the study of human gastroenteritis viruses because it establishes a system in which a number of norovirus strains can be grown, which will allow researchers to explore and develop procedures to prevent and treat infection and to better understand norovirus biology.  People have been trying to grow norovirus in the lab for a very long time. We tried for the last 20 years. Despite all the attempts and the success of growing other viruses, it remained a mystery why noroviruses were so hard to work with,  said senior author Dr. Mary Estes, Cullen endowed professor of human and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor and emeritus founding director of the Texas Medical Center Digestive Diseases Center. Noroviruses, also known as the cruise ship viruses, do not grow in laboratory cultures that traditionally support the growth of other viruses, such as transformed cells that are derived from cancerous tissues. In addition, noroviruses are species specific   human noroviruses only infect and cause disease in humans, and mouse noroviruses only do so in mice. Human noroviruses do not grow in mice or other small animal models typically used for research.  My idea was that we had not succeeded at growing noroviruses because we didn t have the right cell type,  said Estes.  We first showed that in patients with chronic norovirus infections, the virus could be detected in intestinal cells called enterocytes, but normal human enterocyte cells rapidly died when put into culture. A breakthrough came when we learned that Dr. Hans Clevers  team in the Netherlands had developed a method to make a new type of human intestinal epithelial cell culture system including enterocytes. These novel, multi-cellular human cultures, called enteroids, are made from adult intestinal stem cells from patient tissues. We anticipated that putting the virus in these non-transformed human cell cultures would let the virus grow.   I have been working with Dr. Estes for five years trying to cultivate this virus,  said co-first author Dr. Khalil Ettayebi, senior staff scientist in Estes s lab.  We tried many approaches but obtained only negative results until we started using the new human stem cell-derived enteroid cultures in the laboratory.  It took Estes and colleagues about one year to get the human intestinal epithelial cultures growing well in the lab. Then, before they tested the cultures with noroviruses, they tested them with another human gastrointestinal virus, rotavirus.  Rotavirus grew well in the human intestinal epithelial cell cultures,  said Estes.  Then, we tried the human norovirus and found that some strains would grow, but others wouldn t. We suspected that still something was missing.  The researchers tried to improve the growth of the viruses by adding to the cultures substances that are naturally present in the upper small intestine, the natural environment where the virus grows. Other intestinal viruses, such as rotavirus, use these substances to grow inside the body.  The human body responds to food by secreting enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver into the small intestine. Pancreatic enzymes digest the large molecules and bile solubilizes fats,  said Dr. David Y. Graham, professor of medicine and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor and the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  Viruses that cause gastroenteritis, such as rotavirus, utilize pancreatic enzymes to trigger their replication, but these enzymes had no effect on norovirus. We asked, if pancreatic enzymes were not important, was bile a key component allowing the virus to recognize where it was and replicate?   When we added bile to the cultures, norovirus strains that didn t grow before now grew in large numbers!  said Estes.  I was most excited when we discovered that bile allows the successful replication of human noroviruses,  said co-first author Dr. Kosuke Murakami, post-doctoral associate in Estes s lab.  This new cultivation system will finally allow us to gain an insight into how this virus causes disease,  said co-first author Dr. Sue Crawford, an assistant professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor.  We finally solved the 48 year old mystery. We were able to grow norovirus in cultures that mimic the intestinal environment, where the virus naturally grows, by adding bile to the cultures. Bile is critical for several important bacterial pathogens, but this is the first time it s been shown that bile is important for the replication of human intestinal viruses,  said Estes. The human intestinal epithelial cultures are truly unique and the researchers anticipate that the cultures will allow them to answer important questions, such as why one strain of norovirus infects one person, but not another.  These novel cultures are really remarkable as they retain properties of the different regions of the small intestine, and are physiologically active,  said Estes.  Each culture is unique and reflects the genetics of the individual from whom the culture was established. This allowed us to show that some cultures, like some people, are susceptible to only one or to several human norovirus strains. These cultures will allow us to determine the mechanisms that restrict replication in some people, but not others.  This is the first example where human intestinal epithelial cultures have been used to cultivate a non-cultivable agent.  I predict this new culture system, changing certain conditions, will allow for the cultivation of other viruses or bacteria that we cannot grow at the moment. If we succeed, it will help us develop effective methods to prevent and treat infection, test vaccines, interrupt transmission, and better understand how these microbes infect people, respond to bodily defenses and evolve,  said Estes.","Published: August 30, 2016"

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/pancreatic-cancers-aggression-explained-204732,Pancreatic Cancer s Aggression Explained Internal conflict between cell types explains why the immune system struggles to recognize and attack pancreatic cancer   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Curbing this infighting has the potential to make treatment more effective, according to a study led by researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center and its Perlmutter Cancer Center. The study describes how a powerful subset of immune cells, known as gamma delta T cells, prevents other tumor-fighting T cells from entering pancreatic tumors. Without interference from gamma delta T cells, CD4 and CD8 cells multiply and actively attack tumors the way they attack invading viruses or bacteria. Unfortunately, the immune system generates a large number of pro-tumor gamma delta T cells that infiltrate pancreatic tumors. Recent advances in immunotherapy, an approach that activates a person s immune system to combat cancer, boost the effects of CD4 or CD8 T cells. Results of the newly published study argue that this kind of immunotherapy must be more rigidly targeted in pancreatic cancer. Unless the gamma delta T cells are blocked, CD4 and CD8 cells are unable to function or thwart cancer growth, the study finds.  Standard immunotherapy does not work in pancreatic cancer, which is especially deadly. Now we have more information to help us understand why,  says senior author George Miller, MD, head of the Immunology Program at Perlmutter Cancer Center, vice chair for research in the Department of Surgery, and associate professor in the departments of Cell Biology and Surgery at NYU Langone.  The main anti-tumor defense mechanism is rendered completely useless in pancreatic cancer.  Miller s study focused on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which is almost always fatal. While overall cancer survival rates have improved dramatically with the advent of modern therapies in the past two decades, only about 8 percent of people survive five years after their diagnosis with any form of pancreatic cancer. Gamma delta T cells are prolific in human PDA tumors, making up about 40 percent of T cells on average. This prompted Miller and lead author Donnele Daley, MD, a postdoctoral fellow and surgery resident at NYU Langone, to theorize that gamma delta T cells play a unique role in the promotion of pancreatic cancer, as the new study shows. Separate tests revealed that gamma delta cells alone do not promote tumor growth they simply prevent the tumor-fighting immune cells from working The findings also underscore the complexity of the immune system, says Miller. The same gamma delta T cells that enable pancreatic cancer tumors to grow unchecked have been shown to fight other kinds of cancers, such as melanoma, some kidney cancers, and colon cancer. Not all immune cells have the same roles in different cancers, and they sometimes work against each other. The research has important implications for the development of better diagnostics and treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, Miller cautions that translating it to humans may be challenging, because there is currently no known drug or other method that can block the action of gamma delta T cells in humans.

Adverse side effects are a well-known phenomenon and something many of us will have experienced when taking medicines. Sometimes, these side effects can be caused when a drug hits the wrong target, binding to the wrong protein. However, the difficulty of tracking this process means that little research has been carried out. Now, a new study led by scientists at the University of Oxford has shown how a series of anti-HIV protein inhibitor drugs can interfere with the processing of a protein known as prelamin A, essential for maintaining the shape of human cells and directly related to ageing. The researchers used mass spectrometry   a long-established way of identifying molecules by measuring their mass   to observe directly the drugs' 'hitchhiking' on the wrong protein. Professor Dame Carol Robinson of Oxford's Department of Chemistry, corresponding author on the paper, said: 'The ""hitchhiking"" of drugs on incorrect targets is a common problem but isn't much studied, as it can be difficult to observe directly. You have to know which proteins to look for, and only then can you target these proteins for further research. 'The results of this study surprised us, as the drugs target HIV proteases and were not thought to bind the human metalloprotease that is involved in processing prelamin A.' The researchers found that the anti-HIV drugs lopinavir, ritonavir and amprenavir each blocked the processing of prelamin A. Professor Robinson added: 'The association between some anti-HIV drugs and premature ageing has been suspected for some time through observation of patients undergoing treatment, but it hasn't been proved at the molecular level. There have also been other highly publicised drugs with off-target protein side effects, including an anti-diabetes drug that caused heart attacks in some patients. 'Now that we have developed this mass spectrometry-based approach, we anticipate that it will have widespread application, since it is likely that many drugs that are designed with a specific target in mind end up hitchhiking on other protein targets. It could even be used during the drug development process to determine if drugs are binding to the wrong targets at the molecular level.'","Published: August 30, 2016"

GCXV does not appear to infect mammals, according to first author Jason Ladner, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). However, the team also isolated a related virus called Jingmen tick virus, or JMTV from a nonhuman primate. Further analysis demonstrates that both GCXV and JMTV belong to a highly diverse and newly discovered group of viruses called the Jingmenvirus group.  Taken together, the research suggests that the host range of this virus group is quite diverse and highlights the potential relevance of these viruses to animal and human health.   Animal viruses typically have all genome segments packaged together into a single viral particle, so only one of those particles is needed to infect a host cell,  Ladner explained.  But in a multicomponent virus, the genome is divided into multiple pieces, with each one packaged separately into a viral particle. At least one particle of each type is required for cell infection.  Several plant pathogens have this type of organization, but the study published today is the first to describe a multicomponent virus that infects animals.  Working with collaborators including the University of Texas Medical Branch and the New York State Department of Health, the USAMRIID team extracted and sequenced virus from mosquitoes collected around the world. The newly discovered virus is named for the Guaico region of Trinidad, where the mosquitoes that contained it were first found. In collaboration with a group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the USAMRIID investigators also found the first evidence of a Jingmenvirus in the blood of a nonhuman primate, in this case a red colobus monkey living in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The animal showed no signs of disease when the sample was taken, so it is not known whether the virus had a pathogenic effect.  Jingmenviruses were first described in 2014 and are related to flaviviruses a large family of viruses that includes human pathogens such as yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses.   One area we are focused on is the identification and characterization of novel viruses,  said the paper s senior author Gustavo Palacios, Ph.D., who directs USAMRIID s Center for Genome Sciences.  This study allowed us to utilize all our tools and even though this virus does not appear to affect mammals, we are continuing to refine those tools so we can be better prepared for the next outbreak of disease that could have an impact on human health.  While it is difficult to predict, experts believe that the infectious viruses most likely to emerge next in humans are those already affecting other mammals, particularly nonhuman primates.","Published: August 30, 2016"

It is expected that the technique will be applied to gene therapy in the future in addition to providing a powerful tool for breeding useful organisms and conducting disease and drug-discovery research.  Deaminase is attached by a linker to nuclease  deficient CRISPR/Cas9.

Genome editing - which can directly manipulate the genome information of various organisms without leaving an artificial strand - has seen rapid progress in recent years and it is gradually becoming a revolutionary tool in fields ranging from life sciences to advanced medical research. Known to be highly effective, genome editing using  artificial nuclease  (1) aims to cut the DNA at the target point and to modify the gene while it is repaired. As this method is efficacious in biological materials for which genetic operation was difficult, it has been used mainly for higher eukaryotes such as animals and plants. However, a major issue with this method has been the uncertainty of inducing the intended mutation and  cytotoxicity  caused by splitting of chromosomes. In the present research, researchers demonstrated that it is possible to modify genetic function by inducing target  point mutation  (3) at a highly efficient rate (Figure 2). The point mutation was induced by forming a synthetic complex (Figure 1) through removal of nuclease activity from the CRISPR system   a technique using artificial nuclease   and addition of deaminase, a deaminizing (base-modifying) enzyme, and then expressing it in yeasts and mammalian cells. Moreover, it was confirmed that, compared to previous nuclease models, cytotoxicity is significantly reduced by modifying the DNA without cutting. The present technique can realize a more diverse, higher-level genome editing operation as it can efficiently conduct intended modification in a way that does not put significant burden on the cells. It is expected that the new technique will be applied to gene therapy in the future in addition to providing a powerful tool for breeding useful organisms and conducting disease and drug-discovery research.","Published: August 30, 2016"

This same shift has been observed in human inflammatory disorders, though previous attempts to mimic it in lower organisms like fruit flies or zebrafish have proved unsuccessful. The study provides a valuable model for uncovering the basic molecular mechanisms governing the interplay of immunity and regeneration, and could point the way toward new therapies to combat serious human ailments like chronic non-healing wounds.  This is the first animal model to link pathological shifts in endogenous bacteria with the inhibition of regeneration,  says Alejandro S nchez Alvarado, Ph.D., an investigator at the Stowers Institute and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and senior author of the study.  We know that some kinds of bacteria are critical to our health, and that other kinds of bacteria can make it very difficult for us to recover from illness. Now we can study how the changing nature of the microbiome   and the way the immune system responds to those changes   impacts the natural execution of regenerative processes.  For a long time, researchers believed that the immune response primarily posed a barrier to effective tissue regeneration and repair. However, recent studies in a variety of different organisms have shown that it can play a central role in promoting this process as well. Still, the molecular mechanisms driving these diametrically opposed outcomes remain unclear. A sudden dilemma in the S nchez Alvarado Laboratory presented an opportunity to dissect the perplexing duality of the immune system. An infection struck part of the lab s planaria population. The infected animals developed lesions around their eyes, and those lesions grew larger and larger until their entire head degenerated. Normally, the worms could simply regrow a new head, but the infection somehow thwarted their regenerative powers. S nchez Alvarado s team and the Stowers aquatics facility developed a modified tank system that was capable of circulating and sanitizing the culture media so they could rear healthy worms, but they found that when they took the worms out of that system, they quickly got sick again. Although most of the lab members viewed this development with frustration, Chris Arnold, Ph.D., a new postdoctoral research associate at the time, took a different perspective.  I saw this as the perfect inducible model system. It was making lemonade out of lemons,  Arnold said.  We could take worms that were healthy, remove them from the tank system when desired, and place them in other conditions where they would then become ill. Amazingly, we found that when we withdrew the worms from the tank system and they developed problems, we could successfully treat their tissue degeneration with antibiotics. That suggested bacteria might be involved.  Arnold decided to determine what kind of bacteria were living with the worms. He conducted a bacterial census and found that the microbiome of the worms was surprisingly similar to that of humans. When the worms were healthy, they housed a large population of Bacteroides   a group of helpful, supportive, symbiotic bacteria   and a smaller population of Proteobacteria   a group that contains a number of dangerous human pathogens. But when the worms developed lesions, they experienced a huge surge in Proteobacteria, some members of which have been shown to cause peptic ulcers and stomach cancer in humans. The researchers wondered if it was not the bacteria itself, but rather the immune system s response to the bacteria that was impairing the worm s ability to regenerate. To test this hypothesis, Arnold used an advanced molecular technique called RNA interference to silence core components of the immune system. Then, he looked to see how each one affected the ability of the worms to repair their lesions and regenerate their heads during infection. The researchers discovered that when they blocked a gene called TAK1 kinase, the worms were able to recover from the damage incurred from infection. They looked at other genes that interacted with TAK1 kinase including activators and inhibitors of the TAK1 pathway and found that most of them also affected regeneration, but only when worms were infected.  Our findings suggest that there is something special about regeneration during infection that s different than normal regeneration. There are genes that prompt degeneration in one case, and regeneration in another. It is topsy-turvy, completely different from what we would expect. We think this pathway might act to get rid of infected cells, clearing them out so the infection cannot spread to healthy tissue. Only when we block the pathway, can we allow regeneration to occur even in the presence of infection,  said S nchez Alvarado. S nchez Alvarado says that in the future, it may be possible to develop small molecules that suppress this immune pathway in order to bump up tissue repair and regeneration not just in a simple organism like planaria, but also in higher organisms like humans. However, first they will need to understand more about the activators and inhibitors in the pathway, and how they interact.  Our healthcare system is struggling to deal with conditions of impaired wound healing. We know that bacteria are impediments to healing in patients, and that antibiotics aren t always effective, especially with the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. By understanding the genes and pathways involved in the immune response, we may be able to interpret the signals that determine whether an organism decides it is beyond repair or tries to regenerate. Perhaps then could we develop more effective therapies,  said Arnold. Lay Summary of Findings Shifts in the balance of the human microbiome   the microbial communities that call our bodies home   underlie persistent inflammatory disorders, chronic non-healing wounds, and scar formation. In an article published in the journal eLife, Stowers Institute scientists explore the interplay between the microbiome, host immunity, tissue repair, and regeneration in planaria, a freshwater flatworm. Postdoctoral Research Associate Chris Arnold, Ph.D., his advisor Alejandro S nchez Alvarado, Ph.D., and their collaborators find that ailing flatworms experience a dramatic expansion of pathogenic Proteobacteria that closely mirrors changes associated with human ailments. This bacterial infection stimulated the flatworms  immune response, impeding its regeneration capabilities. The study provides a valuable animal model for understanding host-microbiome interactions and for designing therapies that may enhance healing in humans.","Published: August 30, 2016"

We don t know a lot about the details of how the CRISPR-Cas9 complex gets around the genome of a live cell and finds its target,  said Thoru Pederson, PhD, the Vitold Arnett Professor of Cell Biology and professor of biochemistry & molecular pharmacology.  What we ve learned in this study about how this machinery works is important and useful for gene editors looking to develop tools for the lab and potentially the clinic.  A component of the bacterial immune system that protects it from viral invasion, the CRISPR-Cas9 complex is a powerful gene editing system. More efficient and precise than previous technologies, the CRIPR-Cas9 complex is being adapted in the lab, as scientists find ways to program and deliver it quickly to selectively edit specific genetic sequences for study. In order to cut a piece of double-stranded DNA, CRISPR-Cas9 makes use of a guide RNA made of roughly 20 nucleotides to target specific regions of a genome at which the Cas9 complex then makes the cut. This allows scientists to remove or insert genetic sequences into the genome. Because the underlying dynamics of how the CRISPR/Cas9 system works inside live cells aren t well understood, some delivery systems and techniques have been more successful than others. In order to observe the actions of the CRISPR-Cas9 system at work in a live cell, Dr. Pederson and colleagues developed a technique for labeling the guide RNA and Cas9 elements with different florescent molecules so they could be tracked simultaneously. The research team included Hanhui Ma, PhD, research specialist in the Pederson laboratory and co-first author of the Journal of Cell Biology article; David Grunwald, PhD, assistant professor of the RNA Therapeutics Institute; and Li-Chun Tu, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the Grunwald lab. What they found is that the guide RNA, when not bound to Cas9, is extremely short-lived. When the Cas9 and guide RNA do assemble, the complex is much more stable, with about half showing a lifetime in the cell nucleus of approximately 15 minutes and the remainder being considerably more stable.  Cas9 stabilizes the guide RNA,  said Dr. Ma.  If you re delivering the guide RNA and Cas9 separately into the cell for them to then assemble it won t be as efficient because some of the guide RNA will degrade. If you deliver them both into the cell, already assembled, you ll see more activity.  The other observation the team made was that the duration of target residence by the Cas9-guide RNA complex determines whether the DNA will be cut. When the guide RNA sequence perfectly matched the target DNA sequence, the Cas9-guide RNA complex remained bound for as long as two hours before leaving, with cleavage completed. With mismatched guide RNA-target DNA sequences, the complex lingered for as little as a few minutes and cleavage was impaired. Knowing this, scientists can potentially predict mathematically where an off-target cut may happen based on how long the CRISPR complex sits on the genome, said Ma.  We still don t know the rules of CRISPR,  said Ma.  Everybody wants to know what will happen when it s delivered into a live cell. This study helps write a piece of that operating manual.

Interestingly, the researchers discovered that different members of the cluster dominate different stages as disease-targeting immune cells, called B cells, develop a finding that could guide the development of therapies against autoimmune diseases.  Although the miRNAs in the cluster are all expressed, it s not like they re playing the same role different individual miRNAs within the cluster are more important than others in controlling different stages of B cell development,  said TSRI Research Associate Alicia Gonzalez Martin, who served as co-first author of the study with TSRI Professional Scientific Collaborator Maoyi Lai and Anthony B. Cooper, a TSRI researcher now at Adimab.  At different stages, one miRNA is like the lead actor and another is like a supporting actor,  added Lai. The study, published August 2, 2016, in the journal Nature Communications, was co-led by TSRI Associate Professor Changchun Xiao and TSRI Professor David Nemazee. A Key Question in Drug Development As they develop, the immune system s B cells acquire specific receptors to allow them to recognize and attack harmful pathogens. The receptor assembly process is random, and sometimes this roll of the dice leads to potentially harmful cells such as B cells that produce antibodies against the body s own tissues, causing autoimmune diseases like lupus. miRNAs appear to be crucial for healthy B cell development. Previous TSRI studies from the Xiao lab have shown that six miRNAs form a cluster called miR-17~92, whose expression has to stay at just the right level to stop cells from triggering cancers or autoimmune diseases. In the new study, the researchers investigated the roles of the six miRNAs in this cluster to see if any might be good targets for future therapeutics.  miRNA-based therapies are usually designed for certain miRNAs, not a whole cluster,  Lai explained.  If you can narrow it down to one or two important miRNAs, you can design miRNA mimics or anti-miRNAs to try to restore the normal expression level.  A Shift in Power The new study suggests that the expression of two miRNAs in this cluster, called miR-17 and miR-19, are key to healthy B cell development. By  knocking out  (disabling) expression of these select miRNAs in mouse models, the researchers found that miR-17 steps in early in B cell development, making it possible for B cells to progress through this stage and produce the receptors they need to fight infections later on. Although the pathway for this action is not yet known, the researchers found that B cells without miR-17 cannot develop effectively thus weakening the immune system. miR-19 expression is important later on in B cell development, helping to regulate the quality control  checkpoint  system that stops harmful B cells from escaping the bone marrow and causing disease. The researchers found that overexpression of miR-19 led to a reduced expression of a gene called Pten, allowing potentially autoimmune disease-causing cells to survive longer and get past the checkpoint.  Pten has been the focus of oncology studies, so it s interesting to see that this gene is also involved in tolerance checkpoints,  said Lai. Other miRNAs from the cluster are involved during both of these processes, but they appear to have minor roles. The researchers plan to continue their investigation into the roles of different miRNAs at the tolerance checkpoint stage and their roles in autoimmunity, with the goal of figuring out which might be the best to target with future therapeutics","Published: August 30, 2016"

Terpenoids, mostly produced by plants, are a family of molecules that encompass some of the most well-known and successful drugs derived from natural sources, for example the cancer treatment Taxol . In total, there are more than 65,000 known terpenoids. Natural compounds, such as terpenoids, are typically made by numerous enzymes that stitch the parts together, like building a model from Lego . In the new study, the team focused on enzymes known as terpene synthases, which are found in both plants and bacteria. The study, led by TSRI Professor Ben Shen, was recently published online ahead of print by the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In addition to the advance in the structural biology of this class of proteins, the new findings could also affect drug discovery, making engineering of these proteins, and thus the compounds they make, easier in the future. Using x-ray crystallography freezing the atomic structure of a protein, then bombarding it with x-rays to create a snapshot of it Shen and his colleagues developed a detailed structural model that provides a far better understanding of bacterial diterpene synthases and how this class of enzymes work in a natural setting.  What we found out is that the bacterial version is structurally very similar to the plant version and may support the idea of a gene fusion event that created the bifunctional plant enzymes,  said TSRI Research Associate Jeffrey Rudolf, a co-first author of the paper with TSRI Research Associate Liao-Bin Dong.  We were also able to map which parts of the enzyme are important, giving us an idea of how to engineer the protein for structural diversity.  Dong added,  This new information not only allows us to engineer structural diversity into both bacterial and plant terpenoids, it also helps us identify new diterpenoids of bacterial origin, which are rare and could lead to exciting new natural compounds with interesting biological activities.

The findings may further indicate that an excessively low intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids increases the risk of (premature) death. However, no clear correlation could be established with mortality from cardiovascular disease. This study is the largest yet conducted examining the association between specific fatty acids in adipose tissue and the intake of these fatty acids. The study is also the largest forward-looking study to have analysed the associations between fatty acids in adipose tissue, cardiovascular disease, and mortality from all causes. The question of what type of fat food should contain has been hotly debated. According to current dietary guidelines, food should contain a relatively high proportion of unsaturated   including  polyunsaturated    fatty acids. One difficulty in dietary studies is finding a reliable method of measuring dietary intake, particularly over an extended period. Measuring the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue can therefore make a valuable contribution to our knowledge about the association between diet and disease. The composition of adipose tissue provides an objective reflection of the average fat intake in recent years, particularly of fatty acids that the body cannot produce itself, such as the Omega 6 fatty acid linoleic acid derived from vegetable sources. Linoleic acid occurs in sunflower, rapeseed and other vegetable oils, in soft table and cooking fats (margarine), nuts and seeds. In the population-based study ULSAM (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men), adipose tissue biopsy specimens and blood samples were taken from 853 men at the age of 71 years. At about the same time, the men in the study were asked to fill in a food diary over a period of seven days. Many of the men underestimated their intake of energy and fat. Disregarding the men who reported most inadequately, a clear correlation was evident between the proportion of linoleic acid in adipose tissue and the food diaries. Somewhat weaker correlations were observed between fatty acids in the blood and reported intake, while strong correlations were observed between adipose tissue and blood for most fatty acids. Overall, the findings indicate that the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue reflects the individual s intake of these fatty acids over the long term, and this appears to be particularly true of linoleic acid, which is the most common polyunsaturated fatty acid. With regard to Omega 3 fats, however, this study showed no clear association with a risk of cardiovascular disease or mortality. After taking statistical account of a number of known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, no clear correlations with cardiovascular disease were observed for any fatty acid (251 deaths during a 15-year follow-up period). However, for total mortality (605 deaths) a correlation was seen, with a higher proportion of linoleic acid in adipose tissue being associated with a ten per cent lower risk of death. Linoleic acid is known to reduce the content of bad cholesterol in the blood, but the study cannot answer the question of whether this is the explanation for the association with reduced mortality. The study is unique in measuring various fatty acids in adipose tissue among a large population of older men, followed over an extended period of time.  Even though the study cannot prove any causal connection, the findings nevertheless support current dietary advice to replace some hard fats in the diet   namely, those with a high proportion of saturated fatty acids   with softer fats, e.g. vegetable oils with a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids,  says David Iggman, a physician and researcher at the Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism Unit at Uppsala University.","Published: August 30, 2016"

The study could be used to engineer fungal enzymes for biofuel production and bioremediation efforts. Fungi secrete a diverse repertoire of enzymes that break down tenacious plant material. These powerful enzymes degrade plant cell wall components such as cellulose and lignin, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide from soils containing dead plant material into the atmosphere. As such, fungal enzymes are not only critical drivers of climate dynamics, but they also hold promise for cost-effective development of alternative transportation fuels from biomass. Moreover, the manganese [Mn(II)]-oxidizing capacity of certain fungal species can be harnessed to remove toxic metals from contaminated soils and water. Yet few studies have characterized enzymes secreted by diverse Mn(II)-oxidizing fungi that are commonly found in the environment. Recently, a team of researchers used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), genomic analyses, and bioinformatic analyses to characterize and compare enzymes secreted by four Mn(II)-oxidizing Ascomycetes species. These four species were isolated from coal mine drainage treatment systems and a freshwater lake contaminated with high concentrations of metals and are associated with varied environments and common in soil ecosystems worldwide. The researchers performed LC-MS/MS-based comparative proteomics using the Linear Ion Trap Quadrupole Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), a Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science user facility. This analysis revealed that fungi secrete a rich yet functionally similar suite of enzymes, despite species-specific differences in the amino acid sequences of these enzymes. These findings enhance understanding of the role Ascomycetes species play in biogeochemistry and climate dynamics and reveal lignocellulose-degrading enzymes that could be engineered for renewable energy production or bioremediation of metal-contaminated waters.","Published: August 30, 2016"

ThyraMir is used in the classification of indeterminate thyroid nodule results from fine needle aspirates and biopsy specimens. New York State accounts for approximately 5% of the 600,000 Thyroid FNA biopsies performed in the US annually according to Thyroid Disease Manager. Many States, including New York, Florida, and California require special licensure for laboratory Companies to allow them to provide such tests to patients who reside within their jurisdiction. New York was the final State for which the Company had been awaiting approval. Even robust submissions with substantial validation study data can take a significant amount of time prior to receiving approval by New York State. The Company first launched ThyraMir on April 15th, 2015 making it available to Endocrinologists and Pathologists throughout the country. Since then, the Company has conducted over 5,000 ThyraMir tests for nearly 400 physicians and hospitals. According to Jack Stover, President and CEO of Interpace Dignostics,  we are pleased with the New York State acceptance of our data submission for ThyraMir. This is a significant milestone and further confirms the overall robust performance of our test.  The Company has also filed with New York State seeking approval of ThyGenX, our molecular panel that typically precedes the running of ThyraMir to determine whether or not specific biomarkers are present that warrant the reflex to ThyraMir testing.

A key aspect of the Assay Portal is to provide space where national and international proteomics researchers from across the globe can upload and share their quantitative assays with standard operating procedures and guidelines. To meet this goal, NCI is continuing to improve the assay upload process to have an independent process for public/non-CPTAC teams to upload their assays in a seamless fashion and will provide update on this effort to the community as it comes available. Targeted proteomic assays eliminate issues that are commonly observed using conventional protein detection systems (e.g. Western blotting), which are semi-quantitative at best, not readily multiplexed, and often non-specific. Until recently, non-standardized information for hundreds of targeted mass spectrometry-based assays was distributed across published journal articles. The CPTAC assay portal serves as a centralized public repository of highly characterized targeted MS assays, including standard operating protocols, reagents, and assay characterization data. Dr. Christoph Borchers, Ph.D., Director of the University of Victoria Genome BC Proteomics Centre, Canada, has volunteered to be the first non-CPTAC researcher to upload targeted mass spectrometry-based assays to the portal. These multiple reaction monitoring (MRM-MS)-based assays fully adhere to the standards and guidelines developed by CPTAC and meet the minimum characterization requirements for entry to the portal, including development of multipoint response curve and repeatability assessment. In the portal landing page, which is designed to be relevant to biologists, researchers will be able to search for the Proteomics Centre assays by querying using the  non-CPTAC  term. Dr. Borchers has contributed 107 MRM assays to the portal in this initial phase, and is working on completing up to 2,000 assays that will be ultimately imported to the CPTAC Assay Portal.  We are delighted to be working with the CPTAC on this important project,  says Dr. Borchers.  Standardization of protein quantitation is essential if mass spectrometry-based proteomics is going to be used for clinical assays. To assist in cancer-related research, we are planning to greatly extend the range of our MRM based assays in CPTAC to include assays for mouse proteins. The mouse is the preferred animal model for studying cancer, and will become even more important through the new CRISPR/Cas9 technology, which greatly facilitates the research of genetic mutations of cancer-related proteins in mice at a low cost.  Dr. Amanda Paulovich, a Member of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and co-Chair of the CPTAC Assay Development Working Group, notes that,  We are excited to take this important first step in opening up the Assay Portal for contributions from the entire community, bringing us one step closer to the goal of standardizing quantification of all proteins across the community to improve analytical rigor and reproducibility in protein-based research.

The Company's SFX-01, a synthetic and stabilised version of sulforaphane, is currently in a Phase II trial, SAS (SFX-01 after Subarachnoid Haemorrhage), in the UK. The orphan drug designation programme provides orphan status to drugs and biologics for rare diseases or disorders affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the USA. Orphan drug designation gives SFX-01 the potential for US market exclusivity for seven years from the date of marketing approval. SAH is a rare form of stroke in which blood from a ruptured aneurysm enters the protective space around the brain. The worldwide annual incidence of SAH averages at nine people in every 100,000 and in the USA there are approximately 30,000 cases per year, the significant majority of which are caused by ruptured cerebral aneurysms. SFX-01 represents a potentially new class of drug for the treatment of SAH with a mechanism of action that specifically targets the Nrf-2 pathway. The effect of this is to reduce the oxidative stress and toxicity caused by free haemoglobin from the haemorrhage. Dr Stephen Franklin, Evgen Pharma's CEO, commented: ""The receipt of orphan drug designation in SAH is highly significant for Evgen Pharma and for our clinical programme in SAH, a devastating condition with high unmet clinical need. Evgen's SFX-01, has the potential to represent the first step-change improvement in the treatment of SAH in more than 20 years in that it targets the principal drivers of the delayed vasospasm.

There is still much uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of Zika virus transmission,  said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  At this time, the recommendation for testing the entire blood supply will help ensure that safe blood is available for all individuals who might need transfusion.  The FDA first issued guidance on Feb. 16 recommending that only areas with active Zika virus transmission screen donated Whole Blood and blood components for Zika virus, use pathogen-reduction devices, or halt blood collection and obtain Whole Blood and blood components from areas of the U.S. without active virus transmission. All areas with active transmission in the U.S. are currently in compliance with this guidance. The revised guidance announced recommends that all states and U.S. territories screen individual units of donated Whole Blood and blood components with a blood screening test authorized for use by the FDA under an investigational new drug (IND) application, or a licensed test when available. Alternatively, an FDA-approved pathogen-reduction device may be used for plasma and certain platelet products. The FDA is updating its guidance after careful consideration of all available scientific evidence, consultation with other public health agencies, and taking into consideration the potential serious health consequences of Zika virus infection to pregnant women and children born to women exposed to Zika virus during pregnancy. Testing of donated blood is already underway in Florida and Puerto Rico, as well as in other areas, and it has shown to be beneficial in identifying donations infected with Zika virus. Expanded testing will continue to reduce the risk for transmission of Zika virus through the U.S. blood supply and will be in effect until the risk of transfusion transmission of Zika virus is reduced. Zika virus is transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquito. Zika virus can also be spread by sexual contact. Although 4 out of 5 people infected with Zika virus never develop symptoms, when symptoms do occur they may include fever, arthralgia (joint pain), maculopapular rash (red area with small bumps), and conjunctivitis (red, irritated eyes). In addition, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes.  As new scientific and epidemiological information regarding Zika virus has become available, it s clear that additional precautionary measures are necessary,  said Luciana Borio, M.D., the FDA s acting chief scientist.  We are issuing revised guidance for immediate implementation in order to help maintain the safety of the U.S. blood supply.  The first local or non-travel related transmission of Zika virus in the U.S. by mosquitoes was reported from Puerto Rico in December 2015; and soon thereafter, local transmission was reported in American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In July 2016, the first cases of local or non-travel related transmission of Zika virus in the continental U.S. were reported in Miami-Dade County, Florida. In addition to protecting the nation s blood supply, the FDA works to protect the safety of our nation s supply of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products; supports the development and availability of diagnostic tests that may be useful for identifying the presence of or prior exposure to the Zika virus; works with commercial and government developers to advance the development of investigational vaccines and therapeutics; and monitors for fraudulent products and false product claims related the Zika virus. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.","Published: August 27, 2016"

Sound waves bounce off the tissues, revealing their different densities and shapes. The next step in ultrasound technology is to image not just anatomy, but specific cells and molecules deeper in the body, such as those associated with tumors or bacteria in our gut. A new study from Caltech outlines how protein engineering techniques might help achieve this milestone. The researchers engineered protein-shelled nanostructures called gas vesicles which reflect sound waves to exhibit new properties useful for ultrasound technologies. In the future, these gas vesicles could be administered to a patient to visualize tissues of interest. The modified gas vesicles were shown to: give off more distinct signals, making them easier to image; target specific cell types; and help create color ultrasound images. ""It's somewhat like engineering with molecular Legos,"" says assistant professor of chemical engineering and Heritage Principal Investigator Mikhail Shapiro, who is the senior author of a new paper about the research published in this month's issue of the journal ACS Nano and featured on the journal's cover. ""We can swap different protein 'pieces' on the surface of gas vesicles to alter their targeting properties and to visualize multiple molecules in different colors."" ""Today, ultrasound is mostly anatomical,"" says Anupama Lakshmanan, a graduate student in Shapiro's lab and lead author of the study. ""We want to bring it down to the molecular and cellular level."" In 2014, Shapiro first discovered the potential use of gas vesicles in ultrasound imaging. These gas-filled structures are naturally occurring in water-dwelling single-celled organisms, such as Anabaena flos-aquae, a species of cyanobacteria that forms filamentous clumps of multicell chains. The gas vesicles help the organisms control how much they float and thus their exposure to sunlight at the water's surface. Shapiro realized that the vesicles would readily reflect sound waves during ultrasound imaging, and ultimately demonstrated this using mice. In the latest research, Shapiro and his team set out to give the gas vesicles new properties by engineering gas vesicle protein C, or GvpC, a protein naturally found on the surface of vesicles that gives them mechanical strength and prevents them from collapsing. The protein can be engineered to have different sizes, with longer versions of the protein producing stronger and stiffer nanostructures. ""The proteins are like the framing rods of an airplane fuselage. You use them to determine the mechanics of the structure."" Shapiro says. In one experiment, the scientists removed the strengthening protein from gas vesicles and then administered the engineered vesicles to mice and performed ultrasound imaging. Compared to normal vesicles, the modified vesicles vibrated more in response to sound waves, and thus resonated with harmonic frequencies. Harmonics are created when sound waves bounce around, for instance in a violin, and form new waves with doubled and tripled frequencies. Harmonics are not readily created in natural tissues, making the vesicles stand out in ultrasound images. In another set of experiments, the researchers demonstrated how the gas vesicles could be made to target certain tissues in the body. They genetically engineered the vesicles to display various cellular targets, such as an amino acid sequence that recognizes proteins called integrins that are overproduced in tumor cells. ""Adding these functionalities to the gas vesicles is like snapping on a new Lego piece; it's a modular system,"" says Shapiro. The team also showed how multicolor ultrasound images might be created. Conventional ultrasound images appear black and white. Shapiro's group created an approach for imaging three different types of gas vesicles as separate ""colors"" based on their differential ability to resist collapse under pressure. The vesicles themselves do not appear in different colors, but they can be assigned colors based on their different properties. To demonstrate this, the team made three different versions of the vesicles with varying strengths of the GvpC protein. They then increased the ultrasound pressures, causing the variant populations to successively collapse one by one. As each population collapsed, the overall ultrasound signal decreased in proportion to the amount of that variant in the sample, and this signal change was then mapped to a specific color. In the future, if each variant population targeted a specific cell type, researchers would be able to visualize the cells in multiple colors. ""You might be able to see tumor cells versus the immune cells attacking the tumor, and thus monitor the progress of a medical treatment,"" says Shapiro.","Published: August 26, 2016"

These bacteria are a common cause of meningitis in newborns and the leading cause of infection in the first three months of life in the UK and globally. The new research, on 183 women in The Gambia and published in the journal Clinical and Translational Immunology, suggests a sugar found in some women s breast milk protect babies against the bacteria. The bug is carried naturally in the vagina and bowels by up to one in three women and can be transferred to the baby during childbirth or in breast milk. In the UK pregnant women deemed high risk are offered a test for the bacteria, or women can pay privately. This test consists of a swab a few weeks before a woman's due date. However there is still a chance of a woman picking up the bacteria in her gut at some point between the test and giving birth (once the bug gets into the gut of the mother or baby it can trigger an infection). However, the new research, from the Centre for International Child Health at Imperial, found that naturally-occurring sugars in a woman s breast milk may have protective effects against Group B streptococcus.  Each woman s breast milk contains a mixture of many different types of sugar, called human milk oligosaccharides. These are not digested in the baby s tummy and act as food for the 'friendly bacteria' in a baby's intestine.  The type of sugars a woman produces in her breast milk are partly dictated by her genetic make-up. A type of genetic system in particular, called the Lewis antigen system (which is involved in making the ABO blood group), plays an important role in determining breast milk sugars. In the study, the team tested all the mothers  breast milk for the sugars that are known to be controlled by these Lewis genes. They also tested women and their babies for Group B streptococcus at birth, six days later, and then between 60 and 89 days after birth. The team found women who produced breast milk sugars linked to the Lewis gene were less likely to have the bacteria in their gut, and their babies were also less likely to get the bacteria from their mothers at birth. In addition, among the babies who had the bacteria in their guts at birth, the infants whose mothers produced a specific sugar in their breast milk, called lacto-n-difucohexaose I, were more likely to have cleared the bacteria from their body by 60-89 days after birth. This suggests this breast milk sugar, which is linked to the Lewis gene, may have a protective effect. The researchers then went on to show in the laboratory that breast milk containing this particular sugar - lacto-n-difucohexaose I - was better at killing the Group B streptococcus bacteria compared to breast milk without this specific sugar. Around half of all women in the world are thought to produce the sugar lacto-N-difucohexaose I.  Dr Nicholas Andreas, lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial said: ""Although this is early-stage research it demonstrates the complexity of breast milk, and the benefits it may have for the baby. Increasingly, research is suggesting these breast milk sugars (human milk oligosaccharides) may protect against infections in the newborn, such as rotavirus and Group B streptococcus, as well as boosting a child s  friendly  gut bacteria.  He added the presence of these sugars allows  friendly  bacteria to flourish and out-compete any harmful bacteria that may be in the youngster's gut, such as Group B streptococcus.  The sugars are also thought to act as decoys, and fool the bacteria into thinking the sugar is a type of human cell that can be invaded. The bacteria latch onto the sugar and is then excreted by the body. This may help protect the baby from infection until their own immune system is more mature to fight off the  bad bugs  at around six months of age. The team hope their findings might lead to new treatments to protect mothers and babies from infections. The researchers raise the possibility of giving specific breast milk sugar supplements to pregnant and breast-feeding women who do not carry the active Lewis gene. This may help prevent harmful bacteria getting into the baby s gut at birth and in the first weeks of life. Some companies are already exploring adding such sugars to formula milk, but Dr Andreas cautioned it would be difficult to replicate the mix of sugars found in breast milk:  These experimental formulas only contain a couple of these compounds, whereas human breast milk contains dozens of different types. Furthermore, the quantity of sugars produced by the mother changes as the baby ages so that a newborn baby will receive a higher amount of sugars in the breast milk compared to a six-month-old."" Dr Andreas, who is a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for International Child Health at Imperial, also suggested that testing new mothers' blood for the Lewis gene may be beneficial: ""If we know whether a mother is colonised with Group B streptococcus and know if she carries an active copy of the Lewis gene, it may give us an indication of how likely she is to pass the bacteria on to her baby, and more personalised preventive measures could be applied."" The work was supported by the Medical Research Council at the MRC Unit The Gambia, the Wellcome Trust, and the Thrasher Research Fund.","Published: August 26, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/researchers-identify-influenza-fighting-molecule-207494,Researchers Identify Influenza Fighting Molecule St  Jude scientists have identified the molecule that recognizes influenza virus cells and triggers their death to fight the infection   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. St. Jude Children s Research Hospital immunologists have identified the protein trigger in the body s quick-reaction innate immune system that specifically recognizes the influenza virus in infected cells and triggers their death. The researchers said that identifying this virus sensor, called ZBP1, offers the hope of developing drugs to protect against influenza s sometimes lethal complication of pneumonia. The pneumonia is exacerbated by lung inflammation and cell damage caused by overreaction of the innate immune system. Such drugs would modulate ZBP1 s action allowing the body to fight the virus by killing infected cells, but preventing that overreaction. The team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings today in the journal Science Immunology. First author on the paper was Teneema Kuriakose, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research associate in the Kanneganti laboratory. Their research sought to understand how the body s innate immune system is alerted to the presence of the virus and mobilizes to trigger infected cells to commit suicide. The innate immune system triggers the body s  emergency response  to invaders such as infections. This rapid attack gives the body s adaptive immune system time to generate antibodies that specifically target the virus or bacterium. Flu vaccines train this adaptive immune system to attack specific viral strains. In the studies led by Kanneganti, Kuriakose and colleagues first sought to identify the specific machinery that the innate immune system uses to induce cell suicide. They identified that machinery as a biological pathway controlled by type I interferon. Once the scientists identified that pathway, they began to search for the protein molecule that actually recognizes the virus and triggers the cell death machinery. Their experiments used cells from genetically altered mouse strains, in which genes for particular proteins are selectively removed, to discover whether the cells lacking that protein would commit suicide when infected with influenza. To their surprise, researchers found that cells lacking a protein called ZBP1 were completely resistant to viral-induced cell death. The finding was surprising because ZBP1 was known to sense foreign DNA in the cell, but the influenza virus uses RNA as its genetic material.  Our discovery was totally unexpected,  said Kanneganti.  We never thought we would actually identify this molecule to be important in influenza viral infection, because there is no DNA stage in the influenza life cycle.  Further experiments revealed that ZBP1 was, indeed, a  master assassin  in the cell, responsible for triggering three separate cell death pathways. In another surprise, the researchers discovered that ZBP1 was specific for recognizing influenza. The sensor did not trigger cell death in response to other similar viruses or to bacteria. This specificity is surprising, because the innate immune system is a generic emergency responder its attack machinery evolved to thwart a wide array of invaders. Other experiments revealed that ZBP1 acts as a protein detector, not a DNA detector, sensing telltale viral-produced proteins in the infected cell. Moving their studies from cells to whole animals, the researchers tested the effects of knocking out the Zbp1 gene in mice infected with influenza. Because the innate immune system wasn t killing off infected cells, the mice showed an increased viral load and delayed recovery. But because the immune system wasn t able to overreact, the mice showed reduced lung inflammation and damage to lung cells and were protected from mortality.  Since the pathology that we saw in the mice matches what is seen in humans, we will now explore translating these findings to humans,  Kanneganti said.  If we can somehow modulate the activation of this pathway, then that will help to decrease the exaggerated inflammatory response that causes mortality during influenza infection.  The timing of such drug treatment would be critical, Kuriakose said.  ZBP1 does an amazing job of killing off infected cells. But it would be very useful to modulate ZBP1 in later stages of the infection, when the uncontrolled inflammation causes damage.  Kanneganti emphasized that their discoveries have fundamental importance, because they identify a key innate immune sensor that recognizes the influenza virus and a regulator of multiple cell death pathways. These details are basic to our understanding of biological pathways of the innate immune system.  We have shown that these molecules are important in viral infections, but now we want to test their role in other inflammatory conditions,  she said.  ZBP1 is likely not dedicated to attacking only the influenza virus. Maybe it also plays other roles, and if we fully understand those roles, we can learn how to manipulate immune responses.

People with a DNA variation in a gene called PDSS2 tend to drink fewer cups of coffee, the study found. Experts say the findings suggest that the gene reduces the ability of cells to breakdown caffeine, causing it to stay in the body for longer. Caffeine hit This means that a person would not need to consume as much coffee to get the same caffeine hit, the team says. The findings add to previous studies that have identified genes linked to coffee habits and shed new light on the biological mechanisms of caffeine metabolism. Gene survey Researchers looked at genetic information from 370 people living in a small village in south Italy and 843 people from six villages in north-east Italy. Each of the study participants was asked to complete a survey that included a question about how many cups of coffee they drank each day. The team found that people with the DNA variation in PDSS2 tended to consume fewer cups of coffee than people without the variation. The effect was equivalent to around one fewer cup of coffee per day on average. The results of our study add to existing research suggesting that our drive to drink coffee may be embedded in our genes. We need to do larger studies to confirm the discovery and also to clarify the biological link between PDSS2 and coffee consumption.  Coffee preference The researchers replicated the study in a group of 1731 people from the Netherlands.  The result was similar but the effect of the gene on the number of cups of coffee consumed was slightly lower. This could be because of the different styles of coffee that are drunk in the two countries, the researchers say. In Italy, people tend to drink smaller cups such as espresso whereas in the Netherlands the preference is towards larger cups that contain more caffeine overall. The Study The study was conducted at the Universities of Edinburgh and Trieste, the Burlo Garofolo Pediatric Institute in Italy, the Erasmus Medical Center and PolyOmica, a data analysis company based in Groningen, the Netherlands. Researchers from the Italian coffee company Illy also participated in the project though the company did not offer financial support.

These findings are based on a systematic review of the published scientific literature, the Working Group for IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention Volume 16: Body Fatness provided the latest evaluation of the cancer-preventive effects of the absence of excess body fatness. A summary of the results is published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.  A Working Group of 21 independent international experts, convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), assessed more than 1000 studies, including intervention trials, cohort and case  control studies, studies in experimental animals, and studies on the mechanisms linking excess body fatness and cancer.  This comprehensive evaluation reinforces the benefits of maintaining a healthy body weight in order to reduce the risk of several different types of cancer,  says Dr B atrice Lauby-Secretan, lead author of the new article.  Link between overweight/obesity and cancer  The experts confirmed the previous evaluation of the IARC Handbooks (Volume 6, published in 2002) that the absence of excess body fatness reduces the risk of cancer s of the colon and rectum, oesophagus (adenocarcinoma), kidney (renal cell carcinoma), breast in postmenopausal women, and endometrium of the uterus.  In addition, the review of the available literature for middle-aged adults showed that there is sufficient evidence in humans that the absence of excess body fatness reduces the risk of cancers of the gastric cardia, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, ovary, and thyroid, and meningioma, and multiple myeloma. There is also limited evidence that the absences of excess body fatness reduces the risk of fatal cancer of the prostate, cancer of the breast in men, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  The Working Group al so reviewed data pertaining to body fatness in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged up to 25 years) to assess whether obesity at earlier periods of life is linked with cancer in adult life. For several cancer sites, including the colon and the liver, associations between excess body weight and cancers were observed that were similar to those reported in adults.  It is well established that overweight in experimental animals increases the incidence of several types of cancer. Studies in overweight animals showed that caloric or dietary restriction reduces the risk of cancers of the mammary gland, colon, liver, pancreas, skin, and pituitary gland. Global burden of overweight and obesity  Body fatness is assessed primarily by body mass index (BMI), defined as a person s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in metres (kg/m2). In adults, overweight is defined as BMI   25 kg/m2, and obesity as BMI   30 kg/m2. Worldwide, an estimated 640 million adults were obese in 2014 (a 6-fold increase since 1975) and 110 million children and adolescents were obese in 2013 (a 2-fold increase since 1980). The estimated age-standardized prevalence of obesity in 2014 was 10.8% in men, 14.9% in women, and 5.0% in children, and globally more people are overweight or obese than are underweight.  In 2013, an estimated 4.5 million deaths worldwide were attributable to overweight and obesity. The identification of new obesity-related cancer sites will add to the number of deaths worldwide attributable to obesity.   The new evidence emphasizes how important it is to find effective ways, at both the individual and societal level, to implement World Health Organization recommendations on improving diets and physical activity patterns throughout life if the burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases is to be tackled,  says IARC Director Dr Christopher Wild.

The discovery offers a potential drug target for several inflammatory disorders characterized by an abnormal lifespan in a group of white blood cells, which can lead to organ damage.  The gene for a LncRNA called Morrbid was identified in 2013 by Henao-Mejia when he was a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of the present study s coauthor, Richard Flavell, PhD, FRS, at Yale University in collaboration with another coauthor, Adam Williams, of The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Bar Harbor, Maine. After Henao-Mejia established his lab at Penn in 2014, he and his students led the team that eventually identified the immune cells in which Morrbid is expressed and illuminated its role and mechanism by which it regulates immune cell lifespan. This current study appears as an advance online publication in Nature this month.   Long non-coding RNAs are transcribed from genes and are often abundant in cells, yet they do not code for proteins. The human genome contains about 20,000 protein-coding genes   less than 2 percent of the total genome   but 70 percent of the human genome actively produces about 10,000 lncRNAs and the function of the majority of them is unknown.  The team found that Morrbid controls the life span of circulating myeloid cells, which are key to maintaining the proper balance between fighting infection and inflammation. The gene for Morrbid is conserved across species, including mice and humans, and is specific to certain immune cells -- neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes.  These cell types comprise 70 percent of all circulating white blood cells; however, they are very potent in their reaction and sometimes so strong that they can cause much damage to surrounding, healthy tissue. The active system is akin to the first responders to a crisis or an invader of all immune cells.  But, how does the body keep this initial over-zealous-guard-dog response in check? How does the body know when and how to tell the cells to back off?   These cells are extremely short-lived   less than one day -- and their life span is tightly regulated to meet the demands of an organism,  Henao-Mejia said.  If we understand the molecular mechanisms by which their life span is tightly regulated, perhaps we could correct it when the control goes awry or power it up, when needed.  Morrbid regulates cell lifespan by controlling the expression of Bim, a nearby gene that in turn controls programmed cell death in response to the abundance of pro-survival cytokines and metabolites in the surrounding environment outside cells. Morrbid essentially overrides a signaling mechanism that prevents premature immune cell death.  By deleting Morrbid in mice, the team instigated a drastic reduction in the frequency of immune cells that normally express Morrbid. Therefore, the mice had less ability to fight infection but gained protection against inflammation.  The expression of the human version of the gene, MORRBID, is impaired in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome, in which the lifespan of some immune cells is not kept in check, causing inflammation and organ damage.  Knowing this, Morrbid might be a good drug target for this uncommon disease and maybe even has a potential role for chronic diseases like asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, or cancer, all of which have an errant inflammatory component to their symptoms,  Henao-Mejia said.  In the near future, we would like to concentrate our efforts to develop strategies to modulate the function of MORRBID in human cells as an effective therapeutic tool against inflammatory disease.

It is the most abundant protein found in the bodies of humans and many other animals. It is also an important biomaterial in modern medicine, used in wound healing, tissue repair, drug delivery and more. Much of the clinical supply comes from animals like pigs and cows, but it can cause allergic reactions or illness in some people. Functional human collagen has been impossible to create in the lab. In the study, published this month in Nature Chemistry, a team of University of Wisconsin Madison researchers describe what may be the key to growing functional, natural collagen fibres outside of the body: symmetry.  These are massive protein chains and it s difficult to make them,  says study lead author I. Caglar Tanrikulu, an assistant scientist in the laboratory of Ronald Raines, professor of chemistry and Henry Lardy Professor of Biochemistry.  You can t synthesize them chemically because they re really long. You can t make them biologically because of post-translational modifications,  the cellular-level touches that render collagen functional. In the body, collagen is built by a process involving the interaction of three separate strands of collagen protein that intertwine to create a long, rope-like fibre, known as a triple helix. For years, scientists have tried to get short pieces of collagen arranged into a triple helix to grow into these long fibres, but the process relies on chemistry and physical principles that are more complex than the relatively simple rules of other molecules like DNA, which forms a double helix. So far, they have not succeeded in creating fibres that are either long enough or thick enough to mimic what is found in the body. However, the work of these scientists has helped to establish some ground rules that govern the basic principles of collagen building. For example, they have found that making collagen requires having just the right amount of chemical and physical contact between individual strands to encourage them to fit together and grow. Using the knowledge from new studies as a basic scaffold, Tanrikulu got to work  designing  collagen based on the rules he knew to be true. Those rules include a particular arrangement of amino acids   which create the collagen protein   and specific interactions between charged molecules on the individual collagen strands, called salt bridges, that help link them together. A relative outsider to the field, Tanrikulu  naively  began to assemble a collection of possible designs, ignoring some of the dogma his more experienced colleagues had adopted in their work.  My naivet  ended up being my biggest strength,  says Tanrikulu.  I looked at it in a way other people hadn t.  He realized that each individual strand in the three-member collagen fibre had to  see  the exact same environment while leaving enough overlap between them that they could join up with other short pieces of collagen.  All parts of the collagen fibre have to be experiencing the same thing,  Tanrikulu says.  Like floor tiles, if you know the shape of a tile and what symmetry to use, you can cover the whole surface; either every tile is arranged the same as the others or the edges won t fit. Similarly, if the ends of the growing collagen fibre are not regularly-spaced, the chemical environment won t be the same.  Tanrikulu came up with multiple designs that fit the symmetry criteria. None of his predecessors  versions met it.  The key is not making the peptide (the short version of a protein that serves as the individual tile in a larger molecule),  he says.  It s knowing which peptide to make.  Using the rules and subsequent designs, Tanrikulu was able to grow long, stable collagen fibres in the laboratory that mimic those found in nature. Now, he is exploring ways to bring the findings to the world of biomaterials and nanotechnology, and is looking to collaborate with other scientists with expertise in these fields. The lessons he has learned about the importance of symmetry in building collagen, he believes, could have implications for other types of molecules, which could be particularly informative for nanotechnology. And, equipped with a better way to grow molecules in the lab, he s hopeful it will have human health applications, too, even if that is far in the future.  This is something that has never been done before. Will it have an eventual application? I hope so,  Tanrikulu says.  But that s not how science works. ","Published: August 26, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/oxygen-can-impair-cancer-immunotherapy-204676,Oxygen Can Impair Cancer Immunotherapy Researchers have identified a mechanism within the lungs where anticancer immune resposnse is inhibited  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Researchers have identified a mechanism in mice by which anticancer immune responses are inhibited within the lungs, a common site of metastasis for many cancers. This mechanism involves oxygen inhibition of the anticancer activity of T cells. Inhibiting the oxygen-sensing capability of immune cells, either genetically or pharmacologically, prevented lung metastasis. This research was conducted by Nicholas Restifo, M.D., Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute (NCI) and others at NCI as well as colleagues at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, both parts of the National Institutes of Health. The findings appeared Aug. 25, 2016, in the journal Cell. Metastasis is the cause of most cancer deaths. It has long been hypothesized that the process of cancer metastasis requires cooperation between spreading cancer cells and the cellular environment to which they spread. A key component of that environment is the local immune system, which can act to fight off invading cancer cells. The researchers discovered that T cells, a type of immune cell, contain a group of oxygen-sensing proteins which act to limit inflammation within the lungs. This new research shows, however, that oxygen also suppresses the anticancer activity of T cells, thereby permitting cancer cells that have spread to the lungs to escape immune attack and establish metastatic colonies.   Since the lung is one of the most frequent sites to which cancers spread, we hypothesized that there might be unique immunologic processes that aid tumor cells in their ability to establish themselves in the lung. Because oxygen is a pervasive local environmental factor in the lung, we wanted to examine what role oxygen might play in regulating immunity in the lung,  said David Clever, a M.D., Ph.D. candidate who trained in Restifo s lab, and has now returned to the Ohio State University College of Medicine.  The research team discovered that oxygen-sensing proteins, called prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins, act within T cells to prevent overly strong immune responses to harmless particles that frequently enter the lung. This protective mechanism also allows circulating cancer cells to get a foothold in the lung.  Specifically, the researchers found that PHD proteins promote the development of regulatory T cells, a type of T cell that suppresses the activity of other parts of the immune system. They also found that PHD proteins limit the development of inflammatory T cells and restrain their ability to produce molecules involved in cancer killing. To test whether PHD proteins promote tumor cells to grow in the lung, the researchers used a  knockout  mouse strain that lacks PHD proteins in its T cells. These PHD-knock-out mice, as well as unaltered normal mice, were injected with melanoma cells. Strikingly, whereas normal mice showed large amounts of cancerous melanoma cells in the lungs, the mice whose T cells lacked PHD proteins showed almost no evidence of melanoma in the lungs. Given their finding that PHD proteins suppress the inflammatory immune response in the lung, the researchers wondered whether inhibiting them might improve the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer, a type of immunotherapy that harnesses the ability of a patient s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer. In adoptive cell transfer, T cells are extracted from a patient s tumor tissue, expanded to great numbers in the laboratory, and then administered intravenously into the patient along with a T-cell growth factor, with hopes that these cells will return to sites of cancer and eliminate it. For these experiments, the research team expanded the antitumor T cells in the presence of a drug called dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), which blocks the activity of PHD proteins. In the lab, the drug treatment improved the cancer-killing properties of the T cells and when administered to mice with established metastatic cancer, the drug-treated T cells were far better at eliminating cancer than untreated T cells. DMOG treatment has also been found to improve the cancer-killing properties of human T cells in other studies.  The application of these findings to human adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy clinical trials is being investigated by Restifo s group.  Adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy provides a unique opportunity for manipulation of a patient s own T cells out of the body,  said Restifo.  Although our finding is in mice, we are eager to test whether disruption of the oxygen sensing machinery in T cells   with drugs, genetics, or regulation of environmental oxygen   will enhance the efficacy of T-cell mediated immune therapies for cancer in humans.

They found that early-stage breast cancer patients with high  clinical risk    as determined by conventional measures such as tumor size, the presence of hormone receptors, and metastasis to lymph nodes   but low genetic risk, according to MammaPrint results, had very similar prognoses whether they underwent chemotherapy or not. After five years, nearly 95 percent of patients with high clinical risk, but low genetic risk, who did not receive chemotherapy were still alive and without metastatic disease distant from the site of their primary cancer, a survival rate only 1.5 percent lower than in women with the same characteristics who did receive chemotherapy. The patients had undergone other standard treatments in addition to surgery, including hormone therapy and radiation treatment. Potential to Help Clinicians, Patients Evaluate Treatment The results suggest that MammaPrint testing could be used to help clinicians and patients evaluate their treatment course   which may include skipping chemotherapy.  For the first time, a prospective, randomized trial shows that the active biology of breast cancer in an individual, as assessed by the MammaPrint test, can assist in making a well-informed choice to undergo chemotherapy treatment or not,  said co-first author Laura van  t Veer, PhD, an inventor of MammaPrint, and director of Applied Genomics at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. The results come from an international research collaboration called MINDACT ( Microarray In Node-Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy ). Joining van  t Veer as equally contributing authors are Fatima Cardoso, MD, director of the breast unit of the Champalimaud Clinical Center, in Lisbon, Portugal; and Jan Bogaerts, PhD, of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Headquarters. The team also included Emiel Rutgers, MD, PhD, of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, and Martine Piccart, MD, PhD, of the Universit  Libre de Bruxelles, in Belgium. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In 2015, the American Cancer Society estimated that there were nearly 1.7 million new breast cancer cases internationally in 2012, accounting for 25 percent of all new cancer cases in women. Gene expression patterns in tumors differ from individual to individual, and MammaPrint, which is produced by Agendia, a company co-founded by van  t Veer, represents a new way to assess risk of cancer recurrence in women with breast cancer. The test checks for a 70-gene signature that can predict whether cancer will reoccur in early-stage breast cancer patients. Chemotherapy and Metastases  Chemotherapy, though a powerful treatment for breast cancer, is toxic, and causes serious side effects. In the MINDACT study, 23 percent of nearly 6,700 breast cancer patients across Europe were determined to be candidates for chemotherapy due to their high clinical risk, but they had low-risk tumors according to MammaPrint. These patients were randomly assigned into two groups: one received chemotherapy and the other did not. Five years after they had received surgery, almost 95 percent of the patients in the group of high clinical risk/low genetic risk patients who did not receive chemotherapy were still alive, a survival rate only 1.5 percent lower than that for the group that did receive chemotherapy. Those who didn t receive chemotherapy also did not develop metastases distant from the site of their original cancer. For the most common type of breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (HR+)/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2 )/lymph node negative (LN0) disease, 75 percent of patients were found to have low genetic risk via MammaPrint. Of that group, nearly 98 percent of those not receiving chemotherapy had a five-year survival rate without a distant metastasis. Overall, 46 percent of the women with high clinical risk had low genetic risk, as determined by MammaPrint testing, suggesting that nearly half of high clinical risk women could safely forgo chemotherapy, the researchers report.  The MINDACT trial results are of great importance for early stage breast cancer patients,  said van  t Veer. MINDACT is a collaboration between 112 academic cancer centers; van  t Veer s company, Agendia NV; the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer; and the Breast International Group. Analysis of the tumor samples for the trial was performed by Agendia at no charge. As a co-founder, part-time employee, member of the management board, and stockholder in Agendia NV, van  t Veer has disclosed that she has received  personal fees and other support from Agendia NV outside the submitted work.  The Netherlands Cancer Institute holds a patent related to MammaPrint, which is licensed to Agendia NV; UCSF has no interest in the MammaPrint patent.","Published: August 26, 2016"

Millions of Americans, and an even larger number of patients worldwide, take calcium channel blockers to control cardiovascular problems. In a study published Aug. 24 in the advanced online edition of Nature, researchers describe how the fundamental mode of action of two distinct chemical classes of these drugs differs. The knowledge was gleaned by analyzing the atomic structure of their binding sites.   UW Medicine researchers Dr. William A. Catterall, University of Washington professor and chair of pharmacology, and Ning Zheng, UW professor of pharmacology and investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, headed the project.  The first author on the Nature report was Lin Tang, UW postdoctoral research scientist in pharmacology. Calcium channel blockers were first identified and approved as medications in the previous half-century, and have emerged as major therapies for cardiovascular disorders. These latest findings could inform the design of better, safer versions of calcium channel blockers for managing heart beat irregularities, chest pain, and high blood pressure. The researchers compared calcium channel blockers that treat heart arrhythmias, such as verapamil, with those taken for hypertension or angina, such as amlodipine.  A third class of calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem, both slow the heart rate and dilate the blood vessels. Those drugs were not part of this study. The team wanted to learn how calcium channel blocker molecules interact with calcium channels, the molecular pores that govern the flow of calcium ions across a cell membrane. When these pores open in heart muscle cells or in the smooth muscle cells in arteries and veins, the rush of calcium entering the cells triggers contraction of the heart to pump blood and contraction of the arteries to narrow their diameter and thereby increase blood pressure. By interfering with these molecular pores, calcium channel blockers can subdue a too-powerful cardiovascular response that can cause an irregular heart beat or high blood pressure.   Pharmacologists had thought that verapamil-like drugs physically blocked calcium channel pores to prevent calcium entry into the cell, and thereby restore a normal heart rhythm, whereas amlodipine-like drugs (called dihydropyridines) were thought to indirectly prevent calcium channel activation and pore opening, and thereby prevent high blood pressure and angina. However, the specific structures behind these different mechanisms of action remained uncharted. Advances in X-ray crystallography   a way to determine the arrangement of atoms within a large protein molecule   and in the functional analyses of ion channels have now enabled researchers to probe the submolecular depths of the drugs  actions.   Researchers looked at where the drug molecules bound to calcium channels, and how this binding changes the workings of the channels. The binding site for the blood pressure and angina medication, amlodipine, was discovered to be on the outside edge of the calcium channel molecule. The central pore has voltage sensors around it which are sensitive to electrical potential.  The binding site is positioned on the outside edge of the central pore structure between two of the four subunits of the calcium channel molecule. The binding shuts down the channel by distorting its shape and lodging a calcium ion permanently within it.  The amlodipine subtly remodels the pore so that the calcium ion is pulled to one side and just sticks there the whole time, as if it were locked up,"" said Ning Zheng. In contrast, the verapamil molecule plugs the central cavity of a calcium channel and by itself directly barricades the calcium ion-conducting pathway. Verapamil also takes advantage of the frequent openings of the calcium channels when the heart is palpitating, as it does during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.  The more often the pore opens, the greater the odds that the verapamil molecule can slip into the central cavity and seal off the pore.  Verapamil appears to bind better to calcium channels in the rapidly beating parts of the heart and slows them down,  Catterall said.  He noted that his UW colleague, Bertil Hille, professor of physiology and biophysics, and his associates earlier had demonstrated the effects of rapid firing frequency on sodium channel blockade in their studies of local anesthetic drugs like lidocaine that prevent pain in dentistry and surgery. On the other hand, in their resting state, calcium channels in blood vessel cells are usually closed.  Amlodipine molecules modulate the voltage-dependent activation of calcium channels, and do not need to rely on frequent openings of the channel to enter the pore. That is why amlodipine-like drugs, which relax the blood vessels, can treat certain causes of high blood pressure and the tight, squeezing pain of angina without major effects on the heart itself.  This sets them apart from the verapamil-like drugs, which favor calcium channels in cells active in the electrical circuitry of the heart.  Understanding details of the two binding sites might lead to the development of calcium channel blockers that fit more exactly in place.  A more precise shape might also prevent next-generation versions of the blockers from inadvertently aligning with the wrong binding sites and causing unwanted side effects.  Calcium channel blockers are relatively safe drugs,  Catterall explained,  but toxicity can arise from overdoses that can lead to ventricular arrhythmias or to too strong depression of the contraction of the heart or smooth muscle cells.   Structure-based, improved drug design, he said, might allow for smaller, yet still effective, drug doses that are more specific and safer.  Fine-tuning the drug design, he added, might prevent another possible contributor to unwanted side effects: the off-target blocking of sodium channels by calcium channel blockers. The new research was conducted on bacterial ion channels, which are the ancestors of sodium and calcium channels in other life forms, including worms, flies, fish and humans.  These ancient channels in bacteria still recognize the drugs designed for people,  Catterall said.  The experiments done by our second author Tamer Gamal El-Din, acting assistant professor of pharmacology, showed that these drugs act in the same way on bacterial channels as they do on those in mammals. It s remarkable that the most basic bacterial channels respond to these modern medicines for treating arrhythmias and certain other cardiovascular diseases. ","Published: August 26, 2016"

In their report in the Sept. 1 issue of Nature, the research team describes finding a mixture of HER2-positive and HER2-negative circulating tumors cells (CTCs) in blood samples from patients who developed metastatic disease after originally being diagnosed with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.   Not only did we observe the acquisition of HER2 positivity in patients with ER-positive/HER2 negative breast tumors, we also found that this population of tumor cells is able to spontaneously oscillate between HER2-positive and HER2-negative states, which contributes to tumor progression and resistance,  says Shyamala Maheswaran, PhD, of the MGH Cancer Center, co-senior author of the report.  We also showed in mouse models the types of therapies that may be most useful for patients with these difficult-to-treat tumors.  Molecular heterogeneity of tumors has become a confounding factor in cancer treatment in recent years, requiring the use of multiple drugs that specifically target all the different cell populations driving tumor growth. The current study was designed to investigate further the differences in HER2 expression that can occur in individual patients  tumors and how they affect tumor growth and treatment. Using the CTC-iChip   a microfluidic device developed at the MGH Center for Engineering in Medicine that isolates CTCs from blood samples   the researchers found both HER2-positive and HER2-negative CTCs in samples from 16 out of 18 patients who had developed metastases after treatment for ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.  CTCs isolated from patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and grown in culture also showed a similar pattern of HER2 expression, in which some of the tumor cells expressed HER2 and some did not. Closer examination of these HER2-positive tumor cells showed elevated expression of proteins in several growth signaling pathways, but the level of HER2 expression was not as high as seen in HER2-amplified primary tumors.  These HER2-positive CTCs were no more sensitive to treatment with a HER2-inhibiting drug than were HER2-negative CTCs, but combined treatment with both the HER2 inhibitor and an IGFR1 (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1) inhibitor was toxic to HER2-positive CTCs. In contrast, HER2-negative CTCs had elevated expression of proteins in the Notch developmental pathway and in pathways that respond to DNA damage. Reflecting those differences, HER2-positive CTCs were found to proliferate more rapidly and respond to treatment with standard chemotherapy drugs, while HER2-negative CTCs were more resistant to chemotherapy drugs but sensitive to gamma secretase inhibitors, which are known to suppress Notch signaling.  Injecting either HER2-positive or HER2-negative breast tumor cells into the mammary tissue of mice led to the development of tumors with both types of cells. Treatment of tumors in which HER2-positive cells were predominant with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel led to rapid tumor shrinkage, followed by recurrence with a greater number of HER2-negative cells, while paclitaxel treatment of tumors with more HER2-negative cells did not have any effect. Treating mice in which tumors had been initiated by a mixture of HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumor cells with a combination of paclitaxel and a gamma secretase inhibitor did delay tumor recurrence significantly, suggesting the potential utility of a combination treatment strategy to eliminate this mixed population of tumor cells.   The ability of these two populations of tumor cells to convert back and forth highlights the importance of treating tumors with drugs that would simultaneously target both populations,  says Maheswaran, who is an associate professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Now we need to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this interconversion. ","Published: August 26, 2016"

The discovery offers a potential drug target for several inflammatory disorders characterized by an abnormal lifespan in a group of white blood cells, which can lead to organ damage. The gene for a lncRNA called Morrbid was identified in 2013 by Henao-Mejia when he was a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of the present study s coauthor, Richard Flavell, PhD, FRS, at Yale University in collaboration with another coauthor, Adam Williams, of The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Bar Harbor, Maine. After Henao-Mejia established his lab at Penn in 2014, he and his students led the team that eventually identified the immune cells in which Morrbid is expressed and illuminated its role and mechanism by which it regulates immune cell lifespan. This current study appears as an advance online publication in Nature this month.  Long non-coding RNAs are transcribed from genes and are often abundant in cells, yet they do not code for proteins. The human genome contains about 20,000 protein-coding genes   less than 2 percent of the total genome   but 70 percent of the human genome actively produces about 10,000 lncRNAs and the function of the majority of them is unknown. The team found that Morrbid controls the life span of circulating myeloid cells, which are key to maintaining the proper balance between fighting infection and inflammation. The gene for Morrbid is conserved across species, including mice and humans, and is specific to certain immune cells -- neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. These cell types comprise 70 percent of all circulating white blood cells, however, they are very potent in their reaction and sometimes so strong that they can cause much damage to surrounding, healthy tissue. The active system is akin to the first responders to a crisis or an invader of all immune cells. But, how does the body keep this initial over-zealous-guard-dog response in check? How does the body know when and how to tell the cells to back off?  These cells are extremely short-lived   less than one day -- and their life span is tightly regulated to meet the demands of an organism,  Henao-Mejia said.  If we understand the molecular mechanisms by which their life span is tightly regulated, perhaps we could correct it when the control goes awry or power it up, when needed.  Morrbid regulates cell lifespan by controlling the expression of Bim, a nearby gene that in turn controls programmed cell death in response to the abundance of pro-survival cytokines and metabolites in the surrounding environment outside cells. Morrbid essentially overrides a signaling mechanism that prevents premature immune cell death. By deleting Morrbid in mice, the team instigated a drastic reduction in the frequency of immune cells that normally express Morrbid. Therefore, the mice had less ability to fight infection but gained protection against inflammation. The expression of the human version of the gene, MORRBID, is impaired in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome, in which the lifespan of some immune cells is not kept in check, causing inflammation and organ damage.  Knowing this, Morrbid might be a good drug target for this uncommon disease and maybe even has a potential role for chronic diseases like asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, or cancer, all of which have an errant inflammatory component to their symptoms,  Henao-Mejia said.  In the near future, we would like to concentrate our efforts to develop strategies to modulate the function of MORRBID in human cells as an effective therapeutic tool against inflammatory disease.

These animals change their diet in late summer and are particularly attracted to sugary products. Those who are incautious or react inappropriately run the risk of wasp stings. This is sometimes a perilous situation for allergy sufferers. Hyposensibilisation is a common therapy against allergies. Here, the patient receives an inoculation with the allergens at periodic intervals in an increasing concentration. In this way the body slowly becomes accustomed to the allergen, in this case the insect venom. The process can take up to five years. ""For success it is important that the patients are treated with exactly the substance which induces the allergy,"" explains Dr. Simon Blank, leader of the working group at the Institute for Allergy Research (IAF) at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen. However, there are numerous different variants of vespid venom. ""Until now it was almost impossible to diagnostically differentiate the venoms of different wasp species,"" adds Blank. ""Consequently, it is correspondingly difficult to offer patients the best treatment. This often leads to them being treated unnecessarily against many venoms, which is a burden for patients and the health insurers.""  Improved diagnostics due to new test method Blank and his colleagues led by the IAF Director Prof. Carsten Schmidt-Weber were able to overcome this problem with a new test. First, the scientists specifically produced the allergen components of the venoms from a total of seven different insect species in modified insect cells.* Then, they examined them on 63 patient blood samples for their interaction with the antibodies triggering the allergy. ""A succession of several test methods enabled us to determine from the samples exactly the venom causing the allergic reaction in the patients,"" says lead author and doctoral student, Maximilian Schiener.  This could allow doctors to offer the most efficient vaccine.  However, according to the scientists, a hyposensibilisation therapy is not yet available against all venoms and further work is still to be done.  The results are coming just at the right time, because climate changes appear to be bringing new species of wasp to Germany which in turn produce their own venoms. ""Recently our colleagues in Aachen reported that they had sighted a paper wasp which is well-known in the Mediterranean region,"" explains Blank. ""If these neighbours propagate widely here, it would of course be an advantage if we were able to introduce the appropriate countermeasures directly   the vaccine is already available. A test such as ours could unambiguously identify the triggering venom in advance.""","Published: August 26, 2016"

A genetic analysis conducted by New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station researchers, which took four years to complete, aims to improve modern cultivation efforts of strawberry growers. The focus of the UNH research is one of cultivated strawberry s wild ancestors, Fragaria iinumae. Strawberry species have seven unique chromosomes. Like humans, this species of strawberry has two sets of chromosomes, as opposed to the cultivated strawberry, which has eight sets chromosomes and is among the most genetically complex plants. The UNH study relied on samples of this strawberry species collected on the Japanese Island of Hokkaido by an American-Japanese expedition in 2004 that included UNH plant geneticist Thomas Davis. UNH scientists, including Davis and experiment station researcher Lise Mahoney, constructed a linkage map of the seven chromosomes of the diploid Fragaria iinumae, which allows them to fill in a piece of the genetic puzzle about the eight sets of chromosomes of the cultivated strawberry. The cultivated strawberry is believed to trace its genetic ancestry to as many as four diploid ancestral strawberries, one of which is Fragaria iinumae.  Many people are trying to understand the ancestry of the cultivated strawberry so that they can better understand traits associated with specific genetic markers, such as fruit quality, flowering habits, and resistance to diseases,  Mahoney said.  Defining the genomes of the cultivated strawberry s wild ancestors will ultimately help guide the use of genetic information in breeding for a better cultivated strawberry.  The research on Fragaria iinumae is the second time experiment station researchers have mapped the genes of an ancestral diploid strawberry of the cultivated strawberry. In 2011, UNH researchers were part of a team that sequenced Fragaria vesca, another diploid ancestor of the cultivated strawberry. This reference sequence immediately became an indispensable resource in strawberry genetic research throughout the world.  This remarkable genetic map, which is the highest resolution linkage map for any ancestral diploid strawberry species, is a valuable research tool in and of itself. More importantly, it provides a necessary resource for assembly of a Fragaria iinumae reference genomic sequence as a much needed complement to the previously published reference genome for ancestral diploid F. vesca,  Mahoney said. To create the genetic map of Fragaria iinumae, experiment station researchers used the IStraw90  strawberry SNP array, an advanced genomics tool for marker-assisted mapping that the Davis lab helped develop as part of the International RosBREED Consortium. Prior to the advent of the marker-assisted mapping approach, breeders had to rely only on the evaluation of physiological traits such as fruit yield, disease resistance, and flavor for hundreds of plants to identify those with the desired traits, while having little or no knowledge of each plant s underlying genetic composition. The evaluation of traits in very large breeding populations is costly and time-consuming.  UNH is recognized as one of a very small handful of institutions worldwide working at the forefront of strawberry genomics and its application to strawberry breeding. We are leading a multi-institutional collaboration to assemble a new genomic resource, the F. iinumae reference genome. Of particular local interest, we are putting the genomic knowledge, resources, and technologies to work at UNH to develop new strawberry varieties that will be locally adapted and suitable for organic production, to the benefit of regional strawberry growers and consumers,  Mahoney said. The researchers present their findings in the journal The Plant Genome.","Published: August 26, 2016"

Simple to use and cheap to manufacture, the Lab-on-a-Stick is a  dip and read  method using a transparent microcapillary film suitable for naked eye detection or measurement with portable, inexpensive equipment such as a smartphone camera. The test, which is at least 12 times faster than current microbiological tests, is the result of research by Dr Nuno Reis, Lecturer in Chemical Engineering at Loughborough University, and Dr Al Edwards, Associate Professor in Biomedical Technology at the University of Reading. The full study has been published in the Lab on a Chip journal. The study showed that dipstick tests routinely used for testing in a variety of scenarios from soil pH strips for the garden to pregnancy tests, could be updated using the latest approach in miniaturised testing technology to help form the basis of a new generation of advanced, yet affordable, point-of-care tests for global diagnostics. As part of the study, different cellular tests were carried out to demonstrate the full potential of Lab-on-a-Stick devices for a range of clinical situations: Anti-microbial resistance   this was measured with E. coli samples typical of common urinary tract infection (UTIs). UTIs can be hard to treat with antibiotics because antibiotic resistance is so common and lab testing takes at least two days. The assay detects antibiotic resistance   in other words, can the cells grow in the presence of the antibiotic, and how much antibiotic is needed to stop cell growth? This demonstrated the advantage of using the microcapillary film which enables 10 different concentrations of antibiotic per sample to be tested with a single test strip. The research team are currently optimising this so that the test, which currently requires overnight incubation in a multi-well plate, could in the future be completed in less than two hours in a single test strip. Bacteria identification   classical analytical microbiology tests used for the identification of bacteria were miniaturised and performed in parallel microcapillaries, resulting in simple and rapid identification of bacteria. To identify bacteria, many different tests must be performed on every sample, illustrating again the benefits of microcapillary film which performs 10 tests per test strip. This study demonstrated a four-hour test to distinguish two very closely related bacteria   a harmless laboratory strain of E. coli from a type of Salmonella that causes food poisoning. ABO blood typing   a simple blood test that takes only two minutes was miniaturised and the results were recorded using an everyday digital camera. Dr Reis said:  This is a major step towards miniaturising complex, routine microbiological and clinical tests that cannot at the moment be performed outside of the laboratory setting.  Our secret is simplicity. We have shown how microengineered film material made from a very transparent plastic with special optical properties, makes it easy to perform laboratory tests without lab equipment. Previously, we showed how a portable Lab-in-a-briefcase made it possible to record blood test results with the assistance of a simple smartphone.  Dr Edwards, co-author of the study, said:  This is the latest demonstration of our exciting new technology called microcapillary film. Many researchers across the world have shown how miniaturising lab tests can speed them up using microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip devices. But these are too expensive to be useful outside the laboratory. What we have done is to develop a low cost way of making thousands of miniature test tubes, so that we can use them for many important applications. Lab-on-a-Stick shows yet again how versatile these microscopic test tubes are. ","Published: August 26, 2016"

The product is the most advanced Chikungunya vaccine candidate globally and is developed by the Austrian biotech company Themis Bioscience GmbH. It is based on the company's proprietary Themaxyn  platform, a standard measles vaccination vector developed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur, that offers an excellent immunogenicity and safety profile. The vaccine candidate already showed high seroconversion rates in the preceding Phase 1 clinical trial: Up to 100 percent of all vaccinated subjects produced neutralizing antibodies against the Chikungunya virus. In total 320 volunteers will be enrolled for this Phase 2 dose confirmation study that is carried out in centers in Germany and Austria. The biotech company Themis Bioscience GmbH (Vienna, Austria) has announced the vaccination of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of a prophylactic vaccine candidate against Chikungunya fever.

The ongoing Phase 2 trial will further confirm the immunogenicity of the vaccine and analyse indicators of efficacy such as functional antibodies and T-cell immune responses. Commenting on the trial, Dr. Erich Tauber, CEO and co-founder of Themis says: ""With outbreaks in many regions of the world, the Chikungunya virus remains a growing risk in endemic areas. A prophylactic vaccine against Chikungunya is highly desirable and we are happy to be able to offer this important vaccine candidate that is now undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial."" The trial will be carried out in centers in Berlin and Rostock (Germany) as well as in Vienna and Graz (Austria). 320 volunteers will receive either mid or high doses with study groups receiving a single injection and others two, spaced one month apart. Erich Tauber adds: ""This current study is aimed at the registration of our vaccine candidate on a world-wide basis. This study will be complimented by additional Phase 2 studies currently under preparation in the US and the Carribean."" The prophylactic Chikungunya vaccine under development at Themis is based on the company's proprietary Themaxyn  platform. It uses a standard measles virus vaccine as a vector that has been developed at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and constitutes the basis of the company's pipeline. Genes coding for selected antigens from the Chikungunya virus have been inserted into the genome of the well-established measles vaccine delivering those new antigens into the cells, thereby triggering a specific immune response against the Chikungunya virus. As measles vaccines have been successfully used in hundreds of millions of people globally, the Themaxyn  platform offers an excellent safety profile and clear advantages in terms of a validated, low-cost production process. Chikungunya fever is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes. It originates in Asia and parts of Africa but the increase in global traveling and rising temperatures cause it to spread into more temperate zones. Within the last three years well over 1.5 million cases have been reported in the Americas and the Caribbean alone, highlighting the urgent need for an affordable and effective prophylactic vaccine.","Published: August 26, 2016"

For the first time, a study in mice, to be published in the journal eLife, shows that five hours of sleep deprivation leads to a loss of connectivity between neurons in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with learning and memory. See Also: Weekend catch-up sleep can reduce diabetes risk associated with sleep loss""It's clear that sleep plays an important role in memory - we know that taking naps helps us retain important memories. But how sleep deprivation impairs hippocampal function and memory is less obvious,"" says first author Robbert Havekes, PhD, Assistant Professor at the Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences. It has been proposed that changes in the connectivity between synapses - structures that allow neurons to pass signals to each other - can affect memory. To study this further, the researchers examined the impact of brief periods of sleep loss on the structure of dendrites, the branching extensions of nerve cells along which impulses are received from other synaptic cells, in the mouse brain. They first used the Golgi silver-staining method to visualize the length of dendrites and number of dendritic spines in the mouse hippocampus following five hours of sleep deprivation, a period of sleep loss that is known to impair memory consolidation. Their analyses indicated that sleep deprivation significantly reduces the length and spine density of the dendrites belonging to the neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. They repeated the sleep-loss experiment, but left the mice to sleep undisturbed for three hours afterwards. This period was chosen based on the scientists' previous work showing that three hours is sufficient to restore deficits caused by lack of sleep. The effects of the five-hour sleep deprivation in the mice were reversed so that their dendritic structures were similar to those observed in the mice that had slept. The researchers then investigated what was happening during sleep deprivation at the molecular level. ""We were curious about whether the structural changes in the hippocampus might be related to increased activity of the protein cofilin, since this can cause shrinkage and loss of dendritic spines,"" Havekes says. ""Our further studies revealed that the molecular mechanisms underlying the negative effects of sleep loss do in fact target cofilin. Blocking this protein in hippocampal neurons of sleep-deprived mice not only prevented the loss of neuronal connectivity, but also made the memory processes resilient to sleep loss. The sleep-deprived mice learned as well as non-sleep deprived subjects."" Read Next: Brain damage caused by severe sleep apnea is reversible Ted Abel, PhD, Brush Family Professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania and senior author of the study, explains: ""Lack of sleep is a common problem in our 24/7 modern society and it has severe consequences for health, overall wellbeing, and brain function. ""Despite decades of research, the reasons why sleep loss negatively impacts brain function have remained unknown. Our novel description of a pathway through which sleep deprivation impacts memory consolidation highlights the importance of the neuronal cell network's ability to adapt to sleep loss. What is perhaps most striking is that these neuronal connections are restored with several hours of recovery sleep. Thus, when subjects have a chance to catch up on much-needed sleep, they are rapidly remodeling their brain."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

While several previously published studies have suggested a protective effect for cognitive activities such as reading, playing games or attending cultural events, questions have been raised about whether these studies reveal a real cause-and-effect relationship or if the associations could result from unmeasured factors. To address this question, a Boston-based research team conducted a formal bias analysis and concluded that, while potentially confounding factors might have affected previous studies' results, it is doubtful that such factors totally account for observed associations between cognitive activities and a reduced risk of dementia. See Also: Being underweight in middle age associated with increased dementia risk ""Our paper lends support to a potential role for late-in-life cognitive activity in prevention of Alzheimer's disease,"" says Deborah Blacker MD, ScD, director of the Gerontology Research Unit in the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry and senior author of the report in the September issue of the journal Epidemiology. ""While it is possible that socioeconomic factors such as educational level might contribute to the association between cognitive activity and reduced risk, any bias introduced by such factors is probably not strong enough to fully account for the observed association."" Blacker and her colleagues from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health maintain a database on the Alzheimer's Research Forum website cataloging evidence from observational studies and some clinical trials about known and proposed risk and protective factors for the devastating neurologic disorder. The current paper was developed from the database's systematic review of studies examining the impact of cognitive activity, conducted by lead author Guatam Sajeev, ScD, as part of his Harvard Chan school dissertation. The research team analyzed 12 peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies that examined the relationship between late-in-life cognitive activities and the incidence of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. The studies were selected on the basis of prespecified criteria for the AlzRisk database, included almost 14,000 individual participants and consistently showed a benefit, sometimes substantial, for cognitive activity. Since any observational studies are likely to be confounded by unmeasured factors - such as participants' socioeconomic level or the presence of conditions like depression - the researchers also conducted a bias analysis designed to evaluate how much such factors might influence reported associations between the amount of cognitive activity and dementia risk. This analysis indicated that bias due to unmeasured factors was unlikely to account for all of the association because the impact of such factors is likely to be considerably smaller than the observed effect. The group also investigated the possible role of reverse causation - whether a reduction in cognitive activity among those already in the long phase of cognitive decline that precedes Alzheimer's dementia might have led to an apparent rather than a real causal relationship. The findings of that analysis could not rule out the possibility that reverse causation contributed substantially to the observed associations, but analyses restricted to studies with longer term follow-up might be better able to address this question, the authors note. Learn More: Altered brain communication could be predictive marker of dementia in Parkinson's disease ""Ultimately, clinical trials with long-term follow-up are the surest way to definitively address reverse causation,"" says co-author and AlzRisk co-director Jennifer Weuve, MPH, ScD, of Boston University School of Public Health. ""Trials could also confront the vexing question of whether training to improve specific cognitive skills has benefits that extend into everyday functions. But not every question about cognitive activity is well-suited for a trial. To fill those gaps, innovations in epidemiology, such as the analytic techniques used in this study, should help us get even greater insights from available observational data."" Blacker adds, ""Cognitive activity looks like it may offer some modest protection, and based on our bias analysis, I am somewhat less skeptical than I was previously. But remember that any impact will be relative, not absolute. I typically advise people to engage in cognitive activities that they find interesting and enjoyable for their own sake. There is no evidence that one kind of activity is better than another, so I would advise against spending money on programs claiming to protect against dementia.""

Researchers say the findings of their study, published in the journal Science, may lead to new therapies to halt the progression of the uniformly fatal disease that affects more than 30,000 Americans. One such treatment is already under development for testing in humans after the current study showed it stopped nerve cell damage in mice with ALS. See Also: ALS: Renewing brain's aging support cells may help neurons survive The onset of ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is marked by the gradual degradation and eventual death of neuronal axons, the slender projections on nerve cells that transmit signals from one cell to the next. The HMS study reveals that the aberrant behavior of an enzyme called RIPK1 damages neuronal axons by disrupting the production of myelin, the soft gel-like substance enveloping axons to insulate them from injury. ""Our study not only elucidates the mechanism of axonal injury and death but also identifies a possible protective strategy to counter it by inhibiting the activity of RIPK1,"" said the study's senior investigator Junying Yuan, the Elizabeth D. Hay Professor of Cell Biology at HMS. The new findings come on the heels of a series of pivotal discoveries made by Yuan and colleagues over the last decade revealing RIPK1 as a key regulator of inflammation and cell death. But up until now, scientists were unaware of its role in axonal demise and ALS. Experiments conducted in mice and in human ALS cells reveal that when RIPK1 is out of control, it can spark axonal damage by setting off a chemical chain reaction that culminates in stripping the protective myelin off of axons and triggering axonal degeneration--the hallmark of ALS. Read Next: Study shows more patients with ALS have genetic origin than previously thought RIPK1, the researchers found, inflicts damage by directly attacking the body's myelin production plants--nerve cells known as oligodendrocytes, which secrete the soft substance, rich in fat and protein that wraps around axons to support their function and shield them from damage. Building on previous work from Yuan's lab showing that the activity of RIPK1 could be blocked by a chemical called necrostatin-1, the research team tested how ALS cells in lab dishes would respond to the same treatment. Indeed, necrostatin-1 tamed the activity of RIPK1 in cells of mice genetically altered to develop ALS. In a final set of experiments, the researchers used necrostatin-1 to treat mice with axonal damage and hind leg weakness, a telltale sign of axonal demise similar to the muscle weakness that occurs in the early stages of ALS in humans. Necrostatin-1 not only restored the myelin sheath and stopped axonal damage but also prevented limb weakness in animals treated with it. At the outset of their experiments, investigators homed in on a gene called optineurin (OPTN). Past research had revealed the presence of OPTN defects in people with both inherited and sporadic forms of ALS, but scientists were not sure whether and how OPTN was involved in the development of the disease. To find out, researchers created mice genetically altered to lack OPTN. Examining spinal cord cells under a microscope, the scientists noticed that the axons of mice missing the OPTN gene were swollen, inflamed and far fewer in number, compared with spinal cord cells obtained from mice with the OPTN gene. These axons also bore signs of myelin degradation. Strikingly, the researchers noticed the same signs of axonal demise in spinal cord cells obtained from human patients with ALS. Mice with OPTN deficiency also exhibited loss of strength in their hind legs. Further experiments revealed that lack of OPTN was particularly harmful to myelin-secreting cells. Thus, the researchers concluded, OPTN deficiency was directly incapacitating the nervous system's myelin factories. But one question remained: How did the absence of OPTN damage these cells? Looking for the presence of chemicals commonly seen during inflammation and cell death, the researchers noticed abnormally high levels of RIPK1--a known promoter of cell death--in spinal cord cells from mice lacking OPTN. Moreover, the scientists observed traces of other damaging chemicals often recruited by RIPK1 to kill cells. ""It was as if we saw the chemical footprints of cell death left behind by RIPK1 and its recruits,"" Yuan said. That observation, Yuan added, was the smoking gun linking RIPK1's misbehavior to OPTN deficiency. In other words, researchers said, when functioning properly, the OPTN gene appears to regulate the behavior of RIPK1 by ensuring its levels are kept in check, that it is broken down fast and that it is cleared out of cells in a timely fashion. In the absence of such oversight, however, RIPK1 appears to get out of control and cause mischief. Learn More: Researchers develop unique model for studying ALSIn a closing set of experiments, the researchers examined neurons obtained from mice with the most common inherited form of ALS, one caused by mutations in a gene called SOD1. Indeed, RIPK1 levels were elevated in those cells too. Thus, the investigators said, OPTN may not be the sole gene regulating RIPK1's behavior. Instead, RIPK1 appears to fuel axonal damage across various forms of inherited and acquired forms of ALS. The findings suggest that RIPK1 may be involved in a range of other neurodegenerative diseases marked by axonal damage, including multiple sclerosis, certain forms of spinal muscular atrophy and even Alzheimer's disease.

In May, the collaboration between Aldevron and the Center for Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM) was awarded the top prize in the 2016 Applied Research Challenge for the development of methods to make faster, better decisions in biomanufacturing. The award was made by the Production and Operations Management Society. From the microorganisms it grows, Aldevron extracts a wide variety of biological substances, including DNA, enzymes, antibodies and other proteins   all made to order. The company employs 18 in Madison, and is headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota. Aldevron s market includes pharmaceutical and biotech firms involved in drug discovery and other aspects of personalized medicine.  Our clients need a variety of biological products made to their specifications,  says Tom Foti, vice president and general manager of Aldevron s Madison lab.  We have finished more than 700 projects and made thousands of proteins.  The world of drug discovery is being fueled by drugs called monoclonal antibodies   large, complicated molecules made by bioengineered cells, Foti says. For example, Humira, used to treat inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, had sales of $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Speed matters in drug development, since it can lead to valuable patents that protect inventors  rights to their inventions. But producing inside cells can be tricky, Foti says.  You have inherent variability, and you have to manage variables that are absent in most other industries: How fast do the cells grow? When is the optimal time to harvest the cells? Different cells or strains may process DNA, RNA or proteins differently, depending on growth conditions such as temperature, cell density, oxygen level and pH.  Typically, Aldevron makes products in three steps: 1. A scouting run explores the variables, checks behavior of the product, and settles on the best method. 2. A verification run tests that the chosen method is optimal for quality and productivity. 3. A production run yields the quantity required by the customer. In 2013, Aldevron sought to increase its competitive advantages by working with the QRM center on campus. Director Ananth Krishnamurthy explains that QRM is a set of manufacturing principles focused on exploiting  the power of time  by examining organization structure, system dynamics and application throughout an enterprise.  Reducing lead time through QRM allows a manufacturer to gain a quantum improvement in competiveness and quality, with reduced cost and improved efficiency,  says Krishnamurthy.  QRM helped us think about how we can eliminate or mitigate the variability and risks associated with producing products inside of living cells,  says Foti. Foti will chair a keynote panel and discuss the QRM project at the BioForward Health Summit at the Overture Center in Madison on Sept 27. Since its establishment in 1993, the QRM center has more typically focused on traditional manufacturing, yet biological production is a natural fit, says Krishnamurthy.  We needed a good understanding of what they do so we could develop methods and tools that allow them to reduce lead time.  At Aldevron, even before production starts, QRM s statistical methods can squelch over-promising and under-delivering, Krishnamurthy says.  If you can t do something, given the timeline, required quality and cost, you would rather know sooner than later. Our math can support decision-making to determine the best case scenario, and if that is not good enough, you can cut your losses while maintaining a good relationship with the client.  The same tools help further on, Krishnamurthy says.  Failure in the production run is very expensive. It s less expensive to fail in the scouting run.  Data from the scouting run may also obviate the need for the mid-scale qualification step. The application of QRM to biology represents the wave of the future, Krishnamurthy says.  Reducing the lead time for a high mix, custom-engineered environment is not just relevant to biologicals. That s the way manufacturing in general is headed. ","Published: August 25, 2016"

According to the research, children born after being exposed to the highest levels of certain compounds of the chemicals, called organochlorine chemicals, during their mother s pregnancy were roughly 80 percent more likely to be diagnosed with autism when compared to individuals with the very lowest levels of these chemicals. That also includes those who were completely unexposed. Although production of organochlorine chemicals was banned in the United States in 1977, these compounds can remain in the environment and become absorbed in the fat of animals that humans eat, leading to exposure. With that in mind, Kristen Lyall, ScD, assistant professor in Drexel University s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute, and her collaborators, decided to look at organochlorine chemicals during pregnancy since they can cross through the placenta and affect the fetus  neurodevelopment.  There s a fair amount of research examining exposure to these chemicals during pregnancy in association with other outcomes, like birth weight   but little research on autism, specifically,  Lyall said.  To examine the role of environmental exposures in risk of autism, it is important that samples are collected during time frames with evidence for susceptibility for autism   termed  critical windows  in neurodevelopment. Fetal development is one of those critical windows.  Their paper describing this study was published in Environmental Health Perspectives. Now a researcher in the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute s Modifiable Risk Factors Program, Lyall was with the California Department of Public Health when she began the work. She teamed with researchers from the department, including Gayle Windham, PhD, and Martin Kharrazi, PhD, members of the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research (which includes the study s principal investigator, Lisa Croen, PhD), as well as an expert on measuring organochlorine chemicals, Andreas Sjodin, PhD, of the Division of Laboratory Sciences of the National Center for Environmental Health. The team looked at a population sample of 1,144 children born in Southern California between 2000 and 2003. Data was accrued from mothers who had enrolled in California s Expanded Alphafetoprotein Prenatal Screening Program, which is dedicated to detecting birth defects during pregnancy.  Participants  children were separated into three groups: 545 who were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, 181 with intellectual disabilities but no autism diagnosis, and 418 with a diagnosis of neither. Blood tests taken from the second trimester of the children s mothers were used to determine the level of exposure to two different classes of organochlorine chemicals: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, which were used as lubricants, coolants and insulators in consumer and electrical products) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs, which include chemicals like DDT).   Exposure to PCBs and OCPs is ubiquitous,  Lyall said.  Work from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which includes pregnant women, shows that people in the U.S. generally still have measurable levels of these chemicals in their bodies.  However, Lyall emphasized that exposure levels were key in determining risk.  Adverse effects are related to levels of exposure, not just presence or absence of detectable levels,  she said.  In our Southern California study population, we found evidence for modestly increased risk for individuals in the highest 25th percentile of exposure to some of these chemicals.  It was determined that two compounds in particular   PCB 138/158 and PCB 153   stood out as being significantly linked with autism risk. Children with the highest in utero levels (exposure during their mother s pregnancy) of these two forms of PCBs were between 79 and 82 percent more likely to have an autism diagnosis than those found to be exposed to the lowest levels. High levels of two other compounds, PCB 170 and PCB 180, were also associated with children being approximately 50 percent more likely to be diagnosed   again, this is relative to children with the lowest prenatal exposure to these PCBs. None of the OCPs appeared to show an association with higher autism diagnosis risk. In children with intellectual disabilities but not autism, the highest exposure to PCBs appeared to double the risk of a diagnosis when compared to those with the lowest exposure. Mid-range (rather than high) OCP exposure was also associated with an increased level of intellectual disability diagnosis when measured against children with the lowest exposure levels.  The results suggest that prenatal exposure to these chemicals above a certain level may influence neurodevelopment in adverse ways,  Lyall said. These results are a first step to suggest these compounds may increase risk of development of autism, and Lyall and her colleagues are eyeing up more work in the field.  We are definitely doing more research to build on this   including work examining genetics, as well as mixtures of chemicals,  Lyall said.  This investigation draws from a rich dataset and we need more studies like this in autism research. ","Published: August 25, 2016"

The goal of this new academic research facility is to explore efforts to more accurately classify diseases and guide treatment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The Center for Computational and Systems Pathology will be a hub for the development of new diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic tests and will partner with Mount Sinai-based  Precise Medical Diagnostics  (Precise MD), which has been under development for more than three years by a team of physicians, scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and programmers. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, MD, PhD, will oversee the new center, located at Mount Sinai St. Luke s, and will continue his role as Chair of the Department of Pathology at the Mount Sinai Health System and Professor of Pathology, Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and Oncological Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine.  Gerardo Fernandez, MD, Associate Professor of Pathology, and Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, will be the Center s Medical Director.  He will work closely with Michael Donovan, MD, PhD, Research Professor of Pathology at the Icahn School of Medicine, and Jack Zeineh, MD, Director of Technology for Precise MD.  Our goal is to provide a precise mathematical approach to classifying and treating disease, which will assist our clinicians with information for effective patient care and health management,  says Dr. Cordon-Cardo.  By refining diagnoses, we can save patients from unnecessary treatments.  Mount Sinai s Department of Pathology processes more than 80 million tests a year, making it the largest department of its kind in the country. Precise MD is developing new approaches to characterizing an individual s cancer by combining multiple data sources and analyzing them with mathematical algorithms, offering a more sophisticated alternative to standard approaches.  One such example is Precise MD s approach to improve upon the Gleason score, a grading system that has been used since the 1960s to establish the prognosis for a prostate cancer and guide the patient s treatment options.  We re characterizing tumors based on the combination of their architectural patterns and biomarkers,  says Dr. Fernandez.  Computer vision analysis, leveraging multispectral fluorescence microscopic imaging, enables us to see what the human eye cannot.  In its initial phase this summer, Precise MD will complete a test used for patients who have had prostatectomies at Mount Sinai Health System, to help determine which of them are more likely to have a recurrence of cancer and may need additional therapy such as chemotherapy.    Precise MD s approach gives us an in-depth knowledge about biological behavior of prostate cancer and allows us to choose appropriate patients for active surveillance,  says Ash Tewari, MD, Chair of the Department of Urology at the Mount Sinai Health System and the Kyung Hyun Kim, MD Professor of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine.  Due to their support, we have a large pool of patients who are with active surveillance.  A second, higher-impact test will follow in 2017, which will be used to characterize prostate cancer in newly diagnosed patients. At that time, Dr. Cordon-Cardo says all prostate cancer patients at Mount Sinai will have the option to receive this test.     It is anticipated that in 2017 other current efforts will yield additional novel computer vision and machine learning tools to better characterize breast cancer.

(SAB) announced that it has been awarded a contract for up to $5.3 million by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The funding will be used for advanced clinical manufacturing and testing for SAB s novel antibody therapeutic (SAB-301) to treat MERS-CoV.  SAB has developed a unique production platform to rapidly respond to emerging infectious disease threats,  said SAB president and CEO Dr. Eddie Sullivan.  This partnership with BARDA is instrumental in advancing the MERS treatment, while creating a clinical development pathway for other therapeutics produced from our novel rapid response platform.  SAB-301 was produced utilizing the DiversitAb  platform, which leverages transchromosomic cattle (Tc Bovine ). These cattle have been genetically designed to produce large amounts of human polyclonal antibodies (immunoglobulin G) in response to an antigen such as MERS in a brief period of time.  Currently, there are no approved vaccines or specific treatments for MERS, a severe respiratory disease akin to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) with a high fatality rate. Since it was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS has infected more than 1,700 people and killed nearly 40% of those infected. According to the World Health Organization, cases have now been confirmed in 27 countries in the Middle East, Europe, Asia and the United States. A 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea is the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East. BARDA, which manages the procurement and advanced development of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases, will provide an initial $2.4M for clinical grade product for human trials, with an option for an additional $2.9M to produce more doses if needed. Phase I Clinical Trials are currently underway for SAB-301 with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) evaluating dosage and safety with a final report expected in the first quarter of 2017. Once these trials in healthy candidates have been completed with no significant safety concerns, the potency and dosing of the treatment can be evaluated in Phase 2 trials in patients with MERS in endemic countries utilizing the product specified in the BARDA contract also conducted by the NIH.  We are also advancing treatments for Ebola, Influenza and Zika with the goal of leveraging our platform as a countermeasure against emerging infectious diseases,  added Sullivan.  SAB is dedicated to partnering with government and other organizations to address this current and future threats [sic] to human health. ","Published: August 25, 2016"

These data were presented at the 2016 meeting on Genome Engineering: The CRISPR/Cas Revolution, in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. In several in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, the data demonstrated:   Editing efficiency in mouse liver of up to approximately 60 percent at the transthyretin (TTR) target site after a single intravenous administration, consistently across different lobes. This resulted in an associated decrease in serum TTR protein levels of up to approximately 80 percent;   Dose-dependent editing by LNP delivery;   Undetectable Cas9 mRNA and guide RNA (gRNA) in the liver at 72 hours post administration;   Repair patterns in mouse liver cells in vivo being best predicted by primary mouse liver cells in vitro.  Intellia has shown robust data that demonstrates the clinical potential of the LNP delivery of CRISPR components. With a single administration, we show significant editing at the target gene and a related decrease in target protein in serum,  said David Morrissey, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer, Intellia Therapeutics.  These early data also show that LNP delivery can lead to rapid clearance of the Cas9 and guide components from the liver, an important consideration for future clinical studies. Intellia continues to make further advances, and we would expect greater editing efficiency with continued optimization.  Study Background The preclinical editing studies were designed to explore the use of lipid nanoparticles for delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components to the liver in mice and to mediate editing of target DNA within hepatocytes. In general, for the LNPs in the studies, Cas9 mRNA was co-formulated with chemically synthesized gRNAs targeting the mouse TTR gene, and administered via one or two intravenous tail vein injections. Additional studies were performed to evaluate the impact on editing of variables including guide format, dosing regimen and dose escalation.","Published: August 25, 2016"

The ability to control DNA repair outcomes has significant implications for the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in product development. The study is published in the current edition of Molecular Cell and entitled DNA Repair Profiling Reveals Non-random Outcomes at Cas9-Mediated Breaks. As discussed therein, Caribou researchers cut 223 sites in the human genome with Cas9 and analyzed the DNA repair profiles at each site. They discovered that the DNA repair outcomes, namely the collection of insertions and deletions that are produced by the cellular repair machinery following DNA cutting, generate reproducible patterns at each target site. The research also demonstrated how these non-random outcomes can be harnessed to produce a desired effect, such as a gene knockout or the reading frame restoration of a disease-causing allele.  This discovery represents a fundamental advance in the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Through careful measurement of the outcomes of the DNA repair machinery, we can understand the specific patterns of editing that occur within a cell population with a high degree of certainty,  said Andrew May, D.Phil., Chief Scientific Officer of Caribou.  Caribou is at the forefront of cutting-edge research in genome engineering, and I am delighted that our world class scientific team continues to make significant contributions to develop the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.  The findings of this study have potential applications across a range of industries. For example, these findings can accelerate the progress of gene-editing research because DNA repair profiling in one cell type may accurately predict repair outcomes in other cell types, including human primary cells. This can allow scientists to conduct research in standard, easy-to-use cell lines that can then be applied to more challenging cell types. Future studies are expected to explore these patterns of predictability outside of human cells and with a range of enzymes, with potential relevance to fields such as agriculture, industrial biotechnology and beyond.","Published: August 25, 2016"

Using genome-editing tools, Harvard scientists are getting closer to finding answers. A recent study authored by Alexander Schier, chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Leo Erikson Life Sciences Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, James Gagnon, a postdoctoral fellow in Schier s lab, and Aaron McKenna and Greg Findlay, Ph.D. students in the lab of Jay Shendure at the University of Washington, developed a system that uses the CRISPR genome-editing tool to mark zebrafish cells with a genetic barcode that can later be used to reconstruct their lineage. The study was published earlier this year in Science.  We would like to understand how cells go down different avenues during development and end up as specific cell types,  Schier said.  With this new tool, we can take adult brain cells and   see how those cells are related to each other all the way back to the embryo.  In this system CRISPR targets 10 short sequences and randomly cuts them, inducing either deletions or insertions as the cell repairs the cuts,  he explained.  We can then sequence those areas, and understand how the cells relate to each other.  For example, Schier said, a single cell may have one sequence cut in a certain location, but as it divides, its daughter and granddaughter cells may be cut at additional locations. By tracing how those changes accumulate, researchers eventually can identify how cells relate to each other. The more closely related cells are, the more similar their mutated barcodes. Though the idea of marking cells to track their development isn t new, the new technique offers far more versatility and specificity.  One major way this has been done is by labeling cells with fluorescent proteins and then following the inheritance of the color,  Schier said.  For example, one could deduce that cells that are purple might have come from a common progenitor that was purple.  The problem, Schier said, was that even the most advanced systems were limited to only about 100 distinct colors.  The power of this method is that you can, essentially, get thousands of colors,  Schier said.  In this paper, we demonstrated that we could produce 4,000 unique barcodes which we could trace to see how cells are related to one another.  Already, Schier said, the technique is providing new insights for researchers to investigate.  There are some tantalizing hints we found,  he said.  For example, we found that more than 98 percent of the blood in one fish came from just five progenitor cells, and in another fish it came from just two. This raises interesting questions of tissue dynamics that we would really like to understand   how relatively few progenitor cells give rise to a large number of blood cells or brain cells.  Schier s lab isn t alone in exploring the possibilities of using CRISPR to understand how cells develop. Researchers working in the lab of George Church, the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School (HMS), developed a similar system in which the guide RNA sequence that instructs CRISPR where to cut was also the target. The end result is a system that targets a specific genetic sequence and cuts it, but as that cut is repaired it creates a new guide RNA, telling the system where to cut next, and generating enough diversity to allow researchers to trace a cell s lineage. This study has been posted on the preprint server BioRxiv. The next step, Church said, will be learning not only how cells develop into adulthood, but how and when cells change their identity during development.  We want to know who begat whom,  he said, but also  what the cells are thinking and what they re doing. We can stop the merry-go-round at any point in development and take a snapshot of their lineage and what the cells are doing. ","Published: August 25, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/an-emerging-model-of-cancer-186520,An Emerging Model of Cancer Cancer acts cooperatively  making individual decisions but acting in unison  this insight is being used to create a computer model of cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cancer cells can be as cooperative as a flock of birds, making individual decisions yet somehow acting in unison. A Stanford researcher is using this insight to make a computer model of cancer. Such group behavior, whether in birds, fish or cells, arises from simple rules governing the behavior of each individual. In a flock of birds, the rules might include how each bird always flies in the same direction as nearby birds and always stays close, though not too close, to them. But the coordinated, dancelike behavior of flocks can t be predicted by studying one bird at a time. Complex behaviors that only emerge in groups are called  emergent properties.  For example, no single molecule has a temperature, but groups of them do. What triggers metastasis? At the Canary Center, Mallick and other researchers are building on such insights to develop a computer model of cancer. Working with a team that includes the center s director, Sam Gambhir, MD, PhD, professor of radiology; computer scientist Christopher R , PhD; and interns from local high schools, Mallick is looking at how cancer cells behave in order to discover what triggers their sudden transformations, or state changes, from quiet and comparatively harmless tumor cells into peripatetic, metastatic cells that migrate all over the body, invading and altering other tissues. Just as hundreds of birds can suddenly take flight together and head off in one direction, swooping and turning in unison, tumor cells can perform similar feats. When cancer cells transition to metastatic behavior, it can happen quite suddenly, said Mallick. Non-metastatic tumor cells might sit quietly inside a tumor with a clear boundary. But when metastasis starts, the same cells become lethal; they aggressively break through the wall of the tumor and launch themselves out into the rest of the body.  Cancer cells will spontaneously start to move in one direction,  he said. But what makes cancer cells suddenly get the travel itch? And more generally, added Mallick,  What are the origins of such state changes? How do you describe them? How do we model them? What s governing their behavior?  Of course, the behavior of cancer cells, like that of healthy cells, is hugely complex. For example, cells might behave in a cancerous way for reasons that are deep in their genes, or the change could be driven by signals from the environment. And metastatic cells might circulate in the blood for long periods before beginning to colonize other parts of the body. Yet we do know that no single governor gives a top-down order to all the cells; instead, just like a flock of birds taking wing, the cells all begin moving at once, responding to one another. Building a model In an attempt to detect, predict and prevent such transitions, Mallick and his colleagues are building a massive computer model of cancer that includes every level of organization, starting from molecular processes and the behavior of individual cells to the growth of whole tumors and their metastasis, as well as immune responses throughout the body.  We re working on coalescing all of that information into what, in our mind, is the first-ever truly multiscale data set,  he said. Mallick s forte is finding ways to connect all these different levels of organization. One connection is the sudden transition from the independent behavior of cancer cells to group behavior. Another might be a nutrient gradient across a tumor that connects the effects of nutrients on individual cells with those on the whole tumor.  If you are modeling water,  he said,  there s a particular sort of math that you use to describe the behavior of single atoms, and a very different sort of math for describing the flow of rivers.  For a multiscale model of water, you would need a way for those two models to connect. Putting the pieces together means accepting that the very theory of how cancer works is evolving. An evolving theory of cancer Decades of work had researchers convinced that cancer resulted from genetic mutations in individual cells. The theory was that a carcinogen, such as asbestos or cigarette smoke, induced mutations in a cell s DNA that eventually caused it to become cancerous. That bad cell multiplied and spread. But it has turned out that most of the things that cause cancer, including tobacco smoke and asbestos, don t cause mutations. Rather than modifying the genes themselves, smoke and asbestos alter the activity of genes through a collection of processes called epigenetics. Epigenetics consists of tiny modifications   either to the DNA itself or to proteins called histones that wrap around the DNA and change the activity of the genes. For example, if you spend every weekend gardening, changes in the activity of genes in the skin cells of your hands will produce callouses. Our callouses might seem very ordinary to us; they come and go depending on what we ve been up to recently. But what if the genes whose activity changes to produce them could mutate so that our callouses became permanent? What if some babies were born with calloused hands? Amazingly, modern evolutionary biologists are moving to the view that that s exactly how wild plants and animals often evolve. It all starts with the phenotype, which is every single trait of an organism or cell other than the genome itself. The phenotype includes the actual enzymes encoded by genes, myriad metabolic pathways, the shape of a nose or the hands, a vast repertoire of behavior and even memories of an equation or a loved one. We already know that the same genes can produce alternate phenotypes, depending on just how the genes are expressed. That phenotypic plasticity delivers different castes of ants, all from the same genotype; hands that look different from our feet, even though they have the same genotype; and identical twins of different heights and personalities. All these changes arise from the way the immediate environments of cells, or of organs, or of whole individuals interact with genes. The differences in gene activity are mediated by an array of hormones, transcription factors and other mechanisms.  Genes are followers, not leaders  Evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard, PhD, one of the leaders of the movement to reframe evolution, has laid out the experimental evidence showing that the plasticity of an organism s characteristics, or phenotype, foreshadows its evolution. In essence, you can start with an epigenetic variant   think calloused hands   and later that particular trait can become permanently fixed in the genes. Famously, West-Eberhard said,  Genes are followers, not leaders, in evolution.  Now that same idea is invading the theory of cancer. It seems that cancer cells, too, can first begin to change through temporary epigenetic changes, instead of by means of mutations in the DNA. In cancer biology, the role of epigenetics is gaining acceptance, but it s still meeting resistance from researchers who may have spent a lifetime with the idea that cancer cells are primarily the result of individual mutations, said Alexander Anderson, PhD, chair of integrated mathematical oncology at the Moffitt Cancer Center, in Tampa, Florida.  There s still definitely an old-school crowd who think if we just sequence deep enough, we ll solve all the problems.  A recent article in The New Yorker about epigenetics by Siddhartha Mukherjee, MD, DPhil, triggered a storm of complaints from molecular biologists who felt that standard genetics had been ignored. But while it s possible to quibble about whether Mukherjee, an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, should have put his discussion of epigenetics in context, there s no question that epigenetics is deeply altering our understanding of both evolution and cancer.  There s a feeling in the field that we have to start thinking more holistically,  said Anderson. And the key to that, he said, is math. A systems approach Mallick, said Anderson, is one of a few researchers with a strong understanding of both cancer biology and the mathematics needed to build a model of cancer based on a systems approach. Said Mallick,  We just had a paper accepted where we found that when you treated cells with a chemotherapeutic drug over long periods of time, you could make cells that were 40 times more drug-resistant. Yet the cells had no genetic alterations.  Instead, all the changes were epigenetic.  If you treated the cells with the drug, they were like,  Oh, OK, let me change my histones,  he said.  It s a crazy thought.  While the mechanisms for changes may be modifications to the histone proteins or the DNA, the driver of change is the environment. It is now well-established that epigenetic changes play a role in both cancer initiation and progression. The same processes may also determine if cells are cancerous or healthy, metastatic or not. Cancer, explained renowned developmental biologist Scott Gilbert, PhD, of Swarthmore College, can result not only from bad cells but from a bad cellular environment. For cancer cells, said Mallick, that means where the cells live in a tumor, how close they are to nutrient-rich blood vessels, the behavior of nearby cells and where the cells are in the body. Each of these situations can induce a range of epigenetic reactions that can impact, for example, how resistant or sensitive the cells are to chemotherapy drugs or how likely the cells are to begin to metastasize. A tumor comprises an array of ecological niches, each of which can induce a different kind of behavior or phenotype in the cancer cells that live there, said Anderson. But just as a tropical rainforest functions similarly whether it s on one continent or another, different kinds of tumors share common rules that govern their overall behavior and the phenotypes of individual cells in different parts of the tumor. Animals and other organisms can pass epigenetically mediated traits to multiple generations without any change in the genes themselves. And at least some of these phenotypic traits can become permanently fixed in the genome, as demonstrated in lab studies. It makes sense then that cancer cells could do the same. Mallick said the epigenetic changes that incite tumor cells to resist deadly drugs are passed on to daughter cells. Although no one has witnessed it happen, it s pretty clear that the right mutation could turn the trait for drug resistance from plastic to permanent, making the trait part of the cancer cells  permanent genetic repertoire. As Gilbert said,  You start off with an epigenetically induced phenotype. And then if any mutations occur that allow this to be fixed into the genome, it goes for it.  Markerville This new way of understanding evolution is the theoretical engine that drives Mallick s research. Viewing cancer as a dynamically evolving adaptive system, his team s big focus is the giant model of cancer behavior that integrates all the different levels.  Our entire purpose in life is to build a virtual model of cancer,  said Mallick. The ultimate goal of the model is to explain cancer, but the model also has immediate medical uses. For instance, Mallick is using the model as a tool to help identify markers of important transitions in the life of populations of cells   to cancer, to drug resistance or to metastasis. Such markers are essential to developing tests for diagnosing cancer and for investigating how patients respond to treatment over the course of their disease. Mallick and his colleagues are on the verge of launching a publicly accessible, interactive database and model of cancer called Markerville.  It includes both a model of cancer and a collection of data we ve pulled from the literature about each protein,  he said. Markerville will tell users everything known about a particular protein and also how it might be expected to serve as a marker in a given cancer.  Our goal is to build a computer program that you could come to with any protein and say,  OK, I m interested in this protein and I m looking at this cancer. Do you think it has potential to be a good biomarker?  Our understanding of cancer biology has taken off in recent years, but it s not yet clear where it s leading researchers. Just as it s difficult to see which way the individual birds in a flock will turn from moment to moment, it s difficult to predict which discoveries will transform our understanding of cancer. But changes in the understanding of both basic evolutionary biology and systems biology are helping researchers see things in new ways.","Published: August 25, 2016"

The study, published in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, makes rats less willing to try a cognitively demanding task. See Also: Starting age of marijuana use may have long-term effects on brain development""Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that when we gave THC to these rats, they basically became cognitively lazy,"" said Mason Silveira, the study's lead author and a PhD candidate in UBC's department of psychology. ""What's interesting, however, is that their ability to do the difficult challenge was unaffected by THC. The rats could still do the task they just didn't want to."" For the study, researchers looked at the effects of both THC and cannabidiol (CBD) on rats' willingness to exert cognitive effort. They trained 29 rats to perform a behavioural experiment in which the animals had to choose whether they wanted an easy or difficult challenge to earn sugary treats. Under normal circumstances, most rats preferred the harder challenge to earn a bigger reward. But when the rats were given THC, the animals switched to the easier option, despite earning a smaller reward. Read next: Mulling the marijuana munchies: How the brain flips the hunger switch When they looked at the effect of CBD, an ingredient in marijuana that does not result in a high, researchers found the chemical did not have any effect on rats' decision-making or attention. CBD, which is believed to be beneficial in treating pain, epilepsy and even cancer, also didn't block the negative effects of THC. ""This was surprising, as it had been suggested that high concentrations of CBD could modulate or reduce the negative effects of THC,"" said Catharine Winstanley, senior author of the study and an associate professor in UBC's department of psychology. ""Unfortunately, that did not appear to be the case."" Given how essential willingness to exert cognitive effort is for people to achieve success, Winstanley said the findings underscore the importance of realizing the possible effect of cannabis use on impairing willingness to engage in harder tasks. While some people view marijuana as a panacea that can cure all ailments, the findings also highlight a need for more research to determine what THC does to the human brain to alter decision-making. That could eventually allow scientists to block these effects of THC, allowing those who use medical marijuana to enjoy the possible benefits of cannabis without the less desirable cognitive effects. Don't Miss: How CBD, a component in marijuana, works within cells At the beginning of each behavioural experiment, rats chose between two levers to signal whether they wanted an easy or hard challenge. Choosing the easy challenge resulted in a light turning on for one second, which the rats could easily detect and respond to by poking it with their nose, receiving one sugar pellet as a reward. In the more difficult challenge, the light turned on for only 0.2 seconds, rewarding the rat with two sugar pellets if they responded with a nose poke.

Often, aquatic environments such as rivers and streams become reservoirs for BPA, affecting turtle habitats. Last year, a team of researchers led by the University of Missouri (MU) determined that BPA can disrupt sexual function in painted turtles, causing males to develop female sex organs. Now, the team has shown that BPA also can induce behavioral changes in turtles, reprogramming male turtle brains to show behavior common in females. Researchers worry this could lead to population declines in painted turtles. See Also: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice ""Previously, our research team found that BPA and ethinyl estradiol (EE2), a hormone found in birth control pills, could 'sex-reverse' turtles from males to females,"" said Cheryl Rosenfeld, an associate professor of biomedical sciences in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine and an investigator in the Bond Life Sciences Center. ""Painted turtles and other reptiles lack sex chromosomes. The gender of painted turtles and other reptiles is determined by the incubation temperature of the egg during development. Studies have shown that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as BPA, can override incubation temperature and switch the sex of males to females. In our latest study, we found that BPA also affects how the male brain is 'wired,' potentially inducing males to show female type behavioral patterns."" Researchers applied a liquid form of BPA and ethinyl estradiol to painted turtle eggs and incubated the eggs at a temperature that typically results in males. Five months after hatching, turtles were tested with a spatial navigation test that included four food containers, only one of which was baited with food. Each turtle was randomly assigned one food container that did not change over the trial period. Researchers predicted that male turtles exposed to BPA and EE2 would exhibit improved navigational ability similar to behaviors observed in female turtles. Results showed that developmental exposure to BPA and EE2 improved spatial navigational learning and memory in males, as evidenced by increased number of times spent in the correct target zone and greater likelihood of solving the maze compared to control turtles, who were male based on the lower incubation temperature. ""Previous studies have found that female turtles are much more adept at spatial navigation think of female sea turtles that return many years later to the same beaches where they hatched to lay their own eggs,"" Rosenfeld said. ""We found that developmental exposure to BPA essentially overrides the brain development of male turtles as indicated by the enhanced navigational ability of the turtles we studied. While improved spatial navigation might be considered a good thing, it also may suggest that when they reach adulthood male turtles will not exhibit courtship behaviors needed to attract a mate and reproduce, which could result in dramatic population declines.""

While these strategies manifest as behaviors, a Princeton University and National Institutes of Health (NIH, US) study suggests that our response to stressful situations originates from structural changes in our brain that allow us to adapt to turmoil. See Also: Specific gene linked to adult growth of brain cells, learning and memory A study conducted with adult rats showed that the brains of animals faced with disruptions in their social hierarchy produced far fewer new neurons in the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for certain types of memory and stress regulation. Rats exhibiting this lack of brain-cell growth, neurogenesis, reacted to the surrounding upheaval by favoring the company of familiar rats over that of unknown rats, according to a paper published in The Journal of Neuroscience. The research is among the first to show that adult neurogenesis or the lack thereof has an active role in shaping social behavior and adaptation, said first author Maya Opendak, who received her PhD in neuroscience from Princeton in 2015 and conducted the research as a graduate student. The preference for familiar rats may be an adaptive behavior triggered by the reduction in neuron production, she said. ""Adult-born neurons are thought to have a role in responding to novelty, and the hippocampus participates in resolving conflicts between different goals for use in decision-making,"" said Opendak, who is now a postdoctoral research fellow of child and adolescent psychology at the New York University School of Medicine. ""Data from this study suggest that the reward of social novelty may be altered,"" she said. ""Indeed, sticking with a known partner rather than approaching a stranger may be beneficial in some circumstances."" The findings also show that behavioral responses to instability may be more measured than scientists have come to expect, explained senior author Elizabeth Gould, Princeton's Dorman T. Warren Professor of Psychology and department chair. Gould and her co-authors were surprised that the disrupted rats did not display any of the stereotypical signs of mental distress such as anxiety or memory loss, she said. Read Next: Research shows new neurons created through exercise don't cause you to forget old memories""Even in the face of what appears to be a very disruptive situation, there was not a negative pathological response but a change that could be viewed as adaptive and beneficial,"" said Gould, who also is a professor of neuroscience in the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI). ""We thought the animals would be more anxious, but we were making our prediction based on all the bias in the field that social disruption is always negative,"" she said. ""This research highlights the fact that organisms, including humans, are typically resilient in response to disruption and social instability."" Co-authors on the paper include: Lily Offit, who received her bachelor's degree in psychology and neuroscience from Princeton in 2015 and is now a research assistant at Columbia University Medical Center; Patrick Monari, a research specialist in PNI; Timothy Schoenfeld, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who received his PhD in psychology and neuroscience from Princeton in 2012; Anup Sonti, an NIH researcher; and Heather Cameron, an NIH principal investigator of neuroplasticity. The study is unusual for mimicking the true social structure of rats, Gould said. Rats live in structured societies that contain a single dominant male. The researchers placed rats into several groups consisting of four males and two females in to a large enclosure known as a visible burrow system. They then monitored the groups until the dominant rat in each one emerged and was identified. After a few days, the alpha rats of two communities were swapped, which reignited the contest for dominance in each group. Learn More: Single brain cells reveal genes controlling formation, development The rats from disrupted hierarchies displayed their preference for familiar fellows six weeks after those turbulent times, during which time neurogenesis had decreased by 50 percent, Opendak said. (Any neurons generated during the time of instability would take four to six weeks to be incorporated into the hippocampus' circuitry, she said). When the researchers chemically restored adult neurogenesis in these rats, however, the animals' interest in unknown rats returned to pre-disruption levels. At the same time, the researchers inhibited neuron growth in ""na ve"" transgenic rats that had not experienced social disruption. They found that the mere cessation of neurogenesis produced the same results as social disruption, particularly a preference for spending time with familiar rats. ""These results show that the reduction in new neurons is directly responsible for social behavior, something that hasn't been shown before,"" Gould said. The exact mechanism behind how lower neuron growth led to the behavior change is not yet clear, she said. Bruce McEwen, professor of neuroendocrinology at The Rockefeller University, said that the research is a ""major step forward"" in efforts to explore the role of the dentate gyrus a part of the hippocampus in social behavior and antidepressant efficacy. ""The ventral dentate gyrus, where they found these effects, is now implicated in mood-related behaviors and the response to antidepressants,"" said McEwen, who is familiar with the research but had no role in it. ""The connection to social behavior shown here is an important addition because social withdrawal is a key aspect of depression in humans, and the anterior hippocampus in humans is the homolog of the ventral hippocampus in rodents,"" McEwen said. ""Although there is no 'animal model' of human depression, the individual behaviors such as social avoidance, and brain changes such as neurogenesis, have been very useful in elucidating brain mechanisms in human depression."" At this point, the extent to which the exact mechanism and behavioral changes the researchers observed in the rats would apply to humans is unknown, Gould and Opendak said. The study's overall conclusion, however, that social disruption and instability lead to neurological changes that help us to better cope is likely universal, they said. ""Most people do experience some disruption in their lives, and resilience is the most typical response,"" Gould said. ""After all, if organisms always responded to stress with depression and anxiety, it's unlikely early humans would have made it because life in the wild is very stressful."" Related: Newborn neurons in the adult brain may help us adapt to the environment""For people who are exposed to social disruption frequently, our animal model suggests that these life events may be accompanied by long-term changes in brain function and social behavior,"" Opendak said. ""Although we hope that our findings may guide research on the mechanisms of resilience in humans, it is important as always to exercise caution when extrapolating these data across species.""

""Imaging is essential for identifying the presence and the severity of the structural changes induced by the infection, especially in the central nervous system,"" said the report's lead author, Fernanda Tovar-Moll, MD, PhD, vice president of the D'Or Institute for Research and Education and professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ""Microcephaly is just one of several radiological features."" See Also: Mouse models of Zika in pregnancy show how fetuses become infected Zika appears to be most dangerous when transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, increasing the likelihood of severe brain defects in the baby, including microcephaly. In cases of microcephaly, the baby's head is exceptionally small, due to an underdeveloped brain. Zika has also been linked to eye defects, hearing impairment and stunted growth in babies. ""The first trimester is the time where infection seems to be riskiest for the pregnancy,"" said study coauthor Deborah Levine, MD, director of Obstetric & Gynecologic Ultrasound at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. ""From an imaging standpoint, the abnormalities in the brain are very severe when compared to other congenital infections."" Though much of the concern in the media regarding the toxic effects of Zika virus has focused on brain findings of microcephaly, the researchers noted that there are a variety of brain abnormalities that can be found in fetuses exposed to the virus, including gray and white matter volume loss, brainstem abnormalities, calcifications, and a condition called ventriculomegaly, where the ventricles, or fluid filled spaces in the brain, are enlarged. Some babies infected by Zika may not have a small head size if the ventricles remain excessively enlarged. The researchers performed a retrospective review of imaging and autopsy findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection found in the Instituto de Pesquisa in Campina Grande state Paraiba (IPESQ) in northeastern Brazil, where the infection has been severe. Learn More: Zika infection may affect adult brain cells From June 2015 to May 2016, 438 patients were referred to the IPESQ due to rash during pregnancy or suspected central nervous system abnormality. From this group, the researchers identified 17 fetuses or neonates of women who had imaging at IPESQ, as well as documented Zika infection in fluid or tissue (""confirmed cohort""), and 28 fetuses or neonates with brain findings suspicious for Zika infection with intracranial calcifications (""presumed cohort""). Imaging exams included fetal MRI, postnatal brain CT, postnatal brain MRI and, in some cases, longitudinal prenatal ultrasound. The brain abnormalities seen in confirmed and presumed Zika groups were very similar. Nearly all of the babies in each group had ventriculomegaly. Although most fetuses had at least one exam showing abnormally small head circumference, the researchers discovered that head circumference was normal in three fetuses with severe ventriculomegaly. Ninety-four percent of the confirmed Zika group and 79 percent of the presumed Zika group had abnormalities of the corpus callosum, which is a large nerve fiber bundle that allows communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. All but one had cortical migrational abnormalities, meaning the neurons did not travel to their proper destination in the brain. Intracranial calcifications were present in almost all of the neonates, most commonly found at the gray-white junction of the brain. All of the babies exhibited reduced tissue volume in their brains. All patients showed varying abnormalities in cortical development. Read Next: Why neural stem cells may be vulnerable to Zika infection""The severity of the cortical malformation and associated tissue changes, and the localization of the calcifications at the grey-white matter junction were the most surprising findings in our research,"" Dr. Tovar-Moll said. The babies' skulls frequently had a collapsed appearance with overlapping sutures and redundant skin folds. The researchers believe the unusual appearance of the skull is due to a combination of the small brain as it develops, but also a result of what at some point was likely a larger head size--due to ventriculomegaly--that then decompresses, and/or brain atrophy, giving the skull the collapsed shape. Dr. Levine noted that ultrasound in pregnancy can show the abnormalities associated with congenital Zika infection, but it may take time before these changes are obvious. ""More than one ultrasound or MRI scan in pregnancy may be needed to assess the growth and development abnormalities of the brain,"" she said. Zika is mainly spread to humans via the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms may include fever, rash, joint or muscle pain, headache, and bloodshot eyes. However, many people infected with Zika have no symptoms at all. Although the current Zika outbreak is centered in Brazil, it has spread to countries and territories around the world, including the United States. Pregnant women and women who are considering becoming pregnant should avoid visiting areas where infected mosquitos are known to be present. However, if women live in areas where the mosquitos are present, the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to wear clothes that protect from mosquito bites, use mosquito repellent and get appropriate testing, including routine prenatal care and an ultrasound at 18 to 20 weeks. Pregnant women who are worried that they may have contracted the virus should speak with their obstetrician to initiate testing. Related: Microcephaly discoveries made in non-Zika cases help explain abnormal brain growthDr. Tovar-Moll noted that the researchers are continuing to investigate the central nervous system changes induced by congenital Zika virus infection to better understand the spectrum of the changes they have seen. ""We are also interested in investigating how congenital Zika virus infection can interfere with not only prenatal, but also postnatal gray and white brain maturation,"" she added.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/improved-immunity-in-older-age-198030,Improved Immunity in Older Age A study from Oxford and Basel universities may point the way to maintaining our immune systems as we get older  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a paper in the journal Nature Immunology, scientists explain how they uncovered the effects of a protein called Foxn1, which is a critical factor in the development of an effective immune system. Humans, like all higher animals, use T cells as part of the immune system, to fight off infections and cancer. T cells are generated in an organ called the thymus, where they closely interact with thymic epithelial cells (TEC) as they mature. People without TEC cannot generate T cells, severely compromising the immune system and consequently increasing the risk for life threatening infections and cancer. More than 20 years ago the transcription factor Foxn1 was identified as an essential molecule for the normal development of TEC. However, the genes directly controlled by Foxn1   and thus responsible for the various TEC functions   have remained unidentified. The researchers used new experimental models and analytical tools to investigate which genes were regulated by Foxn1 and how it affected them. Transcription factors bind to particular sections of our DNA and the team is the first to identify the DNA sequence bound by Foxn1. From there, they identified the hundreds of genes whose expression is regulated by this master regulator. These include genes that are essential to attract precursor cells in the blood, which are destined to become T-cells, to the thymus, genes that commit these precursor cells to become T cells and genes that provide the molecular machinery which allows the selection of those T cells that best serve an individual. Experiments in which Foxn1 expression by TEC was inhibited, confirmed that the transcription factor needs to be continuously present for TEC to function normally. Professor Georg Hollander from the University of Oxford's Department of Paediatrics said: 'The thymus is the organ in humans that first displays an age-dependent, physiological decline in function. 'It grows until puberty and then shrinks throughout the rest of our lives. This is thought to contribute to the decline in immunity in older people, which makes them more susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancers. 'The findings from these studies therefore provide important insight into the genetic control of regular TEC function and identify new potential strategies to preserve thymus function for longer, raising the prospect of a healthier old age.'","Published: August 24, 2016"

In spite of those widespread medical problems, scientists were uncertain about how these single-celled fungi reproduced in human or animal cells. But in a study that employed transparent roundworms, biologists at the University of California San Diego succeeded in directly observing how these microorganisms replicate and spread. And what they saw surprised them. The UC San Diego biologists report in this week s issue of Nature Microbiology that microsporidia fuse the cells of their animal hosts together so they can multiply and quickly spread, alien-like, within their hosts  uninfected cells.  Viruses and bacteria have been shown to fuse host cells together to facilitate the spread of an infection,  said Emily Troemel, a professor of biology who headed the study.  But this is the first time we ve seen this mode of infection by a eukaryotic pathogen, which is a single-celled organism with a distinct nucleus containing genetic material.   It s like microsporidia have figured out that, like soldiers fighting in an urban warfare, it s easier and safer to go from house to house by entering adjacent houses through a common wall, rather than by going through the front door of each house,  said Troemel. Microsporidia are typically found in the intestinal tracts of animals and humans, which are made up of millions of cells. That s one reason why studying their mode of reproduction before had been so difficult.  We often don t know where pathogens invade or how they spread from cell to cell,  explained Keir Balla, a graduate student working in Troemel s laboratory and the first author of the paper.  This is partly due to the complex arrangement of cells in the body. Because the gut is made up of millions of cells, it s virtually impossible to tell which gut cell was first invaded or the extent to which infection was able to spread. And this can prevent effective treatment.  Although some compounds have been used to treat infections with microsporidia, none have proven effective, leading to widespread infections among humans as well as animals. A recent study conducted in the Czech Republic found that roughly one-half of the population was infected with at least one of the 14 species of microsporidia known to infect humans.  It s been an unappreciated medical issue because of how difficult it s been to detect microsporidia,  said Troemel. Balla and two other scientists in Troemel s lab  graduate student Robert Luallen and postdoctoral fellow Malina Bakowski used the tiny roundworm, C. elegans to figure out how microsporidia replicate from a single infection. Not only is the worm transparent, allowing the researchers to directly observe the process, but it has a very simple gut.  The entire body of this worm is roughly 10 times shorter than a single human eyelash and its gut is made up of just 20 cells,  said Balla.  But despite the drastic differences in the number of gut cells between the worms and humans, their gut structure is quite similar. This means there are probably parallels in how microsporidian infections spread in both the human and worm cells.  By labeling the RNA of microsporidia with a red fluorescent dye and tagging the membranes of the gut cells in green, the researchers were able to microscopically track a single infection of one microsporidia cell in one gut cell as it reproduced over two days by more than 50,000 individuals and travelled through all 20 gut cells. Thus, one parasite cell can replicate to take ultimately over the entire intestinal organ.  While watching these infections in the living worms, we saw the microsporidia grow and spread beyond the initially invaded cell by fusing neighboring gut cells together,  said Troemel.  This process continued across all of the gut cells until the majority of the entire intestine was fused into one giant cell filled with microsporidia.  When the researchers infected the worm s muscle cells with microsporidia, the same process occurred. The invaders fused the cells together into one continuous structure, suggesting that the same mode of reproduction microsporidia employ in gut cells occurs in many other types of animal cells they infect including humans.  Our observation in this study that a single microbe can fuse many host cells into one should provide insights for other scientists designing more effective treatments for microsporidia infections,  said Balla.  Because these pathogens remain hidden within their hosts  cells, treatments will need to be designed that deliver drugs or other agents to these intracellular regions. ","Published: August 24, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/proteins-preserve-vital-genetic-data-206305,Proteins Preserve Vital Genetic Data Research has shown how two key proteins bring about the oragnization of chromosomes and our genome  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cancer is often driven by various genetic mutations that are acquired through changes to a person s DNA over time. These alterations can occur at the chromosome level if the proteins are not properly organized and segregated as our cells divide and multiply. Now, new research from The Wistar Institute demonstrates how two key proteins mediate the organization of chromosomes and our genome, shedding light on one of the key genetic processes for every person. With this key basic information in hand, scientists may now be able to pinpoint the origins of cancer due to genetic mutations. The findings were published in the journal Nature Genetics.  Understanding the three-dimensional structure of our genome is critical if we are to properly understand key functions like transcription, DNA replication and repair,  said Ken-ichi Noma, Ph.D., associate professor in the Gene Expression and Regulation program at Wistar and lead author of the study. Each of our cells contains enough DNA that, if stretched out in a line, would total about six feet in length. Condensin and cohesin are two key protein complexes that properly preserve our DNA in our chromosomes. Condensin helps to compact the essential genetic information into our cells and facilitates chromosome formation. Cohesin helps regulate the chromatids   the two strands along which a chromosome divides   during cell division. Noma has extensively studied the importance of the three-dimensional structure of our genomes, and while researchers know the roles of condensin and cohesin, their exact roles in how they are able to properly organize chromosomes has remained unclear. Noma and his colleagues studied fission yeast because it undergoes cell division very similar to that of humans. They were able to show that although condensin and cohesin bind to the exact same position on chromosomes, but the domains of chromatins   complexes of DNA and proteins that make up our chromosomes   vary in size and function depending on which protein complex is responsible for the organization. Cohesin helps mediate associations between chromatins located close to one another whereas condensin mediates larger associations. These domains play critical roles in making sure each cell performs its key function, and if either cohesin or condensin does not organize these key genetic components properly, the consequences could be a host of genetic diseases, including cancer. Specifically, the researchers pinpointed a mutation in the ace2  gene, which is responsible for encoding a transcription factor that is important for condensing, that can disrupt these key gene association domains. If this happens, it can lead to chromosomal segregation defects. This mutation revealed more information about the specific role of condensin as well. They proposed that condensin is recruited to chromosomes by transcription factors that regulate mitosis, or cell division. When condensin is recruited in this manner, chromosomes can be properly segregated.  The more we know about the role of condensin and cohesin, the more we can learn about key processes involved in the cell cycle and how cancer can be controlled through processes like cellular senescence,  Noma said.","Published: August 24, 2016"

The protein rhodopsin sees to it that our eyes can rapidly take in their ever-changing surroundings. Free-electron X-ray lasers such as SwissFEL at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI now makes it possible for the first time to catch such processes in flagranti. Free-electron X-ray lasers generate extremely short and intense pulses of X-ray light. Currently there are only two such facilities in operation, worldwide. An international team under the leadership of the PSI has now successfully shown how the ultrafast processes by which proteins do their work can be studied with free-electron X-ray lasers. As a model organism, they used a simple microbe that can convert light into chemical energy. The researchers report their results in the scientific journal Nature Communications. Sitting in a sidewalk cafe, watching people stroll by: Most of us are unaware that complex processes are constantly taking place in our body to make seemingly simple perceptions such as sight possible in the first place. There s a reason why, nevertheless, vision appears to be an immediate experience that belongs to us directly: The processes involved take place so rapidly that we simply don t notice them. We do notice the blink of an eye, but biological processes can be up to a billion times faster, particularly if light is involved.  Testing methods on a simple model  Researchers around the world use the protein bacteriorhodopsin to investigate such ultrafast processes. It has a key function in certain simple microbes, above all those in the group of halobacteria. If these smallest of living things run short on oxygen, they use light instead as an energy supply. Bacteriorhodopsin is a membrane protein   that is, it sits in the outer skin of the cell. When light strikes it, the protein changes form and starts the process of converting light to chemical energy.  For researchers, this is an important model protein, on which they can test methods that can later be used on more complex membrane proteins   such as bacteriorhodopsin s big brother rhodopsin, which sees to it that our eyes can rapidly take in their ever-changing surroundings.  Capturing ultrafast biological processes  Researchers have been trying for a long time to understand in detail the ultrafast processes that take place in proteins day in and day out. This now becomes possible for the first time, with free-electron X-ray lasers such as SwissFEL, which is currently being completed at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI: These facilities generate a rapid sequence of extremely short and intense pulses of X-ray light, with which the individual steps of ultrafast processes can be illuminated to be rendered and viewed, so to speak, as a molecular movie.  To be able to optimally exploit the potential of free-electron X-ray lasers, PSI researchers are developing new experimental methods. The most promising method to date is called serial crystallography. It was specially developed for free-electron X-ray laser applications but can also be used at facilities such as the Swiss Light Source SLS of the PSI to investigate the structure of biomolecules.  In theory the idea of how, with serial crystallography, it is possible to study light-activated proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin in action is simple. Many identical samples are made, an optical laser triggers the desired process in the samples at precisely controlled time intervals, and the samples are injected individually into the beam of X-ray laser pulses. The pulses then X-ray the individual samples. Because the state of the protein at a specific process step can be inferred from the deflected light, the individual steps are captured, image by image. These can then be assembled into a movie.  The devil s in the details   of the research object  As self-evident as the theory may be, in practice the researchers have to contend with the uncooperative nature of their research objects. In order for the X-ray light to be deflected with sufficient strength, the sample must be prepared in crystal form. And up to now, the ability to resolve ultrafast processes required a large number of such protein crystals. Their production, however, is very time-consuming and cost-intensive   especially for the important group of membrane proteins to which the previously mentioned light sensor rhodopsin belongs.  At the free-electron laser facility LCLS at Stanford University in California, an international team under the leadership of the PSI has now shown how even these difficult proteins can be made accessible for study. Our goal was to drastically reduce the number of crystals required, says Przemyslaw Nogly, who played a leading role in the project within the framework of the Swiss-European PSI FELLOW Program.  The researchers injected bacteriorhodopsin crystals into the X-ray beam with a special injector. In this injector the crystals, just a few micrometres in size, are embedded in an extremely viscous fluid. It is in fact so viscous that the injector admits less than two microlitres per minute into the X-ray beam   that is, less than two-millionths of a litre. In this way we were able to decisively increase the hit rate of the X-ray pulses, and we lose fewer crystals than with other methods, beams Nogly. Previous methods needed several grams of the precious protein crystals, but now just a few milligrams are enough.  That experiments with this method can be conducted at room temperature is another crucial advantage. It s hard to produce a good movie when the actors are frozen in their tracks, jokes Standfuss, under whose leadership the experiment at Stanford was conducted.  Gaining experience for SwissFEL  The researchers took the injector used in their experiment with them to Stanford. In this way they were able to gain valuable experience, because this injector is destined for use at SwissFEL, where the first pilot experiments will start in 2017. It s important for us to be able to test the methods planned for SwissFEL in advance on existing X-ray lasers, says Christopher Milne. For SwissFEL, he is developing the experiment station at which serial crystallography will be deployed once the facility is in operation. He also took part in the Stanford experiment. This lets us optimise the experiment stations from the start to be compatible with state-of-the-art methods.  The same goes for the biologists. They want to begin their studies at SwissFEL with the best possible research tools. And they can hardly wait to see, in addition to their model protein, other proteins in action. With free-electron X-ray lasers such as SwissFEL, we will finally be able to follow some of the fastest biological process in the finest detail, Standfuss says.","Published: August 24, 2016"

Now, Monash and Harvard researchers have discovered the molecular cause of this irritation. The finding brings us a step closer to designing agents to block this mechanism and sheds light on other serious skin conditions, such as psoriasis. The international team of scientists have shown, for the first time, a connection between an immune molecule found in the skin and skin sensitisers   the research was published overnight in Nature Immunology. Professor Jamie Rossjohn, co-lead author with Dr Florian Winau, Harvard Medical School, confirmed the body s immune molecule, CD1a, plays a crucial role in mediating skin inflammation and irritation after contact with urushiol   the  active ingredient  found in plants endemic to Northern America and parts of Europe and Australia.  A complex set of experiments, coupled with imaging techniques at the Australian Synchrotron revealed the molecular interplay between CD1a and urushiol. This highlights CDIa s role in sudden and uncomfortable skin reactions,  Professor Rossjohn says. CRACKING A 35 YEAR MYSTERY   Dr Tang Yongqing and Dr Jerome Le Nours say the research team needed a combination of scientific creativity and ingenuity to crack the CD1a urushiol code.  For over 35 years we have known CD1a is abundant in the skin,  says Dr Le Nours.  Its role in inflammatory skin disorders has been difficult to investigate and until now has been really unclear. Our work represents clear evidence that CD1a is instrumental in skin-related diseases. We are the first scientists to image the CD1a urushiol connection.    Our results were strengthened by in vivo and clinical studies at Harvard Medical School, in the United States,  Dr Yongqing says. The studies in Boston also showed that blocking the function of CD1a prevents the triggering of this skin-based allergic reaction, giving the researchers further evidence of just how important CD1a is.  Future research could lead to the development of new treatments to combat minor skin irritations as well as chronic inflammatory skin diseases like psoriasis, eczema and rosacea,  says Dr Yongqing.  We now have a target to further investigate. Our basic discovery may make a big difference in the future treatment and prevention of inflammatory skin diseases,  Dr Le Nours concludes. This work was a collaboration between researchers from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging at the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute (Rossjohn, Yongqing, Le Nours) and researchers at the Harvard Medical School (Winau).","Published: August 24, 2016"

Now Illumina Accelerator has expanded its pool of startups to include Center of Individualized Diagnostic (CID), the first-ever Illumina Accelerator Fellow, working to bringing cancer genomics diagnostics to Saudi Arabia. Illumina Accelerator Fellow is a new partnership with international genomics experts and entrepreneurs to bring precision medicine and next-generation sequencing (NGS) capabilities to unique patient populations across the globe. Saudi Arabia, in particular, has a high burden of genetic disease, both in the form of severe inherited diseases and in common genetic diseases, including cancer.  CID is the brainchild of Malak Abed Al-Thagafi, M.D., and Ahmed Al-Bader, both born and raised in Saudi Arabia. Dr. Abed Al-Thagafi, a board certified, Harvard-trained pathologist and Al-Bader, an Oxford-educated entrepreneur with extensive experience in business development, started CID after recognizing the lack of public awareness and technical expertise in the field of genomics in their country. They realized that they needed additional resources, like those offered by Illumina Accelerator, to bring this vision to life and to help close the noticeable gap in the region.  We launched Illumina Accelerator to lower the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs developing novel commercial sequencing approaches,  said Mostafa Ronaghi, Ph.D., Illumina s Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Illumina Accelerator.  Dating back to our first funding cycle, we ve received applications from 28 different countries. We re thrilled to partner with the esteemed CID team to bring NGS to patients in Saudi Arabia.  Dr. Abed Al-Thagafi s passion for this project began long before her medical degree. She was born with an inherited genetic disease called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a genetic defect that limits the adrenal glands' ability to make certain vital hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone. These hormones are critical to life, as they help to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, to suppress the immune system, and to aid in the metabolism of fat, protein and carbohydrates. She was diagnosed with the disease at the age of two, but only after her family took her to see a British physician who was visiting Saudi Arabia at the time. At the age of five, she traveled to London to have surgery to improve her condition. Thanks to diagnosis and intervention at an early age, she is able to manage her genetic condition today through continued hormone replacement therapy.  It was the early 1980s, and there were no genetic clinics in the Kingdom. My personal experience as a patient with a genetic condition helped inspire and shape my career,  said Dr. Abed Al-Thagafi.  When I was in medical school, the human genome project had just been completed, and that s when I heard about molecular genetics pathology. I knew I wanted to specialize in this field in order to help others.  Dr. Abed Al-Thagafi is also part of the team selected by King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KASCT) to lead the Saudi Human Genome Project. The project s five-year goal is to identify genetic basis of disease in the Saudi population by utilizing NGS and bioinformatics to enable rapid, accurate and affordable diagnostic screening and treatment for patients.  There s an extraordinary amount of advancement and opportunity in the field of genomics and NGS, but it hasn t yet carried over to Saudi Arabia,  said Al-Bader.  We are working to bring the benefit of this important technology to our country and to improve lives, starting with cancer diagnostics. As an Illumina Accelerator Fellow, we re collaborating with Illumina to bring two nations together to address important health issues in the world. We see major interest from the government in the NGS field translated to massive projects by KACST and the National Transformation Program (NTP), as both are planning to enhance the Saudi health standards using the benefits of NGS.   Every patient deserves a chance, and we want to show physicians and clinicians in our country that this is not only possible, but it s accessible. We want to improve the application of personalized medicine and targeted therapy, which can be utilized in the clinical management of cancer patients,  Dr. Abed Al-Thagafi added. Al-Bader says the CID team plans to take full advantage of the entire ecosystem Illumina Accelerator offers in the San Francisco Bay Area.  We re hoping to transfer what we learn back to Saudi Arabia to share how the most effective biotech startups should operate. That s why we have adapted the motto,  Redefining the Impossible,  he said.  Illumina Accelerator helps drive value for entrepreneurs by providing unparalleled resources to advance genomics startups,  said Amanda Cashin, Ph.D., co-founder and Head of Illumina Accelerator.  Over the six months, we try to check all the boxes, from how to build a company and team, to how to secure partnerships, to networking and go-to-market strategies. We re proud to partner with CID as part of our fourth class and help bring genomics to Saudi Arabia. ","Published: August 24, 2016"

But how does each resting ovule know that it is time to prepare for ovulation?  In a study published in the latest issue of Nature Communications, researchers at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia (IGC; Portugal), at University of Algarve (Portugal), and at University at Albany (USA) discovered in the fruit fly a molecular ""alarm clock"" that tells resting ovules when is the right time to wake up. Defects in this alarm clock result in female fertility problems. During their resting period, ovules turn off their genes to enter an almost hibernation-like state. When they wake up, they need to turn their genes back on so they can grow and become ready for ovulation. The research team led by Rui Martinho, from the Center for Biomedical Research at University of Algarve and from Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, and Prashanth Rangan, from University at Albany, discovered that the timing of turning the genes back on is programmed directly into the chromosomes of the ovule.  To uncover this mechanism, the research team conducted a series of genetic experiments in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Paulo Navarro-Costa, first co-author of this study and researcher at the IGC explains: ""Similarly to humans, fruit fly ovules also have a resting period during meiosis - the specialized cell division required for the formation of healthy reproductive cells. Therefore, this organism could help us understanding exactly how the ovule is able to turn back on its genes at the right time, a biological mystery until now."" The results of the research team revealed the ovules keep track of time during meiosis using a process similar to a molecular ""alarm clock"". Rui Martinho clarifies the mechanism: ""When ovules begin to form, a protein called dKDM5 modifies the chromosomes in a way that they can only activate their genes at the right time. If this alarm clock is incorrectly set, for example due to defects in the dKDM5 protein, females become infertile because their ovules fail to complete meiosis."" An unexpected property of this new molecular alarm clock is that it is set at early stages of ovule formation, long before the cell needs to be awakened. ""These results illustrate just how important for female fertility is the early life of the ovule. For instance, in the case of humans, the early stages of ovule formation occur before women are born, while they are still in their mother's womb. This prenatal development period is therefore critical for the future formation of healthy reproductive cells"", says Paulo Navarro-Costa.","Published: August 24, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/creating-embryos-with-heteroplasmy-191479,Creating Embryos with  Heteroplasmy  New discovery in genetic research could lead to treatments for mitochondrial diseases  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) from the University of Missouri has succeeded in creating embryos with  heteroplasmy,  or the presence of both maternal and paternal mitochondrial DNA. This new innovation will allow scientists to study treatments for mitochondrial diseases in humans as well as the significance of mitochondrial inheritance for livestock. When parents pass along their genes to their children, most of the DNA from the mother and father is evenly divided. However, children only receive one type of DNA, called mitochondrial DNA, from their mothers, while the fathers  mitochondrial DNA is naturally removed from the embryos. Peter Sutovsky, a professor of reproductive physiology at Mizzou and lead author Won-Hee Song, a doctoral candidate in the Mizzou College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, have found a way to prevent this paternal mitochondrial DNA removal process in pig embryos, thus creating embryos with  heteroplasmy.   As many as 4,000 children are born in the U.S. every year with some form of mitochondrial disease, which can include poor growth, loss of muscle coordination, learning disabilities and heart disease,  Sutovsky said.  Some scientists believe some of these diseases may be caused by heteroplasmy, or cells possessing both maternal and paternal mitochondrial DNA. We have succeeded in creating this condition of heteroplasmy within pig embryos, which will allow scientists to further study whether paternal heteroplasmy could cause mitochondrial diseases in humans.  For their study, Sutovsky and Song identified two separate ubiquitin-binding proteins, called SQSTM1 and valosin-containing proteins (VCP), within embryos they believed were responsible for removing paternal, sperm-contributed mitochondria and their genetic cargo. Sutovsky, Song and their colleagues experimented by inhibiting SQSTM1 and VCP separately, but found that even when one protein was incapacitated, the other protein still carried out the duty of disposing of the paternal mitochondria inside the fertilized egg. However, when Song and Sutovsky inhibited both proteins simultaneously, the paternal mitochondria were not removed and remained within the embryos.  This research is important because we now know for sure what processes lead to the deletion of paternal mitochondrial DNA from embryos,  Sutovsky said.  This knowledge will enable us to further explore how some children may develop devastating mitochondrial diseases. From there, we can create treatments and therapies that may help prevent or reduce the effects of heteroplasmy and other mitochondrial disorders.  The study,  Autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system contribute to sperm mitophagy after mammalian fertilization,  was funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Additional funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs, and by the Food for the 21st Century program at the University of Missouri.

A study on this gene therapy approach, called sonoporation, appears today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).   We can use ultrasound energy in combination with small, gas-filled bubbles to selectively open up cells to allow the delivery of therapeutic agents,  said Brandon Helfield, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Ultrasound Molecular Imaging and Therapeutics at UPMC.  With a focused ultrasound beam, this approach lets us tune this delivery to the precise location of disease while sparing healthy tissue. Our study looks at some of the biophysics at play and helps us get closer to refining this technique as a clinical tool.  Current approaches to gene therapy often use viruses to gain access inside cells, which can cause severe side-effects, including inflammatory immune system reactions. To address this, researchers have developed gene-loaded intravascular microbubbles that can be targeted to release their payloads by direct navigation of focused ultrasound energy.  The Pitt researchers developed an ultrafast imaging camera capable of reaching speeds up to 25 million frames per second the only one of its kind in North America. Using the camera, these researchers examined the biophysics of sonoporation. They determined that the oscillating bubbles need to generate a minimum amount of localized shear stress, beyond which cell membranes perforate and allow entry of a targeted therapeutic.    By allowing us to actually see the microbubbles vibrating at millions of times per second, our unique camera enabled us to determine that microbubble-induced shear stress is the critical factor for sonoporation,  said Xucai Chen, Ph.D., research associate professor of medicine, Pitt Division of Cardiology, and Pittsburgh Heart, Lung and Blood Vascular Medicine Institute, who co-developed the camera system.  This new information, in turn, will facilitate the intelligent design of treatment protocols and microbubble fabrication to preferentially cause the desired effect of opening nearby cells. It also gives us a starting point to investigate how cells cope with this treatment.  Researchers believe the findings will help them understand how the process of sonoporation works, as well as how experts can tailor the approach, including ultrasound amplitude levels and microbubble designs, toward its eventual clinical use.   It s critical for us to understand the biophysical mechanisms of sonoporation in order to translate this approach into an effective gene or drug delivery tool for patients,  said Flordeliza Villanueva, M.D., professor of medicine at Pitt, director of the Center for Ultrasound Molecular Imaging and Therapeutics, and the senior author of the investigation.  Building on the PNAS study, we are continuing to investigate how sonoporation affects the function of treated cells and to develop strategies to maximize its therapeutic effects.

With additional research, the new technique could be an improvement over the standard method, which requires isolating live bacteria from blood, urine or spinal fluid and growing them in a laboratory culture. The study, funded in part by NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), appears in the Aug. 23, 2016, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Health care providers who evaluate young infants with fevers have limited means to quickly and accurately diagnose whether or not an illness results from a bacterial infection. Determining if the illness is caused by bacteria may involve complicated medical procedures, such as a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). While they wait for the test results, physicians also may need to admit the infant for a lengthy hospital stay or prescribe antibiotics, which may later turn out to be unnecessary.   The development of a fast and non-invasive diagnostic tool holds promise for better outcomes and lower treatment costs for young infants with fevers of unknown cause,  said Valerie Maholmes, Ph.D., chief of NICHD s Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch. With advances in genetic sequencing technology, researchers have explored alternative approaches to diagnosing infections, such as assessing the body s immune response. When the immune system wards off an infection, immune cells activate certain genes, depending on whether the infection results from bacteria or viruses. Collectively, these distinct genes form what is called a  biosignature.   Previous studies have suggested that analyzing immune cell biosignatures can distinguish between bacterial and viral infections in children and adults,  said Ruth Brenner, M.D., M.P.H., an NICHD program officer.  However, scientists were uncertain if this approach would work in young infants because of their immature immune systems.  In the current study, researchers in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) sought to define a group of genes that could serve as a biosignature in infants. The study team enrolled infants 2 months of age or younger from 22 emergency rooms. More than 1,800 infants with fevers were enrolled. For this preliminary study, the researchers tested samples from 279 randomly selected infants (89 with bacterial infections, 190 without bacterial infections), along with samples from 19 healthy infants without fevers. The PECARN team identified a biosignature of 66 genes, measured in a small blood sample, from which they could distinguish between newborns with or without bacterial infections. These serious bacterial infections included urinary tract infections, brain or spinal fluid infections (bacterial meningitis) and blood infections (bacteremia), all of which are typically diagnosed by growing bacteria from samples of body fluids. In their study, the biosignature was 87 percent sensitive   correctly identifying a sample as positive. The researchers also found a group of 10 genes signifying bacteremia, a very serious condition. This biosignature correctly identified a positive sample 94 percent of the time. When compared to the traditional culture method, these preliminary findings indicate that biosignatures could ultimately lead to a fast and non-invasive test for diagnosing bacterial infections in infants with fevers. More work is needed, however, to optimize this diagnostic approach.","Published: August 24, 2016"

According to a paper published today in the journal Nature Cell Biology, the scientists discovered that before spreading to other organs, a melanoma tumor sends out tiny vesicles containing molecules of microRNA. These induce morphological changes in the dermis in preparation for receiving and transporting the cancer cells. The researchers also found chemical substances that can stop the process and are therefore promising drug candidates. ""The threat of melanoma is not in the initial tumor that appears on the skin, but rather in its metastasis   in the tumor cells sent off to colonize in vital organs like the brain, lungs, liver and bones,"" said research leader Dr. Carmit Levy of the Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry at TAU's Sackler School of Medicine. ""We have discovered how the cancer spreads to distant organs and found ways to stop the process before the metastatic stage."" The TAU group worked in close collaboration with Prof. J rg D. Hoheisel and Laureen Sander at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Dr. Shoshi Greenberger at the Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer, Israel and Dr. Ronen Brenner at the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, Israel. Lab research was led by Dr. Shani Dror of Dr. Levy's research group. Morphological changes in the dermis Melanoma, the most aggressive and lethal type of skin cancer, causes the death of one person every 52 minutes according to data from the Skin Cancer Foundation, and the number of diagnosed cases has been on the rise for the past three decades. Despite a range of therapies developed over the years, there is still no full remedy for this life-threatening disease. The new study proposes novel and effective methods for diagnosing and preventing this most deadly of skin cancers. The researchers began by examining pathology samples taken from melanoma patients. ""We looked at samples of early melanoma, before the invasive stage,"" Dr. Levy said. ""To our surprise we found changes in the morphology of the dermis   the inner layer of the skin   that had never before been reported. Our next task was to find out what these changes were, and how they related to melanoma."" In the ensuing study, the group was able to discover and block a central mechanism in the metastasis of melanoma. According to Dr. Levy, scientists have known for years that melanoma forms in the outer layer of the skin, the epidermis. At this early stage, the cancer is unable to send off colonizing cancer cells because it has no access to blood vessels   the highways that carry the cells to other parts of the body. With no blood vessels present in the epidermis, the tumor first needs to contact the abundant blood vessels running through the dermis. But how was the connection made? ""We found that even before the cancer itself invades the dermis, it sends out tiny vesicles containing molecules of microRNA,"" Dr. Levy said. ""These induce the morphological changes in the dermis in preparation for receiving and transporting the cancer cells. It then became clear to us that by blocking the vesicles, we might be able to stop the disease altogether."" Transforming melanoma into a nonthreatening illness Having discovered the mechanism, the researchers proceeded to look for substances that could intervene and block the process in its earliest stages. They found two such chemicals: one (SB202190) inhibits the delivery of the vesicles from the melanoma tumor to the dermis; and the other (U0126) prevents the morphological changes in the dermis even after the arrival of the vesicles. Both substances were tested successfully in the lab, and may serve as promising candidates for future drugs. In addition, the changes in the dermis, as well as the vesicles themselves, can be used as powerful indicators for early diagnosis of melanoma. ""Our study is an important step on the road to a full remedy for the deadliest skin cancer,"" said Dr. Levy. ""We hope that our findings will help turn melanoma into a nonthreatening, easily curable disease.""","Published: August 24, 2016"

Cancer has proven to be a formidable adversary, in part because the cells are so effective at hypnotizing the immune system that should act to destroy them. In recent years, cancer therapies that activate the body s own immune system to destroy tumors have improved the odds against some cancers, including formerly incurable skin cancers like that afflicting former President Jimmy Carter. But the immunotherapies currently available only activate one arm of the multi-pronged immune system   the adaptive immune system   and aren t always effective. Carolyn Bertozzi, a Stanford professor of chemistry, has now shown that removing certain sugars surrounding breast cancer cells can recruit a second arm of the immune system   the innate immune system. The approach, described in a study published Aug. 22 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, greatly improved the effectiveness of a breast cancer drug in a lab dish, opening up a new avenue in the fight against cancer.  This is a whole new dimension to immune therapy,  Bertozzi said, adding that she thinks it could be the first of many therapeutic approaches involving the sugars that surround cells, called the glycocalyx.  People in this field are starting to appreciate that there are many different nodes that you need to affect to get a more robust immune reaction against a tumor, and the glycocalyx appears to be one of those nodes,  she said. Nothing to see here Scientists have long known that if certain sugars are present on a tumor, it is less likely to respond well to therapies. But nobody knew what that halo of sugars was doing, in part because such a small number of labs study the glycocalyx. Evidence had been mounting within those few labs that do study the glycocalyx, including Bertozzi s, that a subset of sugars called sialic acids act as a signal for the innate immune system to ignore the otherwise suspicious-looking tumor. Eliminate those sugars, and maybe innate immune cells would be more likely to recognize and attack the cancer cells, Bertozzi thought. And essentially that s exactly what happened. Chemical lawn mower Bertozzi and her team worked with breast cancer cells in the lab that had varying amounts of a protein called HER2 on the surface. This is a well-known protein that s present at some level on about three-quarters of breast cancers. Women whose tumors have that protein at high levels generally receive a therapy called Herceptin, which is an antibody that binds to HER2 and flags the tumor cell for destruction by innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. But Herceptin doesn t always work, especially in tumors with less abundant HER2, and if sialic acids are present on the cancer cell surface, then it s even less likely to be effective. Bertozzi and her team used chemistry tools they d created in previous work to attach what is essentially a chemical lawn mower onto the Herceptin antibody. Once the drug bound to HER2 molecules on the cancer cell, the chemical mower sliced off the neighboring sialic acids. With those sugars gone, Herceptin became significantly more likely to activate NK cells to kill the cancerous cells, especially in cases where the cells had lower levels of HER2 and higher levels of sugars. This all took place in a lab dish, but Bertozzi is hopeful a version of this strategy could be effective in people. Tilting the scale Bertozzi said that cancer immunotherapies are a matter of tilting the scale of signals present on tumors, some of which tell immune cells to attack, and others of which tell immune cells to turn a blind eye.  All of the world of immune therapy is now thinking about the immune system as calculating pluses and minuses. If you want to tilt the scale toward immune activation, you can either augment the activator or remove inhibitor, or both,  said Bertozzi, who is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Current immunotherapies on the market work by blocking one of the inhibitory signals that are recognized by the adaptive immune system. Block those and the balance tilts in such a way that the immune system will attack the now recognizable cancer. Bertozzi s approach provides a second way of tiling the balance in favor of attack, this time for the innate immune system. She said this study shows just one example of how it could work, but her sugar-removing lawnmower could be used on a wide variety of cell types, not just those expressing HER2, and on different types of sugars.  It s almost always the case that you need a component of both the adaptive and innate immunity to get a robust reaction against infectious pathogens, such as during vaccination,  said Bertozzi.  The smart money suggests that the same will be true with tumors.  Bertozzi said the approach also highlights the importance of paying attention to the much ignored glycocalyx.  The fact that people don t study and understand the contribution of the glycocalyx to interactions means there s lost opportunity there,  Bertozzi said.  I think this work might turn the tide on that situation. ","Published: August 24, 2016"

Microbes with the potential to cause disease are destroyed during milk pasteurization, but not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated by that process. The remaining bacteria retain the ability to cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods. Despite the diversity, a core community of microbes remains constant through the seasons and across the various farms from which the milk is collected, the researchers found. Surprisingly, this core microbiota is quite vulnerable to change when the raw milk is transferred to large storage silos at the dairy processing plant. Identification of these raw-milk microbes and their abundance should help dairy processors develop new, effective sanitation procedures and process controls to ensure that the milk and resulting dairy foods are safe and of consistently high quality. The study findings are reported in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology.  The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing,  said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco of the Department of Food Science and Technology.  More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 percent of the total microbial content.  Raw milk and microbes Marco noted that the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk s high nutrient content as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. The cows  skin, feed, bedding and aerosols; human handlers; and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport milk are all likely bacterial sources. Raw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk as well as that of fermented dairy products like cheese and yogurt. Analyzing tankers of milk The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow s milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at two dairy processors in California s San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria, one of the largest known groups of bacteria. Within those diverse microbial populations was a core community of microbes that existed in all of the raw milk samples. This core group of microbes represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The researchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks. One group of silos contained microbial populations similar in makeup to the milk from the tanker trucks, while the other group of silos had distinctly different microbial populations dominated by the Acinetobacter and Lactococcus bacteria.  This finding demonstrates how the built environment in food-processing plants can have significant but still unpredictable impacts on the microbial quality of foods,  Marco said. California is nation s largest dairy producer The findings of the new study are particularly important for California, which is the largest dairy producer in the United States, providing more than one-fifth of the nation s fluid milk production. The state also is the nation s second largest cheese producer, following only behind Wisconsin.  In 2015, California dairy farms sold approximately $9.5 billion worth of milk, according to the UC Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis.","Published: August 24, 2016"

GABA is important to restrain neural activity, preventing neurons from getting too trigger-happy and from firing too much or responding to irrelevant stimuli. Researchers led by Dr Tobias Bast in the School of Psychology at The University of Nottingham have found that faulty inhibitory neurotransmission and abnormally increased activity in the hippocampus impairs our memory and attention. See Also: Current screening methods miss worrisome number of persons with mild cognitive impairmentTheir latest research, published in the academic journal Cerebral Cortex, has implications for understanding cognitive deficits in a variety of brain disorders, including schizophrenia, age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's, and for the treatment of cognitive deficits. The hippocampus plays a major role in our everyday memory of events and of where and when they happen for example remembering where we parked our car before going shopping. This research has shown that a lack of restraint in the neural firing within the hippocampus disrupts hippocampus-dependent memory; in addition, such aberrant neuron firing within the hippocampus also disrupted attention a cognitive function that does not normally require the hippocampus. Dr Bast, said: ""Our research carried out in rats highlights the importance of GABAergic inhibition within the hippocampus for memory performance and for attention. The finding that faulty inhibition disrupts memory suggests that memory depends on well-balanced neural activity within the hippocampus, with both too much and too little causing impairments. This is an important finding because traditionally, memory impairments have mainly been associated with reduced activity or lesions of the hippocampus. Learn More: Some astronauts at risk for cognitive impairment, animal studies suggest ""Our second important finding is that faulty inhibition leading to increased neural activity within the hippocampus disrupts attention, a cognitive function that does not normally require the hippocampus, but depends on the prefrontal cortex. This probably reflects that there are very strong neuronal connections between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Our finding suggests that aberrant hippocampal activity has a knock-on effect on the prefrontal cortex, thereby disrupting attention."" ""Overall, our new findings show that increased activity of a brain region, due to faulty inhibitory neurotransmission, can be more detrimental to cognitive function than reduced activity or a lesion. Increased activity within a brain region can disrupt not only the function of the region itself in this case hippocampus-dependent memory but also the function of other regions to which it is connected in this case prefrontal cortex-dependent attention."" Dr Bast's research is motivated by recent clinical findings that patients in early stages of schizophrenia, age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's show faulty inhibition and increased activity within the hippocampus. The new study, where inhibition in the hippocampus of rats was disrupted before the animals took part in tests of attention and memory, revealed that such faulty inhibition and aberrant activity within the hippocampus causes the type of memory and attentional impairments seen in patients. This research adds to the team's recent findings, where they found that attention was disrupted by faulty inhibition and increased activity within the prefrontal cortex, a brain region important for attention. Dr Bast, said: ""Overall, these findings highlight that higher brain functions, such as attention and memory, depend on well-balanced neural activity within the underlying brain regions."" This research has important implications for treating cognitive impairments. The findings show that simply 'boosting' the activity of the key memory and attention centres in the brain (the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex), which has been a long-standing strategy for cognitive enhancement, will not necessarily improve memory and attention, but can actually impair these functions. What's important is to re-balance activity within these regions. Read Next: The risk of cognitive impairment in children born prematurely may be predicted using MRI after birth Dr Bast, said: ""One emerging idea is that early stages of cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia and age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's, are characterised by faulty inhibition and too much activity; this excess neural activity leads then to neuronal damage and the reduced brain activity characterizing later stages of these disorders. So, rebalancing aberrant activity early on may not only restore attention and memory, but also prevent further decline. ""We have new studies on the way where we aim to identify medicines that might be able to re-balance neural activity within hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and to restore memory and attention.""

See Also: Scientists discover brain s anti-distraction system that may change perception and treatment of ADD Manganese is an essential element, required by the body in trace amounts. High levels of exposure can have neurotoxic effects, however, leading to a condition called ""manganism"" in adults exposed to manganese dust or fumes in mining, welding, and other industrial occupations. Studies of children and adolescents have associated excess manganese in the diet with attention deficits, but confounding factors in those studies have made it impossible to show a cause and effect relationship. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorder in children, but its cause remains unclear and probably involves many different factors. The new study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, is the first study to establish a causal link between exposure to elevated manganese in the diet and attentional dysfunction in an animal model, according to senior author Donald Smith, professor of environmental toxicology at University of California, Santa Cruz. ""There are many environmental and biological factors that have been associated with increased risk for attention deficits in children, so it's very challenging to understand which factors may actually contribute to or cause attention deficits,"" Smith said. ""Our study clarifies the effects of a single environmental agent, and it allowed us to tease out the specific nature of the deficits it causes, which is extremely difficult if not impossible to do in human studies."" Learn More: Attention deficit after kids' critical illness linked to plasticizers in medical tubes The most common source of exposure to excess manganese is drinking water from wells, because groundwater in some areas is naturally high in manganese. Soy-based infant formulas also have much higher levels of manganese than breast milk. The exposure levels used in the rat study were chosen to produce increases in manganese intake (relative to the normal intake of baby rats) comparable to the relative increases that would be experienced by infants and young children exposed to contaminated drinking water, soy-based formulas, or both. The impairments seen in the exposed rats were comparable in magnitude to the attentional dysfunction seen in children with ADHD, Smith said. A previous study by Smith's lab found that manganese exposure also causes deficits in fine motor abilities in rats, and he noted that similar deficits in coordination and dexterity are often seen in children with ADHD. In the new study, newborn rats were exposed to 0, 25, or 50 milligrams of manganese per kilogram of body weight per day, for either the first 21 days after birth or for the duration of the study (about six months). Behavioral testing for attention and impulsivity began when the rats were about 80 days old and continued six days a week for three months, using a well-accepted protocol. The animals were trained to focus their visual attention on a wall in the testing chamber with five ports and to respond to a brief flash of light within one port by poking their nose into that port. The researchers introduced distractions by delivering a puff of scented air into a different port within the test chamber. Read Next: MRI shows disrupted connections in the brains of young people with ADHD ""The odor-based distractor is very hard for the animals to ignore because they have very strong olfactory senses,"" Smith said. ""With thousands of response trials over months of testing, we were able to obtain very detailed information to assess specific functions that we can compare to the assessments used for children."" The impairment caused by manganese exposure was most pronounced in the area of selective attention, assessed by response accuracy in the presence of a distracting odor. Deficits were also seen in other areas related to attention, but manganese exposure did not affect impulse control. The results also showed that the susceptibility to manganese changed as the animals grew and matured. They were particularly sensitive to the neurotoxic effects during the early postnatal period, before weaning. According to Smith, the dependence of toxicity on the dose as well as the timing and duration of exposure is complicated for a substance like manganese that also has a beneficial biological function. ""The typical dose-response curve for biologically essential elements is U-shaped: too little is bad, too much is bad, and you want to be somewhere in the middle. This study shows that vulnerability also changes over the course of neurodevelopment,"" he explained. In the experiment, the rats got a constant dose relative to their body weight, but their sensitivity to it changed as they aged. At the lower dose level (25 mg/kg/d), animals exposed throughout the study actually showed less impairment than those exposed only during the early postnatal period. At the higher dose level, the level of impairment from the longer exposure was the same as the effects of the early life exposure. Don't Miss: Confirmation of neurobiological origin of attention-deficit disorder ""The lower dose exposure over the early life period produced lasting deficits in attention, but if that same dose was continued into adulthood, it helped lessen the deficits caused by the earlier exposure. At the higher dose, however, they were unable to recover,"" Smith said. He noted that such complex responses to differences in dose, timing, and duration of exposure may underlie the inconsistencies in published studies of the relationship between blood levels of manganese in humans and neurobehavioral deficits. ""It's difficult if not impossible to reconstruct the exposure histories of children,"" Smith said. ""If we knew their exposure histories more thoroughly, we would likely find stronger associations with the neurobehavioral deficits."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

This can lead to a loss of boundaries between the self and the environment, as might occur in certain psychiatric illnesses. David Nutt, professor of Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, leads a team of researchers who study how this psychedelic substance works in the brain. In a new study Dr. Neiloufar Family, post-doc from the University of Kaiserslautern, along Nutt and colleagues from Imperial College London, investigated how LSD can affect speech and language. See Also: Psychedelic therapy re-emerging for anxiety, PTSD and addiction For the study, ten participants were asked to name a sequence of pictures both under placebo and under the effects of LSD, one week apart. ""Results showed that while LSD does not affect reaction times, people under LSD made more mistakes that were similar in meaning to the pictures they saw"" indicated Dr. Family, lead author. For example, when people saw a picture of a car, they would accidentally say 'bus' or 'train' more often under LSD than under placebo. This indicates that LSD seems to effect the mind's semantic networks, or how words and concepts are stored in relation to each other. When LSD makes the network activation stronger, more words from the same family of meanings come to mind. The results from this experiment work to lead us to a better understanding of the neurobiological basis of semantic network activation. Dr. Family explains further implications: ""These findings are relevant for the renewed exploration of psychedelic psychotherapy, which are being developed for depression and other mental illnesses. The effects of LSD on language can result in a cascade of associations that allow quicker access to far away concepts stored in the mind.""

A team of researchers has developed a therapeutic technique that dramatically increases the production of nerve cells in mice with stroke-induced brain damage. See Also: Human stem cells repair damage caused by radiation therapy for brain cancer in ratsThe therapy relies on the combination of two methods that show promise as treatments for stroke-induced neurological injury. The first consists of surgically grafting human neural stem cells into the damaged area, where they mature into neurons and other brain cells. The second involves administering a compound called 3K3A-APC, which the scientists have shown helps neural stem cells grown in a petri dish develop into neurons. However, it was unclear what effect the molecule, derived from a human protein called activated protein-C (APC), would have in live animals. A month after their strokes, mice that had received both the stem cells and 3K3A-APC performed significantly better on tests of motor and sensory functions compared to mice that received neither or only one of the treatments. In addition, many more of the stem cells survived and matured into neurons in the mice given 3K3A-APC. ""This University of Souther California-led animal study could pave the way for a potential breakthrough in how we treat people who have experienced a stroke,"" added Jim Koenig, PhD, a program director at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), which funded the research. ""If the therapy works in humans, it could markedly accelerate the recovery of these patients."" Learn More: Human stem cell-derived neuron transplants reduce seizures in mice The researchers induced stroke-like brain damage in mice by disrupting blood flow to a specific part of their brains.

""When you give these mice 3K3A-APC, it works much better than stem cells alone,"" said Berislav Zlokovic, MD, PhD, the University of Southern California professor who led the research. ""We showed that 3K3A-APC helps the cells convert into neurons and make structural and functional connections with the host's nervous system."" To confirm that the stem cells were responsible for the animals' improved function, the researchers used a targeted toxin to kill the neurons that had developed from them in another group of mice given the combination therapy. These mice showed the same improved performance on the tests of sensory and motor functions prior to being given the toxin but lost these gains afterwards, suggesting that the neurons that grew from the implanted cells were necessary for the improvements. In a separate experiment, the team examined the connections between the neurons that developed from the stem cells in the damaged brain region and nerve cells in a nearby region, the primary motor cortex. The mice given the stem cells and 3K3A-APC had many more synapses linking these areas than mice given the placebo. In addition, when the team stimulated the mice's paws with a mechanical vibration, the neurons that grew from the stem cells responded much more strongly in the treated animals. Read Next: Unlocking the potential of stem cells to repair brain damage ""That means the transplanted cells are being functionally integrated into the host's brain after treatment with 3K3A-APC,"" Dr. Zlokovic explained.

As a result of the new mouse study, Dr. Zlokovic and his team, including co-first authors Yaoming Wang and Zhen Zhao, now hope to pursue another Phase II clinical trial to test whether the combination of neural stem cell grafts and 3K3A-APC can stimulate the growth of new neurons in human stroke patients to improve function. If that trial succeeds, it may be possible to test the treatment's effects on other neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injuries, for which stem cell therapies are being investigated.

See Also: Parkinson s disease: New insights into a traveling protein Synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, are characterized by the pathological deposition of aggregates of the misfolded  -synuclein protein into inclusions throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Intercellular propagation (from one neuron to the next) of  -synuclein aggregates contributes to the progression of the neuropathology, but little was known about the mechanism by which spread occurs. In this study, scientists from the Membrane Traffic and Pathogenesis Unit, directed by Chiara Zurzolo at the Institut Pasteur, used fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that pathogenic  -synuclein fibrils travel between neurons in culture, inside lysosomal vesicles through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), a new mechanism of intercellular communication. After being transferred via TNTs,  -synuclein fibrils are able to recruit and induce aggregation of the soluble  -synuclein protein in the cytosol of cells receiving the fibrils, thus explaining the propagation of the disease. The scientists propose that cells overloaded with  -synuclein aggregates in lysosomes dispose of this material by hijacking TNT-mediated intercellular trafficking. However, this results in the disease being spread to naive neurons. Learn More: New model recreates early spread of Parkinson s disease in the brain This study demonstrates that TNTs play a significant part in the intercellular transfer of  -synuclein fibrils and reveals the specific role of lysosomes in this process.

This Consortium comprises the University of Glasgow ( the University ), the University of St Andrews, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde ( NHS-GGC ), Metrion Biosciences Ltd ( Metrion ), the Gr nenthal Group ( Gr nenthal ) in Germany, and the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research ( NC3Rs ), with vital support and facilitation by NHS Blood & Transplant (Scotland). The ultimate aim of the project is to enhance research efficiency by putting in place a system whereby high quality and viable human DRG neurons can be supplied to both industrial and academic researchers, thereby partially superseding current methods involving isolated cells or tissues from animals, or in vivo animal testing. Successful implementation of the system will increase our understanding of the human system, facilitating drug target identification and supporting more rapid development of novel pain therapeutics. The Consortium anticipates that the project will lead to the development of a successful human sensory neuronal model for improved mechanistic understanding and compound screening, which will aid in advancing the speed and quality of research into new pain therapeutics. Better understanding of human DRG neurons may also facilitate the development of stem cell-derived sensory neurons for use in high throughput and high content screening of new drug candidates. A successful outcome of the collaboration will also include a contribution to the reduction in the use of animals in pain research.   Metrion is supporting the project as an industrial sponsor alongside Gr nenthal, a family-owned, international research-driven pharmaceutical company headquartered in Aachen, Germany. Metrion is taking over a role previously undertaken by Pfizer-Neusentis, and will be responsible for evaluation and functional characterisation of human nerve cells. The project, entitled  Developing an ethical, sustainable, human sensory neuron cell culture model for use in therapeutic pain research , also known as DRGNET, is headed by the University of Glasgow, which has received funding from the NC3Rs as part of their CRACK IT Challenges open innovation initiative. Supported by NHS Blood & Transplant and integrated into their pathways for life-saving organ retrieval, and only with specific authorisation from donors  families, surgical staff from NHS-GGC will retrieve human DRGs from organ transplant donors, and research staff from the University and their partners will extract viable sensory neurons. Protocol development has been approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (WoSRES). Metrion will undertake functional characterisation of sensory neurons dissociated from fresh human DRGs, in particular the distribution and function of specific ion channels and receptors.   Dr Marc Rogers, Chief Scientific Officer of Metrion, commented:  We are pleased to be asked to join the DRGNET consortium as an industrial sponsor. This opportunity recognises the extensive academic expertise of Metrion s staff in the neuroscience field, and in particular in the application of their knowledge to develop high quality neuronal cell assays that have helped progress several preclinical and clinical drug discovery programs. Combined with the academic and clinical credentials of the other consortium partners, we are confident of contributing to the achievement of the project goals and delivering robust in vitro assays capable of more reliable translation of therapeutic efficacy in human pain clinical trials.  Professor Andrew Hart from the University of Glasgow and NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde said:  We welcome Metrion s involvement in the project, particularly given their highly relevant skillsets, exceptional technical resource, and enthusiastic collaboration that is cogniscent of the ethical sensitivities and responsibility to deliver solid therapeutic progress in pain research that is implicit in the extraordinary generosity of the transplant donors who enable this work with the support of their families.  Dr Vicky Robinson, Chief Executive of the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research said:  We are delighted that Metrion has joined the DRGNET CRACK IT Challenge. The expertise and experience that Metrion brings to the Challenge in validating the human DRG neurons, in addition to that already provided by Gr nenthal, is critical to the success of the programme and ultimately the provision of a new resource for industry and academic scientists that allows them to reduce the use of animals in pain research and drug development.

They have also identified anti-inflammatory treatments that ease some of the patients  symptoms: fever, skin rashes, diarrhoea, joint pain and overall failure to grow or thrive. Otulipenia is caused by the malfunction of OTULIN, a single gene on chromosome 5. When functioning properly, OTULIN regulates the development of new blood vessels and mobilization of cells and proteins to fight infection. NIH researchers published their findings Aug. 22, 2016, in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Contributing to the work were researchers from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the NIH Clinical Center, all part of NIH, along with their colleagues in Turkey and the United Kingdom.  The results have been amazing and life changing for these children and their families,  said Daniel Kastner, M.D., Ph.D., co-author and NHGRI scientific director and head of NHGRI s Inflammatory Disease Section.  We have achieved the important goal of helping these young patients and made progress in understanding the biological pathways and proteins that are important for the regulation of the immune system s responses.  Cells use biological pathways to send and receive chemical cues in reaction to injury, infection or stress. Otulipenia is one of several inflammatory diseases that occur when the immune system attacks the host s own tissues. Inflammation is the body s natural response to invading bacteria or viruses. The body releases chemicals that cause blood vessels to leak and tissues to swell in order to isolate a foreign substance from further contact with the body s tissues. Inflammatory diseases affecting the whole body are caused by mutations in genes like OTULIN that are part of a person s innate immunity (the cells and proteins present at birth that fight infections). An international network of scientists studying inflammatory diseases identified four children from Pakistani and Turkish families with unexplained skin rashes and inflamed joints. NIH scientists then searched for disease-causing genes using next-generation DNA sequencing, technology that allows researchers to sequence DNA quickly and economically. Once they found that the OTULIN gene was abnormal in the sick children, they studied the immune pathway in order to understand the mechanisms of disease and to improve treatment of these patients. They discovered a problem in the processing of a small protein, ubiquitin, which is critical to the regulation of many other proteins in the body, including immune molecules. In the affected children, the inability to remove the ubiquitin proteins from various molecules resulted in an increased production of chemical messengers that lead to inflammation (inflammatory cytokines). The researchers determined that the children with otulipenia might respond to drugs that turned off tumour necrosis factor, a chemical messenger involved in systemic inflammation. Inflammation subsided in the children who had been treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs (TNF inhibitors). TNF inhibitors are also used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.   The malfunction in this protein has not been previously linked to clinical disorders of the human immune system,  said Ivona Aksentijevich, M.D., staff scientist in NHGRI's Medical Genetics Branch and study co-author.  This discovery suggests a direction that can be explored for development of new therapies for patients with a wide range of inflammatory diseases. ","Published: August 23, 2016"

A paper detailing the results has been published in the journal Scientific Reports. Up until the 20th century, tuberculosis was considered an incurable disease and, despite newly developed methods of curing it at its early stages, the death rate is still high. There are 22 countries, including Russia, in which the infection rate is four times greater than in the rest of the world. It is important to note that the term  tuberculosis  covers a wide range of bacteria strains that cause the disease. Strains of the Beijing family (this genotype was first discovered in Beijing) are prevalent in Russia - every year about 150,000 people are infected with it. To understand the reason behind the  success  of this strain, scientists compared proteins produced by Beijing B0/W148 with a control strain.  In order to do this, separated bacterial proteins were enzymatically cleaved into smaller fragments   peptides and their mass and relative abundance were measured precisely using mass spectrometry. After analysing the data collected, the scientists knew which and how many proteins there were in each strain. It was found that in Beijing B0/W148 strains, 266 proteins were differentially abundant compared with the control strain. 57 of them were entirely absent in the study group and 17, on the contrary, were unique to it, others differed quantitatively.  Analysis of the functions associated with differing proteins revealed that in Beijing B0/W148 strains there are more proteins producing long-chain fatty acids and less proteins destroying them. Bacteria use these acids to produce mycolic acids, which integrate themselves in the bacterial cell membrane and make it waxy, which is why mycobacteria can survive and even reproduce in macrophages (special human cells that destroy foreign substances).  Normally, if a bacterium is  eaten  by a macrophage it dies. However, mycobacterium tuberculosis strains have evolved to reproduce in macrophages and in doing so they hide from the immune system. Mycolic acids not only protect bacteria, but also play a crucial role in synthesizing substances that inhibit macrophages so they stop fighting disease. The features of lipid metabolism that have been discovered could explain the success of Beijing B0/W148 strains in relation to other tuberculosis mycobacteria.","Published: August 23, 2016"

A multidisciplinary, international team of researchers from 10 institutions published the results in today s issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics.  Our interest in SON began when one of our patients, who presented with developmental delays, persistent feeding difficulties, and congenital malformations, was going through elaborate genetic testing,  said senior author Dr. Magdalena A. Walkiewicz, an assistant professor of molecular & human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine and assistant laboratory director at Baylor Genetics. Using software tools and algorithms to analyze large amounts of data as well as extensive, detailed clinical descriptions of the patient s features, the researchers sorted through thousands of genes and through variations of the same genes and finally identified a  de novo  mutation in SON. A de novo mutation is one that only affects the patient   it is not passed from the parents to the child. This mutation resulted in a protein, also called SON, which is unable to perform its function.  Usually this is how discovering a gene linked to a disorder starts   you have one patient who has a de novo mutation, then, you do more research and identify additional patients with mutations in the same gene,  said Walkiewicz.  We were able to identify six other children with mutations in the SON gene and they all had the same or very similar features. Literature on the function of the gene led us to believe that this gene is likely relevant to the neurodevelopmental disorder in this children.  First author Dr. Mari J. Tokita, a postdoctoral associate in molecular & human genetics at Baylor has been a driving force behind this project.  One of the most exciting parts of this field for me is to be involved in describing new gene-disease connections,  said Tokita.  I was fortunate to be able to interact very closely with the physicians and genetic counselors involved in the care of these patients, all of whom were incredibly enthusiastic and supportive of this research. As a trainee, I also had the wonderful opportunity to meet several of the patients in person during their clinical visits.  The researchers identify this condition as a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to disease-causing variants in the SON gene. Knowing that this neurodevelopmental disorder is linked to harmful mutations in the SON gene can provide answers to patients who do not have a diagnosis for their condition. ""This discovery allows physicians to identify patients with the disorder throughout the world using genetic testing,  said Walkiewicz.  In addition, physicians would now be able to explain to parents what to expect   to forecast the characteristics of the disorder, how these patients will develop throughout their life and how to plan for their care.  The discovery of the link between mutations in SON and the disorder owes a great deal to significant innovations in molecular technology and testing developed in the last several years, which now provide researchers with more advanced tools to study genetic disorders.  If you have children who have gone through rounds of genetic testing and everything has come back negative, that does not mean that your child does not have a genetic disorder. It is worth bringing those patients back to the clinic, if they have not been seen in the past two or three years,  said senior author Dr. Christian P. Schaaf, an assistant professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor.","Published: August 23, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/converting-isolated-cells-with-gene-editing-191328,Converting Isolated Cells with Gene Editing Researchers have used CRISPR to generate neuronal cells from isolated connective tissue  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers have used CRISPR a revolutionary new genetic engineering technique to convert cells isolated from mouse connective tissue directly into neuronal cells. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka, a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University at the time, discovered how to revert adult connective tissue cells, called fibroblasts, back into immature stem cells that could differentiate into any cell type. These so-called induced pluripotent stem cells won Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in medicine just six years later for their promise in research and medicine. Since then, researchers have discovered other ways to convert cells between different types. This is mostly done by introducing many extra copies of  master switch  genes that produce proteins that turn on entire genetic networks responsible for producing a particular cell type. Now, researchers at Duke University have developed a strategy that avoids the need for the extra gene copies. Instead, a modification of the CRISPR genetic engineering technique is used to directly turn on the natural copies already present in the genome. These early results indicate that the newly converted neuronal cells show a more complete and persistent conversion than the method where new genes are permanently added to the genome. These cells could be used for modelling neurological disorders, discovering new therapeutics, developing personalized medicines and, perhaps in the future, implementing cell therapy. The study was published on August 11, 2016, in the journal Cell Stem Cell.  This technique has many applications for science and medicine. For example, we might have a general idea of how most people s neurons will respond to a drug, but we don t know how your particular neurons with your particular genetics will respond,  said Charles Gersbach, the Rooney Family Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and director for the Center for Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering at Duke.  Taking biopsies of your brain to test your neurons is not an option. But if we could take a skin cell from your arm, turn it into a neuron, and then treat it with various drug combinations, we could determine an optimal personalized therapy.   The challenge is efficiently generating neurons that are stable and have a genetic programming that looks like your real neurons,  says Joshua Black, the graduate student in Gersbach s lab who led the work.  That has been a major obstacle in this area.  In the 1950s, Professor Conrad Waddington, a British developmental biologist who laid the foundations for developmental biology, suggested that immature stem cells differentiating into specific types of adult cells can be thought of as rolling down the side of a ridged mountain into one of many valleys. With each path a cell takes down a particular slope, its options for its final destination become more limited. If you want to change that destination, one option is to push the cell vertically back up the mountain that s the idea behind reprogramming cells to be induced pluripotent stem cells. Another option is to push it horizontally up and over a hill and directly into another valley.  If you have the ability to specifically turn on all the neuron genes, maybe you don t have to go back up the hill,  said Gersbach. Previous methods have accomplished this by introducing viruses that inject extra copies of genes to produce a large number of proteins called master transcription factors. Unique to each cell type, these proteins bind to thousands of places in the genome, turning on that cell type s particular gene network. This method, however, has some drawbacks.  Rather than using a virus to permanently introduce new copies of existing genes, it would be desirable to provide a temporary signal that changes the cell type in a stable way,  said Black.  However, doing so in an efficient manner might require making very specific changes to the genetic program of the cell.  In the new study, Black, Gersbach, and colleagues used CRISPR to precisely activate the three genes that naturally produce the master transcription factors that control the neuronal gene network, rather than having a virus introduce extra copies of those genes. CRISPR is a modified version of a bacterial defence system that targets and slices apart the DNA of familiar invading viruses. In this case, however, the system has been tweaked so that no slicing is involved. Instead, the machinery that identifies specific stretches of DNA has been left intact, and it has been hitched to a gene activator. The CRISPR system was administered to mouse fibroblasts in the laboratory. The tests showed that, once activated by CRISPR, the three neuronal master transcription factor genes robustly activated neuronal genes. This caused the fibroblasts to conduct electrical signals a hallmark of neuronal cells. And even after the CRISPR activators went away, the cells retained their neuronal properties.  When blasting cells with master transcription factors made by viruses, it s possible to make cells that behave like neurons,  said Gersbach.  But if they truly have become autonomously functioning neurons, then they shouldn t require the continuous presence of that external stimulus.  The experiments showed that the new CRISPR technique produced neuronal cells with an epigenetic program at the target genes matching the neuronal markings naturally found in mouse brain tissue.  The method that introduces extra genetic copies with the virus produces a lot of the transcription factors, but very little is being made from the native copies of these genes,  explained Black.  In contrast, the CRISPR approach isn t making as many transcription factors overall, but they re all being produced from the normal chromosomal position, which is a powerful difference since they are stably activated. We re flipping the epigenetic switch to convert cell types rather than driving them to do so synthetically.  The next steps, according to Black, are to extend the method to human cells, raise the efficiency of the technique and try to clear other epigenetic hurdles so that it could be applied to model particular diseases.  In the future, you can imagine making neurons and implanting them in the brain to treat Parkinson s disease or other neurodegenerative conditions,  said Gersbach.  But even if we don t get that far, you can do a lot with these in the lab to help develop better therapies. ","Published: August 23, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/telomere-replenishment-in-real-time-211330,Telomere Replenishment in Real Time Researchers have visualised the process of telomere attachment to chromosomes through single molecule imaging  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Telomerase, a powerful enzyme that acts at the ends of human chromosomes, can keep us healthy, but it can also promote cancer growth. Now, researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have used a process called single-molecule imaging to visualize the process that this enzyme uses to attach itself to the ends of chromosomes. The new understanding could help researchers develop new approaches for treating cancer and other diseases. The findings, which were recently published in the journal Cell, show that telomerase has a small window of opportunity, lasting only minutes, to do its job at the ends of chromosomes. The team was surprised to find that telomerase may probe each telomere thousands of times, rarely forming a stable connection, in order to be successful at connecting to the chromosome end. Researchers believe that inhibiting telomerase from attaching to telomeres in cancer cells is a strategy for treatment of the disease. Telomerase is the enzyme that keeps cells young. From stem cells to germ cells, telomerase helps cells continue to live and multiply. Too little telomerase produces diseases of bone marrow, lungs and skin. Too much telomerase results in cells that over-proliferate and may become  immortal.  As these immortal cells continue to divide and replenish, they build cancerous tumours. Scientists estimate that telomerase activation is a contributor in up to 90 percent of human cancers. Telomeres have been studied since the 1970 s for their role in cancer. They are constructed of repetitive DNA sequences that sit at the ends of our chromosomes like the ribbon tails on a bow. This extra material protects the ends of the chromosomes from deteriorating or from fusing with neighbouring chromosome ends. Telomeres are consumed during cell division and, over time, will become shorter and provide less cover for the chromosomes they are protecting. The enzyme, telomerase, replenishes telomeres throughout their lifecycles.  This discovery changes the way we look at how telomerase recruitment works,  said CU Boulder Distinguished Professor and Nobel laureate Thomas Cech, who is director of CU s BioFrontiers Institute and the lead author on the study.  It s exciting to see this in living cells as it happens. Single-molecule imaging isolates the process, allowing us to study its dynamics.  The research team included co-authors Jens Schmidt, a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation postdoctoral fellow, and Staff Scientist Arthur Zaug. They used CRISPR genome editing and single-molecule imaging to track telomerase s movements in the nuclei of living human cancer cells. CRISPR, or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, allowed the team to attach fluorescent protein tags to telomerase and telomeres in human cancer cells so that the search process was visible under a powerful microscope.  At the end of the day, the goal is to target telomerase as an approach to treat cancer,  said Schmidt.  You can inhibit telomerase across the board, but the challenge is isolating the telomerase in cancer cells from the telomerase participating in the normal processes of healthy cells. This research brings us closer to understanding these processes. ","Published: August 23, 2016"

The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the merger, which is expected to be immediately accretive to Pfizer s Adjusted Diluted EPS upon closing, approximately $0.05 accretive in the first full year after close with additional accretion and growth anticipated thereafter. Pfizer does not expect the transaction to impact its current 2016 financial guidance.  The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,  said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer.  The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term. This transaction is another example of how we are effectively deploying our capital to generate attractive returns and create shareholder value.  Medivation s portfolio includes XTANDI  (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within the tumor cell. XTANDI is the leading novel hormone therapy in the United States today and generated approximately $2.2 billion in worldwide net sales over the past four quarters, as recorded by Astellas Pharma Inc., with whom Medivation entered an agreement in 2009 to develop XTANDI globally and commercialize jointly in the U.S. Since its approval for advanced metastatic prostate cancer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012, XTANDI has treated 64,000 men to date in the U.S. alone. Medivation and Astellas have built a robust development program for XTANDI, including two Phase 3 studies in non-metastatic prostate cancer and another Phase 3 study in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. It is also being further developed in Phase 2 studies for the potential treatment of advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, Medivation has a promising, wholly-owned, late-stage oncology pipeline, which includes two development-stage oncology assets, talazoparib and pidilizumab. Talazoparib, currently in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of BRCA-mutated breast cancer, has the potential to be a highly potent PARP inhibitor and could be efficacious across several additional tumors. Pidilizumab is an immuno-oncology (IO) asset being developed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies and has the potential to be combined with IO therapies in Pfizer s portfolio.  We believe the combination with Pfizer is the right next step in our growth trajectory and is a testament to the passion and dedication by which the Medivation team has delivered on our mission to profoundly transform patients  lives through medically innovative therapies,  said David Hung, M.D., founder, president and CEO of Medivation.  This compelling transaction will deliver significant and immediate value to our stockholders and provides new opportunities for our employees as part of a larger company. We believe that Pfizer is the ideal partner to extend the reach of our blockbuster XTANDI franchise and take our promising, late-stage assets   talazoparib and pidiluzimab   to their next stages of development so that they can be made available to patients as quickly as possible.   The proposed acquisition of Medivation will build upon Pfizer s success with our IBRANCE  (palbociclib) launch in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and with our strong immuno-oncology portfolio, and will transform Pfizer into a leading oncology company,  said Albert Bourla, group president, Pfizer Innovative Health.  IBRANCE and XTANDI are anchor brands in breast and prostate cancer respectively, giving Pfizer leadership in two hormone-driven cancers. Similar to IBRANCE in the breast cancer setting, XTANDI is being explored for its potential to move from metastatic prostate cancer to treat earlier stages of non-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, Medivation s portfolio within prostate cancer and across diverse tumors will complement Pfizer s broad IO portfolio. Finally, Medivation adds commercial scale to better compete with other top tier oncology companies in advance of the potential emergence of Pfizer s IO pipeline expected in the next few years. Together, we believe Pfizer and Medivation can bring the full force of our combined research and resources to combat two of the most common cancers, as well as speed cures and make accessible breakthrough medicines to patients, redefining life with cancer.  Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the U.S. and a  Top 10  killer worldwide. According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer and prostate cancer are among the top three cancers by annual incidence in the U.S. There are several parallels between breast and prostate cancer, including the incidence of prostate cancer in the U.S., which is similar to that of breast cancer with approximately 280,000 cases per year. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Medivation common stock for $81.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any required withholding of taxes. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including U.S. antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Medivation common stock. The merger agreement contemplates that Pfizer will acquire any shares of Medivation that are not tendered into the offer through a second-step merger, which will be completed promptly following the closing of the tender offer. Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the Third- or Fourth-Quarter 2016.","Published: August 23, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/eye-colour-determines-cancer-risk-194230,Eye Colour Determines Cancer Risk Researchers report first findings of a link between eye pigment gene and uveal melanoma development  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. New research links specific inherited genetic differences (alterations) to an increased risk for eye (uveal) melanoma, a rare form of melanoma that arises from pigment cells that determine eye color. Roughly 2,500 people are diagnosed with uveal melanoma in the United States annually. Previous clinical data suggests uveal melanoma is more common in Caucasians and individuals with light eye coloration; however, the genetic mechanisms underlying this cancer s development were largely unknown. In this new study, scientists report the first evidence of a strong association between genes linked to eye color and development of uveal melanoma. Reported data suggests that inherited genetic factors associated with eye and skin pigmentation could increase a person s risk for uveal melanoma. Abdel-Rahman, Kirchhoff and team report their findings in the medical journal Scientific Reports.   This is a very important discovery that will guide future research efforts to explore the interactions of these pigmentary genes with other genetic and environmental risk factors in cancers not linked to sun exposure, such as eye melanoma. This could provide a paradigm shift in the field. Our study suggests that in eye melanoma the pigmentation difference may play a direct cancer-driving role, not related to sunlight protection,  says Abdel-Rahman. Unlike other solid tumors, there has been limited progress in understanding the contribution of genetic risk factors to the development of uveal melanoma, researchers say, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive genetic data from patients as the large sample cohorts for this rare cancer type have not been available for research. To overcome these limitations, researchers analyzed samples from more than 270 patients with uveal melanoma, most of which were treated at Ohio State.  Because there is a known clinical connection between eye melanoma and skin cancer, in this study researchers sought to determine whether there were commonly shared genetic risk factors between both diseases, as the inherited genetic risk of skin melanoma has been more extensively explored in previous medical literature. The team analyzed 29 inherited genetic mutations previously linked with skin melanoma to determine if there was an associated risk of uveal melanoma. This analysis revealed that five genetic mutations were significantly associated with uveal melanoma risk. The three most significant genetic associations occurred in a genetic region that determines eye color.  Genetic susceptibility to uveal melanoma has been traditionally thought to be restricted only to a [sic] small groups of patients with family history. Now our strong data shows the presence of novel genetic risk factors associated with this disease in a general population of uveal melanoma patients,  says Kirchhoff.  But this data is also important because it indicates -- for the first time -- that there is a shared genetic susceptibility to both skin and uveal melanoma mediated by genetic determination of eye color. This knowledge may have direct implications in the deeper molecular understanding of both diseases,  adds Kirchhoff. Researchers expect the data presented in this study to fuel the formation of large national and international research consortiums to conduct comprehensive, systematic analysis of inherited (germline) genome data in large cohorts of uveal melanoma patients.  This type of collaboration is critically needed to dissect additional modifying genetic risk factors that may be uveal melanoma specific. This has important consequences not only for the prevention or early diagnosis of the disease but potentially for more improved therapies for at-risk patients,  says Kirchhoff.  Federal funding will be crucial to support research of rare cancers such as eye melanoma as it is likely, as shown in this study, that the impact of such research will extend across the different cancer types,  adds Abdel-Rahman.

A team of researchers has developed a therapeutic technique that dramatically increases the production of nerve cells in mice with stroke-induced brain damage.The therapy relies on the combination of two methods that show promise as treatments for stroke-induced neurological injury. The first consists of surgically grafting human neural stem cells into the damaged area, where they mature into neurons and other brain cells. The second involves administering a compound called 3K3A-APC, which the scientists have shown helps neural stem cells grown in a petri dish develop into neurons. However, it was unclear what effect the molecule, derived from a human protein called activated protein-C (APC), would have in live animals. A month after their strokes, mice that had received both the stem cells and 3K3A-APC performed significantly better on tests of motor and sensory functions compared to mice that received neither or only one of the treatments. In addition, many more of the stem cells survived and matured into neurons in the mice given 3K3A-APC.  This USC-led animal study could pave the way for a potential breakthrough in how we treat people who have experienced a stroke,  added Jim Koenig, Ph.D., a program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), which funded the research.  If the therapy works in humans, it could markedly accelerate the recovery of these patients.  The researchers induced stroke-like brain damage in mice by disrupting blood flow to a specific part of their brains. One week later   the equivalent of several months in humans   the team inserted the stem cells next to the dead tissue and then gave the mice several infusions of either a placebo or 3K3A-APC.  When you give these mice 3K3A-APC, it works much better than stem cells alone,  said Berislav Zlokovic, M.D., Ph.D., the University of Southern California professor who led the research.  We showed that 3K3A-APC helps the cells convert into neurons and make structural and functional connections with the host s nervous system.  To confirm that the stem cells were responsible for the animals  improved function, the researchers used a targeted toxin to kill the neurons that had developed from them in another group of mice given the combination therapy. These mice showed the same improved performance on the tests of sensory and motor functions prior to being given the toxin but lost these gains afterwards, suggesting that the neurons that grew from the implanted cells were necessary for the improvements. In a separate experiment, the team examined the connections between the neurons that developed from the stem cells in the damaged brain region and nerve cells in a nearby region called the primary motor cortex. The mice given the stem cells and 3K3A-APC had many more neuronal connections, called synapses, linking these areas than mice given the placebo. In addition, when the team stimulated the mice s paws with a mechanical vibration, the neurons that grew from the stem cells responded much more strongly in the treated animals.  That means the transplanted cells are being functionally integrated into the host s brain after treatment with 3K3A-APC,  Dr. Zlokovic explained.  No one in the stroke field has ever shown this, so I believe this is going to be the gold standard for future studies.  3K3A-APC is currently being studied in a NINDS-funded Phase II clinical trial to determine if it can reduce the death of neurons deprived of blood flow immediately following a stroke. As a result of the new mouse study, Dr. Zlokovic and his team, including co-first authors Yaoming Wang and Zhen Zhao, now hope to pursue another Phase II clinical trial to test whether the combination of neural stem cell grafts and 3K3A-APC can stimulate the growth of new neurons in human stroke patients to improve function. If that trial succeeds, it may be possible to test the treatment s effects on other neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injuries, for which stem cell therapies are being investigated. The study was supported by the NIH (NS090904, NS075345, HL052246, HL031950) with additional funding provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Adelson Medical Research Foundation, the New York State Stem Cell Research Board, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Lundbeck Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the ALS Association. The NINDS is the nation s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.

The molecule, beta 1 adrenergic receptor, is a member of a class of cell surface receptor proteins whose primary functions are to convert extracellular stimuli into intracellular signals. In the study, published online in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers found that this receptor mediates release of ghrelin by cells in the stomach. Ghrelin, known as the hunger hormone since the protein stimulates appetite and is produced before meals, also prevents dangerously low blood sugar levels, or hypoglycemia. The hormone acts as a natural antidepressant as well.  When beta 1 adrenergic receptors are removed from the ghrelin-producing cells of laboratory mice, the animals exhibit a marked reduction in circulating ghrelin levels,  said study senior author Dr. Jeffrey Zigman, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Psychiatry at UT Southwestern.  The effects of this reduction become apparent when the mice are placed on a calorie-restricted diet and include severe hypoglycemia and, as a result, reduced survival.  The involvement of beta 1 adrenergic receptors in this process may be particularly relevant to children prescribed beta blocker drugs to treat conditions such as irregular heart rhythms or infantile hemangioma, an abnormal collection of blood vessels that may cause  strawberry  marks on the skin. Beta blockers work by binding to and inhibiting beta 1 adrenergic receptors. While these drugs usually are not associated with adult hypoglycemia, they have been linked to marked drops in blood sugar levels of young children taking them, especially during periods of acute illness or decreased food intake. These reports of hypoglycemia in children taking beta blockers led to development of best practice standards, with the goal of increasing awareness of and avoiding this life-threatening condition. Motivated by these cases of hypoglycemia in children and by the findings of hypoglycemia in calorie-restricted mice lacking beta 1 adrenergic receptors in ghrelin-producing cells, Dr. Zigman s team sought to answer the question: Is there a connection between hypoglycemia and the reduced ghrelin release caused by beta blocker treatment? In its research, the team reproduced hypoglycemia in young laboratory mice treated with beta blockers and then fasted overnight, a result similar to that found in children prescribed these drugs. Furthermore, the team demonstrated low levels of ghrelin in the mice.  Based on our data, we would predict that suppression of ghrelin release by beta blockers acting on ghrelin-producing cells likely is responsible for the hypoglycemia that children treated with beta blockers sometimes experience,  said Dr. Zigman, who holds the Diana and Richard C. Strauss Professorship in Biomedical Research and the Mr. and Mrs. Bruce G. Brookshire Professorship in Medicine.  For as yet unknown reasons, most adults taking beta blockers don t exhibit problems with low blood sugar, and neither did our adult laboratory mice.  Besides young children, Dr. Zigman said other groups that could be susceptible to hypoglycemia as a result of beta blocker-induced or other causes of reduced ghrelin production include those with muscle and fat wasting   cachexia   and people with anorexia nervosa. Other UT Southwestern researchers who contributed to this study included lead author Dr. Bharath Mani, a postdoctoral researcher; Sherri Osborne-Lawrence, senior research scientist, Prasanna Vijayaraghavan, a former research assistant, and Chelsea Hepler, a graduate student.

Typical MRIs don t reliably distinguish between zinc levels in healthy, malignant, and benign hyperplastic prostate tissue, so discovery of the technique could eventually prove useful as a biomarker to track the progression of prostate cancer, according to researchers with the Advanced Imaging Research Center, part of UT Southwestern s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  This research provides the basis for differentiating healthy prostate from prostate cancer by use of a novel Zn(II) ion sensing molecule and MRI,  said senior author Dr. A. Dean Sherry, Director of the Advanced Imaging Research Center and Professor of Radiology at UT Southwestern. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The potential for translating this method to human clinical imaging is very good, and will be useful for diagnostic purposes. The method may prove useful for monitoring therapies used to treat prostate cancer,  said Dr. Sherry, who is also Professor of Chemistry at UT Dallas, where he holds the Cecil and Ida Green Distinguished Chair in Systems Biology. The majority of prostate cancers are classified as adenocarcinomas and originate in epithelial cells. The UTSW researchers initially determined that glucose stimulates release of the zinc ions from inside epithelial cells, which they could then track on MRIs. The prostate cancer tissue secreted lower levels of zinc ions, offering an opportunity to distinguish between malignant and healthy tissue. When they tested the technique on mouse models, they were able to successfully detect small malignant lesions as early as 11 weeks, making the non-invasive imaging procedure a potentially useful method for detecting the disease and its progression.  Prostate cancer often has no early symptoms, so identifying potential new diagnostic methods that might catch the cancer at an earlier stage or allow us to track how it is progressing is an important opportunity,  said co-author Dr. Neil Rofsky, Chairman of Radiology, Director of Translational Research for the Advanced Imaging Research Center, and holder of the Effie and Wofford Cain Distinguished Chair in Diagnostic Imaging. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, after skin cancer, and is the second leading cause of death from cancer in men, according to the National Cancer Institute. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men, who are more likely to die from the disease. Researchers with the Advanced Imaging Research Center are world leaders in developing new MRI tracers, which are non-radioactive, and techniques to reveal the aberrant machinery of cancer, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and diseases of the heart, lung, and liver. As part of UT Southwestern s Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, the scientists are also mapping the brain in unprecedented detail, offering researchers new understanding of the normal brain and abnormal brain as found in subjects with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses only harmless magnetic fields and radio waves, is one of the most benign technologies in medicine for studying and diagnosing medical disorders, enabling researchers to view diseases that afflict millions of people, without the need for surgery, X-rays, or radioactive tracers. Support for this latest research came from grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute through the Harold C.

Findings from the study were published recently in PLoS One. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified The researchers treated 10-day-old mice that had incurred hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (caused by a decrease in blood flow and oxygen to the brain, as occurs during a stroke) with a fat emulsion containing either DHA or EPA--omega-3 fatty acids that are found in certain foods and in supplements. The researchers evaluated the mice's neurological function 24 hours and 8 to 9 weeks after the brain injury. EPA and DHA are bioactive omega-3 fatty acids that are found in oils extracted from cold-water fish. The CUMC researchers and other scientists have shown that these fish-oil fatty acids protect organs and cells in numerous ways after oxygen deprivation, reducing inflammation and cell death. At 24 hours, mice treated with DHA, but not EPA, had a significant reduction in brain injury. In the following weeks, the DHA group also had significantly better results in multiple brain functions compared to the EPA-treated mice and untreated (control) mice. The researchers also discovered that these mice had increased concentrations of DHA in their brain mitochondria, energy-producing structures in cells that can be injured by free radicals when blood flow is restored to the brain after a stroke. This process, known as reperfusion injury, is a common cause of brain damage following the oxygen and nutrient deprivation that occurs after a stroke.

Lesions caused by traumatic brain damage, stroke and functional decline due to aging processes can disrupt the complex cellular network that constitutes the central nervous system, and lead to chronic pathologies, such as dementia, epilepsy and deleterious metabolic perturbations. ""How exactly this happens is completely unknown,"" says Dr. Ali Ert rk, who heads a research group at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit t M nchen (LMU) Medical Center. See Also: Researchers open  Golden Window  in deep brain imaging Ert rk and his team previously developed and have now refined a novel imaging technique that allows them to visualize and monitor these structural alterations in neuronal networks. The new findings appear in the journal Nature Methods. Many neurons in the brainstem possess axons that project as far as the base of the spinal column. Thus damage to these axons can affect the function of parts of the central nervous system that are remote from the actual site of injury. The new imaging method is based on a clearing-and-shrinkage procedure that can render whole organs and organisms transparent, making for instance the full length of the rodent spinal cord accessible to optical imaging. Moreover, the technique is applicable down to the level of individual cells, which are labeled with fluorescent protein tags and can be visualized under the microscope by irradiating them with visible light. This enables researchers to map complex neuronal networks in rodents in 3D, a significant step in revealing the enigma behind the human brain. Because essentially all cell types including immune cells and tumor cells can be specifically labeled with the aid of appropriate fluorescent markers or antibodies, the new method can be employed in a broad range of biomedical settings.

A team headed by Qun-Yong Zhou, UCI professor of pharmacology, examined the day/night patterns of monkeys (diurnal) and mice (nocturnal) and found that although both process light through the eyes in a similar way, the signals that determine sleep/awake modes are sent to the brain via different routes and produce completely opposite sleep/awake patterns. See Also: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions ""Since humans are diurnal, this has clear implications for potential novel treatment of certain sleep or mood disorders,"" said Zhou, the study's lead author. The results appear in Molecular Brain. Sleep/awake patterns are among the basic physiological functions in virtually all organisms that are governed by circadian rhythms. These fundamental time-tracking systems anticipate environmental changes and adapt to the appropriate time of day. Zhou and his colleagues discovered that the sleep/awake switch exists in the eyes within the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, or ipRGC. Previously, a brain region called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, was believed to house the master clock that keeps the body on an approximately 24-hour schedule. The current findings give the eyes a more central role in the control of the sleep/awake cycle. In the nocturnal mice, ipRGC and SCN appear to function similarly, and either could serve as the timekeeper. But in the diurnal monkeys, the eyes' ipRGC seems to be dominant. ""Considering the long-held view of SCN as the master clock for our circadian rhythms, the idea that the eyes or particularly ipRGC are the commander in chief is somewhat surprising,"" Zhou said. ""But it makes logical sense, as diurnal mammals are visually driven. The eyes not only guide us around during our wakefulness time, but they also dictate when we go to sleep."" Read Next: Setting the circadian clock It had been thought that distinct switches triggered after signaling to the SCN generated completely opposite sleep/awake patterns during day and night for diurnal and nocturnal creatures. But no such different switches have been found. Instead, Zhou and his fellow researchers discovered that the sleep/awake control mechanism differs in monkeys and mice before signaling to the SCN, in the neural circuitry controlling sleep and wakefulness. A novel but elegantly designed bifurcation of ipRGC to brain centers produces the inverse sleep/awake patterns for the monkeys and mice. In mice, ipRGC, via connection to the SCN, signals the animals to sleep during daytime. In monkeys, this stay-put message from the ipRGC-SCN pathway is overpowered by signals from a more dominant clock pathway of ipRGC to a midbrain structure called the superior colliculus that tell the animals to be awake during daytime. These findings challenge the long-presumed master role of the suprachiasmatic clock in all mammals. At least in monkeys and possibly in humans and other diurnal species ipRGC may be more important than the suprachiasmatic clock in determining when to be active and when to sleep. Learn More: Scientists discover protein that controls the strength of body's circadian rhythms ""Our thinking makes evolutionary sense as well,"" Zhou said. ""Early mammals, during the dinosaur age, are believed to have been nocturnal, and diurnal species came later. It is completely logical that this diurnality co-evolved with the vision dominance of diurnal mammals via the expansion of the wake-promoting ipRGC-superior colliculus pathway and the simultaneous diminishment of the sleep-promoting ipRGC-SCN pathway. Thus, light puts mice to sleep, but it wakes up monkeys and other diurnal mammals."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, show for the first time that morphine tolerance is due to an inflammatory response produced in the brain. This brain inflammation is caused by the release of cytokines, chemical messengers in the body that trigger an immune response, similar to a viral infection. See Also: Studies: Addiction starts with an overcorrection in the brain Researchers' results show blocking a particular cytokine eliminated morphine tolerance, and they were able to reduce the dose of morphine required to alleviate pain by half. ""These results have important clinical implications for the treatment of pain and also addiction,"" said Lori Eidson, lead author and a graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. Anne Murphy in the Neuroscience Institute of Georgia State. ""Until now, the precise underlying mechanism for opioid tolerance and its prevention have remained unknown."" Over 67 percent of the United States population will experience chronic pain at some point in their lives. Morphine is the primary drug used to manage severe and chronic pain, with 3 to 4 percent of adults in the U.S. receiving long-term opioid therapy. However, tolerance to morphine, defined as a decrease in pain relief over time, significantly impedes treatment for about 60 percent of patients. Long-term treatment with opioids is associated with increased risk of abuse, dependence and fatal overdoses. In the absence of pain, morphine interferes with the body's ability to maintain normal function, referred to as homeostasis. Anything that interferes with homeostasis is viewed by the body as a pathogen, resulting in an immune response to rid the body of the pathogen. When Eidson gave rats drugs that blocked the immune response, the rats no longer became tolerant to morphine.

With the development of optogenetics, researchers can study the function of specific neurons by turning them on and off with light under various conditions. See Also: New mapping approach lets scientists zoom in and out as the brain processes sound Translating the rules governing the functional organization of neural circuits requires knowledge of the synaptic connections among identified classes of neurons as well as the strength and dynamics of these connections. Researchers from Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) optimized optogenetics to map the neural circuits of the brain of rodents with single neuron resolution. Optogenetics is a technique that combines genetics and optics to control neuronal activity, which is based on the discovery of light-sensitive membrane channels within pond algae that control movement in response to light. When genes that produce one such light-sensitive membrane channel, called channelrhodopsin (ChR), are inserted into neurons and subsequently exposed to light, they regulate the flow of ions across cell membranes, increasing the neuron's activity. This allows scientists to discretely control neuronal activity by using pulses of light to activate specific populations of neurons. Read Next: New brain mapping reveals unknown cell types Optogenetics is leveraged for mapping connections in the brain by stimulating individual neurons with light and recording the responses of nearby neurons with an electrode. In this manner, scientists ask whether stimulation of a putative presynaptic neuron causes a response in the putative postsynaptic neuron being monitored by the electrode. When ChRs are inserted into neurons using genetic techniques, however, their expression occurs throughout the entire surface of the neuron, from dendrites, the parts of the neuron that receive information, to the axon, the part of the neuron that sends information. The fact that ChR expression is not restricted to one particular domain of the neuron limits the information researchers can collect and interpret about synaptic connectivity, since it can be difficult to determine whether ChR stimulation was generated in a protein located in that neuron's cell body, or in the axon terminal or in the dendrites of other cells that happen to be passing through the light-stimulated area. Published in eLife, the researchers which include Christopher Baker, PhD and McLean Bolton, PhD both from MPFI, described how they optimize optogenetic methods for mapping neural circuits in the brain. Their improved method uses optical techniques to confine light stimulation to a defined disc-like shape deep within living tissue, combined with a genetic approach for spatial restriction of ChR expression to the cell body and proximal dendrites of neurons. The spatially restricted ChR expression allows unmasking of synaptic connections from neurons whose cell bodies lie close to the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell that would have been occluded by direct activation of ChR on its dendrites. Moreover, it ensures that when light stimulation is applied to a particular cell, any recorded responses can reliably be assigned to the activity of that cell and not to the stimulation of axons or dendrites of other cells that happen to be passing within the disc of light stimulation. This method is a reliable way to rapidly evaluate synaptic connectivity with single neuron resolution and also offers enhanced specificity for other experiments involving optogenetic manipulations. Learn More: Mapping neurons to improve the treatment of Parkinson'sAccording to Dr. Bolton, their goal is to construct precise maps revealing the functional connectivity of synapses, without the loss of information that limits the current optogenetics method.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/vortex-ring-freezing-applications-213756,Vortex Ring Freezing Applications Accidental lab discovery could aid cell delivery and cell free protein production  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Some of the world s most important discoveries   penicillin, vulcanized rubber and Velcro, to name a few   were made by accident. In fact, it s been said that upward of half of all scientific discoveries are by chance. Add vortex ring freezing to that long list of  accidents.  Duo An, a doctoral student in the labs of both professor Dan Luo and assistant professor Minglin Ma, in the Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering, was an undergraduate from China doing an internship at Cornell when he stumbled upon a phenomenon that has the potential to greatly improve cell-free protein production and cell delivery, particularly for Type 1 diabetes patients. A group headed by Luo and Ma has published the paper,  Mass production of shaped particles through vortex ring freezing,  which was released online Aug. 4 in Nature Communications and which An is lead author. Vortex rings are ubiquitous in nature   a mushroom cloud of smoke is one example   and the ring s evolution exhibits a rich spectrum of complicated geometries, from spherical to teardrop to toroidal (doughnut-shaped). The researchers used these features to control and mass produce inorganic and organic particles via an electrospraying process, whereby a multitude of vortex ring-derived particles (VRPs) can be produced, then frozen at precise time points. The group reported they could produce 15,000 rings per minute via electrospraying. They found controlling the shape and speed of the spray, as well as the speed of the chemical reaction, can yield different structures.  We can tune both of these timescales, and control at which stage we can freeze the structure, to get the results we want,  An said. While working in Luo s lab during a summer internship, An was making nanoclay hydrogels   injecting one solution into another to create a gel. But for this particular procedure, instead of direct injection, he dripped one solution into another. When the first solution entered the second, it created vortex-ring particles. It wasn t until two years later, while working in Ma s lab, that he recalled the vortex rings he d created and wondered if that concept could be applied to Ma s work with microcapsules and cell therapy. The Ma lab focuses on cell delivery for Type 1 diabetes patients. Ma admitted that the concept of using a doughnut-shaped encapsulation hadn t occurred to him, but made perfect sense.  We knew the concept that a doughnut shape is better, but we never thought of making it until we saw it [from An],  Ma said. An advantage of the doughnut-shape encapsulation over a spherical-shaped one is shorter diffusion distance   the distance the encapsulated particle must travel to escape the capsule   while at the same time maintaining a relatively large surface area. This concept could pave the way for other as-yet-unknown applications of vortex ring freezing, according to Luo.  Our hope is that this type of material in these shapes can be used much more extensively in other labs for whatever they re trying to do,  he said.  There is a whole field devoted to just particles, but by default, they are all thinking in terms of spherical particles. Hopefully, this will add to that field of study.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/pinpointing-key-influenzafighting-immune-trigger-205421,Pinpointing Key Influenza Fighting Immune Trigger  Immunologists have identified the protein trigger that recognises influenza virus infection in cells and triggers their death  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. St. Jude Children s Research Hospital immunologists have identified the protein trigger in the body s quick-reaction innate immune system that specifically recognizes the influenza virus in infected cells and triggers their death. The researchers said that identifying this virus sensor, called ZBP1, offers the hope of developing drugs to protect against influenza s sometimes lethal complication of pneumonia. The pneumonia is exacerbated by lung inflammation and cell damage caused by overreaction of the innate immune system. Such drugs would modulate ZBP1 s action allowing the body to fight the virus by killing infected cells, but preventing that overreaction. The team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings today in the journal Science Immunology. First author on the paper was Teneema Kuriakose, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research associate in the Kanneganti laboratory. Their research sought to understand how the body s innate immune system is alerted to the presence of the virus and mobilizes to trigger infected cells to commit suicide. The innate immune system triggers the body s  emergency response  to invaders such as infections. This rapid attack gives the body s adaptive immune system time to generate antibodies that specifically target the virus or bacterium. Flu vaccines train this adaptive immune system to attack specific viral strains. In the studies led by Kanneganti, Kuriakose and colleagues first sought to identify the specific machinery that the innate immune system uses to induce cell suicide. They identified that machinery as a biological pathway controlled by type I interferon. Once the scientists identified that pathway, they began to search for the protein molecule that actually recognizes the virus and triggers the cell death machinery. Their experiments used cells from genetically altered mouse strains, in which genes for particular proteins are selectively removed, to discover whether the cells lacking that protein would commit suicide when infected with influenza. To their surprise, researchers found that cells lacking a protein called ZBP1 were completely resistant to viral-induced cell death. The finding was surprising because ZBP1 was known to sense foreign DNA in the cell, but the influenza virus uses RNA as its genetic material.  Our discovery was totally unexpected,  said Kanneganti.  We never thought we would actually identify this molecule to be important in influenza viral infection, because there is no DNA stage in the influenza life cycle.  Further experiments revealed that ZBP1 was, indeed, a  master assassin  in the cell, responsible for triggering three separate cell death pathways. In another surprise, the researchers discovered that ZBP1 was specific for recognizing influenza. The sensor did not trigger cell death in response to other similar viruses or to bacteria. This specificity is surprising, because the innate immune system is a generic emergency responder its attack machinery evolved to thwart a wide array of invaders. Other experiments revealed that ZBP1 acts as a protein detector, not a DNA detector, sensing telltale viral-produced proteins in the infected cell. Moving their studies from cells to whole animals, the researchers tested the effects of knocking out the Zbp1 gene in mice infected with influenza. Because the innate immune system wasn t killing off infected cells, the mice showed an increased viral load and delayed recovery. But because the immune system wasn t able to overreact, the mice showed reduced lung inflammation and damage to lung cells and were protected from mortality.  Since the pathology that we saw in the mice matches what is seen in humans, we will now explore translating these findings to humans,  Kanneganti said.  If we can somehow modulate the activation of this pathway, then that will help to decrease the exaggerated inflammatory response that causes mortality during influenza infection.  The timing of such drug treatment would be critical, Kuriakose said.  ZBP1 does an amazing job of killing off infected cells. But it would be very useful to modulate ZBP1 in later stages of the infection, when the uncontrolled inflammation causes damage.  Kanneganti emphasized that their discoveries have fundamental importance, because they identify a key innate immune sensor that recognizes the influenza virus and a regulator of multiple cell death pathways. These details are basic to our understanding of biological pathways of the innate immune system.  We have shown that these molecules are important in viral infections, but now we want to test their role in other inflammatory conditions,  she said.  ZBP1 is likely not dedicated to attacking only the influenza virus. Maybe it also plays other roles, and if we fully understand those roles, we can learn how to manipulate immune responses.

Their work, published online Aug. 18 in the journal Science, could help to reveal new structural details for a range of challenging molecules including complex chemical compounds and potentially new drugs by stabilizing them inside sturdy structures known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The researchers introduced a series of different molecules that were chemically bound inside these porous MOFs, each measuring about 100 millionths of a meter across, and then used X-ray techniques to determine the precise molecular structure of the samples inside the MOFs. The samples ranged from a simple alcohol to a complex plant hormone, and the new method, dubbed  CAL  for covalent alignment (the molecules form a type of chemical bond known as a covalent bond in the MOFs), enables researchers to determine the complete structure of a molecule from a single MOF crystal that contains the sample molecules in its pores. The MOFs in the study, which are identical and are easy to manufacture in large numbers, provided a sort of backbone for the sample molecules that held them still for the X-ray studies the molecules otherwise can be wobbly and difficult to stabilize. The researchers prepared the samples by dipping the MOFs into solutions containing different molecular mixes and then heating them until they crystallized.  We wanted to demonstrate that any of these molecules, no matter how complex, can be incorporated and their structure determined inside the MOFs,  said Omar Yaghi, a materials scientist at Berkeley Lab and chemistry professor at UC Berkeley who led the research. The MOFs also possess a particular handedness known as  chirality like a left-handed person vs. a right-handed person that selectively binds with molecular samples that also possess this handedness. The difference in a molecule s handedness is particularly important for pharmaceuticals, as it can mean the difference between a medicine and a poison.  This is one of the holy grails: how to crystallize complex molecules, and to determine their chirality,  Yaghi said. Seungkyu Lee and Eugene A. Kapustin, Berkeley Lab researchers and UC Berkeley graduate students who participated in the latest work, said hard-to-study proteins, such as those important for drug development, are high-priority targets for the new technique.  We are aiming for those molecules that have never been crystallized before,  Kapustin said.  That s our next step. So we cannot only show the arrangement of atoms, but also the handedness of molecules, in which pharmaceutical companies are interested.  One of the best methods for studying any molecule s 3-D structure in atomic detail is to form it into a crystal. Then, researchers point intense X-ray light at the crystal, which produces a pattern of spots like light off of a disco ball. Such patterns serve as a fingerprint for fully mapping the molecule s 3-D structure. Some molecules are difficult to form into crystals, though, and the process of crystallizing a single molecule can in some cases involve years of effort and expense.  To crystallize a molecule typically involves a trial-and-error method,  Yaghi said.  Every chemist and biologist has to submit to this process. But in this MOF material you don t need all that it traps the molecule and orders it. It s a way to bypass that trial-and-error approach to crystallography.  Different types of MOFs, with different pore sizes, could be tested to find out which ones work best with different types of samples, Lee said. Importantly, the MOFs in the latest study did not appear to distort the natural, intact structure of the molecules. Researchers say it s possible to determine the complete 3-D structure of a molecule even if the samples only fill about 30 percent of a MOF s pores. Researchers determined the atomic structure of the MOFs and the bound molecules with X-rays at Berkeley Lab s Advanced Light Source (ALS), and they also studied the MOFs using a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at Berkeley Lab s Molecular Foundry. In all, the researchers studied 16 different molecules bound inside the MOF pores, including a plant hormone called jasmonic acid whose chiral structure had never been directly determined before, other plant hormones known as gibberellins, methanol, and other acids and alcohols.The metals in the MOF framework itself can actually serve to enhance the quality of the X-ray images, Kapustin said, adding that in one case the technique allowed researchers to distinguish between two nearly identical plant hormones based on the difference in a single atomic bond. Researchers could see structural details down to hundredths of a nanometer less than the diameter of some atoms.  You can see with such precision whether it is a double bond or a single bond, or if this is a carbon atom or some other atom,  Lee said.  Once you bind a molecule in the MOF, you can learn the absolute structure very precisely since the chirality of the MOF serves as a reference during the structure refinement.

In particular, one question relevant to future drug discovery has puzzled scientists: how does Nature make these molecules? A study from scientists on the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) has now filled in a missing piece of the evolutionary puzzle, determining a previously unknown structure of a family of proteins that are crucial for making these compounds. Terpenoids, mostly produced by plants, are a family of molecules that encompass some of the most well-known and successful drugs derived from natural sources, for example the cancer treatment Taxol . In total, there are more than 65,000 known terpenoids. Natural compounds, such as terpenoids, are typically made by numerous enzymes that stitch the parts together, like building a model from Lego . In the new study, the team focused on enzymes known as terpene synthases, which are found in both plants and bacteria. The study, led by TSRI Professor Ben Shen, was recently published online ahead of print by the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In addition to the advance in the structural biology of this class of proteins, the new findings could also affect drug discovery, making engineering of these proteins, and thus the compounds they make, easier in the future. Using x-ray crystallography freezing the atomic structure of a protein, then bombarding it with x-rays to create a snapshot of it Shen and his colleagues developed a detailed structural model that provides a far better understanding of bacterial diterpene synthases and how this class of enzymes work in a natural setting.  What we found out is that the bacterial version is structurally very similar to the plant version and may support the idea of a gene fusion event that created the bifunctional plant enzymes,  said TSRI Research Associate Jeffrey Rudolf, a co-first author of the paper with TSRI Research Associate Liao-Bin Dong.  We were also able to map which parts of the enzyme are important, giving us an idea of how to engineer the protein for structural diversity.  Dong added,  This new information not only allows us to engineer structural diversity into both bacterial and plant terpenoids, it also helps us identify new diterpenoids of bacterial origin, which are rare and could lead to exciting new natural compounds with interesting biological activities.

The Zika virus contains 10 proteins, but only NS4A and NS4B matter when it comes to microcephaly, according to a USC-led study published in the journal Cell Stem Cell on Aug. 11. These miscreant proteins, researchers discovered, have two shared life goals: to handicap fetal brain formation and to mobilize their malevolent forces. Researchers said they are the first to examine three strains of Zika in second trimester human fetal neural stem cells. Previous studies created tiny neural stem cell organoids from adult origin. The USC-led study, a collaborative effort between the virology and neurobiology disciplines, is also the first to examine Zika virus on the molecular level, said Jae Jung, senior corresponding author and distinguished professor and chair of the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.  We now know the molecular pathway, so we made the first big step toward target therapy for Zika-induced microcephaly,  Jung said.  Years from now, one shot or a series of shots could target the proteins NS4A and NS4B or their collaborators.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April confirmed that Zika virus causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects, but it was unclear how. Jung and his colleagues explained the molecular mechanisms that lead to the devastating condition.  This field moves so fast; however, no one has examined the viral proteins in Zika before,  said Jung, holder of the Fletcher Jones Foundation chair in molecular microbiology and immunology.  The scientific community knows what the Zika virus does but not who is responsible. It s the difference between saying this nation s Olympic team earned a gold medal or saying the swim team won the gold medal. My lab is scrutinizing the jobs Zika proteins have in the creation of disease.  How the two miscreant Zika proteins operate The miscreant Zika proteins smack a cellular signaling gatekeeper called  Akt-mTOR pathway  until it is disoriented and can no longer properly guard brain development and autophagy regulation, the cell s recycling factories. Autophagy usually digests and kills pathogens; however, when a family of viruses called flaviviruses (dengue, hepatitis C and Zika) infects a cell, autophagy helps the virus proliferate.  Zika loves and needs autophagy,  Jung said.  Zika raises the activity in this recycling factory so they can use the energy and nutrients there to replicate. It s possible that since Zika is using most of the energy, the neuronal stem cells are left with metabolic deficits. Thus the chances for them to differentiate and mature into neurons and other brain cell types is much lower.  In short, Zika NS4A and NS4B proteins stunt brain development and prod autophagy to mushroom so that the virus could spread. According to the study, when these two key proteins hijacked fetal neural stem cells, the size of brain organoids were, on average, halved. Working collaboratively, the two proteins stunted the growth of fetal neural stem cells further by 65 percent. Moreover, differentiation of neural stem cells into mature brain cells, such as neurons and star-shaped supporting cells called astrocytes, was reduced by up to 51 percent. Taking the next step USC researchers are already working on experiments to better demonstrate the functions of NS4A and NS4B in brain organoids and in mouse models, said Zhen Zhao, corresponding co-author and an assistant professor of research physiology and biophysics. He worked with Berislav Zlokovic, director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at Keck Medicine of USC.  It is important to remember that not every pregnant woman infected with Zika virus gives birth to a baby with microcephaly,  Zhao said.  Nevertheless, we are trying to develop a cure for that percentage that does get Zika-related microcephaly.  Scientists are still looking for effective biomarkers to indicate when a pregnant woman who has been infected with Zika needs intervention. MRI is one possibility, but more work needs to be done, Zhao said.","Published: August 22, 2016"

The study hopes to dramatically improve the success rate of clinical trials for treatments in Alzheimer s disease. This landmark  6.9million research project has been designed to identify measureable characteristics, known as biomarkers, which can detect the occurrence of Alzheimer s disease very early on in the progression of the disease - when a person may have no obvious symptoms. Between 2002 and 2012, 99% of clinical trials into treatments for Alzheimer s disease failed. A probable reason for the high failure rate is that treatments are being tested on those who already have irreparable damage to the brain.  It is likely that treatments will be more effective in slowing or stopping further at onset of dementia at earlier stages of the disease. Also, by targeting people in the earlier stages, it should be possible to design better clinical trials for treatments that make a real difference and improve people s lives. The multisite team, led by the University of Oxford, will work with colleagues at eight UK universities and the Alzheimer s Society, with the project also receiving support from a coalition of biopharma companies. Together, the researchers will perform up to 50 tests on 250 volunteers from Dementias Platform UK cohorts, including new tests that have never been used before to detect dementia. The tests will include wearable devices that will give researchers detailed information on people s movement and gait, and sophisticated retinal imaging that will look at subtle changes affecting a person s central and peripheral vision. These potential new biomarkers will be used alone and alongside tests such as brain imaging and assessment of memory and other cognitive functions. They will allow the researchers to recognize the early stages of the disease and those who may be suitable for trials of possible treatments. An estimated 46.8m people worldwide were living with dementia in 2015, and with an ageing population in most developed countries, predictions suggest this number may double by 2050. Currently, there is no known cure for the disease, and few treatments which are available treat symptoms of the disease, rather than slow or stop its progression. Professor Simon Lovestone, lead researcher and Professor of Translational Neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said:  We know that Alzheimer s disease starts long before it is noticed by those with the disease or their doctor. Previous studies have shown changes to the brain as early as 10 to 20 years before symptoms arise. If we can identify the biomarkers present in this very early stage, we have the chance of treating the disease earlier, which is vital if we are to prevent damage to people s memory and thinking. We re indebted to those volunteers taking part in the study whose time and effort will make a real difference to our ability to diagnosis and treat this disease.  Dr Rob Buckle, director of science programmes at the MRC, said:  This is the first major clinical study based on Dementias Platform UK and the results could be game changing for dementia research. Our goal is to find treatments that can slow down or even stop the progression of Alzheimer s disease. Finding biomarkers for clinical trials is crucial for fast-tracking decisions as to whether a trial should stop or continue, and the faster we can find out which drugs work and which ones don t, the faster we can benefit patients. An ability to deliver more cost-effective clinical trials would also encourage investment and increase the number of such studies in the future.  Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department of Health, Professor Chris Whitty, said:  By working together, the National Institute for Health Research and the Medical Research Council are leading the way on new and potentially important treatments for dementia. This important study will hopefully encourage more people to take part in our high quality research to help uncover more insight into causes and possible solutions for dementia.  Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said:  Dementia can be a heart-breaking condition, but it is my mission as Health Secretary to make this country the best place in the world to get a dementia diagnosis and support, as well as being a global leader in the effort to find a cure.  This extra investment is a vital step forwards towards that goal.  Business and Energy Secretary, Greg Clark, said:  We all know friends and family whose lives have been affected by dementia; many of us have been and will be affected directly. That s why we re committed to leading global efforts to tackle this disease and supporting this pioneering project that could improve the lives of millions around the world.  How the study will be run The Deep and Frequent Phenotyping study will recruit 250 volunteers from existing study cohorts led by the Dementias Platform UK, and tests will be carried out over the course of 12 months. Some of the participants will be at risk of developing Alzheimer s disease - due to their age, genes and performance in memory tests - and other participants will not be deemed at risk. The tests will involve:   Movement and walking (gait) assessments using wearable devices   Ophthalmological assessments to photograph the back of the eye (the retina)   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans using an MRI scanner to generate an electronic picture of the brain using magnetic fields instead of X-rays   Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the magnetic fields produced by nerve cells and electroencephalogram (EEG) brain scans to measure the electrical currents association with brain activity   Positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans to detect build-up of proteins associated with Alzheimer s disease in the brain   Thinking and memory (cognitive) assessments which will measure how well participants can pay attention, solve problems and remember things   Clinical assessments including blood and urine samples and cerebrospinal fluid","Published: August 22, 2016"

The animal study, published in Nature Communications, may lead to studies of the equivalent human gene and help develop screening programmes to identify the risk of developing an age-related condition many years before symptoms appear. Age is a risk factor for many conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, dementia and others, but the genes that we carry also influence whether we are more or less susceptible to these. Not much is known about which genes influence age-related conditions, or how they do so. To explore further, researchers from MRC Harwell, a research facility based in Oxfordshire, introduced new mutations at random positions in the genes of mice before they were born, and then monitored their health as they aged. If an age-related condition developed, the researchers investigated which particular gene in that mouse had been mutated.  One gene identified in this way was Slc4a10. This was already known to be needed for eye function, but this new study linked defective Slc4a10 to age-related hearing loss for the first time.   Identifying this gene and others related to late-onset conditions in mice could now prompt investigation of the same genes in humans to ask if naturally-occurring mutations in them cause similar effects. In future, screening people for defects in the genes identified could help to predict their chances of developing a particular condition, and the findings may one day inform treatment development or timing of interventions.  Lead researcher, Dr Paul Potter of MRC Harwell, said:  Our study is an important springboard for a better understanding of which genes in humans are involved in age-related conditions, and how changes in those genes influence this. This is a first and vital step in developing new therapies.  Dr Lindsay Wilson, Programme Manager for Genetics and Genomics at the MRC, said:  As we get older, we have an increased risk of developing many conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hearing loss and dementia. The genes that we carry can influence this, but it is hard to know which do, or how. This study increases our understanding of the genes related to ageing and ill-health and may ultimately help us to identify new treatments. ","Published: August 22, 2016"

A research group at the University of Basel now describes for the first time a mechanism by which hippocampal neural stem cells regulate their own cell fate via the protein Drosha. The journal Cell Stem Cell has published their results. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the potential to differentiate into many cell types. However, the cell types that somatic stem cells produce are usually restricted to those of the organ in which they sit. The current view proposes that stem cell differentiation is controlled by their local environment, the so-called niche. Thus, stem cells receive and interpret specific factors present in their niche that guide their differentiation into specific and restricted cell types. In the adult brain, the hippocampus is responsible for specific forms of memory   a brain region that is also affected in diseases such as dementia, depression and epilepsy. The functions of the hippocampus are based on different cell types, some of which are generated throughout life by neural stem cells. Neural stem cells are generally accepted to produce three different cell types: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the adult hippocampus does not produce oligodendrocytes   the reason for this was so far not known.  Intrinsic cell mechanism Researchers from the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel have now found that the fate of adult hippocampal stem cells is not only controlled by their local niche, but also by a cell-intrinsic mechanism. Their study describes the central role of the enzyme Drosha in this mechanism. Drosha degrades the messenger RNA for NFIB in the adult hippocampal stem cells and prevents the expression of this transcription factor which is necessary for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and thus blocks their development and therefore biases differentiation towards neurons. The team lead by Prof. Verdon Taylor was able to demonstrate for the first time a cell-intrinsic mechanism regulating stem cell fate.  Our research results about the function of Drosha challenge the way we used to think about how stem cell fate is controlled , says cell biologist Taylor. His research group now wants to study if and how stem cells are able to modulate the activity of Drosha in order to satisfy demand.","Published: August 22, 2016"

Now, an international team of researchers led by the University of Missouri has completed studies on fruit flies with a condition that mimics a form of HPV-induced cancer. The fly models the team developed may help scientists understand the underlying mechanism by which this virus can cause cancer as well as identify potential drug treatments. The study appears in today s issue of PLoS Pathogens.  This is the first model of an HPV-induced cancer in fruit flies,  said Bing Zhang, professor of biological sciences in the MU College of Arts and Science.  This new model will help scientists understand the molecular and biochemical pathways involved in tumor growth and malignancy caused by HPV as well as screen for potential drug targets.  Previous studies conducted in human cells and in mice have shown that the virus enters the body through the skin and produces several oncoproteins, which are proteins that can transform a normal cell into a tumor cell. One of these viral oncoproteins, called E6, plays an important role during the later stages of tumor formation and metastasis. In the study, led by Mojgan Padash, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Missouri, the researchers introduced the viral E6 oncoprotein and a human protein that is necessary for E6-induced cancer into fruit flies. The proteins caused severe abnormalities in the epithelial, or skin, cells of the fruit flies. The researchers also show reduced levels of the same suite of proteins targeted by E6 in humans. Further experiments done in human cell lines with the fruit fly version of the E6-targeted proteins yielded similar results, providing additional evidence that E6 works the same in flies as it does in humans. Although cellular abnormalities resulted, the scientists found that the E6 proteins were not sufficient enough to cause tumors in flies. Since it is thought that mutations in a human oncoprotein, called Ras, may contribute to E6-mediated tumor development in humans, the researchers introduced this third protein into the flies. With all three proteins present, the flies developed malignant tumors that metastasized.  The take home message is that the same key molecular players that underlie HPV E6-mediated cancer in humans do the same things in flies,  Padash said.  Practically speaking, this means we can now use this fly model to identify other essential components that contribute to E6-mediated tumorigenesis, which has the potential to translate into therapies for HPV-induced cancers.   The model that has been developed has been used to identify other essential pathways that contribute to E6-driven malignancy,  said Lawrence Banks, head of the Tumor Virology group at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in Trieste, Italy, and a coauthor of the study.  The power of this model is that it can be used now to screen for inhibitors of other pathways, which have the potential to translate into therapies for HPV-induced cancer.

Pyrenochaeta sp. DS3sAY3a growing in liquid culture. As the fungus grows, brown-colored manganese oxides are formed. Here, the oxides can be seen associated with biomass and suspended in solution. (Carolyn Zeiner) Fungal secretomes, those collections of all molecules secreted by a cell, contain enzymes that can break down plant cell wall components such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. These capabilities make them of interest to bioenergy researchers looking for cost-effective ways to convert plant mass into sustainable, alternative transportation fuels. In a study published online July 19, 2016 inPlos ONE, a team led by researchers at Harvard University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) conducted a comparative analysis of the secretomes of four recently-isolated and sequenced filamentous Ascomycete fungi to learn more about the variety of pathways they deploy to break down carbon compounds.  While the secretomes of model organisms such as the white-rot Basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium and members of the Aspergillus genus have been well characterized, little is known about the enzymatic capabilities of environmental isolates. Thus, the mechanisms of carbon degradation by many ubiquitous soil fungi remain poorly understood,  said study first author Carolyn Zeiner, now a postdoctoral research associate at Boston University.  This work suggests that a more taxonomically and mechanistically diverse community of fungal species contributes to environmental lignocellulose degradation beyond the traditional wood-rot Basidiomycetes.  Fungal Research Made Possible Through FICUS Program The research was made possible through a collaborative science initiative called Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science (FICUS) that offers researchers the capabilities of two DOE Office of Science User Facilities: the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), and the Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory (EMSL) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. As described in the FICUS proposal filed by WHOI s Colleen Hansel and University of Minnesota s Cara Santelli, the team seeks to identify the carbon degradation pathways of filamentous Ascomycete fungi. One aspect of the project focuses on understanding the role of manganese (Mn) oxidizers in carbon degradation. The enzymes and Mn products produced by Mn oxidizing fungi rank among the strongest known oxidants on the planet, and play key roles in helping to break down even the most recalcitrant forms of lignocellulose. For the study, the team studied four Mn(II)-oxidizing fungi known to play roles in cleaning up metal contaminated waters: Alternaria alternata SRC1lrK2f, Stagonospora sp. SRC1lsM3a, and Pyrenochaetasp. DS3sAY3a were all isolated from coal mine drainage treatment systems in central Pennsylvania;Paraconiothyrium sporulosum AP3s5-JAC2a was isolated from a remediated freshwater lake in Massachusetts. All four fungi had had their genomes sequenced and annotated as part of the FICUS project to enable genomic and proteomic characterization of enzymes involved in manganese and carbon oxidation by these isolates. Leveraging Tools at National User Facilities Two of the Plos ONE study authors: co-author Sam Purvine (left), of PNNL, and first author Carolyn Zeiner (right), now at Boston University. (DOE JGI) By comparing the composition and functional diversity of the secretomes with mass spectrometry at EMSL, the team was able to identify several lignocellulose-degrading enzymes for future study.  Our primary finding was that these fungi generate a wide variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes that can directly oxidize labile and recalcitrant carbon, in addition to a diverse suite of redox-active accessory enzymes that indirectly attack lignocellulose by forming reactive oxygen species,  said Zeiner.  The robust enzymatic machinery of these four Ascomycete species, combined with their known ability to degrade cellulose and to generate strong oxidants such as Mn(III) aqueous complexes and solid-phase Mn(III/IV) oxides, suggests a role for these species in lignocellulose conversion in the environment. This is particularly intriguing given that environmental lignin degradation is thought to be carried out primarily by Basidiomycete fungi.  Zeiner noted that having access to the capabilities at the DOE JGI and EMSL  proved to be a powerful tool in exploring the molecular mechanisms of carbon degradation by soil microbes.  She elaborated on the resources the team utilized at these national user facilities.  Through collaboration with EMSL, we utilized state-of-the-art mass spectrometry facilities and leveraged expertise in quantitative, comparative proteomic methods specifically, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to identify over 1,300 secreted proteins per species. Additionally, we worked closely with EMSL bioinformaticists to develop a customized pipeline for protein data analysis and functional annotation that is now being successfully deployed on other EMSL proteomic projects. Through collaboration with JGI, we sequenced the genomes of our four Ascomycetes, resulting in a 400 percent increase in the number of protein matches that we were able to obtain compared to searching our datasets against the genomes of closely related species.  This vastly improved our ability to harness our large datasets in drawing biological conclusions about the role of these species in carbon cycling. Finally, we collaborated with JGI bioinformaticists to generate genome-based predicted secretomes of the four species, which enhanced the functional annotation of our experimental data, aided in identifying intracellular proteins that were released into the secretome via lysis, and provided more robust assignments of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes).

And with internet sales of medications on the rise, people everywhere are increasingly at risk. So, a team of researchers has developed a simple, inexpensive paper-based device to screen suspicious medications. The researchers will present their work today at the 252nd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS, the world's largest scientific society, is holding the meeting here through Thursday. It features more than 9,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  ""People who don't have access to the best-quality medicines also don't have as many resources to buy the analytical instrumentation to detect the quality problems,"" says Marya Lieberman, Ph.D. ""Instead of a $30,000 instrument, we've developed a $1 paper card. We designed the card so it would be as easy and inexpensive to use as possible."" Medications can be compromised in many different ways. For example, they may be bulked up with fillers, or they can degrade because they are stored improperly. Identifying poor-quality medications is challenging, as inspectors may not know in advance what chemical adulterants or degradation products they need to look for. Plus, bad-quality medications may contain at least some of the active ingredient, so simply detecting the presence of the real medication isn't enough to rule out issues. In this study, Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame, along with Hamline University undergraduate Sarah Bliese, developed a card to detect falsified or degraded antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone, both of which the World Health Organization lists as ""essential."" To screen for a variety of potential quality issues, the researchers included 12 lanes separated by wax barriers on the paper device. Each lane contained a different set of reagents to detect materials or functional groups found in active pharmaceutical ingredients, degradation products or common fillers. To run a sample, the researchers crush a pill and rub the resulting powder across all 12 lanes, and then dip the bottom of the paper card in water for three minutes. The water wicks up the lanes, bringing reagents into contact with the powder. Colors are formed when the reagents interact with the pharmaceutical, filler or degradation product. The researchers then compare the color pattern from the sample with the color patterns obtained from high-quality pharmaceutical products. The comparison can be done by eye or with an image-analysis program on a smartphone. Ceftriaxone is sensitive to heat and breaks down if storage temperatures climb too high. As an experiment, the researchers subjected ceftriaxone to high temperatures and ran the card test, simultaneously analyzing the degradation products via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. They verified that the colorimetric pattern for the degraded antibiotic was different from that of the correctly stored product. In addition to these tests on the pure active ingredient, Lieberman and Bliese analyzed dozens of real-world samples of ceftriaxone from Kenya and Uganda. Unscrupulous makers of falsified medication sometimes add colorants containing toxic heavy metals to their products to make the illicit pills more closely resemble their legitimate counterparts, Bliese says. So, in a related project at Hamline University, Bliese and Deanna O'Donnell, Ph.D., are exploring whether a portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy device can scan pills for these substances. In June, Lieberman and Bliese traveled to Kenya to test a new paper card which can detect substandard antibiotics. While Lieberman is currently focusing her work on the developing world, she says her cards could be applicable worldwide to perform, for example, the analysis of herbal medicines and nutritional supplements. ""Sometimes those 'herbal products' are actually spiked with pharmaceuticals,"" she explains. ""The paper test cards could be a defense against this."" Bliese says her next project will be to develop a paper test card to help first responders identify drugs of abuse and differentiate them from household products or legitimate medicines.","Published: August 22, 2016"

The researchers showed that a compound that inhibits the activity of certain brain-cell receptors can reverse signs of cocaine dependency in rodents. Prior experiments targeting this receptor, known as the TrkB receptor, produced results that differed greatly according to the brain region involved. The new study is the first to test system-wide delivery the way drugs are typically given in humans of a TrkB-blocker, showing that the overall effect is to reverse cocaine dependency. See Also: Brain damage during stroke may point to source of addiction ""I think this study could help revive the idea of targeting TrkB signaling to treat addiction,"" said TSRI biologist Candice Contet, senior author of the study. Scientists have long struggled to find an effective strategy against cocaine addiction, which is estimated to affect more than two million people in the U.S., resulting annually in about half a million emergency room visits and hundreds of thousands of rehab facility admissions. There is still no FDA- (Federal Drug Administration-) approved drug specifically for treating cocaine addiction. Addiction researchers know that cocaine produces a huge surge in the levels of dopamine in the ""mesocorticolimbic reward system,"" where the brain registers pleasurable experiences and wires itself to want them. In rat models, repeated exposure to cocaine which the animals readily self-administer causes long-lasting adaptive changes in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, two key areas of this reward system. Over the past decade, studies have found that these changes are mediated at least partly by changes in production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which works by activating TrkB receptors. Mimicking that effect by injecting BDNF directly into the nucleus accumbens strongly increases rats' motivation for cocaine and other measures of dependency. By contrast, blocking BDNF production or BDNF/TrkB signaling in this brain region reduces the signs of dependency. Those results have suggested TrkB-blocking as a new therapeutic strategy against addiction. One problem has been that BDNF has the opposite effect on addiction-type behavior when it acts in the medial prefrontal cortex. In experiments with rats, BDNF applied to this region reduces dependency behaviors, whereas blocking BDNF/TrkB signaling increases those behaviors. Learn More: Cocaine addiction, craving, relapse: Paradigm shift in treatment holds promise, thanks to epigenetics ""Based on these previous findings, we were very excited to investigate whether blocking TrkB receptors throughout the brain would be beneficial or detrimental in helping to reduce the motivation to take cocaine,"" said Michel Verheij, a research associate at TSRI at the time of the study, now at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, the Netherlands. For the new study, which appears in The Journal of Neuroscience, Contet and her colleagues examined the overall effects of blocking TrkB signaling, using a recently developed TrkB-receptor blocker, or ""antagonist,"" that can successfully get into the brain after being injected into the bloodstream. The team found in rats that had learned to self-administer cocaine infusions by pressing a lever, the TrkB blocker powerfully reduced basic behavioral measures of cocaine use and dependency--and did so more strongly when the dose was higher. The treated rats used much less cocaine, were much less willing to press the lever many times to get more cocaine, and were less inclined to ""relapse"" when re-exposed to cocaine after a period of withdrawal. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by signs of lower, more normal TrkB signaling activity in the nucleus accumbens. Surprisingly, signs of TrkB signaling activity in the brain's medial prefrontal cortex also showed a move toward normal rising, despite the presence of the TrkB-blocking drug. ""We suspect that the antagonist has its primary action in the nucleus accumbens, where it's logical that it would prevent the activation that is triggered by cocaine,"" said Contet, ""while what happens in the prefrontal cortex is probably a downstream consequence, rather than a direct effect of the TrkB antagonist in that region."" Don't Miss: Cocaine addiction: Scientists discover 'back door' into the brainImportantly, the TrkB-blocking treatment did not blunt the rats' appetite for a sweet-tasting glucose-saccharine solution. ""That's good because it shows that the TrkB antagonist doesn't work by causing a general suppression of appetite or activity, but specifically reduces the sense of reward and motivation for cocaine,"" Contet said. Contet and her colleagues now hope that their results will encourage clinicians to consider the therapeutic potential of the TrkB-blocking strategy in humans with cocaine addiction. TrkB-blocking compounds are already being investigated by academic and pharmaceutical company laboratories for treating disorders including anxiety, depression, and brain cancer.

However, new research in mice from scientists at The Rockefeller University and La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology suggests that certain adult brain cells may be vulnerable to infection as well. Among these are populations of cells that serve to replace lost or damaged neurons throughout adulthood, and are also thought to be critical to learning and memory. See Also: Zika virus tested in brain precursor cells ""This is the first study looking at the effect of Zika infection on the adult brain,"" says Joseph Gleeson, adjunct professor at Rockefeller, head of the Laboratory of Pediatric Brain Disease, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. ""Based on our findings, getting infected with Zika as an adult may not be as innocuous as people think."" Although more research is needed to determine if this damage has long-term biological implications or the potential to affect behavior, the findings suggest the possibility that the Zika virus, which has become widespread in Central and South America over the past eight months, may be more harmful than previously believed. The new findings are published in Cell Stem Cell. ""Zika can clearly enter the brain of adults and can wreak havoc,"" says Sujan Shresta, a professor at the La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology. ""But it's a complex disease it's catastrophic for early brain development, yet the majority of adults who are infected with Zika rarely show detectable symptoms. Its effect on the adult brain may be more subtle, and now we know what to look for."" Early in gestation, before our brains have developed into a complex organ with specialized zones, they are comprised entirely of neural progenitor cells. With the capability to replenish the brain's neurons throughout its lifetime, these are the stem cells of the brain. In healthy individuals, neural progenitor cells eventually become fully formed neurons, and it is thought that at some point along this progression they become resistant to Zika, explaining why adults appear less susceptible to the disease. Learn More: Why neural stem cells may be vulnerable to Zika infectionBut current evidence suggests that Zika targets neural progenitor cells, leading to loss of these cells and to reduced brain volume. This closely mirrors what is seen in microcephaly, a developmental condition linked to Zika infection in developing fetuses that results in a smaller-than-normal head and a wide variety of developmental disabilities. The mature brain retains niches of these neural progenitor cells that appear to be especially impacted by Zika. These niches in mice they exist primarily in two regions, the subventricular zone of the anterior forebrain and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus are vital for learning and memory. Gleeson and his colleagues suspected that if Zika can infect fetal neural progenitor cells, it wouldn't be a far stretch for them to also be able to infect these cells in adults. In a mouse model engineered by Shresta and her team to mimic Zika infection in humans, fluorescent biomarkers illuminated to reveal that adult neural progenitor cells could indeed be hijacked by the virus. ""Our results are pretty dramatic in the parts of the brain that lit up, it was like a Christmas tree,"" says Gleeson. ""It was very clear that the virus wasn't affecting the whole brain evenly, like people are seeing in the fetus. In the adult, it's only these two populations that are very specific to the stem cells that are affected by virus. These cells are special, and somehow very susceptible to the infection."" The researchers found that infection correlated with evidence of cell death and reduced generation of new neurons in these regions. Integration of new neurons into learning and memory circuits is crucial for neuroplasticity, which allows the brain to change over time. Deficits in this process are associated with cognitive decline and neuropathological conditions, such as depression and Alzheimer's disease. Gleeson and colleagues recognize that healthy humans may be able to mount an effective immune response and prevent the virus from attacking. However, they suggest that some people, such as those weakened immune systems, may be vulnerable to the virus is a way that has not yet been recognized. ""In more subtle cases, the virus could theoretically impact long-term memory or risk of depression,"" says Gleeson, ""but tools do not exist to test the long-term effects of Zika on adult stem cell populations."" In addition to microcephaly, Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barr  syndrome, a rare condition in which the immune system attacks parts of the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness or even paralysis. ""The connection has been hard to trace since Guillain-Barr  usually develops after the infection has cleared,"" says Shresta. ""We propose that infection of adult neural progenitor cells could be the mechanism behind this."" Read Next: Sophisticated 'mini-brains' add to evidence of Zika's toll on fetal cortex There are still many unanswered questions, including exactly how translatable findings in this mouse model are to humans. Gleeson's findings in particular raise questions such as: Does the damage inflicted on progenitor cells by the virus have lasting biological consequences, and can this in turn affect learning and memory? Or, do these cells have the capability to recover? Nonetheless, these findings raise the possibility that Zika is not simply a transient infection in adult humans, and that exposure in the adult brain could have long-term effects. ""The virus seems to be traveling quite a bit as people move around the world,"" says Gleeson. ""Given this study, I think the public health enterprise should consider monitoring for Zika infections in all groups, not just pregnant women.""

See Also: From transcription to function: mapping brain networks The new method, called MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), makes it possible in a single experiment to trace the long-range projections of large numbers of individual neurons from a specific region or regions to wherever they lead in the brain in experiments that are many times less expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming than current mapping technologies allow. Although a number of important brain-mapping projects are now under way, all of these efforts to obtain ""connectomes,"" or wiring maps, rely upon microscopes and related optical equipment to trace the myriad thread-like projections that link neurons to other neurons, near and far. For the first time ever, MAPseq ""converts the task of brain mapping into one of RNA sequencing,"" says its inventor, Anthony Zador, MD, PhD, professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. ""The RNA sequences, or 'barcodes,' that we deliver to individual neurons are unmistakably unique,"" Zador explains, ""and this enables us to determine if individual neurons, as opposed to entire regions, are tailored to specific targets."" Read Next: New mapping approach lets scientists zoom in and out as the brain processes sound MAPseq differs from so-called ""bulk tracing"" methods now in common use, in which a marker typically a fluorescent protein is expressed by neurons and carried along their axons. Such markers are good at determining all of the regions where neurons in the source region project to, but they cannot tell scientists that any two neurons in the source region project to the same region, to different regions, or to some of the same regions, and some different ones. That inability to resolve a neuron's axonal destinations, cell by cell in a given region, is what motivated Zador to come up with a new technique. 'Bulk' labeling methods now widely in use to map brain connections are able to determine that neurons in the 'source' region (left side) project to three green-shaded regions (right side), but are not able to distinguish the specific destinations of individual neurons in the source region. MAPseq enables such distinction -- in this example, showing that neurons bearing specific 'barcodes' (vastly reduced in complexity here for demonstration purposes) carry those barcodes to some of the 3 'destinations' but not necessarily all of them, or the same ones as other neurons in the source region. Credit: Zador lab, CSHL  One way of explaining the advantage of MAPseq over bulk tracing methods is to imagine being at an international airport, with the intention of getting on a flight to, say, Germany. ""If you go to the international terminal, you see a long line of ticket counters,"" Zador explains. ""If you want to go to Germany, it's not enough to take any airline at the international terminal. If you stand in line at the counter for Air Chile, you're probably not going to be able to buy a ticket for Germany."" ""Those many airlines whose counters are adjacent serve many destinations, some of which overlap, some of which are unique. You can print out a map showing all of the foreign countries that all of the airlines serve from your airport, but that doesn't tell you anything at all about individual airlines and where they go. This is the difference between current labeling methods and MAPseq. The 'individual airlines' in my example are adjacent neurons in a part of the brain whose 'routes' we want to trace."" Learn More: New brain mapping reveals unknown cell types Zador and his team, including Justus Kebschull, a graduate student in his lab who is first author on the Neuron paper introducing the new method, have spent several years working out a technology that enables them to assign unique barcode-like identifiers to large numbers of individual neurons via a single injection in any brain region of interest. Each injection consists of a deactivated virus that has been engineered to contain massive pools of individually unique RNA molecules, each of whose sequence - consisting of 30 ""letters,"" or nucleotides - is taken up by single neurons. Thirty letters yields many, many times more barcode sequences (1018) than there are neurons in either the mouse or human brain, so this method is especially well suited to the massive complexity problem that brain mapping presents. An injection into a ""source"" region of the brain contains a viral library encoding a diverse collection of barcode sequences, which are hitched to an engineered protein that is designed to carry the barcode along axonal pathways. The barcode RNA is expressed at high levels and transported into the terminals of axons in the source region where the injection is made. In each neuron, it travels to the point where the axon forms a synapse with a projection from another neuron. Tests show that the technology works - the barcodes travel reliably and evenly throughout the brain, along the ""trunklines"" that are the axons, and out to the ""branch points"" where synapses form. About two days after one or more injections are made in a region of interest, the brain is dissected and RNA is collected and sequenced. RNA barcodes in the ""source"" area are now matched with the same barcodes collected in distant parts of the brain. [[{""fid"":""3140"",""view_mode"":""default"",""type"":""media"",""attributes"":{""alt"":""mapping neural pathways"",""height"":""177"",""width"":""590"",""class"":""media-element file-default""}}]]To demonstrate MAPseq's capabilities, Zador's team injected a part of the mouse brain called the locus coeruleus, located in the brain stem. After nearly 2 days, the cortex was divided in 22 slices, dissected and sequenced for RNA barcodes. The sequence readouts were matched with barcodes of cells in the region of the initial injection, establishing specific paths of individual LC neurons. Credit: Zador lab, CSHL  ""Sequencing the RNA is a highly efficient, automated process, which makes MAPseq such a potentially radical tool,"" Kebschull says. ""In addition to the speed and economy of RNA sequencing, it has the great advantage of making it possible for researchers to distinguish between individual neurons within the same region that project to different parts of the brain."" To demonstrate MAPseq's capabilities, Zador's team injected a part of the mouse brain called the locus coeruleus (LC), located in the brain stem. It is the cortex's sole source of noradrenaline, a hormone that signals surprise. Zador's team used MAPseq to address an old question: does the ""surprise"" signal get broadcast everywhere in the cortex, or only to particular places, where, perhaps, it is most needed or relevant? In their demonstration experiment, only RNA that ended up in the cortex or olfactory bulb was sequenced, along with that of the source region in the LC where the barcodes were originally injected. The team divided the cortex into 22 slices, each about 300 microns thick, and dissected the slices. The results were exciting to the team. ""We found that neurons in the LC have a variety of idiosyncratic projection patterns,"" Zador says. ""Some neurons project almost exclusively to a single preferred target in the cortex or olfactory bulb. Other neurons project more broadly, although weakly."" These results, he adds, ""are consistent with, and reconcile, previous seemingly contradictory results about LC projections."" The surprise signal can reach most parts of the brain, but there are very specific parts of the brain where the signal is especially focused. The team showed that results could be obtained in experiments based on one injection in the LC, and also two injections, on opposite sides. Already in progress are experiments in which the entire cortex is being ""tiled"" with injections. It is hoped this will yield the first connectome of the entire cortex at single-neuron resolution. Don't Miss: Mapping energy metabolism of growing nerve cells to better understand neuronal disorders ""Once we automate the process of using many injections, we think this kind of experiment can be completed by a single person in just a week or two, and at a cost of only a few thousand dollars,"" Zador says. ""We are very keen on being able to do these kind of studies in a single animal, which will eliminate the past problem of injecting multiple animals to trace multiple neurons, a method that requires one to make a single map based on many brains, each of which is somewhat different."" Zador's next goal with MAPseq is to map the brains of animals that model various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric illnesses, to see how gene mutations strongly associated with causality alter the structure of brain circuits, and thus, presumably, brain function.

ISCT supports, and has undertaken decades of activity with regulators in legislative efforts that seek to increase availability and financial accessibility of cell therapies whilst not compromising either safety or efficacy. In addition, ISCT has also supported progress through appropriate fast track treatments, breakthroughs, and accelerated approvals as well as patient-focused tools such as compassionate use for individual patient situations. These all play a key role in addressing unmet medical needs. ISCT has additionally taken a series of initiatives to counter industry practice of unproven cell therapies. ISCT does support addressing the unmet need, stated by the proposed REGROW legislation, for products designated 351 in the regulatory pathways, to allow patient access to these therapies more effectively.   However, ISCT has identified a number of key features of the legislation that fail to address or provide clarity that will be needed to provide affordable and accessible treatment to patients. As a result, ISCT cannot support the current proposed legislation and strongly calls for a redraft to address the following concerns.   All new proposed therapies must have a firm scientific basis for conditional approval relying on, for example, peer-reviewed pre-clinical, early clinical, or other relevant data that support a scientifically credible hypothesis of how the products might provide benefit.   A conditional approval process predicated on preliminary clinical evidence of safety and a reasonable expectation of efficacy must provide a unique patient benefit beyond what is provided by existing regulatory processes. This must include eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid Services and insurance plans. Any conditionally approved product should be granted fast track review for CMS coverage.   A risk/benefit algorithm must be used to assess which therapies qualify for Conditional Approval. It is critical that there is preliminary clinical evidence of safety and a reasonable expectation of efficacy. This method must consider all critical factors equally - the patients need, the ability to reasonably access alternative FDA-approved therapies and the seriousness of condition to be treated.   Any conditionally approved product definition shall not conflict with existing guidance or interim guidance from the FDA.   ISCT believes the rights of patients are paramount, especially in the case of individuals seeking recourse if treated with approaches for which conditional approval has been granted. Critical to this process is attention to the tenets of informed consent designed to clarify in lay terms the evidence, potential risks and potential benefits.  ISCT has a unique role and position in the field, representing all elements of cell therapy. As a result, the Society has, and will continue to work on international consensus documents to progress approved cell therapeutics for the treatment of patients with a range of conditions. We also recognize the role for the United States Department of Health and Human Services to work with the entire industry to develop standards for manufacturing processing and controls of PHS Section 351 regenerative medicine products,  said Catherine Bollard, MBChB, MD, ISCT President.  Last year, ISCT took the lead on tackling the problem of unproven cellular therapies with the launch of a publication and reference guide for those involved in the development of cell therapies. Therefore, in response to the proposed forthcoming REGROW Act, ISCT strongly believes it is critical that cell technologies regulated under Sections 351 as well as 361 all demonstrate a positive benefit/risk ratio through properly designed clinical trials, to provide patients the best opportunity to access demonstrably safe and effective cell therapies.

Compared to existing opioid pain relievers, like morphine, the new agent, called PZM21, was not  reinforcing  or prone to triggering potentially lethal respiratory impairment   and was also less constipating. Also unlike existing analgesics, it had little effect on spinal cord reflexive responses, instead targeting the brain-mediated emotional/experiential component of pain. In addition to clinical potential, PZM21 also holds promise as a  tool molecule  for exploring the workings of brain pain systems, say the researchers. The study represents the combined efforts of NIH-funded research teams led by Nobel laureate Brian Kobilka, M.D. , of Stanford University, NIMH-funded Bryan Roth, M.D., Ph.D.  (inventor of the chemogenetic technology DREADD), of the University of North Carolina, and Brian Shoichet, Ph.D.,  of the University of California San Francisco. They report on their findings August 17, 2016 in the journal Nature.  This work demonstrates the power of structure-based design to speed up the development of drugs with optimal signaling and therapeutic properties,  explained Laurie Nadler, Ph.D., chief of the NIMH Neuropharmacology Program, which co-funded the research along with NIH s National Institute of General Medical Sciences and National Institute on Drug Abuse. The researchers achieved PZM21 s specificity by applying knowledge of opioid receptor structure to design an agent optimized for just the desired properties. Evidence suggested that the undesirable side effects of morphine-like opiates work on the receptor through a molecular signaling pathway linked to beta-arrestin, while the desired analgesic effects work through a G protein-coupled receptor pathway. The researchers screened and ranked more than 3 million compounds for these properties   evaluating each in about 1.3 million configurations for their ability to tweak the opioid receptor in the desired ways. After exhaustive winnowing, they used the knowledge gained to synthesize the strongest G protein and weakest beta-arrestin activator. PZM21 s unprecedented chemical structure then performed just as they had theorized in mouse tests of analgesic and side effect potential.","Published: August 19, 2016"

In the Aug. 17 issue of Nature, scientists from the University of Chicago show that the same cells that make fin rays in fish play a central role in forming the fingers and toes of four-legged creatures. After three years of painstaking experiments using novel gene-editing techniques and sensitive fate mapping to label and track developing cells in fish, the researchers describe how the small flexible bones found at the ends of fins are related to fingers and toes, which are more suitable for life on land.  When I first saw these results you could have knocked me over with a feather,  said the study s senior author, Neil Shubin, the Robert R. Bensley Distinguished Service Professor of Organismal Biology and Anatomy. Shubin is an authority on the transition from fins to limbs.  For years scientists have thought that fin rays were completely unrelated to fingers and toes, utterly dissimilar because one kind of bone is initially formed out of cartilage and the other is formed in simple connective tissue,  he said.  Our results change that whole idea. We now have a lot of things to rethink.   One of those eureka moments  To unravel how fins might have transformed into wrists and fingers, the researchers worked mostly with a standard fish model: the zebrafish. Tetsuya Nakamura, a postdoctoral scholar in Shubin s lab, used a gene-editing technique; CRISPR/Cas, in zebrafish to delete important genes linked to limb-building, and then selectively bred zebrafish with multiple targeted deletions. He spent more than two years building and cross breeding the fish mutants, a project that began at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass, a UChicago-affiliated laboratory, which provided research support and summer lab facilities. The team applied techniques developed at MBL s National Xenopus Resource. At the same time, Andrew Gehrke, a former graduate student in Shubin s lab, refined cell-labelling techniques to map out when and where specific embryonic cells migrated as the animals grew and developed.  It was one of those eureka moments,  Gehrke said.  We found that the cells that mark the wrists and fingers of mice and people were exclusively in the fin rays of fish.  The team focused on Hox genes, which control the body plan of a growing embryo along the head-to-tail, or shoulder-to-fingertip, axis. Many of these genes are crucial for limb development. They studied the development of cells, beginning, in some experiments, soon after fertilization, and followed them as they became part of an adult fin. Previous work has shown that when Hox genes, specifically those related to the wrists and digits of mice (HoxD and HoxA), were deleted, the mice did not develop those structures. When Nakamura deleted those same genes in zebrafish, the long fins rays were greatly reduced.    What matters is not what happens when you knock out a single gene, but when you do it in combination,  Nakamura explained.  That s where the magic happens.  CT scans confirm suspicions The researchers also used a high-energy CT scanner to see the minute structures within the adult zebrafish fin. These can be invisible, even to most traditional microscopes. The scans revealed that fish lacking certain genes lost fin rays, but the small bones made of cartilage fin increased in number. The authors suspect that the mutants that Nakamura made caused cells to stop migrating from the base of the fin to their usual position near the tip. This inability to migrate meant that there were fewer cells to make fin rays, leaving more cells at the fin base to produce cartilage elements.  It really took the combination of labeling and knockouts to convince us that this cellular relationship between fins and limbs was real,  Gehrke said. Future research includes new expeditions to find more fossil intermediates such as Tiktaalik, a link between primitive fish and the first four-legged animals, discovered by Shubin and colleagues in 2006 in the transition from fins to limbs. They are also planning experiments with Hox genes to learn how a common population of cells can form such different structures in fish and people.","Published: August 19, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/grad-students-finding-enables-rapid-compound-screening-196445,Grad Student s Finding Enables Rapid Compound Screening  Grad student makes technical leap that could enable rapid screening of anti cancer compounds  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It isn t often that a graduate student makes a spectacular technical leap in his field, or invents a process that can have a significant impact on a real-world problem. Di Liu did both. A chemistry graduate student at UChicago, Liu devised a way to make tiny knotted and interlocked chemical structures that have been impossible for chemists to fabricate until now, and he invented a way that those knots might be used to quickly screen hundreds of chemicals for fighting cancer. Many chemicals have knots or links as part of their structure. But synthesizing new substances that tie themselves in knots at the molecular scale is prodigiously difficult. Liu found a way to generate a large variety of tiny knots, 15 to 20 nanometers in diameter (smaller than a virus), in a piece of single-stranded DNA.  Nobody could do it before,  said Yossi Weizmann, an assistant professor in chemistry and a co-author on the paper.  Di found a way to synthesize something that s very challenging.  The challenge was part of what attracted him. Liu, Weizmann and three co-authors published their findings July 4 in Nature Chemistry.  Some people want to run faster; some people want to jump higher. Chemists want to create more complex molecules,  Liu said.  It s a demonstration of our capability.  The knots are a way to mimic what happens to DNA inside cells, and they offer a possible tool for attacking an enzyme crucial to the survival of cancer cells.  Super-coiled  DNA DNA is a long molecule. In living cells, it must coil itself up in order to fit into the cell nucleus, and in doing so it becomes  super-coiled an effect similar to being knotted. Like a piece of string twisted too tightly, short segments twist back on themselves, tangle and poke off to the side of the main strand, interfering with the DNA s ability to function. When the DNA needs to replicate, an enzyme called DNA topoisomerase snips the super-coils and untangles them, relaxing the tension in the strand. Then it rejoins the snipped ends so the DNA can function. It s a feat so complex that James Wang, the enzyme s discoverer, dubbed it  the magician of the DNA world.  It also makes topoisomerase a prime target for anti-cancer drugs: If the topoisomerase in a cancer cell doesn t function, the cancer cell will die. Liu uses knotted DNA as a probe to detect the activity of topoisomerase. He first gets the knots to form themselves from strategically designed sequences of single-stranded DNA and shorter segments he calls  staples.  The four nucleotides that make up DNA bond with each other according to strict rules: A bonds only with T; C bonds only with G. So by picking the sequence of nucleotides on the staples, Liu can manipulate where each will attach to the long strand. Using this method Liu has encouraged the formation of nine different knot structures, some, he acknowledged, simply for the satisfaction of being able to do it. After the structure forms, an enzyme seals the ends and another enzyme removes the staples. When topoisomerase is introduced into a vial containing the knotted DNA, it snips the knot, untangles it and seals its ends to form a circle,  unknotting  the knot. The relative quantities of knots and circles after adding topoisomerase show how active the enzyme has been in unknotting the knots: fewer circles equal less action. Testing, retesting To test a potential anti-topoisomerase drug, researchers could run the test before and after introducing the drug, and see if the drug had inhibited the action of the enzyme. But the method chemists typically use for such assays, gel electrophoresis, is too slow to be a practical way to screen drug candidates. Liu invented an alternative. He realized that he didn t need to see the knots themselves, he just needed to see evidence that the enzyme had unknotted them. Since the circles of DNA can replicate while the knots can t, he looked for replication, which is easily detectable using a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA.  You re detecting the activity of topoisomerase, because it can unknot the knot to a circle,  said Weizmann.  And if the DNA is unknotted, then you can detect the replication. And because this method is electrophoresis-free, it can be used in high through-put screening for drugs against this enzyme.  Liu and Weizmann plan to begin testing a library of chemicals, beginning with molecules already approved by the FDA.  There are hundreds, Weizmann said.  If you hit something, then you start to study it. If you don t, you go on to others. It s trial by error. But you have the ability to screen hundreds because the method is very easy.

The bacteria are a common source of food poisoning and are resistant to heat and high salt concentrations, which are used for food preparation and storage. The team hope to use this knowledge to develop a treatment that prevents food poisoning by ensuring all bacteria in food are killed. They are also investigating whether these findings could aid the development of a treatment for patients that would work alongside conventional antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus bacterium live naturally on skin or in the nose of one in four people. However, if the bugs get inside the body they can cause serious infection, blood poisoning and even death. A  superbug  form of the bacteria, called MRSA, has also developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin. Staphylococcus aureus can also trigger food poisoning, commonly through contaminated meat products such as ham, as well as sandwiches, salads and dairy products. In a new study, the Imperial team have discovered how Staphylococcus aureus regulates its salt intake. Disrupting this mechanism means the bacteria either absorb too much salt from their environment, or lose too much water   causing them to dehydrate and die. Professor Angelika Gr ndling, lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial said:  The Staphylococcus aureus bacterium is a key pathogen and causes many serious infections in patients. With this research we now have a better understanding of how the bacteria cope with salt stress. Although this research is at an early stage, we hope this knowledge will someday help us to prevent food borne staphylococcal infections, as well as open new possibilities for a type of treatment that may work alongside antibiotics.  In the new study, published in the journal Science Signaling, the team looked at MRSA cells in the lab and found that a signalling molecule called cyclic di-AMP is critical for the process through which the bacteria regulate their salt levels. Staphylococcus aureus are notoriously resistant to high-salt concentrations, although up until now scientists have been unclear why. In the current study the team revealed that when the signalling molecule detects the bacterium is in a high-salt environment, the molecule latches onto several  transporter  proteins to signal to them to respond and protect the cell. High salt concentrations act to pull water out of a cell   which is why we feel thirsty after eating salty foods. Therefore to prevent water loss, the transporter protein pulls into the cell a type of a molecule that acts like a miniature sponge. It soaks up the water, locking it in the cell and preventing it from escaping. By stopping water loss, the miniature sponges also prevent salt from moving into the cell. The researchers were able to disrupt this salt mechanism, and found that by increasing the signal to the transporter protein, the number of these miniature sponges was significantly reduced. Inhibiting these salt protection mechanisms renders MRSA cells more sensitive to salt   which could ultimately lead to the destruction of the bacterial cells. Experiments from other teams have revealed a similar mechanism is present in Listeria bacteria, which are also a common source of food poisoning. Dr Christopher Schuster, co-author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, added:  Many food preservation methods use salt to keep food fresh and prevent bacteria from multiplying. However, there are always some bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus that are resistant to these high salt levels, and survive. But if we can develop some form of treatment that interrupts these signalling molecules, we could ensure salt kills all of the bacteria.  The team are now further exploring this mechanism, in the hope of finding the exact way the signalling molecule regulates the transporter protein. They are also investigating what other types of molecular sponges are involved in this process.","Published: August 19, 2016"

They went in search of fresh ginger root.  Back at the lab, the scientists turned the ginger into what they are calling GDNPs, or ginger-derived nanoparticles. The process started simply enough, with your basic kitchen blender. But then it involved super-high-speed centrifuging and ultrasonic dispersion of the ginger juice, to break it up into single pellets. (Don't try this at home!) The research team, led by Dr. Didier Merlin with VA and the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University, believes the particles may be good medicine for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The particles may also help fight cancer linked to colitis, the scientists believe.  Efficiently targeting the colon Each ginger-based nanoparticle was about 230 nanometers in diameter. More than 300 of them could fit across the width of a human hair.  Fed to lab mice, the particles appeared to be nontoxic and had significant therapeutic effects:    Importantly, they efficiently targeted the colon. They were absorbed mainly by cells in the lining of the intestines, where IBD inflammation occurs.    The particles reduced acute colitis and prevented chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer.    They enhanced intestinal repair. Specifically, they boosted the survival and proliferation of the cells that make up the lining of the colon. They also lowered the production of proteins that promote inflammation, and raised the levels of proteins that fight inflammation.  Part of the therapeutic effect, say the researchers, comes from the high levels of lipids fatty molecules in the particles, a result of the natural lipids in the ginger plant. One of the lipids is phosphatidic acid, an important building block of cell membranes.  The particles also retained key active constituents found naturally in ginger, such as 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol. Past lab studies have shown the compounds to be active against oxidation, inflammation, and cancer. They are what make standard ginger an effective remedy for nausea and other digestion problems. Traditional cultures have used ginger medicinally for centuries, and health food stores carry ginger-based supplements such as chews, or the herb mixed with honey in a syrup as digestive aids.  Delivering these compounds in a nanoparticle, says Merlin's team, may be a more effective way to target colon tissue than simply providing the herb as a food or supplement.  Ginger could be cost-effective medicine source The idea of fighting IBD with nanoparticles is not new. In recent years, Merlin's lab and others have explored how to deliver conventional drugs via nanotechnology. Some of this research is promising. The approach may allow low doses of drugs to be delivered only where they are needed inflamed tissue in the colon and thus avoid unwanted systemic effects.  The advantage of ginger, say the researchers, is that it's nontoxic, and could represent a very cost-effective source of medicine.  The group is looking at ginger, and other plants, as potential ""nanofactories for the fabrication of medical nanoparticles.""  Merlin and his VA and Georgia State University coauthors elaborated on the idea in a report earlier this year titled ""Plant-derived edible nanoparticles as a new therapeutic approach against diseases.""

As a result, the cells can be used as a proxy to predict whether a patient is likely to experience drug-related heart damage.  The discovery validates the use of such cells to test the potential cardiotoxicity of certain drugs and to devise new therapies for conditions like cardiomyopathy. Pinpointing people who are likely to suffer heart damage before these people undergo treatment could increase the safety profile of many medications, the researchers believe.  Thirty percent of drugs in clinical trials are eventually withdrawn due to safety concerns, which often involve adverse cardiac effects,  said Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, director of Stanford s Cardiovascular Institute and professor of cardiovascular medicine and of radiology.  This study shows that these cells serve as a functional readout to predict how a patient s heart might respond to particular drug treatments and identify those who should avoid certain treatments.  Wu is the senior author of the study, which was published online in Cell Stem Cell. Cardiovascular medicine instructor Elena Matsa, PhD, is the lead author of the research. Testing the tissue The ability to create stem cells from easily obtained skin or blood samples has revolutionized the concept of personalized medicine and made it possible to create many types of human tissue for use in the clinic. Researchers have wondered, however, whether the process of creating stem cells, and subsequently coaxing those stem cells to become other tissues, might affect the patterns of gene expression and even the ways the specialized cells function. If so, these changes could limit their clinical usefulness. Matsa, Wu and their colleagues created heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, from iPS cells from seven people not known to have genetic predisposition to cardiac problems. They sequenced the RNA molecules made by the heart muscle cells to learn which proteins the cells were making, and how much. They then compared the results within individuals   looking at the gene expression patterns of cardiomyocytes derived from several batches of iPS cells from each person   as well as among all seven study subjects. They also investigated how the cardiomyocytes from each person responded to increasing amounts of two drugs, one called rosiglitazone that is sometimes used to treat Type 2 diabetes and another called tacrolimus that serves as an immunosuppressant to inhibit the rejection of transplanted organs. Each of the two drugs has been associated with adverse cardiac effects in some people, but it has not been possible to predict which patients will experience heart damage.    We found that the gene expression patterns of the iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes from each individual patient correlated very well,  said Matsa.  But there was marked variability among the seven people, particularly in genes involved in metabolism and stress responses. In fact, one of our subjects exhibited a very abnormal expression of genes in a key metabolic pathway.  Identifying an unusual response Heart muscle cells from this person, the researchers found, responded differently than the others to exposure to rosiglitazone. Concerns about its effect on cardiac function have caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market in Europe and have strictly limited its use in the United States.  This person s cells produced abnormal amounts of reactive oxygen species, were unable to regenerate their mitochondria and contracted much more weakly when exposed to rosiglitazone than cells derived from the other subjects,  said Matsa. Although the researchers were unable to identify a specific genetic mutation likely to cause such an outcome, they were able to pinpoint an important metabolic pathway involved in the response to the drug by comparing the subject s gene expression profile with that of the others whose cells were unaffected. They were also able to correct the defect by using a genome editing technique to boost the expression of a gene in the pathway and restore normal function. Finally, although the researchers showed that meaningful variability exists in the gene expression patterns of the seven individuals, they couldn t yet be certain that the iPS-derived cardiomyocytes faithfully replicated each person s native heart tissue. To investigate, they created iPS cells from another three people who had undergone either heart biopsies or transplants. They then compared the iPS-derived cardiomyocytes with the matching native heart tissue and confirmed that the gene expression patterns correlated in many significant ways   particularly for genes involved in metabolic pathways critical to cardiac function.  Many people talk about precision medicine or precision health, but there are only few examples of how to carry it out in a clinically meaningful way,  said Wu, who is also the Simon H. Stertzer, MD, Professor.  I think the patient-derived iPS cell platform gives us a surrogate window into the body and allows us to not only predict the body s function but also to learn more about key disease-associated pathways.

This is the main conclusion of a research project led by professor Diether Lambrechts and Dr. Bernard Thienpont (VIB-KU Leuven), which was published in the renowned scientific journal Nature. The findings are far-reaching, as the study also proved that maintaining a proper oxygen supply in tumors inhibits these so-called  epigenetic aberrations . The paper s insights could eventually lead to new anti-cancer drugs that target blood vessels or the epigenetic aberrations.  Cancer onset is generally well-understood: due to chance or carcinogenic factors, a single cell s DNA mutates, followed by the rapid expansion of the abnormal cell. These genetic mutations disturb normal cell function, but are beneficial for the growth and survival of cancer cells. But apart from these genetic changes, tumors cells also differ epigenetically, which has to do with how genes are expressed rather than the genes themselves.  Pertinent to a wide range of cancers Although epigenetic changes don t affect the genetic code, they can strongly disturb gene function in a similar way, to the benefit of cancer cells. But until now, the origins of these epigenetic changes mostly remained a mystery. Scientists from the lab of professor Lambrechts investigated one frequent epigenetic alteration: hypermethylation, or the excessive addition of methyl groups to DNA. Hypermethylation silences the expression of tumor suppressing genes, thereby enabling the aberrant behavior of cells and the excessive growth of tumors. Diether Lambrechts (VIB-KU Leuven):  Our study shows that these epigenetic alterations are caused by the environment of the tumor, and more specifically by oxygen shortage   which we call  hypoxia . Oxygen is required by the enzymes that normally remove the methyl groups from the DNA. When there is oxygen shortage, too much methylation is retained, causing hypermethylation. Even more, hypoxia explains up to half of the hypermethylation in tumors. While we dedicated much of our efforts to breast tumors, we also demonstrated that this mechanism has a similarly broad impact in bladder, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, lung and uterine tumors.  Diagnostic and therapeutic uses Uncovering the link between oxygen shortage and tumor growth was the result of the analysis of over 3,000 patient tumors. As a next step, the researchers verified another assumption: would interfering with tumor oxygen supply strike a blow against the progression of cancer? They were pleased to see this hypothesis confirmed: using mice, they proved that normalizing the blood supply is sufficient to stop the epigenetic alterations from occurring. Bernard Thienpont (VIB-KU Leuven):  Our new insights can have a potentially huge impact on cancer management. First of all, we could use epigenetic aberrations to monitor the oxygen supply to a tumor, allowing us to better predict tumor behavior and make more informed treatment decisions. Secondly, it sheds new light on existing blood vessel targeting therapies. They don t only help deliver chemotherapy to the tumor, but also inhibit new epigenetic aberrations. This could in turn help make relapses less aggressive, and thus prove to be therapeutically beneficial.  Next steps The first ambition is already in full swing: the VIB lab is now testing whether analyzing tumor DNA can be used to predict tumor oxygenation. The scientists are also engaged in new research that focuses on blood vessel normalizing therapies.  We want to know whether it s not just possible to inhibit, but maybe even to reverse some of these epigenetic aberrations. Following through on these and other new research avenues gives us great faith in the future of cancer research,  concludes prof. Lambrechts.","Published: August 19, 2016"

NGS will enhance BCI s DNA testing capabilities in solving missing persons cases in Ohio.      This will position BCI to be a national leader in DNA forensics,  said Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.  I am proud to work with Battelle on the future applications of this cutting-edge technology because it s a clear benefit to Ohio families of missing loved ones. With NGS at BCI, we hope to generate faster DNA results and obtain an expanded range of DNA information to help investigators make identifications.      Headquartered in Columbus, Battelle has spent five years implementing NGS technology in the field for the U.S. Department of Defense and was chosen to lead a National Institute of Justice (NIJ) project evaluating NGS methods in forensic labs around the country.   BCI and Battelle forensic scientists are now working together in the BCI London lab to validate and implement NGS technology in the BCI laboratory with the hope that this new technology can be used in Ohio missing persons forensic cases.  Collaborating with the Ohio Attorney General s Office and the illustrious BCI laboratory is a great opportunity for our scientists who are advancing this important technology,  said Dr. Jeffrey Wadsworth.  It puts Ohio in the leadership position of doing what others in the nation have not yet achieved and aligns with Battelle s core mission of investing in original research that will provide societal benefits.    Solving missing persons cases requires testing of DNA from human remains, often degraded tissue or weathered bones.  The human remains are then compared with DNA samples from potential family members of missing loved ones.  Specialized DNA testing required in these cases is not currently available at BCI.  The specialized testing is done at a federally-funded out-of-state lab, which can take up to six months for results, a long time for a family to wait. With this partnership, NGS testing will be done at the BCI laboratory in London, speeding up results.  And while the current specialized testing does not always return results if samples are extremely degraded, NGS testing can often do better and return a DNA profile.  The goal is to solve more missing persons investigations for Ohio families. Currently, there are approximately 600 missing children and 600 missing adults in Ohio.","Published: August 19, 2016"

Based on the agreement, BMS will supply OPDIVO  (nivolumab) to Bavarian Nordic for use in a clinical study. The trial, which will be sponsored by Bavarian Nordic, will enroll approximately 160 patients and will look to explore the benefit of combining CV301 with OPDIVO in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). OPDIVO is approved for treatment of patients with NSCLC in the second line setting, among other indications. CV301 targets two tumor-associated antigens, CEA and MUC-1, which are over-expressed in major cancer types, including lung, bladder and colorectal cancer. Similar to PROSTVAC , CV301 uses an off-the-shelf, prime/boost dosing schedule. CV301 incorporates a modified version of vaccinia (MVA-BN) as a priming dose, followed by multiple fowlpox boosts, and encodes the TRICOM costimulatory molecules. Preclinical data shows the ability of CV301 to up regulate PD-L1 by mounting an immune response against a tumor target. The up regulation of PD-L1 is a marker indicating the tumor is under attack from T-cells, presenting an opportunity for a greater response in patients who might otherwise not benefit from treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor alone.  We are extremely excited to announce this agreement between Bavarian Nordic and BMS. While we have discussed the potential benefit of combining our cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors for some time, this is now within reach as we have once again been able to strike an agreement with the leading immune-oncology company in the world, this time to explore the potential synergy between our programs to benefit patients with lung cancer. We look forward to the initiation of this study later this year,  stated Paul Chaplin, President and CEO of Bavarian Nordic. Bavarian Nordic continues to retain all commercial rights for CV301.

Compared to existing opioid pain relievers, like morphine, the new agent, called PZM21, was not ""reinforcing"" or prone to triggering potentially lethal respiratory impairment and was also less constipating. Also unlike existing analgesics, it had little effect on spinal cord reflexive responses, instead targeting the brain-mediated emotional/experiential component of pain. In addition to clinical potential, PZM21 also holds promise as a ""tool molecule"" for exploring the workings of brain pain systems, say the researchers. Read Next: Light not pain-killing drugs used to activate brain s opioid receptors The study represents the combined efforts of National Institutes of Health- (NIH-) funded research teams (US) led by Nobel laureate Brian Kobilka, MD, of Stanford University, Bryan Roth, MD, PhD, of the University of North Carolina, and Brian Shoichet, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco. They report on their findings in the journal Nature. They achieved PZM21's specificity by applying knowledge of opioid receptor structure to design an agent optimized for just the desired properties. Evidence suggested that the undesirable side effects of morphine-like opiates work on the receptor through a molecular signaling pathway linked to beta-arrestin, while the desired analgesic effects work through a G protein-coupled receptor pathway. The researchers screened and ranked more than 3 million compounds for these properties evaluating each in about 1.3 million configurations for their ability to tweak the opioid receptor in the desired ways. After exhaustive winnowing, they used the knowledge gained to synthesize the strongest G protein and weakest beta-arrestin activator. PZM21's unprecedented chemical structure then performed just as they had theorized in mouse tests of analgesic and side effect potential.

The Solana  Trichomonas Assay is intended for use only with the Solana  instrument.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 3.7 million people in the United States have trichomoniasis. This disease is more common in women and, because only about 30% of those infected develop symptoms of trichomoniasis, most infected persons do not know that they carry the parasite. In pregnant women, Trichomonas infection is often associated with preterm delivery and low body weight in newborns. Genital inflammation is often associated with disease and can facilitate infection by other sexually transmitted pathogens, including HIV. Importantly, trichomoniasis can be cured with a single dose of antibiotics, emphasizing the need for rapid, highly sensitive tests that can detect this parasite and prompt immediate treatment.  The Solana Trichomonas assay is an easy-to-use, rapid molecular diagnostic test that has superb clinical accuracy. The assay requires no upfront extraction of DNA and generates an accurate result in approximately 30 minutes.  The Solana molecular platform leverages the Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) technology that is resident in Quidel's AmpliVue  molecular product line to generate a fast and accurate test result. Solana can process up to 12 patient samples in each 30-minute run, thereby providing time-saving workflow advantages to healthcare professionals in moderately complex settings.

A research group at the University of Basel now describes for the first time a mechanism by which hippocampal neural stem cells regulate their own cell fate via the protein Drosha. The journal Cell Stem Cell has published their results. See Also: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the potential to differentiate into many cell types. However, the cell types that somatic stem cells produce are usually restricted to those of the organ in which they sit. The current view proposes that stem cell differentiation is controlled by their local environment, the so-called niche. Thus, stem cells receive and interpret specific factors present in their niche that guide their differentiation into specific and restricted cell types. In the adult brain, the hippocampus is responsible for specific forms of memory. This brain region is affected in diseases such as dementia, depression and epilepsy. The functions of the hippocampus are based on different cell types, some of which are generated throughout life by neural stem cells. Neural stem cells are generally accepted to produce three different cell types: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the adult hippocampus does not produce oligodendrocytes. The reason for this was so far not known. Researchers from the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel have now found that the fate of adult hippocampal stem cells is not only controlled by their local niche, but also by a cell-intrinsic mechanism. Their study describes the central role of the enzyme Drosha in this mechanism. Drosha degrades the messenger RNA for NFIB in the adult hippocampal stem cells and prevents the expression of this transcription factor which is necessary for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and thus blocks their development and therefore biases differentiation towards neurons. Read More: Stem cells in the brain: Limited self-renewal The team lead by Prof. Verdon Taylor was able to demonstrate for the first time a cell-intrinsic mechanism regulating stem cell fate.

See Also: Only a small portion of synapses may be active during neurotransmission Now a study conducted in mice by neurobiologists at Harvard Medical School (HMS) reveals that dismantling the docking stations that house these signal-carrying vessels does not fully disrupt signal transmission between cells. The team's experiments, described in the journal Neuron, suggest the presence of mechanisms that help maintain partial communication despite serious structural aberrations. ""Our results not only address one of the most fundamental questions about neuronal activity and the way cells in the brain communicate with each other but uncover a few surprises too,"" said Pascal Kaeser, senior author on the study and assistant professor of neurobiology at HMS. ""Our findings point to a fascinating underlying resilience in the nervous system."" Ultrafast signal transmission between neurons is vital for normal neurologic and cognitive function and takes place at the synapse between two neurons. At any given moment, neurotransmitter-carrying vesicles are on standby at designated docking stations, called active zones, each awaiting a trigger to release its load across the synaptic cleft and deliver it to the next neuron. Signal strength and speed are determined by the number of vesicles ready and capable of releasing their cargo to the next neuron. Read Next: Brain noise found to nurture synapses Neuroscientists have thus far surmised that destroying the docking stations that house neurotransmitter-loaded bubbles would cause all cell-to-cell communication to cease. The HMS team's findings suggest otherwise. To examine the relationship between docking stations and signal transmission, researchers analyzed brain cells from mice genetically altered to lack two key building proteins, the absence of which led to the dismantling of the entire docking station. When researchers measured signal strength in neurons with missing docking stations, they observed that those cells emitted much weaker signals when demand to transmit information was low. However, when stronger triggers were present, these cells transmitted remarkably robust signals, the researchers noticed. ""We would have guessed that signal transmission would cease altogether but it didn't,"" said Shan Shan Wang, a neuroscience graduate student in Kaeser's lab and a co-first author of the study. ""Yet, neurons appear to retain some residual communication even with a key piece of their communication apparatus missing."" Elimination of one active zone building block, a protein called RIM, led to a three-quarter reduction in the pool of vesicles ready for release. Disruption of another key structural protein, ELKS, resulted in one-third fewer ready-to-deploy vesicles. When both proteins were missing, however, the total reduction in the number of releasable vesicles was far less than expected. More than 40 percent of a neuron's vesicles remained in a ""ready to launch"" state even with the entire docking station broken down and vesicles failing to dock. Learn More: Researchers shed light on how neurons exchange neurotransmitters The finding suggests that not all launch-ready vesicles need to be docked in the active zone when a trigger arrives. Neurons, the researchers say, appear to form a remote critical reserve of vesicles that can be quickly marshaled in times of high demand. ""In the absence of a docking sites, we observed that vesicles could be quickly recruited from afar when the need arises,"" said Richard Held, an HMS graduate student in neuroscience and co-first author on the paper. The team cautions that any clinical implications remain far off, but say that their observations may help explain how defects in genes responsible for making neuronal docking stations may be implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-catalog-unprecedented-tool-for-disease-diagnosis-195739,Genetic Catalog Unprecedented Tool for Disease Diagnosis Largest collection of human exome sequence data yields unprecedented tool for diagnosing rare disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Based on the largest resource of its kind, members of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) led by scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard report scientific findings from data on the exome sequences (protein-coding portions of the genome) from 60,706 people from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Containing over 10 million DNA variants   many very rare and most identified for the first time   the ExAC dataset is a freely available, high-resolution catalog of human genetic variation that has already made a major impact on clinical research and diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. Featured in the August 18 issue of Nature, analysis of the data reveals properties of genetic variation undetectable in smaller data sets, for example, the first direct observation of mutations that arose multiple times independently among the samples   so-called  mutational recurrence.  The work also uncovers a class of genes that harbor less variation than expected, representing likely disease-causing DNA variants that are rare or absent in the population because they are so detrimental to human health. With immediate utility for clinical applications, the study further shows that the ExAC database improves the ability to evaluate candidate pathogenic variants in rare disease.  The success of ExAC was made possible by the willingness of our colleagues in many large, disease-focused consortia to openly share sequencing data,  said Daniel MacArthur, senior author of the study, co-director of the Program in Medical and Population Genetics at the Broad Institute, and an assistant professor at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Previous resources contained far fewer exomes without much ancestral diversity, so they were inadequate for studies of rare disease variants.  The scale and diversity of the ExAC resource is invaluable,  MacArthur added.  It gives us the ability to discover extremely rare variants and offers an unparalleled window into the roots of rare genetic diseases.  After collecting the raw data from tens of thousands of human exomes from research collaborators around the globe, the consortium relied upon the analytical and computational capabilities of the Broad Institute s Genomics Platform and Data Sciences and Data Engineering group to produce a catalog of human genetic variation of unprecedented resolution   roughly one variant every eight bases, or letters, of DNA. Many of these variants had never been reported and most are very rare, occurring in less than 1 in 10,000 people. With a patient s genome sequence in hand, a clinician can compare any rare mutations found in his or her genome with those in the ExAC database, shedding light on the genes and proteins that may underlie a patient s disorder. A variant found in a patient s DNA sequence that is extremely rare in ExAC, especially one that is predicted to disrupt the function of the resulting protein, then becomes a key suspect in causing the rare disease. Since its release to the scientific community in October 2014 the ExAC resource has had more than five million page views online, and has allowed clinicians to provide more accurate genetic diagnoses for thousands of rare disease patients.  The ExAC resource gives us incredible insight when evaluating a patient s genome sequence in the clinic,  said Heidi Rehm, medical director of the Broad s Clinical Research Sequencing Platform and chief laboratory director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Personalized Medicine. In clinical sequencing, many DNA variants are rare or understudied, so it is unclear if they have any effect on disease risk and whether they should be taken into consideration when diagnosing and treating patients. By looking at the frequencies of a patient s variants in the ExAC database, Rehm and her team can rule out those that are relatively common, allowing them to more quickly home in on the true disease-causing variants and avoid costly follow-up on benign ones. The resource has also been used by researchers to identify dozens of new rare genetic disorders.  In our own research, using the ExAC resource has allowed us to apply novel statistical methods to identify several new severe developmental disorders,  said Matthew Hurles, a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and frequent user of the ExAC database.  Resources such as ExAC exemplify the benefits that can be achieved for families coping with rare genetic diseases, as a result of the mass altruism of many research participants who allow their data to be aggregated and shared.  The ExAC database is also being used by researchers exploring the more fundamental effects of genetic variation, for example, looking at variation in transcription factor proteins and its impact on protein-protein interaction networks. Interestingly, variation that was expected, but not found, in the data offered new insight. Some genes were found to have less than the expected number of missense mutations, which change the protein sequence, or  loss-of-function  mutations, which obliterate protein function. With such a large sample size, the researchers were able to quantify the deficit of these types of mutation per gene, identifying a few thousand  highly constrained  genes for which natural selection has weeded out these mutations because their effects are so detrimental. With no knowledge about the diseases they cause and often no actual instances of these mutations in the ExAC database, the  missing variation  indicates that these highly constrained genes are likely to cause severe disease. If clinical or research sequencing reveals a loss-of-function or missense mutation in one of these genes in a patient s genome, it becomes a strong candidate for causing his or her rare disease. The ExAC data also revealed more than 100 previously reported disease-causing mutations to actually be benign, reducing the number of these false positive findings in databases widely used by clinical labs. This finding demonstrates the value of the ExAC database in assessing claims that specific mutations cause disease.  With its large sample size and high resolution across many populations, the ExAC database provides much greater power to interpret rare disease-causing variants than ever before, even for common diseases,  said Jose Florez, an institute member at the Broad, chief of the Diabetes Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.","Published: August 18, 2016"

The manuscript titled  The Spectrum of Clinical Utilities in Molecular Pathology Testing Procedures for Inherited Conditions and Cancer: A Report of the Association for Molecular Pathology  has been released online ahead of publication in the September 2016 issue of The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics. Molecular diagnostic procedures are used for a myriad of purposes including diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, prediction of future disease, and monitoring and selection of therapies of disease in patients. Future advancements in precision medicine are threatened by drastic shifts in evidence demands and the adoption of very narrow clinical utility definitions that do not address all the important applications of molecular diagnostic testing. Without a correction, treating clinicians could be left to make decisions without an accurate molecular diagnostic result and the clinically valuable information needed for patient management. In the manuscript, the AMP Framework for the Evidence Needed to Demonstrate (FEND) Clinical Utility Task Force recommends clinical utility definitions that appropriately recognize the full contribution and value of molecular diagnostic testing to improve patient care. This approach emphasizes that a clinical test result s utility depends on the context in which it is used to classify a patient s disease or disorder and/or guide management. The authors also note that the recommendations can be extended to additional applications of molecular testing.  Patient access to clinically useful and appropriate molecular diagnostic testing based upon realistic evidence levels is paramount and clinical utilities beyond therapeutic selection are valuable to patients, providers, and family members,  said Elaine Lyon, PhD, 2014 AMP President and FEND Task Force Co-chair.  Ultimately, we need to capture evidence for the clinical utility of molecular pathology procedures outside of a traditional randomized control trial setting, recognizing that any individual test result is an intermediate outcome that relies on proper clinical interpretation and utilization in context for that specific patient to achieve maximum benefit.   Molecular pathology testing procedures are vital tools for insight and analysis into various aspects of clinical practice,  said Roger D. Klein, MD, JD, AMP Professional Relations Chair.  However, we need a more practical and patient-centered approach for evaluating clinical usefulness before we can truly deliver the promise of precision medicine. ","Published: August 18, 2016"

Microbes are known to play crucial roles in regulating carbon fixation, as well as maintaining global cycles involving nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus and other nutrients, but the majority of them remain uncultured and unknown. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is targeting this  microbial dark matter  to better understand the planet s microbial diversity and glean from nature lessons that can be applied toward energy and environmental challenges. Plumbing the Earth s microbial diversity, though, requires learning more about the poorly-studied relationships between microbes and the viruses that infect them, viruses that impact the microbes  abilities to regulate global cycles. Although the number of viruses is estimated to be at least two orders of magnitude more than the microbial cells on the planet, there are currently less than 2,200 sequenced DNA virus genomes, compared to the approximately 50,000 bacterial genomes, in sequence databases. In a study published online August 17, 2016 in Nature, researchers at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, utilized the largest collection of assembled metagenomic datasets from around the world to uncover over 125,000 partial and complete viral genomes, the majority of them infecting microbes. This single effort increases the number of known viral genes by a factor of 16, and provides researchers with a unique resource of viral sequence information.  It is the first time that someone has looked systematically across all habitats and across such a large compendium of data,  said study senior author and DOE JGI Prokaryote Super Program head Nikos Kyrpides.  A key to uncover all these novel viruses was the sensitive computational approach we have developed along this work.   A key to uncover novel viruses  That approach, explained first author and postdoctoral fellow David Paez-Espino, involved using a non-targeted metagenomic approach, referencing both isolate viruses and manually curated viral protein models, and what he described as  the largest and most diverse dataset to date.  The team analyzed over 5 trillion bases (Terabases or Tb) of sequence available in the DOE JGI s Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome Samples (IMG/M) system collected from 3,042 samples around the world from 10 different habitat types. Their efforts to sift through the veritable haystack of datasets yielded over 125,000 viral sequences containing 2.79 million proteins. The team matched viral sequences against multiple samples in multiple habitats. For example, one viral group they identified was found in 95 percent of all samples in the ocean s twilight zone   a region located between 200 and 1,000 meters below the ocean surface where insufficient sunlight penetrates for microorganisms to perform photosynthesis. By analyzing a CRISPR-Cas system   an immune mechanism in bacteria that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements by incorporating short sequences from infecting viruses and phages   the team was able to generate a database of 3.5 million spacer sequences in IMG. These spacers, fragments of phage genetic sequences retained by the host, can then be used to explore viral and phage metagenomes for where the fragments may have originally come from. Also, using mainly this approach, the team computationally identified the host for nearly 10,000 viruses.  The majority of these connections were previously unknown, and include the identification of organisms serving as viral hosts from 16 prokaryotic phyla for which no viruses have previously been identified,  they reported. Beacons for CRISPR-Cas proteins Jan-Fang Cheng, head of the DOE JGI s Functional Genomics group, said the work being done by Kyrpides  group in identifying new viral sequences will help the Synthetic Biology group develop novel promoters that can work in many bacterial hosts.  We are constantly searching for regulatory DNA parts that will work across many different phyla, and that would allow us to build genes and pathways that can express in many different hosts.  Cheng also anticipated that the expanded viral sequence space generated by Kyrpides  team will allow researchers to look for other genetic sequences known as proto-spacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). These sequences lie next to spacer sequencers in phages and are used as beacons by CRISPR-Cas proteins, triggering actions such as editing or regulating a gene.  People are looking for new PAM sequences and new Cas9s, and with this new information, if you can map the spacer sequence back to the same phage and align them and see what s in common in neighboring sequences, then you could ID new PAM sequences.   We believe that the finding of many large phages including the longest phage genome reported thus far points to the limitations of conventional virome enrichment and sequencing strategies which may bias the studies against the highly novel viruses with unusual properties , said Natalia Ivanova, group lead in the Super Program and co-author of this study.  One of the most important aspects of this study is that we did not focus on a single habitat type. Instead, we explored the global virome and examined the flow of viruses across all ecosystems,  said Kyrpides.  We have increased the number of viral sequences by 50x, and 99 percent of the virus families identified are not closely related to any previously sequenced virus. This provides an enormous amount of new data that would be studied in more detail in the years to come. We have more than doubled the number of microbial phyla that serve as hosts to viruses, and have created the first global viral distribution map. The amount of analysis and discoveries that we anticipate will follow this dataset cannot be overstated. ","Published: August 18, 2016"

Under the terms o f the agreement, Vedanta will collaborate with a group of oncologists led by Jeffrey S. Weber, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Lang one and a renowned melanoma and immunotherapy expert, on clinical studies to support the identification of new microbiome immunotherapies for cancer. The studies will also explore mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients. Recent research published in Cell by Vedanta co - founder Dr. Kenya Honda at Keio University, has suggested that human - dwelling bacterial strains can activate immune cells in the gut that could be harnessed for immunotherapies. Vedanta has a worldwide, exclusive license to IP covering Dr. Honda s discovery. Other findings in the field indicate that gut bacteria can potentially modulate the therapeutic responses to checkpoint blockades, as well as other classes of cancer therapeutics.   Dr. Weber is a pioneer in translational research, particularly in immunotherapy and the development of checkpoint inhibitors,  said Dr. Bruce Roberts, Chief Scientific Officer of Vedanta.  We look forward to working with Dr. Weber to expand Vedanta s portfolio of immune activating microbial cocktails for use in standalone immunotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.   Checkpoint inhibitors are a major advance in cancer therapy, but many patients do not respond to therapy, and some patients who respond will eventually relapse,  said Dr. Weber.   Recent data suggest an important role for the microbiome in the anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy, and our other studies of the microbiome will offer interesting new clinical insights into how and why these treatments work. Further understanding of the role of the microbiome in immunotherapeutic responses against cancer may also lead to new and improved therapies. ","Published: August 18, 2016"

The research was supported by a grant from Innovate UK, the UK s innovation agency. Specifically, CHAIN has demonstrated a new way to change the stereochemistry of intracellular metabolism in Clostridia bacteria, resulting in the re-direction of carbon flow towards R-chiral chemicals rather than the natural S-form. This change in stereochemistry, referred to as the  Chiral Switch , resulted in the production of two new renewable chemical products; 1,3 butanediol and 3-hydroxybutyrate. During this project, CHAIN demonstrated the technical feasibility of applying the Chiral Switch  technology in several different species. The genetic modification was stabilised using advanced genetic tools to achieve chromosomal integration, and the fermentation conditions were optimised to increase product yield. The chiral purity and delivery of chiral chemicals in the correct R-enantiomeric form is critical to ensure safety and efficacy, especially when formulated into nutritional and pharmaceutical products. Currently, chiral chemicals are manufactured as by-products from oil-refining through unsustainable, complex and often costly chemical synthesis processes. In contrast, CHAIN s Chiral Switch  technology provides a new fermentation method for the production of specific R-chiral chemicals. The technology supports a cheaper, cleaner and more sustainable route to these high value chemicals. Clostridium is a genus of bacterium proven for industrial chemical production. Solvent producing strains have been used for commodity chemical (acetone and butanol) fermentation since the early 1900s. Recent technological breakthroughs have allowed the genetic manipulation of these economically and industrially important bacteria, unlocking their potential to make higher value fine chemicals. Edward Green, Chief Executive says,  CHAIN uses advanced gene editing tools for Clostridia and has demonstrated for the first time the use of synthetic biology for the production of novel and specific chiral chemicals in Clostridium. Our proprietary Chiral Switch, we have exemplified and patented, is a powerful mechanism that unlocks the commercial viability of the Clostridium chassis. This important breakthrough supports the production of specific high value chiral chemicals and demonstrates CHAIN s technology leadership with Clostridium bacteria. This innovation provides us with a significant competitive advantage for high value products and we are working with industry partners to translate the research into commercial opportunities.

The findings were published online in PLOS ONE by a team of National Institutes of Health researchers.  The PMI Cohort Program is a landmark longitudinal research effort that aims to engage 1 million or more U.S. participants to improve our ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetics. Participants will be invited to contribute a range of data about themselves via questionnaires, electronic health records and mobile or wearable devices. They will also undergo a baseline physical evaluation and provide blood and urine samples for analysis. These data, protected by essential privacy and security safeguards, will comprise a valuable national resource for researchers and citizen scientists studying a range of health conditions. NIH anticipates launching the PMI Cohort Program in phases, beginning later this year.  We are excited about engaging participants in this historic research effort,  said Kathy L. Hudson, Ph.D., NIH Deputy Director for Science, Outreach and Policy and a study author.  These survey results are extremely promising   they show that after people learn about the PMI Cohort Program, they re supportive, and they recognize the value in taking part.  The study authors analyzed responses of 2,601 people, selected randomly from a representative sample of the U.S. population. The survey, offered in English and Spanish, included questions to gauge public interest in the program and to learn about individuals  preferences concerning data collection, data sharing and involvement in various aspects of the program. After reading a short description of the PMI Cohort Program, 79 percent of the respondents expressed support for the program, and 54 percent said they would definitely or probably participate if asked. This level of support was fairly constant across racial and ethnic groups as well as other demographic categories.  The survey findings do not support the idea that people from communities that have historically been understudied in research are not interested in participating in this cohort. In contrast, in each demographic group..., at least 1 in 11 people (9 percent) said they would definitely participate if asked, would donate blood, and would take part for at least 10 years,  the authors wrote. Some groups showed a slightly higher or lower interest in participation. Higher percentages of younger people, college-educated people, and those who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) reported a willingness to take part. Those with fewer years of education and those ages 60 and above were less inclined to join.  These survey results suggest that people from all walks of life will be interested in the cohort program,  said Dave Kaufman, Ph.D., lead author and a program director at NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute.  But it may take some more thought and effort to engage older people and those with fewer years of education. These results were helpful in identifying areas where the PMI Cohort Program may want to focus outreach efforts, beyond the communities that have been historically underrepresented in research.  Other notable findings from the study included the following:   Respondents expressed high rates of willingness to share many types of personal data, such as blood samples (73 percent), genetic information (76 percent), a family medical history (77 percent), soil and water samples from their home (83 percent) and data on their lifestyle, diet and exercise (84 percent). In contrast, of those with social media accounts, only 43 percent said they would share social media information.   In considering the value of various incentives for participation, 90 percent of respondents felt it was important to receive information about their health. When asked what types of information they would like, 75 percent wanted lab results (such as cholesterol and blood sugar levels), 75 percent wanted genetic information, 68 percent wanted a copy of their medical records, and 60 percent wanted information about other research studies relevant to their health.   Seventy-six percent of respondents agreed that  research participants and researchers should be equal partners in the study.  In particular, respondents felt that it was important for participants to help decide what kinds of research are appropriate, what to do with study results and what research questions to answer. The authors cautioned against using these initial results to predict specific enrolment figures for the PMI Cohort Program, noting that the people who chose to respond to this survey may view research more favourably than the general population. They also emphasized that retention would be an important element of the program s success, as well as enrolment.  To sustain participants  commitment over the long term, researchers must continue working as part of the study communities,  said Dr. Kaufman.  Participants offer terrific ideas and insights when researchers earn their trust. ","Published: August 18, 2016"

Moreover, greater numbers of Plasmodium parasites correlated with increased rates of Ebola survival, according to a dozen collaborating research groups in the new study, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases. The survival difference was evident even after controlling for Ebola viral load and age. Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), led the project. At a joint diagnostic laboratory established in Liberia by NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the scientists tested 1,868 blood samples. The samples were from people seeking care for possible Ebola virus infection at the ELWA3 Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia. Testing confirmed Ebola virus infection in 1,182 samples; 956 of them were tested for Plasmodium parasites, and 185 were positive. Fifty-eight percent with both infections survived, compared to 46 percent who were infected with Ebola virus alone. Of the people with the highest Plasmodium levels, 83 percent survived. Anti-malaria drugs were routinely administered to all patients seen at the Treatment Unit during the Ebola outbreak and had no bearing on the increased survival in Plasmodium-infected patients in the study, the researchers say.  Moreover, in separate experiments conducted in the United States, treatment with antimalarials did not affect survival in laboratory mice infected with Ebola virus. The research group is working to pinpoint a mechanism that could explain the association between Plasmodium infection and surviving an Ebola infection. If a connection is found, they say it might improve understanding of disease caused by Ebola and open possibilities for developing new treatments.","Published: August 18, 2016"

The researchers use a phenomenon called  Raman scattering:  when a laser strikes a molecule it kicks back the laser energy as photons of light at a variety of wavelengths that depend on the structure and composition of the molecule. To allow this phenomenon to occur on a chip, researchers fire a laser into a waveguide   a strip of transparent material made of titanium dioxide, where the light bounces off the inside surfaces and becomes confined to the waveguide. Because a waveguide is only a few nanometers (billionths a meter) high, the light waves spread out beyond the waveguide, creating a so-called  evanescent field  above the surface of the chip. The pumping laser can induce Raman scattering in the space above the chip, or in a drop of liquid placed on its surface for analysis, while still confining the light wave to the chip. Light kicked back by the excited molecules also follows the waveguide; a prism at the end of the waveguide can spread that light into a spectrum that is a  fingerprint  identifying the molecule that produced it.  If you need a chemical sensor in the lab, that is not a problem,  said Jin Suntivich, assistant professor of materials science and engineering.  But when you are outside, finding a chemical sensor that you can take with you is a challenge. We want to develop a technology that is small enough for a phone, such that your personal electronics can constantly monitor the world around you, and the moment you see something out of the ordinary, the sensor can tell you what it is.  Sensors based on Raman scattering have been made before, using silicon nitride waveguides. The Cornell researchers have come up with a design that could make a sensor more sensitive and small enough to be used in the field by using a new material, titanium dioxide.  We re not the first but we re the best,  said Christopher Evans, a Kavli Postdoctoral Fellow in the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics and the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science. Evans is first author of paper describing the new approach published in the July 14 online edition of the American Chemical Society journal ACS Photonics. Co-authors are Suntivich and Chengyu Liu, a doctoral student in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics. Titanium dioxide has a much higher refractive index, making a greater contrast with the space above the chip, which creates a stronger evanescent field. The material is also transparent to light at visible wavelengths, a condition that allows researchers to use a laser at shorter, visible wavelengths, which induce better scattering. The researchers tested with a green laser pointer as a light source. For a future device, a tiny laser unit can be built into a chip, as can a component that can spread out the wavelengths of the kicked off light onto a photosensitive device to read the spectrum. One possibility is to read the spectrum with the camera in a phone. Interaction of the pumping laser with the material above the chip increases with the length of the waveguide. But the researchers also offer a way to increase the interaction without having to make the chip larger. The solution is a  ring resonator.  When a circular waveguide is set tangent to a straight guide, some of the light will enter the ring and continue to circle around it, letting the light interact continually with the material above the chip many times. The circumference of the ring can be adjusted to resonate with the wavelength of the light, intensifying the effect.  We have shown that we can increase the amount of peak signal from our sensors by an order of magnitude (or more), while simultaneously reducing the device footprint down to the cross-section of a human hair,  Evans said.","Published: August 18, 2016"

UC Berkeley researchers have now found a way to boost the efficiency with which CRISPR-Cas9 cuts and disables genes up to fivefold, in most types of human cells, making it easier to create and study knockout cell lines and, potentially, disable a mutant gene as a form of human therapy. Scientists are constantly discovering new genes or the proteins they code for, but it s much harder to figure out their role in the body or in disease. Key to discovering this role is disabling the gene to see what happens when it s removed. While CRISPR-Cas9 can accelerate the process of making knockout cell lines, researchers must sometimes make and screen many variations of the genetic scissors to find one that works well. The UC Berkeley researchers found that this process can be made many times more efficient with a simple tweak. The key is introducing into the cell, along with the CRISPR-Cas9 protein, short pieces of DNA that do not match any DNA sequences in the human genome. The short pieces of DNA, called oligonucleotides, seem to interfere with the DNA repair mechanisms in the cell to boost the editing performance of even mediocre CRISPR-Cas9s between 2  and 5 times.  It turns out that if you do something really simple   just feed cells inexpensive synthetic oligonucleotides that have no homology anywhere in the human genome   the rates of editing go up as much as five times,  said lead researcher Jacob Corn, the scientific director of UC Bekeley s Innovative Genomics Initiative and an assistant adjunct professor of molecular and cell biology. The technique boosts the efficiency of all CRISPR-Cas9s, even those that initially failed to work at all. With higher efficiency, researchers will have better success at creating the knockouts they want, and then using those knockout cell lines to explore the function of a gene or a group of genes. Because most long-lived cell lines are derived from cancer cells   including the very popular HeLa cell line   these cell lines typically have more than the normal two copies of each gene. This can make it difficult to knock out all copies at once, and higher efficiency greatly increases the chance of success. High efficiency also is essential when knocking out genes to correct hereditary mutations in humans. Physicians have speculated about knocking out genes that make people susceptible to infectious diseases, such as AIDS, or prone to autoimmune, inflammatory or neurodegenerative disorders. It remains to be seen whether the approach described by Corn and colleagues could be used in a therapeutic context, but it is very effective for research purposes. The results will be reported in the online journal Nature Communications. DNA repair key to CRISPR-Cas9 success The CRISPR-Cas9 molecule consists of a protein scissors, the Cas9 protein, and an address telling Cas9 where to bind the DNA and cut. The technique relies upon the fact that when you cut DNA, the cell s repair mechanisms don t always correctly rebuild the DNA strand, but make an error in the sequence that disables the gene and knocks out its activity. Tha address, called a guide RNA, is a string of 20 ribonucleic acid molecules that are complementary to the DNA sequence of the target gene. This guide RNA binds to the DNA like a strip of Velcro, setting up Cas9 to cut the double-stranded DNA. Why some guide RNAs work well, setting up Cas9 to cut and disable a gene nearly 100 percent of the time, while others bind but seldom or never knock out the gene, has been a puzzle since the technique was invented by Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier of Umea University in 2012. The cutting efficiency varies with the type of cell and the particular cell line, Corn said. Corn suspected that Cas9 s occasionally poor cutting efficiency might be related to how DNA is repaired, since DNA repair mechanisms   the basic housekeeping enzymes that fix any breaks or deletions in the DNA that might lead to a deadly mutation   differ from cell to cell. He reasoned that random strands of DNA   none of them similar to any actual human DNA (that is, non-homologous)   might confuse the repair process and improve the knockout success rate.  It gives the cell a little kick to prevent normal repair from happening,  he said. He portrays CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing as a competition between cutting and DNA repair: once Cas9 cuts, the cell exactly replaces the cut DNA, which Cas9 cuts again, in an endless cycle of cut and repair until the repair enzymes make a mistake and the gene ends up disfunctional. Perhaps, he said, the oligonucleotides decrease the fidelity of the repair process, or make the cell switch to a more error-prone repair that allows Cas9 to more readily break the gene. The next frontier, he said, is trying to take advantage of the peculiarities of DNA repair to improve sequence insertion, in order to replace a defective gene with a normal gene and possibly cure a genetic disease.","Published: August 18, 2016"

HCM, which affects one in 500 people, is an often-asymptomatic thickening of the heart muscle that can spark fatal arrhythmias in seemingly healthy young adults. The notion that genetic tests could misread benign genetic alterations as disease-causing mutations is not entirely new. But this study is believed to be the first one to trace the root of the problem to racially biased methodologies in early studies that defined certain common genetic variants as causes of HCM. Indeed, the analysis reveals that in the case of HCM, the false positive diagnoses stemmed from inadequately designed clinical studies that used predominantly white populations as control groups. White Americans harbor far fewer benign mutations on several genes implicated in HCM than black Americans. The higher rate of benign alterations in the latter group can cause test results to be misread as abnormal, the researchers say. Using statistical simulations, the HMS team demonstrated that including even small numbers of black participants in the original studies would have improved test accuracy and, consequently, helped avert some of the false-positive diagnoses. The findings, the researchers say, highlight the importance of interpreting genetic test results against diverse control populations to ensure that normal variations of genetic markers common in one racial or ethnic group do not get misclassified as disease-causing in another.                                                                                                                                   The team says their findings point to a pressing need to re-evaluate decades-old genetic studies by using new racially diverse sequencing data.  We believe that what we re seeing in the case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be the tip of the iceberg of a larger problem that transcends a single genetic disease,  said study first author Arjun Manrai, a research fellow in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.  We hope our study motivates a systematic review of this issue across other genetic conditions. Aside from the emotional toll that a genetic misdiagnosis can take on individuals and families, the researchers say their findings represent a cautionary tale with a broad relevance to geneticists, clinicians and policy-makers alike.  Our study powerfully illustrates the importance of racial and ethnic diversity in research,  says Zak Kohane, senior investigator on the study and chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.  Racial and ethnical inclusiveness improves the validity and accuracy of clinical trials and, in doing so, can better guide clinical decision-making and choice of optimal therapy. This is the essence of precision medicine.  In the current study, the team analyzed more than 8,000 DNA samples stored in three national databases   the National Institutes of Health s Mendelian Exome Sequencing Project, the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project. Five genetic variants   each of them benign   accounted for 75 percent of all genetic variation across populations. However, the team found, these five mutations occurred disproportionately in black Americans. Between 2.9 and 27 percent of black Americans harbored one or more such variants, compared with 0.02 to 2.9 percent of white Americans. Next, researchers examined records of more than 2,000 patients and family members tested at a leading genetic laboratory between 2004 and 2014. Seven patients received reports indicating they harbored disease-causing mutations that were subsequently reclassified as benign. Five of the seven patients were black, and two were of unspecified ancestry. Researchers say it remains unclear how many of the seven patients had been re-contacted to communicate the change in test results. The investigators caution that test results from a single genetic lab are not necessarily representative of the scope of the problem nationally, but say their findings likely point to a discrepancy that goes beyond a single laboratory and a single condition. To trace the root of the misclassifications, researchers reviewed the five original studies that shaped early understanding of genetic variants and their role in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. All of them, the researchers found, analyzed small population sizes, and none indicated that black people were included in the control groups. But, the investigators add, even small studies can avert misclassification of genetic variants as long they include racially diverse populations. Using statistical simulation, the team showed that a sample of 200 people that included 20 black participants would have only 50 percent chance of correctly ruling out a harmful mutation. The same sample would have more than an 80 percent accuracy if a third of patients were black and more than 90 percent accuracy if half of them were black. Investigators say the newly created Exome Aggregation Consortium   a compilation of data from various large-scale sequencing projects that includes DNA from more than 60,000 individuals   is well-powered to discern between harmful and benign mutations even for relatively rare genetic variants and should help in the reanalysis of decades-old data. The latest clinical guidelines urge physicians to interpret genetic test results by cross-referencing them against racially matched controls. However, with expanding efforts to sequence DNA from various ethnic and racial groups, researchers say more genetic variants will be reclassified in the next decade. Interpreting the meaning of test results within the context of such rapidly evolving knowledge will pose a serious challenge for clinicians. One way to address the problem, the HMS team says, could be the use of point-of-care risk calculators to help clinicians and genetic counselors more precisely gauge the significance of a given genetic variant. Such risk calculators would use algorithms that incorporate statistical probability, race, ethnicity and family history to help sift variant noise from truly pathogenic mutations.  Ensuring that genomic medicine benefits all people and all populations equally is nothing short of a moral imperative, not only for scientists and clinicians but for political and health policy powers that be,  Kohane said.","Published: August 18, 2016"

Patient recruitment will begin in the UK at Manchester's Christie NHS Foundation Trust following Research Ethics approval, which is expected during the coming weeks. Further regulatory and Research Ethics approvals are also expected shortly at various sites across Europe in this multi-centre study. The STEM (SFX-01 in the Treatment and Evaluation of Metastatic Breast Cancer) trial will investigate SFX-01 in combination with different hormone-based therapies in 60 metastatic breast cancer patients whose cancer cells are estrogen-receptor positive (ER+). The primary objectives of the STEM trial are to evaluate safety and efficacy (via tumour imaging) in patients starting to become resistant to mainstream hormone therapy. Patients will be enrolled into one of three study arms (SFX-01 in combination with either aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen or fulvestrant) based on their current therapy. One proposed mechanism for the generation of resistance to hormone therapy is via the proliferation of hormone-independent breast cancer stem cells. Such cells are known to proliferate during treatment with hormonal agents and it is thought they could have the effect of repopulating the tumour to render it hormone-independent. Earlier work by the Company with xenograft models suggests that SFX-01 has the effect of reducing the number of hormone-independent cancer stem cells. The STEM trial will be led by Chief Investigator Dr Sacha Howell at Manchester's Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Europe's largest single-site cancer centre, and include several other sites across Europe. The first patient is expected to be recruited in October 2016. Evgen Pharma's SFX-01 is a synthetic and stabilised version of the naturally occurring plant compound sulforaphane, a known anti-cancer agent and neuro-protective. Dr Stephen Franklin, CEO of Evgen Pharma, commented: ""Many therapies used in cancer ultimately fail as patients develop resistance - one hypothesis is that this resistance is driven by cancer stem cells which, unlike a mature cancer cell, do not respond to current standards of care. Our excitement with SFX-01 is that it targets the cancer stem cell population and therefore has the potential to improve the efficacy and longevity of a range of drugs used in cancer therapy - both approved drugs and those in clinical development. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Dr Sacha Howell and colleagues at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust and the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute for their steadfast support and encouragement.""","Published: August 18, 2016"

Now, researchers at the Salk Institute have identified a connection between ApoE4 and protein build-up associated with Alzheimer's that provides a possible biochemical explanation for how extra ApoE4 causes the disease. See Also: Novel gene therapy approach to treat Alzheimer s ""The big picture here is that we've found a very different way of thinking about how the proteins in Alzheimer's disease might be regulated,"" says Alan Saghatelian, Salk professor and holder of the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair in Salk's Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology. Their findings, which appear in the Journal of the American Chemical Society underscore the importance of looking at genes and proteins not classically associated with Alzheimer's to make progress in understanding the disease. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease the subset of the disorder occurring in people age 65 and over affects more than 5 million Americans, and is characterized by progressive memory loss and dementia. Scientists have put forth a variety of hypotheses on its causes, including the accumulation of protein clusters called beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. Read Next: Researchers identify potential gene that may increase risk of Alzheimer s disease in African Americans Apolipoprotein E comes in three versions, or variants, called ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4. All the ApoE proteins have the same normal function: carrying fats, cholesterols and vitamins throughout the body, including into the brain. While ApoE2 is protective and ApoE3 appears to have no effect, a mutation in ApoE4 is a well-established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Previous reports have suggested that ApoE4 may affect how the brain clears out beta-amyloid, but what was happening at the molecular level wasn't clear. ""ApoE4 is the most predictive genetic change for late onset Alzheimer's, but no one has really understood what's going on at the molecular level,"" says Saghatelian. Scientists had previously uncovered hints, however, that ApoE4 might degrade differently than the other variants, but the protein that carried out this breakdown of ApoE4 was unknown. To find the protein responsible for degrading ApoE4, Saghatelian and research associate Qian Chu, first author of the new paper, screened tissues for potential suspects and homed in on one enzyme called high-temperature requirement serine peptidase A1 (HtrA1). When they compared how HtrA1 degraded ApoE4 with ApoE3, they found that the enzyme processed more ApoE4 than ApoE3, chewing ApoE4 into smaller, less stable fragments. The researchers confirmed the observation in both isolated proteins and human cells. The finding suggests that people with ApoE4 could have less ApoE overall in their brain cells and more of the breakdown products of the protein. ""There's been an idea tossed around that ApoE4 breakdown products could be toxic,"" said Saghatelian. ""Now, knowing the enzyme that breaks it down, we have a way to actually test this idea."" Learn More: Early warning gene signature for Alzheimer'sBut it's not just a lack of full-length ApoE or an increase in its fragments that may be causing Alzheimer's in people with ApoE4. Saghatelian and Chu also found that ApoE4--because it binds so well to HtrA1--keeps the enzyme from breaking down the tau protein, responsible for tau tangles associated with Alzheimer's. ""People have thought about tau or amyloid beta as things that cause Alzheimer's, but this suggests that we need to think more globally about proteins that could be impacting tau or amyloid through biochemical pathways,"" Saghatelian said. The results need be tested and confirmed in animal studies before researchers can be sure that HtrA1 is the link between ApoE4 and Alzheimer's in humans. But if they hold true, they could point toward a better understanding of the disease and potential new treatment strategies. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

A study of 1.3 million pregnant women suggests antipsychotic medication early in pregnancy was not associated with a meaningful increase in the risk of birth defects when other mitigating factors were considered, although the medication risperidone needs further research, according to the work published in JAMA Psychiatry. See Also: Antidepressants during pregnancy linked to preterm birth Krista Huybrechts, MS, PhD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and coauthors used a nationwide Medicaid (US) database for their analyses and defined exposure to antipsychotics as filling at least one prescription during the first trimester (90 days) of pregnancy. The authors evaluated typical (older) and atypical (newer) antipsychotic medications. Among the more than 1.3 million women, 9,258 women (0.69 percent) filled a prescription for an atypical antipsychotic during the first trimester and 733 women (0.05 percent) filled a prescription for a typical antipsychotic, according to the results. The most frequently used atypical antipsychotic was quetiapine, followed by aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone. Overall, 32.7 per 1,000 births not exposed to antipsychotics were diagnosed with congenital malformations compared with 44.5 per 1,000 births exposed to atypical antipsychotics and 38.2 per 1,000 births exposed to typical antipsychotics, according to the results. While unadjusted analyses suggested an increased risk of birth defects with atypical antipsychotics, the authors report they observed no significant increased risk of birth defects for typical or atypical antipsychotics after accounting for coexisting mental and physical conditions and their associated behaviors, with the possible exception of risperidone. Authors warn the small increase in risk with rispedicone must be interpreted with caution because there is not a biological mechanism that readily explains the outcome: ""This finding should therefore be interpreted as a potential safety signal that will require follow-up in other studies.""

Patients often recover. But in the days or weeks following the hit, they can develop other serious, chronic conditions, such as depression and thinking and memory problems. Now scientists report in the journal ACS Nano a potential way to reduce these effects with a neuron-targeting nanoparticle, using an animal model of TBI. See Also: Impact of traumatic brain injury on long-term memory explored When someone suffers from a head injury, the damage doesn't necessarily stop after the initial blow.

One promising approach to treating these after-effects involves delivering short stretches of RNA that can help shut down this chain reaction.

Pheromones released by females draw the attention of male mice and trigger courtship and mating behavior. Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a specific kind of neuron only in male mice that detects a pheromone in female urine. But the sex difference is not hard-wired. By manipulating the mice's living conditions and exposing male mice to female scents for long periods of time, the scientists showed that males lost these neurons and their interest in courting females. See Also: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells The study, published in Neuron, describes how neurons in the nose adapt to experience, and helps explain differences among individuals and between the sexes. ""Obviously people have different brains. We think differently, we act differently,"" said Timothy Holy, PhD, an associate professor of neuroscience and the study's senior author. ""There's been a lot of interest over the years in trying to understand what it is that makes one brain different than another brain. In this case, the differences between males and females was due not to innate factors as you might expect for a pheromone-sensing system but instead to different sensory experiences."" Holy and former graduate student Pei Sabrina Xu, PhD, screened hundreds of thousands of neurons in mice's vomeronasal organs, a structure in the nose that detects pheromones as well as other chemical signals. The vast majority of the neurons were the same between the sexes, but one subset was present in the males but absent from the females. That subset specifically detects epitestosterone sulfate, a possible byproduct of sex hormones. But was the difference in their neurons due to nature or nurture? In the lab, male and female mice are kept in separate cages, so females are chronically exposed to female pheromones in their own urine and that of their cage-mates. Similarly, males are exposed to male pheromones, but neither males nor females are exposed to the scents of the opposite sex. ""To get to the bottom of the nature vs. nurture question, I exposed males to females and females to males, so that they were all in the same sensory environment,"" said Xu, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. ""We found that under these conditions, the distribution of neurons in males and females actually looks the same."" Learn More: Rats  brains may  remember  odor experienced while under general anesthesia, study suggests The males that were exposed to female urine for two months lost the neurons that responded to the female pheromone. With the loss of such neurons, the males also lost their interest in sniffing around female urine. For female mice which had no such neurons to begin with exposure to male urine had no effect on the types of neurons in their noses. When the sexes were segregated again, the males re-acquired the pheromone-sensitive neurons. Male and female mice differ not only in living arrangements but in exposure to sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen that their own bodies produce. To find out whether sex hormones affect the number of neurons devoted to detecting female pheromones, the researchers removed the testes from male mice and the ovaries from females. ""The neuronal types were not changed in ovariectomized females nor castrated males,"" Xu said. ""That tells us it's not a hormonal effect but dominated by sensory experience."" In most mouse species, males maintain separate territories from females, so they encounter female urine only occasionally, and then they respond with great interest. In nature, they would likely never be so chronically exposed to female pheromones that they would lose the ability to detect them. Females, on the other hand, could never escape their own scents. The result is a neurological sex difference based on environmental, rather than genetic or hormonal, differences between the sexes. ""We looked at sex differences, but the tools we used large-scale imaging of neuronal activity at cellular resolution could be used to study any kind of differences between individuals, not just in the nose but elsewhere in the brain,"" Xu said. ""We showed that it's possible to detect the very tiny fraction of neurons that are functioning differently between individuals, and then look for the factors that drive that difference."" Read Next: Researchers dispute 2014 claim that humans can distinguish 1 trillion odors The process identified in this study in which overexposure to a molecule results in loss of the neurons that detect that molecule could be part of a neurological mechanism to balance the ability to detect common and rare sensory cues, according to Holy. ""In the lab, this is an all-or-none process, but that's probably because it's a very controlled sensory environment with limited cues,"" Holy said. ""In the wild, the animals would be exposed to a wide variety of scents, and this process probably modulates the proportion of neurons responding to each scent, rather than making some neurons disappear entirely. I would guess that this mechanism helps ensure balance in what the animal can detect, so that, if it's getting a lot of information about a particular class of molecule, it turns down that channel of information and that leaves more capacity to pick up other cues that it's not detecting as well right now.""

The enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH) is essential for metabolic processes of parasites that are responsible for the spread of three diseases: Leishmaniases, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness. As such, understanding the enzyme s structure could help researchers figure out how to inhibit FH enzymes, thereby providing new medical therapies.  This enzyme is really critical for the metabolism of organisms like Leishmania major,  says Catherine Drennan, an MIT professor whose lab hosted the research.  If you knock it out, the organism should be dead.  Leishmaniases are a group of diseases varying from severe skin ulcers to debilitation of internal organs, and are present in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Southern Europe. Chagas disease, located mostly in Latin America, causes cardiac and intestinal complications, and can lead to heart failure. Sleeping sickness affects humans and other animals and is an often-deadly disease concentrated in Africa. The study of FH began at the University of S o Paulo, where researchers Patricia R. Feliciano and M. Cristina Nonato made important progress on studying Leishmania major FH. Feliciano then moved to MIT to complete the analysis of the enzyme structure with Drennan, a professor of chemistry and biology, and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  The exciting thing about this is thinking that my work could help people who have those diseases,  says Feliciano. The paper,  Crystal structure of an Fe-S cluster-containing fumarate hydratase enzyme from Leishmania major reveals a unique protein fold,  is being published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The authors are Feliciano, Drennan, and Nonato. First in class Fumarate hydratase enzymes fall into two types, class I and class II. The current study represents the first time that a class I fumarate hydratase enzyme has been mapped. Significantly, the Leishmania major FH enzyme has a protein architecture   it vaguely resembles a human heart in appearance   that is distinctive from the structure of human fumurate hydratase.  When we looked at the structure for the first time, it was like,  Whoa, it is completely different from the human FH enzyme,  says Feliciano.  The fact that it is a novel fold does add to the idea that this is a good drug target,  Drennan adds.  It has a lot of potential.  Here s why: The distinctive structure of class I FH makes it possible that drugs could target the parasite variant of the enzyme alone, while leaving intact the functionally equivalent enzymes that humans use.  It s an enzyme that does the exact same thing, but it s a completely different enzyme,  Drennan explains.  That s what makes this such an exciting target.  Brazil connection The finding stems from work Feliciano started doing nine years ago in Brazil in Nonato s lab, but was not able to complete at the time, in part because of difficulties accessing the right equipment. In 2012 Feliciano arrived at MIT, where the Drennan Lab has tools that let researchers form crystals of proteins under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions. Having formed a crystal of the Leishmania major FH enzyme, it still took Feliciano several months to completely map out the enzyme s structure, partly because of its complexity, she notes. Drennan emphasizes the complementary aspects of the research arrangement, with the research problem identified and important groundwork accomplished in Brazil, while MIT provided the right tools to solve the enzyme structure, and with the results hopefully having long-term application in Latin America and Africa.  It s a really lovely collaboration between the two groups and two countries,  Drennan says. For that matter, Drennan says, the nature of globalization means diseases can spread worldwide in relatively short timespans these days. That means the need to find remedies for Leishmaniases, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness is potentially global, too.  I think it s important to reflect on these health issues, and more people in the U.S. need to be aware of these diseases,  Drennan says.  The world is getting to be a smaller place.

It is essential for making bread, beer and wine, and it is ubiquitous. It is not, however, typical of the more than 1,500 yeast species found around the world. Yeasts are physically hard to distinguish, and it is easy to think they are all the same. Metabolically, genetically and biochemically, however, yeasts are highly diverse. Characteristics such as their thick cell walls and tolerance of pressure changes that could rupture other cells mean yeasts are easily scaled up for industrial processes. In addition, they are easy to grow and modify and, with notable exceptions such as Candida albicans, most are not associated with human illness. While these capabilities can be used for a wide range of biotechnological applications, including biofuel production, so far industry has only harnessed a fraction of the diversity available among yeast species. To help boost the use of a wider range of yeasts and to explore the use of genes and pathways encoded in their genomes, a team led by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 29 yeasts, including 16 whose genomes were newly sequenced and annotated. In the study published the week of August 15, 2016 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the team mapped various metabolic pathways to yeast growth profiles.  Obtaining a complete genome of a microbe that is industrially important greatly stimulates research in the area,  said senior author Tom Jeffries, Professor Emeritus at University of Wisconsin, Madison, of the work.  This is particularly true when the genomic sequence is accompanied by a high-quality annotation of the genes, and the JGI annotation pipeline is one of the best in the field. We can expect an explosive interest in yeast biology in the coming years.  Yeast genetic diversity wider than expected Yeasts (which belong to the  kingdom  of fungi) can use a wide range of carbon and energy sources, ranging from cellulosic (6-carbon) and hemicellulosic (5-carbon) sugars to methanol, glycerol, and acetic acid. Products include ethanol and other alcohols, esters, organic acids, carotenoids, lipids, and vitamins. In fact vitamin complexes and some nutritional supplements are derived from yeasts.  We sequenced these diverse genomes to expand the catalog of genes, enzymes, and pathways encoded in these genomes for producing biofuels and bio-based products we use in daily life,  said Igor Grigoriev, JGI Fungal Program Head and co-senior author of the manuscript. Sequencing these less-known yeasts and characterizing their metabolic pathways, added study first author Robert Riley of the DOE JGI, helps fill in knowledge gaps regarding the fungal enzymes that can help convert a wide range of sugars into biofuel. The well-known yeast S. cerevisiae, for example, ferments glucose, but not the full range of sugars found in plant biopolymers. One of the newly-sequenced yeasts is Pachysolus tannophilus, which can ferment xylose, otherwise known as wood sugar as it is derived from hemicellulose, which along with cellulose, is one of the main constituents of woody biomass. It is only distantly related to well-studied xylose fermenters such as Scheffersomyces stipitis   another yeast sequenced by the DOE JGI. These distances are huge.  We might think of yeasts as simple unicellular, creatures similar to each other, but in fact their genetic diversity is like the difference between human and invertebrate sea squirt,  said Riley.  We sequenced these diverse genomes to discover and facilitate the next generation of biotechnological workhorse yeasts for producing the fuels and products we use in daily life. We also discovered a genetic code change that, if not understood, will impede the yeasts  biotechnological use.  Genetic code reassignment  In P. tannophilus, the team found a change in one of the three-letter codons that represent one of the 20 regularly used amino acids. That change from CUG-Ser to CUG-Ala is only the second observed case of a non-stop codon reassignment (a change from one amino acid to another, rather than from one amino acid to a stop codon) in nuclear genomes.  While we don t know why and how this happened,  said Grigoriev.  Genes with CUG codons may not produce functional proteins when expressed in an organism with different genetic code as will code for a different amino acid.   The CUG-Ala reassignment is important to biotechnology because in order to express novel biotechnologically useful genes from diverse yeasts into workhorses like Saccharomyces, we need to know if the yeasts  genetic codes are the same,  said Riley.  If they aren t, expressing the novel genes won t work because the proteins will be incorrectly translated.   With the advent of new genetic tools that can rapidly manipulate an organism s DNA, publication of these new genomic yeast sequences will open up many new platforms for bioengineering cellulose degrading, lipid producing, acid tolerant yeasts that use a wide range of substrates and produce many different primary and secondary metabolites,  said Jeffries.  The yeast scientific community owes tremendous thanks to the sequencing and annotation team at JGI. ","Published: August 17, 2016"

University of Florida researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to reveal areas where Parkinson s disease and related conditions cause progressive decline in brain activity. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was published in the journal Neurology. While current treatments focus on controlling symptoms, biomarkers provide a quantifiable way to measure how medications address not just symptoms, but the neurological changes behind them. Previous studies have used imaging techniques that require the injection of a drug that crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Our technique does not rely upon the injection of a drug. Not only is it non-invasive, it s much less expensive,  said David Vaillancourt, Ph.D., a professor in UF s Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology and the study s senior author. The study s authors   which included researchers from UF s College of Health and Human Performance and College of Medicine as well as the Medical University of South Carolina   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate five areas of the brain that are key to movement and balance. A year after the baseline study, the 46 Parkinson s patients in the study showed declining function in two areas: the primary motor cortex and putamen. Parkinson s-related disorders evaluated in the study also showed declines: The 13 subjects with multiple system atrophy had reduced activity in three of the five areas, while the 19 with progressive supranuclear palsy showed declines in all five areas. The brain activity of the 34 healthy control subjects did not change.  For decades, the field has been searching for an effective biomarker for Parkinson s disease,  said Debra Babcock, M.D., Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.  This study is an example of how brain imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor the progression of Parkinson s disease and other neurological disorders.  The finding builds on a 2015 UF study that was the first to document progressive deterioration from Parkinson s via MRI, showing an increase in unconstrained fluid in an area of the brain called the substania nigra. An NIH-funded study beginning in November will use both biomarkers to test if a drug approved for symptom relief can slow or stop progressive degeneration. Katrina Gwinn, M.D., also a program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, described the effort to identify biomarkers as  an essential part of moving towards the development of treatments that impact the causes, and not just the symptoms, of Parkinson s disease.

Popularly associated with learning and memory, they play a more fundamental role in our existence by regulating everything from breathing, sleeping and waking and other bodily functions. Loss of synapses and synapse function sit at the heart of a number of diseases, not just neurodegenerative examples such as dementia and Parkinson s disease but also conditions such as diabetes. We do not fully understand how synapses work, but new research published on Nature Neuroscience s website has shed new light on the role of proteins in the way in which synapses maintain their signalling. The research has been carried out by an international team of scientists from: the Institute for Biology/Genetics and the Institute of Chemistry and Biochemisty/Structural Biochemistry, Freie Universit t Berlin; NeuroCure, Cluster of Excellence, Charit  Universit tsmedizin, Berlin; Molecular and Theoretical Neuroscience, Leibniz-Institut f r Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin; Department of Nanobiophotonics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G ttingen; Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry; the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, and; the Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Graz, Austria. The team used genetics like a scalpel blade to remove individual proteins from the synapse to identify their different roles within the synapse, and how they maintain synaptic transmission. They used synapses from the fruit fly drosophila, which compares remarkably closely to synapses in humans. The results showed that two variations of a protein called Unc13 work separately to regulate synaptic transmission. The study is the first to show how the different forms of this protein work. The findings of the study will prove invaluable to other research studies examining the role of synapse function in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative and other diseases. A greater understanding of how synapses work may also find a role in identifying unexpected drug targets for specific diseases. Dr Iain Robinson, Associate Professor in Neurosciences at Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry is part of the international research team on this study. He said:   Using a combination of genetics and state of the art imaging allows us to dissect the function of synapses which are used to convey messages in the brain. We have moved another step nearer to understanding the mechanisms employed by synapses and created knowledge which could play a vital role in research projects with the potential to discover breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of debilitating and life-changing diseases.

During wartime, governments follow these priorities, and so does the immune system. When fighting a bacterial or viral infection, an otherwise healthy person will make lots of antibodies, blood-borne proteins that grab onto the invaders. The immune system also channels some of its resources into research: storing some antibody-making cells as insurance for a future encounter, and tinkering with the antibodies to improve them. In humans, scientists know a lot about the cells involved in immediate antibody production, called plasmablasts, but less about the separate group of cells responsible for the  storage/research for the future  functions, called memory B cells. Understanding how to elicit memory B cells, along with plasmablasts, is critical for designing effective vaccines. Researchers at Emory Vaccine Center and Stanford s Department of Pathology have been examining the precursors of memory B cells, called activated B cells, after influenza vaccination and infection and during Ebola virus infection. The Ebola-infected patients were the four who were treated at Emory University Hospital s Serious Communicable Disease Unit in 2014. The findings were published Monday, August 15 in Nature Immunology.  Ebola virus infection represents a situation when the patients  bodies were encountering something they ve never seen before,  says lead author Ali Ellebedy, PhD, senior research scientist at Emory Vaccine Center.  In contrast, during both influenza vaccination and infection, the immune system generally is relying on recall.  Unlike plasmablasts, activated B cells do not secrete antibodies spontaneously, but can do so if stimulated. Each B cell carries different rearrangements in its DNA, corresponding to the specificity and type of antibody it produces. The rearrangements allowed Ellebedy and his colleagues to track the activated B cells, like DNA bar codes, as an immune response progresses. Ellebedy and Rafi Ahmed, PhD, director of Emory Vaccine Center, teamed up with Katherine Jackson, PhD and Scott Boyd, PhD at Stanford to analyze the DNA bar codes. All work with Ebola specimens was performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s biosafety level 4 facility. Collaborators from St. Jude Children s Research Hospital contributed to the paper. A week after flu immunization, both flu-specific plasmablasts and flu-specific activated B cells could be detected in volunteers  blood. Two weeks after immunization, the plasmablasts had disappeared, but the activated B cells were still proliferating, the researchers report. Similarly, as Ebola infection progressed, more activated B cells were observed in patients  blood while the proportion of plasmablasts declined.  This difference in timing following infection or vaccination may reflect a preference for the immune system to first rapidly generate plasmablasts whose antibodies directly engage the foreign antigens,  the authors write. Analyzing the antibody DNA bar codes showed that the codes overlapped between the plasmablasts and activated B cells, indicating that they came from common ancestors. However, most sequences were found only in one group of cells. The authors show that a couple months after flu immunization, many of the activated B cells had settled down and had become resting memory B cells. The authors highlight an intriguing finding, which was that the level of antibody tinkering   known as somatic hypermutation   did not increase in volunteers  B cells over time after seasonal flu immunization. While this result may suggest that seasonal flu immunization has diminishing returns, Ellebedy says that it is partly because study participants were all adults who had probably been exposed to flu viruses before. Thus, their flu-specific B cells may have already been optimized in previous encounters. The B cells analyzed in this study were those specific for the 2009 H1 flu protein, a part of the seasonal flu vaccine that has not changed in recent years (volunteers were vaccinated between 2012 and 2015).  It is still worthwhile to encourage the immune system to make a greater quantity of antibodies, even if their quality does not rise appreciably, and the value of vaccination may be greater when the flu vaccine strains are not identical to those used in previous seasons  vaccines,  he says.","Published: August 17, 2016"

The sixth of seven children, Shayla had unusual facial features. She had club feet and shorter-than-normal limbs. She was smaller than most newborns. Hearing tests showed she was deaf. As her parents, Cheryl and Levko Siloti, searched for answers about her condition, they worried: Had some preventable event during Cheryl s pregnancy caused Shayla s symptoms? Could identifying her diagnosis improve her treatment options? If Shayla s siblings wanted to become parents someday, would their children be at risk for the same illness?  It was kind of an emotional roller coaster,  Cheryl Siloti said. Over the years, doctors suggested many diagnoses for Shayla, but medical tests repeatedly disproved their theories.  We would get these possibilities and then hear  Nope, that s not the answer.  The Stockton, California, family s quest for answers illustrates the challenges of diagnosing rare genetic diseases, and illustrates how and why scientists at the Stanford University School of Medicine are devising new approaches to help. As much as Shayla s parents longed for a diagnosis, they almost didn t get one. On Aug. 10, 2012   only two weeks after Shayla s doctors at Lucile Packard Children s Hospital Stanford concluded that they could not match her genetic patterns and symptoms to a disease   a scientific report about a newly discovered link between a genetic defect and a rare disease was published that would have allowed them to diagnose her. But at the time, genetic-testing results were not routinely re-analyzed to take into account new knowledge. The family and doctors remained unaware that the answer was out there. Genetic re-analysis Last year, as part of a scientific study, Shayla s parents agreed to have her genome re-analyzed. This time, Stanford computer scientists used new computational tools they had developed to compare Shayla s gene sequences to the scientific literature. They found the 2012 scientific report and predicted that Shayla had a rare genetic disease called Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, which her doctors confirmed.  With each passing month, more of the world s genetic diversity is represented in scientific databases, and each time more information is there, it s easier to interpret the next thing you see,  said Jon Bernstein, MD, Shayla s clinical geneticist at Packard Children s and an author of the new report, which was published online July 21 in Genetics in Medicine. Ten percent of the patients in the study   four individuals, including Shayla, out of 40 who did not receive diagnoses after their first genetic analysis   were diagnosed with various rare diseases based on recent discoveries, even though the initial analyses had been conducted an average of only 20 months earlier. These  near misses  highlight a big challenge in the realm of precision health: Although the speed, cost and effort involved in obtaining individuals  genetic sequences has dropped dramatically in recent years, it still requires about 20 to 40 hours of work by trained experts to match a patient s rare mutations to information in the scientific literature that might reveal a diagnosis. Among patients suspected of having a rare genetic disease, 75 percent aren t diagnosed the first time they have their DNA analyzed. And yet the knowledge base is growing fast. Each year, researchers discover the cause of about 250 genetic diseases and also find 9,200 links between specific gene variants and known diseases. Too many to diagnose by hand  Our study demonstrates that reanalysis of patients  gene-testing results is useful because there s a steady rate of discovery,  said Bernstein, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the School of Medicine.  But there is no way we ll have enough manpower to continue to do all the analysis manually, as clinicians and scientists have done in the past,  said Gill Bejerano, PhD, senior author of the study and associate professor of developmental biology, of computer science and of pediatrics. Bejerano led the computer scientists who devised the automated approach used in the new research. Several million Americans may have some form of rare genetic disease, he noted   too many to diagnose by hand.  Rather than continuing to invest dozens of hours in each patient s analysis, our team thought it made more sense to spend that time building computer science tools that can do much of the work for us,  he said. In the new study, the scientists tested whether automated comparisons between undiagnosed patients  genomes and existing gene databases could accelerate diagnosis. The approach worked.  The genome is ultimately a programming language,  Bejerano said.  We really would like to use machine learning and other approaches to build computer systems that leave as little as possible work for the human expert. A computer is going to be weaker than a human at doing this, but we think we can take the process 80 to 90 percent of the way by computer and provide a huge time savings for the human in the loop.  Comparing genes of patients, parents  Another key finding from the new research, according to Bernstein and Bejerano, is that comparing patients  gene sequences to those of their parents greatly speeds the diagnostic process. Such comparisons help turn up new disease-causing mutations that occurred in the patients but are not present in their parents.  These things stand out more easily if you have the parents  data in front you,  Bernstein said. In Shayla s case, her diagnosis brought her family the answers they d long been seeking. She doesn t share her disease-causing mutation with her parents; instead, it occurred spontaneously in her. It wasn t preventable, nor is there any expectation it would affect her siblings  children.  It really relieves a lot of worry to know that,  Siloti said. The diagnosis also has helped the Silotis find other families whose children have the same diagnosis. They share stories on a Facebook group and feel they ve found a new sense of support and community.  We ve always believed that knowledge is power,  Siloti said.  It is wonderful to have some answers, especially after such a long search. ","Published: August 17, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/unravelling-a-microbial-mess-213056,Unravelling a Microbial Mess Scientists have untangled the Kansas based mess of microbes more fully than scientists have ever done for a sample of soil  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The Kansas prairie seems like the very picture of beauty and simplicity, with undulating fields of corn and wheat stretching as far as the eye can see. But below ground, the soil bears witness to the incredible diversity and chaos of life within even the smallest patch of ground. Just a teaspoonful of Kansas soil contains tens of thousands of microbial species. Now scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have untangled that Kansas-based mess of microbes more fully than scientists have ever done for a sample of soil. In one of the most in-depth looks to date at a soil metagenome   all the genetic material recovered from a sample of soil   the team reconstructed portions of the genomes of 129 species of microbes. While it's only a tiny proportion of the estimated 100,000 species in the sample, it's a leap forward for scientists who have had only a fraction of that success to date. The results include the first reconstruction of the complete genome of a single microbe ever from a complex soil sample. Other groups have reconstructed full genomes of microbes out of less complex environments, including mines, microbial mats, and the human microbiome. The results were published recently in mSystems, a publication of the American Society for Microbiology. Soil microbes: Crucial for climate, environment Microbes in soil determine in large part how the planet stores carbon, when and how carbon is released into the environment, how plants take up nutrients and how crops fare. While many people have become familiar with the community of microbes that live on us, with us, and within us   the human microbiome   the soil microbiome is lesser known but crucial for the fate of our planet. More knowledge about microbes helps scientists understand climate change and the forces that shape the health of our planet. While scientists have made strides sorting out which species are present in complex soil samples, how those species interact remains a hugely daunting problem. ""We're trying to sort out the broad questions. What are the various microbes in the microbial community doing? Which species are very active and which seem dormant? How do they all fit together?"" said microbiologist Janet Jansson, the corresponding author. ""Today we're able to compile immense data about microbial communities very quickly, but it's very difficult to put the information together to create a coherent picture,"" she added. Jansson turned to post-doctoral associate Richard Allen White III, the first author of the paper, to take on the challenge of disentangling the genomes. Digging up the dirt on the Kansas prairie The team started with data culled from a sample of uncultivated, native Kansas prairie collected at the Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeastern Kansas. Scientists compiled the genetic data previously through the Great Prairie Soil Metagenome Grand Challenge Initiative at the Joint Genome Institute, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. The Kansas soil is from the Great Plains, where soil has high carbon content compared to other soils. Scientists like Jansson are exploring what will happen in the soil as the climate changes. For example, there could be greater release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere if microorganisms convert carbon to carbon dioxide more rapidly. The sample under scrutiny included more than 250 billion base pairs of genetic data, mostly of microbes, which awaited a scientific team with the chutzpah to try to make sense of it. Jansson's team took on the challenge, unraveling an amount of information approximately equal to all the data streaming through 200 cell phones in a month. The genetic material didn't come neatly packaged. It had been torn, split, twisted, crushed and exposed to all manner of disrespect. ""Imagine taking a thick book written in hundreds of different languages, chopping the book up into pieces the size of grains of rice, and then having to put it back together again,"" said White. ""That's not unlike the challenge we face when we try to understand what's going on in even a handful of soil."" Jansson considers untangling the microbes in soil especially challenging because there is a huge diversity. Scientists estimate 50 to 100 times as many microbial species inhabit a typical soil sample than the human gut. Also, most microbes from soil have never been grown in a laboratory where they could be studied thoroughly. Knitting soil DNA together Scientists use multiple techniques to knit together strings of DNA accurately. The techniques are generally a combination of sophisticated chemistry methods and software algorithms designed to make sense of genetic material. A key to the team's success was the use of powerful supercomputers at PNNL and EMSL, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory. EMSL is a DOE Office of Science User Facility on the PNNL campus. To do the study, White used a sequencing technology originally developed in the laboratory of his former adviser, Stephen Quake of Stanford. Scientists use the genome analysis tool to break DNA down into smaller pieces, then sequence those and assemble those into longer pieces. When the team combined the technology with other methods, they ended up with 10,000 pieces of DNA, each longer than 10 kilobase pairs   longer than 10,000 pairs of the biological compounds that make up DNA. Other attempts at cracking a soil metagenome have yielded much lower numbers, for instance, just 9 pieces of DNA of that length   less than one-thousandth of what the team achieved. ""Soil is one of the most complex and diverse ecosystems on the planet. It's a complex three-dimensional substrate; there's nothing else quite like it,"" said White. ""We're at the point where we've put together a few long sentences of a very large book,"" he added. ""We've gone from having a few words or parts of words to having a few sentences. But we've got a long ways to go. We are in our baby steps of identifying who's in there and what they're doing.""","Published: August 17, 2016"

A team from the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Bath discovered for the first time that the C9orf72 gene is strongly expressed in the hippocampus of the mouse brain  a region where adult stem cells reside and which is known to be important for memory. C9orf72 is also expressed at the olfactory bulb, involved in the sense of smell. Loss of smell is sometimes a symptom in FTD. They also found that the C9orf72 protein changes from being concentrated in the cytoplasm of cells to both the cytoplasm and nucleus as the brain cortex develops, and during the development of neurons. Dr Vasanta Subramanian, who led the study, said:  By uncovering novel sites of expression in the brain our findings provide an important resource for researchers studying animal models of C9orf72 mediated ALS and FTD.  It is essential to know in which cell types in the nervous system the C9orf72 gene is expressed and where within the cell the C9orf72 protein is present.  Our hope is that by researching accurate animal models of these diseases scientists can eventually develop new treatments and eventually cures for these devastating degenerative diseases.  The researchers, Ross Ferguson, Eleni Serafeimidou- Pouliou and Vasanta Subramanian, were working to map expression of C9orf72 in developing and adult mouse brains to help characterise reliable animal models to study the gene and its effects in both kinds of neurodegenerative diseases, for which there are currently no cures. Dr Brian Dickie, Director of Research Development at the Motor Neurone Disease Association, said:  It is unclear why people who carry an abnormality in genes like C9orf72 don t usually develop symptoms of these diseases until several decades after birth, but it is possible that the activity of the gene early in life somehow  primes  certain types of neuron to degenerate later in life. This detailed study provides a platform for future research to understand the role of this important gene in health and disease.  The exact function of C9orf72 in humans and animals remains unknown, but in the mutated version in patients there are large stretches of abnormal repeated sequences. The findings also confirmed previous research showing C9orf72 is strongly expressed in the cerebellum and motor cortex of the brain.","Published: August 17, 2016"

As a result, the drug dosage that is highly toxic for the human organism could be significantly reduced. This scientific breakthrough has just been published in the prestigious journal Nature Nanotechnology in an article titled  Magneto-aerotactic bacteria deliver drug-containing nanoliposomes to tumour hypoxic regions.  The article notes the results of the research done on mice, which were successfully administered nanorobotic agents into colorectal tumours.  These legions of nanorobotic agents were actually composed of more than 100 million flagellated bacteria   and therefore self-propelled   and loaded with drugs that moved by taking the most direct path between the drug s injection point and the area of the body to cure,  explains Professor Sylvain Martel, holder of the Canada Research Chair in Medical Nanorobotics and Director of the Polytechnique Montr al Nanorobotics Laboratory, who heads the research team s work.  The drug s propelling force was enough to travel efficiently and enter deep inside the tumours.  When they enter a tumour, the nanorobotic agents can detect in a wholly autonomous fashion the oxygen-depleted tumour areas, known as hypoxic zones, and deliver the drug to them. This hypoxic zone is created by the substantial consumption of oxygen by rapidly proliferative tumour cells. Hypoxic zones are known to be resistant to most therapies, including radiotherapy. But gaining access to tumours by taking paths as minute as a red blood cell and crossing complex physiological micro-environments does not come without challenges. So Professor Martel and his team used nanotechnology to do it. Bacteria with compass To move around, bacteria used by Professor Martel s team rely on two natural systems. A kind of compass created by the synthesis of a chain of magnetic nanoparticles allows them to move in the direction of a magnetic field, while a sensor measuring oxygen concentration enables them to reach and remain in the tumour s active regions. By harnessing these two transportation systems and by exposing the bacteria to a computer-controlled magnetic field, researchers showed that these bacteria could perfectly replicate artificial nanorobots of the future designed for this kind of task.  This innovative use of nanotransporters will have an impact not only on creating more advanced engineering concepts and original intervention methods, but it also throws the door wide open to the synthesis of new vehicles for therapeutic, imaging and diagnostic agents,  Professor Martel adds.  Chemotherapy, which is so toxic for the entire human body, could make use of these natural nanorobots to move drugs directly to the targeted area, eliminating the harmful side effects while also boosting its therapeutic effectiveness.

UQ Diamantina Institute study leader Associate Professor Michelle Hill said the findings offered potential new treatment strategies and targets.  Our previous research showed a high cholesterol diet increased the spread of prostate cancer tumours to lymph nodes, lungs and bones,  Dr Hill said.  The new study has extended the results to melanoma, breast, ovarian and kidney cancers by analysing published data sets.  Dr Hill said cholesterol and other fats were essential components of cell membranes, and played a role in regulating processes such as cell migration and division.  Cholesterol makes specialised membrane regions which are important regulators of cell function, and our laboratory has been investigating how these membrane regions increase cancer progression,  Dr Hill said.  By comparing data published by other research groups using melanoma, breast and kidney cancer models, we were able to identify common mechanisms associated with increased cancer progression.  Interestingly, the amount of cytoskeleton (cell skeleton) proteins at the cholesterol membranes are elevated in more aggressive cancers in all models.  The cytoskeleton is a network of fibres connecting parts of the cell, which plays an important role in structural integrity.  Some chemotherapy drugs work on breaking up the cytoskeleton, notably the taxane family of drugs including docetaxel.  Because of its importance in all cells, targeting the cytoskeleton leads to toxicities and side effects for patients.  If we can identify a specific cancer-associated change in cytoskeleton, then more specific therapies could be design to kill cancer without affecting normal cells.  Dr Hill said the group s previous study on prostate cancer had revealed a reduction in the cytoskeleton-cholesterol membrane link when a gene that suppresses tumour growth was activated.  When we tested a completely unrelated tumour suppressor gene in an ovarian cancer cell model, we again found a correlation between reduction of cytoskeleton-cholesterol membrane linkage and cancer properties.  The team will now follow up on the specific molecules responsible for increasing cytoskeleton-cholesterol membrane linkage in cancer. Dr Hill said the research reinforces the importance of cancer patients maintaining low cholesterol levels, in consultation with their clinicians.","Published: August 17, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/sweet-spot-of-human-immune-system-210851,Sweet Spot of Human Immune System Scientists propose answer to how the human immune system scales its response in proportion to threat to make it  just right   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Two Oxford University scientists have proposed a solution to a puzzle of the human immune system: how our immune system scales its response in proportion to any threat to our health to make it  just right . Their ideas, published in the journal Trends in Immunology, could support a range of medical research. Studies by various research groups around the world have shown how the T-cells, which are a vital part of our immune system, only perceive the world in a black and white fashion at any moment in time. This means that a minor threat could trigger a response large enough to injure healthy tissue if the T cells acted impulsively on these momentary signals. However, studies also show that the body can match the level of T-cell response to the seriousness of an infection in most situations. Michael Dustin, Professor of Immunology at Oxford University s Kennedy Institute explained:  While an overwhelming T-cell response might on the face of it sound effective, it brings risks of immunopathology, where an over-active immune system destroys healthy human tissue, not just the invading disease-causing pathogen.  Scaling the immune response is therefore a safer option, and we know that is what happens. Until now, however, no one had suggested how the body does that.  Dr. Viveka Mayya, a scientist working with Prof. Dustin, considered the duration of the interactions between T-cells and the dendritic cells that activate T-cell responses as a possible solution to this mystery. Studies from several labs, including Prof. Dustin s, found that as the severity of an infection increased so did the length of these interactions. T-cells are usually  motile    they move around the body   but when an infection is happening, they slow down and accumulate around the dendritic cells that help the T cells read the severity of the infection. Longer interactions therefore lead to greater accumulation of T cells over time   a bigger immune response. This is because the dendritic cells affect proteins called transcription factors in T cells in a time dependent manner. Some of these transcription factors act to reduce the levels of components needed for T-cell movement, causing movement to be slowed and prolonging the interaction with dendritic cells. At the same time, other transcription factors are either increased or decreased in a way that prevents the process from  saturating . This allows transcription factors that control the growth and metabolism of T cells to accumulate in proportion to the initial microbial threat, allowing a build-up of T cells that is  just right . Dr Viveka Mayya said:  Many biological processes hit an upper limit, known as saturation. But with T-cell response this effect is suppressed, allowing the response to be just right even if the threat varies over a range of 10,000-fold. Overcoming saturation allows the immune system to keep scaling up its response to meet the demands of severe infection.  By understanding more about how the immune system works, the pair hope to advance other areas of research. Prof. Dustin said:  This knowledge could be applied in vaccine development, where you are looking to cause a strong immune reaction but with minimum risk. It also offers more information for the study of auto-immune diseases: by understanding how the immune system usually gets the response 'just right', we are better placed to see how responses go wrong in autoimmunity and chronic infection and therefore how we can prevent or correct such errors.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/4-billionyearold-rna-synthesized-184551,  Billion Year Old RNA Synthesized TSRI are one step closer to the lab recreation of the  RNA world  of   billion years ago  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have taken a big step toward the laboratory re-creation of the  RNA world,  which is generally believed to have preceded modern life forms based on DNA and proteins.  This is probably the first time some of these complex RNA molecules have been synthesized with a ribozyme since the end of the RNA world four billion years ago,  said TSRI Professor Gerald F. Joyce, the senior author of the study. The results from the study, reported this week in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show the scientists have succeeded in creating a ribozyme that can basically serve both to amplify genetic information and to generate functional molecules. The new ribozyme can replicate short lengths of RNA efficiently and perform transcription on even longer RNAs to make functional RNA molecules with complex structures coming close to what scientists imagine in terms of an RNA replicator that could have supported life before modern biology, where protein enzymes now handle gene replication and transcription. Taking Up a Decades-Old Challenge In the new study, Joyce and TSRI Research Associate David P. Horning set out to use test-tube evolution techniques to tackle the decades-old challenge of creating an enzyme that could both replicate and transcribe RNA and thus support an RNA world. The team started with an enzyme that had been developed and improved upon by other researchers since the early 1990s. The class I RNA polymerase ribozyme, as it has come to be known, can perform the basic task of RNA synthesis required for transcribing an RNA template into a functional RNA molecule by binding to a strand of RNA and using it as a template to stitch together a complementary RNA strand. But prior forms of the ribozyme had been very limited in the RNA sequences they could handle, and couldn t transcribe RNAs that have even moderately complex structures. Because of those limitations, they also could not perform full replication of RNA, which requires the transcription of a complementary strand back into a copy of the original. Horning and Joyce drew upon several improvements described in previous research and then added random mutations to create a population of roughly 100 trillion distinct variants of the molecule. Mimicking the evolutionary process of natural selection, they set up a system to isolate only the variant ribozymes that could synthesize from the respective RNA templates two different and challenging RNA molecules, which have mixed sequences and complex structures, and have functions in the sense that they bind tightly to specific target molecules.  The selection was based on the ability of these newly synthesized RNAs to actually function by binding to their targets,  said Horning.  To be able to make these functional RNAs, the ribozyme effectively had to evolve to become versatile in terms of the sequence and the structure of the RNA it could handle.  Best Performer The best performer after two dozen rounds of selection, polymerase ribozyme 24-3, proved capable of synthesizing not only the two target-binding RNAs but also several other structurally complex RNA molecules that exist in nature as functional remnants of the ancient RNA world including a yeast version of a  transfer RNA  molecule that has an essential protein-making role in all cells.  We found that the new ribozyme can handle most sequences and all but the most difficult structures, so we can use it to make a variety of functional RNA molecules,  Joyce said. Even when synthesizing the limited RNA sequences that the original class I RNA polymerase ribozyme could handle, ribozyme 24-3 proved capable of stitching them together about 100 times faster than its ancestor could. Turning to the much harder task of replication, the TSRI researchers found that ribozyme 24-3 could copy RNAs of up to two dozen nucleotides, achieving what biologists call  exponential replication  and creating as many as 40,000 copies of a target RNA within 24 hours. The 24-3 ribozyme is thus the first ever to combine the two basic capabilities RNA synthesis and RNA replication necessary for a pre-protein, pre-DNA world of RNA life. To generate and sustain a true  RNA world,  the new ribozyme will have to be improved further to enable the replication of longer, more complex RNA molecules crucially including the polymerase ribozyme itself. The Joyce laboratory is now driving its ribozyme toward that goal with further test-tube evolution experiments.  A polymerase ribozyme that achieves exponential amplification of itself will meet the criteria for being alive,  Joyce said.  That s a summit that s now within sight. ","Published: August 17, 2016"

If you are one of the estimated 350 million patients that suffer from a rare disease, that s the average length of time it currently takes for the U.S. medical community to diagnose your ailment. And, if you are more severely ill, deathly ill, doctors may have no idea why you are sick or, worse yet, what to do. That s the genesis of the UnDx Consortium . This organization brings together five precision medicine technology providers and prominent experts from medical centers and universities across the country to collaborate in an effort to produce new hypotheses for a set of six patients struggling with undiagnosed diseases. In a meeting today and tomorrow in San Diego, the UnDx Consortium will explore results of cutting-edge tests analyzing samples from these patients and their families.  It has been 13 years since science mapped the human genome, but the promise of personalized medicine remains largely unfulfilled,  says Douglas Jamison, co-organizer of the UnDx Consortium and Chairman of Interome Inc.  Genetics alone is not enough to provide the answers we need. We believe there may be opportunities by applying precision medicine technologies in a multidisciplinary approach that, combined with gene sequencing, will offer new insights on these difficult medical cases.  The UnDx Consortium is an initiative of precision medicine technology companies and scientists to explore how a multidisciplinary approach to precision medicine can provide information and answers for patients with undiagnosed diseases. Today s meeting is the beginning of what is expected to evolve into an ongoing forum to explore the potential of combining precision medicine technologies to diagnose and treat disease. The five technology providers that have donated their services to the UnDx Consortium include:   Genome Profiling, LLC of Wilmington, DE, providing epigenetic analysis;   The Lab of Rob Knight and the American Gut Project at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), providing microbiome analysis;   KromaTiD, Inc. of Fort Collins, CO, providing a chromosomal imaging platform for the detection of chromosomal rearrangements;   Metabolon, Inc. of Durham, NC, providing metabolomic analysis; and   ORIG3N, Inc. of Boston, MA, providing both the sample collection and stem cell analysis. The main question addressed by the UnDx Consortium is whether the contextual information provided by precision medicine technologies can be used in conjunction with genomic information to provide further hypotheses to the six patients covered in the documentary, Undiagnosed: Medical Refugees, and perhaps become a model to help other undiagnosed patients. The contextual information will complement genomic analyses previously performed in the CLARITY Undiagnosed Challenge, a virtual medical crowdsourcing effort established in conjunction with Boston Children s and Harvard s CLARITY Challenge, in an attempt to diagnose five patients whose undiagnosed odyssey was chronicled by the documentary Undiagnosed: Medical Refugees. The CLARITY Undiagnosed Challenge focused on combining the best methods for genomic sequence interpretation with clinical expertise. The UnDx Consortium resulted from several conversations between Dr. Katia Moritz and Doug Jamison sparked by an early screening of the Undiagnosed documentary at the Strategic News Service  Future In Review  conference in late 2015. The documentary filmmakers had been collaborating with Dr. Isaac Kohane, principal investigator for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network Coordinating Center, Boston Children s Hospital s Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, the Harvard Medical School s Center for Biomedical Informatics, and Illumina, Inc., to launch a project titled the CLARITY Undiagnosed Challenge.","Published: August 17, 2016"

The researchers found that a machine-learning approach to identifying critical disease-related features accurately differentiated between two types of lung cancers and predicted patient survival times better than the standard approach of pathologists classifying tumors by grade and stage.  Pathology as it is practiced now is very subjective,  said Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of genetics.  Two highly skilled pathologists assessing the same slide will agree only about 60 percent of the time. This approach replaces this subjectivity with sophisticated, quantitative measurements that we feel are likely to improve patient outcomes.  The research was published in Nature Communications. Snyder, who directs the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, shares senior authorship of the study with Daniel Rubin, MD, assistant professor of radiology and of medicine. Graduate student Kun-Hsing Yu, MD, is the lead author of the study. Although the current study focused on lung cancer, the researchers believe that a similar approach could be used for many other types of cancer.  Ultimately this technique will give us insight into the molecular mechanisms of cancer by connecting important pathological features with outcome data,  said Snyder. Assessing grade, severity of cancer For decades, pathologists have assessed the severity, or  grade,  of cancer by using a light microscope to examine thin cross-sections of tumor tissue mounted on glass slides. The more abnormal the tumor tissue appeared   in terms of cell size and shape, among other indicators   the higher the grade. A stage is also assigned based on whether and where the cancer has spread throughout the body. Often a cancer s grade and stage can be used to predict how the patient will fare. They also can help clinicians decide how, and how aggressively, to treat the disease. This classification system doesn t always work well for lung cancer, however. In particular, the lung cancer subtypes of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can be difficult to tell apart when examining tissue culture slides. Furthermore, the stage and grade of a patient s cancer doesn t always correlate with their prognosis, which can vary widely. Fifty percent of stage-1 adenocarcinoma patients, for example, die within five years of their diagnosis, while about 15 percent survive more than 10 years. The researchers used 2,186 images from a national database called the Cancer Genome Atlas obtained from patients with either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The database also contained information about the grade and stage assigned to each cancer and how long each patient lived after diagnosis. The researchers then used the images to  train  a computer software program to identify many more cancer-specific characteristics than can be detected by the human eye   nearly 10,000 individual traits, versus the several hundred usually assessed by pathologists. These characteristics included not just cell size and shape, but also the shape and texture of the cells  nuclei and the spatial relations among neighboring tumor cells.  We began the study without any preconceived ideas, and we let the software determine which characteristics are important,  said Snyder, who is the Stanford W. Ascherman, MD, FACS, Professor in Genetics.  In hindsight, everything makes sense. And the computers can assess even tiny differences across thousands of samples many times more accurately and rapidly than a human.  Bringing pathology into the 21st century The researchers homed in on a subset of cellular characteristics identified by the software that could best be used to differentiate tumor cells from the surrounding noncancerous tissue, identify the cancer subtype, and predict how long each patient would survive after diagnosis. They then validated the ability of the software to accurately distinguish short-term survivors from those who lived significantly longer on another dataset of 294 lung cancer patients from the Stanford Tissue Microarray Database. Identifying previously unknown physical characteristics that can predict cancer severity and survival times is also likely to lead to greater understanding of the molecular processes of cancer initiation and progression. In particular, Snyder anticipates that the machine-learning system described in this study will be able to complement the emerging fields of cancer genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Cancer researchers in these fields study the DNA mutations and the gene and protein expression patterns that lead to disease.  We launched this study because we wanted to begin marrying imaging to our  omics  studies to better understand cancer processes at a molecular level,  Snyder said.  This brings cancer pathology into the 21st century and has the potential to be an awesome thing for patients and their clinicians. ","Published: August 17, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/uncovering-constructor-proteins-212865,Uncovering Constructor Proteins Scientists have discovered a new bacterial cell wall builder that could be a target for antibiotic development  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Harvard Medical School scientists have identified a new family of proteins that virtually all bacteria use to build and maintain their cell walls. The discovery of a second set of cell wall synthesizers can help pave the way for much-needed therapies that target the cell wall as a way to kill harmful bacteria, said study leaders David Rudner and Thomas Bernhardt.  We know these proteins are a great target because they are enzymes we can inhibit from the outside of the cell,  said Rudner, senior author of the paper and HMS professor of microbiology and immunobiology.  Now we have a better handle on what these proteins do and how a potential drug might affect their activity,  said Bernhardt, the paper s co-author and HMS professor of microbiology and immunobiology. The cell wall plays a critical role in maintaining a bacterium s structural integrity, dictating its shape and warding off external assaults from toxins, drugs and viruses.  The cell wall is made of chains of sugars linked together by short peptides. For half a century, penicillin-binding proteins were thought to be the major, perhaps the only, cell wall synthesizers.  Now we have a better handle on what these proteins do and how a potential drug might affect their activity.    Thomas Bernhardt.  Penicillin was discovered in 1928 and first used to treat bacterial infections in 1942, but it wasn t until 1957 that scientists understood how penicillin blocked the proteins that build the cell walls of bacteria. Research in the 1970s and 1980s on the bacterium Escherichia coli fleshed out the mechanism by which penicillin-binding proteins build the cell wall. Clues that other players may be involved in cell wall biogenesis emerged later. A crucial discovery, made in 2003, was overlooked by many in the field: The bacterium Bacillus subtilis was capable of growing and synthesizing its cell wall even in the absence of penicillin-binding proteins. Some researchers were tantalized by the  missing polymerase,  sometimes called the  moonlighting enzyme.  Tsuyoshi Uehara, former HMS research fellow in the Bernhardt lab and co-author of the paper, was one of those scientists. He thought a family of proteins responsible for a cell s shape, elongation, division and spore formation, or SEDS proteins in scientific shorthand, might be prime suspects for the missing enzyme. SEDS proteins move around the circumference of the bacterial cell in a manner suggesting they might be involved in synthesizing the wall, and, if inactivated, perturb cell wall synthesis. Testing the hypothesis To test the hypothesis that SEDS proteins may be involved in cell wall synthesis, Alexander Meeske, HMS graduate student in the Rudner lab and the paper s first author, deleted all the known penicillin-binding proteins involved in polymerizing the cell wall. Yet, SEDS proteins continued to move in much the same way as they always had. The observation made SEDS proteins look like the missing enzymes and more like major players than mere moonlighters. Later experiments, both genetic and biochemical, confirmed that SEDS proteins are indeed a completely new family of cell wall synthesizers. The scientists also showed that the two families of cell wall synthesizers could work in tandem: While SEDS proteins circumnavigate the cell wall making hoop-like structures, penicillin-binding proteins move diffusely, making smaller strands that, together with the hoop-like strands, build the cell wall. Earlier studies showing that bacteria died when the penicillin-binding proteins were blocked obscured the importance of SEDS proteins, the researchers said. In the current paper, the scientists found that SEDS proteins are more common in bacteria than are the penicillin-binding proteins, raising hopes that potential antibiotic targeting SEDS proteins could be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria.  For a long time in the field, it was thought that one set of enzymes worked in one set of complexes to build a wall. Now we have two sets of enzymes appearing to work in different systems,  Bernhardt said.  Somehow they have to coordinate to build this netlike structure that maintains integrity and expands as the cells grow and divide.  How the two families of proteins work together is just one of many questions raised by the new work.  Even though the history goes all the way back to the 1920s with penicillin, there s plenty to learn,  Bernhardt said.  That s what makes this so exciting,  Rudner said.  In this modern era of sequenced genomes, we re still discovering new enzymes that work in this pathway. ","Published: August 17, 2016"

The tests use recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses that have been engineered to incorporate theranostically informative reporter genes and permit their safe handling as diagnostic reagents in the hospital laboratory setting. The test kits are being developed and preclinically validated at Imanis Life Sciences, while clinical validation is anticipated in Vyriad-sponsored clinical trials through 2017 and beyond. Under the terms of the agreement, Imanis Life Sciences will use its proprietary virus technology to develop and preclinically validate companion diagnostic tests that can be used to predict the likelihood of a clinical response to oncolytic virotherapy. Vyriad will select one or two test formats for further evaluation in Vyriad-sponsored clinical trials to determine their predictive power. Vyriad plans to pursue clinical validation and regulatory approval for the tests in the human and veterinary settings. Once approved, Imanis will grant Vyriad a nonexclusive license to use the companion diagnostic tests to accelerate development of its proprietary oncolytic viruses derived from the company s vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus, or other Vyriad platforms. Financial details of the relationship were not disclosed.  We are excited to initiate this collaboration with Imanis Life Sciences for the development of theranostic tests that will help us to streamline patient selection and maximize response rates in Vyriad-sponsored oncolytic virotherapy clinical trials,  said Stephen Russell, MD, PhD, CEO of Vyriad.  For the first time, we will be able to focus our efforts on those patients with a higher probability of deriving clinical benefit from our drugs while avoiding treating patients that are not likely to respond to them. We strongly expect that pairing our oncolytic virotherapies with theranostic tests being developed in this collaboration will greatly accelerate the pathway to FDA marketing approval for our oncolytic virotherapy products.   This collaboration has provided Imanis with an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate our theranostic test development program all the way through to full clinical validation in Vyriad-sponsored clinical trials,  said Kah Whye Peng, PhD, COO of Imanis Life Sciences.  We are very pleased to be working with Vyriad in this truly synergistic collaboration. ","Published: August 17, 2016"

In a Review published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, two researchers explain the myriad ways in which forms of assistance from gestures to GPS affect both what we know and what we think we know. See Also: Concern over claims about how technology affects young brainsEvan Risko, a Canada Research chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Waterloo, and co-author Sam Gilbert, a Royal Society research fellow at University College London, call these behaviors ""cognitive offloading"" physical actions that reduce the mental effort needed to perform a task. When required to remember an appointment, for example, people are faced with the choice of internally remembering it or ""offloading"" it, by writing it down in a calendar or setting a reminder with a smartphone. Similarly, your accountant may choose to use a calculator when going over your finances rather than mentally perform all of the necessary computations. What's happening here, say the authors, is the use of a physical action (writing, using a calculator) to eliminate the need for that internal effort the cognitive burden. One of the key messages of Risko and Gilbert's Review is that people will engage in such offloading behavior when they believe it is more efficient than their internal abilities. However, these beliefs do not always match reality. ""The growing interaction between people and technology has really brought interest in the subject to the forefront. People want to understand how technology affects the way we think,"" says Risko. Gilbert adds, ""Cognitive offloading undoubtedly brings huge benefits, but also potential costs. We are just beginning to understand these effects. For example, how can technology allow us to remain independent as we grow older, and what might the downsides be to relying on external devices?"" Learn More: New technology allows medical professionals to step into the shoes of patients with Young-Onset Parkinson's disease Though some people may think of offloading as harmful to one's ability to remember, the truth is that these strategies are needed for everyday thinking and planning. People will usually turn toward these offloading strategies because we are ""capacity limited"" in our cognitive abilities. We may be able to remember a list of five, six, or seven numbers, but it's unlikely that we could remember 47 of them. Offloading gives us the ability to ""subvert our cognitive limits,"" say the researchers, who point out that ""devices such as smartphones allow us to be more confident and able to do things that we've not been able to do before."" However, offloading can also have negative consequences. ""If you're allowed to store some to-be-remembered information on a computer, chances are you won't devote cognitive real estate to remembering it,"" says Risko. ""As a result, your ability to remember that information without the computer will likely be reduced. There's little doubt that these new technologies are affecting what we remember."" Recent research has demonstrated some of the consequences of offloading, particularly when offloading onto electronic devices, such as personal computers or digital cameras. In one study, researchers gave museumgoers digital cameras and found that taking photographs degraded subjects' ability to remember the objects they viewed, and specific details about those objects, when compared to their ability to remember objects not photographed. Another study, by Gilbert, showed that using reminders changed the physical activity inside volunteers' brains when they remembered plans and intentions. Moving forward, Risko and Gilbert want to focus on the way offloading changes the way we think, as well as what's happening in the brain as a result of different offloading strategies. They are also interested in the long-term consequences of living in a modern, high-tech environment that allows us to constantly offload our cognition. Read Next: Blind lead the way in brave new world of tactile technology Risko stressed that these are all questions that can only be answered with time. ""There's a lot of conversation about whether devices like smartphones are ruining us cognitively or not,"" says Risko. ""There isn't a lot of research available yet that addresses the long-term cognitive consequences of offloading. What our Review has shown is that similar scientific principles apply to our use of a wide variety of devices, such as pen and paper, GPS trackers, and smartphones. This should make it easier for researchers to fully understand these devices' consequences in the future."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

In the study, 44 adults ranging in age from 40 to 85 (mean age: 62.6) with mild memory changes but no dementia underwent an experimental type of PET scan to measure the level of plaque and tangles in the brain. Researchers also collected information on participants' body mass index, levels of physical activity, diet and other lifestyle factors. Plaque, deposits of the toxic protein beta-amyloid in the spaces between nerve cells in the brain; and tangles, knotted threads of the tau protein found within brain cells, are considered the key indicators of Alzheimer's. See Also: Research shows new neurons created through exercise don't cause you to forget old memoriesThe study found that each one of several lifestyle factors a healthy body mass index, physical activity and a Mediterranean diet were linked to lower levels of plaques and tangles on the brain scans. (The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals and fish and low in meat and dairy, and characterized by a high ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fats, and low to moderate alcohol consumption). ""The fact that we could detect this influence of lifestyle at a molecular level before the beginning of serious memory problems surprised us,"" said Dr. David Merrill, the lead author of the study, which appears in the September issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. Earlier studies have linked a healthy lifestyle to delays in the onset of Alzheimer's. However, the new study is the first to demonstrate how lifestyle factors directly influence abnormal proteins in people with subtle memory loss who have not yet been diagnosed with dementia, Merrill said. Healthy lifestyle factors also have been shown to be related to reduced shrinking of the brain and lower rates of atrophy in people with Alzheimer's. Older age is the number one non-modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, which affects an estimated 5.2 million people in the United States and results in more than $200 billion (USD) in health care costs annually. ""The study reinforces the importance of living a healthy life to prevent Alzheimer's, even before the development of clinically significant dementia,"" Merrill said.

A study in mice published in the journal PLOS Biology shows that the actual color of light matters; blue light keeps mice awake longer while green light puts them to sleep easily. An accompanying Primer provides accessible context information and discusses open questions and potential implications for ""designing the lighting of the future."" See Also: New form of secret light language keeps other animals in the dark Light shining into our eyes not only mediates vision but also has critical non-image-forming functions such as the regulation of circadian rhythm, which affects sleep and other physiological processes. As humans, light generally keeps us awake, and dark makes us sleepy. For mice, which are mostly nocturnal, light is a sleep-inducer. Previous studies in mice and humans have shown that non-image-forming light perception occurs in specific photosensitive cells in the eye and involves a light sensor called melanopsin. Mice without melanopsin show a delay in their response to fall asleep when exposed to light, pointing to a critical role for melanopsin in sleep regulation. Stuart Peirson and Russell Foster, both from Oxford University, UK, alongside colleagues from Oxford and elsewhere, investigated this further by studying sleep induction in mice exposed to colored light, i.e., light of different wave lengths. Based on the physical properties of melanopsin, which is most sensitive to blue light, the researchers predicted that blue light would be the most potent sleep inducer. Related: Researchers untangle the biological effects of blue lightTo their surprise, that was not the case. Green light, it turns out, puts mice to sleep quickly, whereas blue light actually seems to stimulate the mice, though they did fall asleep eventually. Mice lacking melanopsin were oblivious to light color, demonstrating that the protein is directing the differential response. Both green and blue light elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in the blood of exposed mice compared with mice kept in the dark, the researchers found. Corticosterone levels in response to blue light, however, were higher than levels in mice exposed to green light. When the researchers gave the mice drugs that block the effects of corticosterone, they were able to mitigate the effects of blue light; drugged mice exposed to blue light went to sleep faster than control mice that had received placebos. Citing previous results that exposure to blue light a predominant component of light emitted by computer and smart-phone screens promotes arousal and wakefulness in humans as well, the researchers suggest that ""despite the differences between nocturnal and diurnal species, light may play a similar alerting role in mice as has been shown in humans"". Overall, they say their work ""shows the extent to which light affects our physiology and has important implications for the design and use of artificial light sources."" Don't Miss: Exposure to narrow band of green light improves migraine symptomsIn the accompanying Primer, Patrice Bourgin, from the University of Strasbourg, France, and Jeffrey Hubbard from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, say the study ""reveals that the role of color [in controlling sleep and alertness] is far more important and complex than previously thought, and is a key parameter to take into account."" The study's results, they say, ""call for a greater understanding of melanopsin-based phototransduction and tell us that color wavelength is another aspect of environmental illumination that we should consider, in addition to photon density, duration of exposure and time of day, as we move forward in designing the lighting of the future, aiming to improve human health and well-being.""

Outsourcing these major subsystems can have a profound impact on the ultimate cost of the device and on its operational success. The success of these major automated systems may also influence the perception lab personnel have of the equipment manufacturers  overall dedication to quality.  Outsourcing creates a business context for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that may change over time. Change factors involve four dynamics:    Economic rationale  Accelerating innovation  Supply chain vulnerabilities  Enterprise strategy congruence  OEMs need to review their outsourcing decisions periodically to ensure that the manufacturing partners they have still make sense from an engineering, manufacturing, device performance, and customer support perspective.  Economic rationale For decades, cost savings have been the main economic driver in outsourcing decisions. The rapid growth of manufacturing in countries with low labor costs, plus improvements in logistics and transportation of subassemblies back to OEMs for final assembly, have made off shore outsourcing a compelling model to pursue.  In recent years, outsourcing has come back to North American suppliers due to the emergence of hidden costs with off shore suppliers twinned with the resurgence of advanced manufacturing technology in North America. For example, administrative expenses and complexities, especially around managing off shore suppliers and quality control from a distance, can demand more management time and attention than expected. Another example of hidden cost involves poor quality and automation performance, which results in reliability issues that must be addressed with costly post-sale service and support. Quality and component performance are hallmarks of North American manufacturing today. As many OEMs are discovering, outsourcing complex automated handling and microfluidic control subassemblies that arrive fully tested and ready to install from a trusted North American supplier can significantly reduce engineering costs, improve performance, and ultimately lead to fewer support issues. And, by moving machines to market sooner, OEMs gain additional profit.  As part of an OEM s periodic review of the type and quantity of subassemblies outsourced, once hidden costs should be documented, and then evaluated against working with a trusted automation supplier. If the OEM has a trusted partner, the OEM should hold discussions with that partner on a regular basis on how to move outsourced subassemblies and logistics to the next level of speed and performance.  Accelerating innovations Keeping up with both technological and process innovations is a challenge. Technology continues to advance at a blistering pace. Advancements, in turn, can enable new levels of device performance and also drive process improvements inside the OEM. For example, the ERP architecture at Festo and the company s online cad drawings and product selection tools are significantly reducing OEM engineering time and project management overheads.    For OEMs, focus and prioritization are two interrelated keys to success that innovation can disrupt. For example,  feature-creep  is a common problem in product development, as designers seek to add yet another product feature or capability that a recent technology advancement might enable. New features must be evaluated against issues of increased manufacturing complexities, component sourcing, and other concerns about which a knowledgeable, well-qualified outsourcing partner will provide critical counsel. The ideal outsourcing partner will be able to help OEMs not only manage innovation, but also capitalize on it through the identification and adoption of optimum technology innovations.   Supply chain vulnerabilities By outsourcing high speed automated handling subassemblies and microfluidic controls, laboratory device OEMs introduce new risks to their business models from supply chain variables that are beyond their control. Examples of these vulnerabilities include component shortages and transportation disruptions. Managing supply chain vulnerabilities shows how management attention and staff time can be diverted from the oversight of other core operations   a cost that might be initially overlooked in the outsourcing decision but should be considered during the periodic review.OEMs need to ascertain the ability of potential outsourcing partners to mitigate these risks. For example, Festo has recently built a new centrally located $50 million assembly and product distribution center where the majority of the components carry guaranteed delivery windows. OEMs should look for similar wherewithal in the risk-mitigation plans offered by automation subassembly suppliers.  Enterprise strategy congruence Given the critical importance of the outsourcing decision, OEMs will be well served by determining whether the outsource partner shares a congruent overall enterprise strategy. For example, does the proposed partner share the same long term commitment toward quality and investment in technology? Has it similar leading edge systems in place for customer support?  Another strategic consideration is to size up the outsourced partner s core development and manufacturing competencies. After all, the OEM will derive the most competitive advantage and ultimately the most profit from an automation supplier with world class resources. Finding the right automation OEM makes all the difference in terms of reliable high speed automated device performance and long term profitability for that product line.  Criteria for qualifying a strategic outsourcing partner While OEMs seeking a strategic outsourcing partner today should conduct sufficient due diligence to qualify their candidates, here are some criteria to consider.  Stability: How long has the supplier been in business? Is it profitable? Can the company handle major financial changes? Is its client portfolio broad enough to adjust to specific industry downturns? Will a relationship with this supplier make your company stronger? Flexibility: Can the supplier support you as you adapt to growth and changing market conditions? In automation, for example, it makes sense to take a building block approach, working with a supplier that offers basic standardized components as well as design services that create higher-order systems from those parts. This allows fast transfer of engineering and production in-house or to other outside contract manufacturers as inevitable capacity and growth changes occur. The ideal supplier can supply parts, or design, build, document, and validate to your requirements, as needed. Capacity: Can the supplier handle growth? Does it have the resources to invest to accommodate for economic upturns as well as the growth of your company? Capacity is easy to find in a flat economy but can become critical just when business is growing and you need to deliver. Knowledge: Make sure the supplier can and will act as a consultant, understanding that adapting its scope of supply to meet the changing requirements of your business can result in a stronger business relationship by applying the best resources to assure rapid and profitable product development and production. Find a vendor that can be an asset. Require the company to be more than a catalog product supplier, and gain a deep understanding of its level of service.

Blood as a type of liquid biopsy is widely used in clinical research due to its ease of sampling and its rapid dynamics: the majority of the cells are erythrocytes that carry oxygen, causing 50 80 per cent enrichment of globin RNA molecules among all blood RNA. This high prevalence of globin complicates blood related gene expression biomarker studies, causing technical bias and leaving biologically relevant molecules undetectable. According to the researchers the study reveals for the first time the detailed methodology   GlobinLockTM   how to overcome a limitation in blood sample analysis caused by erythrocytes, which complicates any downstream biomarker identification or tracking from blood. The published and patent pending assay minimizes the needs of reagents and sample material, which makes it an effective and robust tool.  The globin reduction rate of GlobinLock is sufficient for any applications. It reduces the globin prevalence from 63 per cent before to five per cent which makes it an effective tool for biotechnology companies as an additive to their kits, said Dr Kaarel Krjut kov, the leading author of the study from both Karolinska Institutet and Estonian Competence Centre on Health Technologies. DNA strands The new method consists of a pair of short synthetic DNA strands that silence majority of globin RNA molecules by highly specific binding. The strands are introduced to purified RNA sample, and according to the researchers, being effective immediately after RNA denaturation and add only ten minutes of incubation time to the whole complementary DNA synthesis procedure.  The locking DNA molecules bind specifically at globin RNA poly-A site that is needed for further analysis. Therefore the globin RNAs are  locked  prior downstream manipulations and are unavailable to cause technical biases in blood RNA biomarker applications.  We show that globin locking is fully effective not only for human samples but also for widely used animal models, like mouse and rat, cow, dog and even zebrafish , said professor Juha Kere in who s laboratory the invention was created at Karolinska Institutet. The research and development from idea to patent pending method was financed by Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, Strategic Research Program funding on Diabetes to Karolinska Institutet, Swedish Research Council, Orion Research Foundation, EU, Enterprise Estonia, and the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.

Last year, they released the mandarin cultivar currently known as  7-6-27,  which UF/IFAS researchers say is soaring with interest, and with more than 100,000 trees already ordered. In a newly published study, Fred Gmitter, a UF/IFAS horticultural sciences professor, and his colleagues, including doctoral student Yuan Yu, found genetic markers for fruit quality traits that will be useful in future cultivar-breeding efforts. Scientists wanted to know whether, for example, genetic markers   or  signposts,  as Gmitter calls them   for qualitative and quantitative traits in one group of mandarins lined up with these traits in other mandarins. Qualitative traits would be such things as peel or flesh color, while quantitative traits would include weight, size or shape. In this study, the markers developed in one mandarin family predicted the fruit quality traits in 13 other unrelated varieties, Gmitter said. Without this process, researchers might have had to plant and grow 250 or more trees to maturity   a process that takes several years   to find a single one that has all the genetic characteristics they want in a new variety, Gmitter said. The study s findings translate to good news for consumers and growers, he said.  Better fruit for consumers, from Florida growers, for a longer period of time,  said Gmitter, a faculty member at the UF/IFAS Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred, Florida.  Though growers will still have to wait for the new varieties to be selected, we will be producing even better ones than if we didn t have these markers to use.  The fruit   popularly known as tangerines   might even be less expensive because it s closer to the market   not importing from Spain or trucking them across the country from California, Gmitter said. That would be helpful to Florida growers and consumers because amid the steady increase of fresh mandarin consumption 1.39 pound per capita in 1991 to 4.17 pounds in 2012   Florida s share of the market has decreased. California now dominates the market, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service. In addition to cutting costs, Gmitter can already see another potential advantage to using genetic markers to breed better mandarins in the future.  Imagine if we could also develop markers for phytonutrients, those things in the citrus fruit that improve human health; we could then breed simultaneously for better-looking, better-tasting, and healthier mandarins,  he said.","Published: August 16, 2016"

The research offers the beginnings of a solution to a puzzle that has vexed oncologists: Though many patients with previously untreatable cancers are in remission after receiving checkpoint-blockade drugs, only about 20 percent of patients who receive them respond. UCSF s Michael Rosenblum, MD, PhD, assistant professor of dermatology and senior author of the new study, said that the new work has generated insights that may help bring the benefits of checkpoint inhibitors to a greater number of patients. Though the study was done in melanoma patients, Rosenblum said that the findings should apply to other types of cancer as well. As reported online in the Aug. 15, 2016, issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the research team analyzed tumors from 40 patients, and found that the relative size of a population of T cells known as partially exhausted CD8+ cells in the tumors accurately predicted most patients' responses to immunotherapy drugs that target a protein called PD-1. If 30 percent or more of the immune cells in a given patient s tumor before treatment were of the proper subtype, that patient responded to therapy; if fewer than 20 percent were such cells, there was no response. Intriguingly, the CD8+ cells that predicted response to anti-PD-1 therapy expressed high levels of PD-1 and also of CTLA-4, another well-known immune checkpoint protein targeted by immunotherapy drugs. The cells are called  partially exhausted  because they can't produce certain cytokines, signaling molecules that regulate the body's immune response, and as a result aren't able to adequately respond to antigens present in tumors. PD-1 acts as a  brake  that shields cells from an overzealous immune system. Over the past decade it has been found that drugs that inhibit PD-1 s ability to tamp down the immune response unleash T cells to recognize tumor cells as aberrant and to destroy them, effectively enabling the body's immune system to kill cancers. These drugs, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo), have none of the usual side effects of chemotherapy, radiation, or traditional targeted drugs, and they have led to remarkable cancer remissions, even in advanced metastatic disease, and especially in late-stage melanoma. But only a fraction of patients respond to anti-PD-1 therapy, and scientists have been eager to devise a method to predict which patients will respond, and why.  People had concluded that there was never going to be an accurate test that could tell you the difference between responders and non-responders,  said Adil Daud, MD, director of Melanoma Clinical Research at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.  They've just assumed that there s no way you could take a tiny piece of tissue and determine who will and won t respond with high predictability,  said Daud, also a member of the UCSF Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. The best tests available so far, which measure levels in tumor tissue of a PD-1-related protein called PD-L1, only modestly discriminate between responders and non-responders, so they have seen limited use in clinical situations, Daud said. In the new research, funded by grateful patients of Daud s, the research team analyzed tumor samples from a  discovery cohort  of 20 patients who had received PD-1 inhibitors and were thus known responders or non-responders, employing a technique known as multiparameter flow cytometry. In this method, proteins such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 can be tagged with labels that emit fluorescent signals as they move single-file through transparent tubes past laser beams, allowing scientists to precisely count and sort cells according to their characteristics. The team focused on a population of  killer  T cells within patients  tumors known as CD8+ cells, and examined these cells to see whether they expressed PD-1, CTLA-4, and other proteins. They found that the number of partially exhausted CD8+ cells in tumors that expressed high levels of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 was a reliable biomarker of response to anti-PD-1 therapy: the more of these cells in the tumor, the more likely patients were to respond, with response defined as at least a 30 percent reduction in melanoma lesions. The potential clinical usefulness of this observation was then tested in a  validation cohort  of 20 patients not yet treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, and the results held up. Moreover, the researchers were able to quantify the biomarker s predictive power: every patient in whom at least 30 percent of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were the newly characterized CD8+ cells responded to therapy; those in whom fewer than 20 percent were such cells had no response. No reliable prediction could be made for patients in between. In a new project partially funded by UCSF s Parker Institute, Rosenblum, Daud, and colleagues hope to find a way to increase populations of these  good  CD8+ T cells in non-responders, with the objective of turning them into responders. For this phase, the researchers have partnered with Berkeley Lights, a company that is pioneering the use of nanofluidic technology to analyze and manipulate single cells. Using this technology, the researchers hope to be able to remove CD8+ cells with the right characteristics from patients, multiply them outside the body, and then return them to patients to change the patients  immune profiles and encourage response to therapy.","Published: August 16, 2016"

The enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH) is essential for metabolic processes of parasites that are responsible for the spread of three diseases: Leishmaniases, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness. As such, understanding the enzyme s structure could help researchers figure out how to inhibit FH enzymes, thereby providing new medical therapies.  This enzyme is really critical for the metabolism of organisms like Leishmania major,  says Catherine Drennan, an MIT professor whose lab hosted the research.  If you knock it out, the organism should be dead.  Leishmaniases are a group of diseases varying from severe skin ulcers to debilitation of internal organs, and are present in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Southern Europe. Chagas disease, located mostly in Latin America, causes cardiac and intestinal complications, and can lead to heart failure. Sleeping sickness affects humans and other animals and is an often-deadly disease concentrated in Africa. The study of FH began at the University of S o Paulo, where researchers Patricia R. Feliciano and M. Cristina Nonato made important progress on studying Leishmania major FH. Feliciano then moved to MIT to complete the analysis of the enzyme structure with Drennan, a professor of chemistry and biology, and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  The exciting thing about this is thinking that my work could help people who have those diseases,  says Feliciano. The paper,  Crystal structure of an Fe-S cluster-containing fumarate hydratase enzyme from Leishmania major reveals a unique protein fold,  is being published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The authors are Feliciano, Drennan, and Nonato. First in class Fumarate hydratase enzymes fall into two types, class I and class II. The current study represents the first time that a class I fumarate hydratase enzyme has been mapped. Significantly, the Leishmania major FH enzyme has a protein architecture   it vaguely resembles a human heart in appearance   that is distinctive from the structure of human fumurate hydratase.  When we looked at the structure for the first time, it was like,  Whoa, it is completely different from the human FH enzyme,  says Feliciano.  The fact that it is a novel fold does add to the idea that this is a good drug target,  Drennan adds.  It has a lot of potential.  Here s why: The distinctive structure of class I FH makes it possible that drugs could target the parasite variant of the enzyme alone, while leaving intact the functionally equivalent enzymes that humans use.  It s an enzyme that does the exact same thing, but it s a completely different enzyme,  Drennan explains.  That s what makes this such an exciting target.  Brazil connection The finding stems from work Feliciano started doing nine years ago in Brazil in Nonato s lab, but was not able to complete at the time, in part because of difficulties accessing the right equipment. In 2012 Feliciano arrived at MIT, where the Drennan Lab has tools that let researchers form crystals of proteins under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions. Having formed a crystal of the Leishmania major FH enzyme, it still took Feliciano several months to completely map out the enzyme s structure, partly because of its complexity, she notes. Drennan emphasizes the complementary aspects of the research arrangement, with the research problem identified and important groundwork accomplished in Brazil, while MIT provided the right tools to solve the enzyme structure, and with the results hopefully having long-term application in Latin America and Africa.  It s a really lovely collaboration between the two groups and two countries,  Drennan says. For that matter, Drennan says, the nature of globalization means diseases can spread worldwide in relatively short timespans these days. That means the need to find remedies for Leishmaniases, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness is potentially global, too.  I think it s important to reflect on these health issues, and more people in the U.S. need to be aware of these diseases,  Drennan says.  The world is getting to be a smaller place.

Amines that contain a ring-like structure - called an ""aryl"" group - are used widely in pharmaceuticals, such as the top-selling drugs Abilify, Crestor, Gleevec, and Lidoderm.  Aromatic and heteroaromatic amines ((hetero)aryl amines) are central to medicinal chemistry. The process of making different amines is called amination, which involves connecting an amine to an organic molecule. The amine itself must first be prepared in advance by the hydrogenation of anilines, which are used as a nitrogen source and are derived from nitroarenes. Xile Hu and Chi Wai Cheung at EPFL have now developed a new method for making (hetero)aryl amines through the reductive coupling of nitroarenes with organic compounds, without needing to go through the aniline step first. Using a simple iron catalyst, the researchers were able to couple amines to a number of alkyl halides, a group of organic compounds widely used in commercial products. The method was shown to have a high tolerance to functional groups - including some that require protection under conventional amine synthesis - making them versatile and well suited for a broad range of applications. The new method allows chemists to synthesize alkyl or aryl amines from directly from nitroarenes, which are often cheaper than anilines. Moreover, using nitroarenes directly is more step-economical than using anilines, since the latter have to be derived from nitroarenes anyway. In addition, certain anilines containing are difficult to produce, while their corresponding nitroarenes are readily available. The authors state: ""From these points of view, the current method can be considered as a valuable alternative to the conventional amination methods such as direct alkylation and reductive amination.""","Published: August 16, 2016"

According to UCLA professor Huan Meng, certain engineered nanomaterials, such as non-purified carbon nanotubes that are used to strengthen commercial products, could have the potential to injure the lungs if inhaled during the manufacturing process. The new test he helped develop could be used to analyze the extent of the potential hazard. The same test could also be used to identify biological biomarkers that can help scientists and doctors detect cancer and infectious diseases. Currently, scientists identify those biomarkers using other tests; one of the most common is called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA. But the new platform, which is called semiconductor electronic label-free assay, or SELFA, costs less and is faster and more accurate, according to research published in the journal Scientific Reports. The study was led by Meng, a UCLA assistant adjunct professor of medicine, and Chi On Chui, a UCLA associate professor of electrical engineering and bioengineering. ELISA has been used by scientists for decades to analyze biological samples   for example, to detect whether epithelial cells in the lungs that have been exposed to nanomaterials are inflamed. But ELISA must be performed in a laboratory setting by skilled technicians, and a single test can cost roughly $700 and take five to seven days to process. In contrast, SELFA uses microchip technology to analyze samples. The test can take between 30 minutes and two hours and, according to the UCLA researchers, could cost just a few dollars per sample when high-volume production begins. The SELFA chip contains a T-shaped nanowire that acts as an integrated sensor and amplifier. To analyze a sample, scientists place it on a sensor on the chip. The vertical part of the T-shaped nanowire converts the current from the molecule being analyzed, and the horizontal portion amplifies that signal to distinguish the molecule from others. The use of the T-shaped nanowires created in Chui s lab is a new application of a UCLA patented invention that was developed by Chui and his colleagues. The device is the first time that  lab-on-a-chip  analysis has been tested in a scenario that mimics a real-life situation. The UCLA scientists exposed cultured lung cells to different nanomaterials and then compared their results using SELFA with results in a database of previous studies that used other testing methods.  By measuring biomarker concentrations in the cell culture, we showed that SELFA was 100 times more sensitive than ELISA,  Meng said.  This means that not only can SELFA analyze much smaller sample sizes, but also that it can minimize false-positive test results.  Chui said,  The results are significant because SELFA measurement allows us to predict the inflammatory potential of a range of nanomaterials inside cells and validate the prediction with cellular imaging and experiments in animals  lungs.

However, when space is limited DNA molecules must be packed together more tightly. This case arises in sperm, cell nuclei and the protein shells of viruses. An international team of physicists has now succeeded in artificially recreating this so-called DNA condensation on a biochip. Recreating important biological processes in cells to better understand them currently is a major topic of research. Now, physicists at TU Munich and the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot have for the first time managed to carry out controlled, so-called DNA condensation on a biochip. This process comes into play whenever DNA molecules are closely packed into tight spaces, for example in circumstances that limit the available volume. This situation arises in cell nuclei and in the protein shells of viruses, as well as in the heads of sperm cells. The phenomenon is also interesting from a physical perspective because it represents a phase transition, of sorts. DNA double helices, which normally repel each other because of their negative charges, are then packed together tightly. ""In this condensed state they take on a nearly crystalline structure,"" says co-author and TU professor Friedrich Simmel. NANO HAIRS The international team led by Simmel and his Israeli colleague Roy Bar-Ziv managed to bond DNA molecules only one thousandth of a millimeter long (i.e. several thousand base pairs long each) tightly to nanostructures of varying widths on a chip. The result looks as though the researchers had planted tiny hairs onto the chip surface. Due to their negative charge, DNA molecules repel each other, giving the appearance of tiny nanohairs standing on end. The process of condensation was initiated when the researchers added an agent called spermidine, whose molecules have multiple positive charges. The previously upright DNA threads collapsed one after the other, dropping systematically onto the fine structures of the next thread. This is like a domino cascade at the nanoscale. The result was compact layers of DNA molecules, packed as densely as they are in cell nuclei. All DNA molecules fell along the predefined path. ""This is a very dramatic process,"" says Simmel. ""The DNA is instantly bundled in a single direction."" Condensation and decondensation, i.e. the renewed unpacking of DNA strands, play an important role in processes like gene expression. When the DNA molecules are densely packed, for example, the information coded in them cannot be read. NEW INSIGHT FROM THE DNA CHIP The researchers thus have a further building block for creating artificial cells on the surface of chips and studying all associated phenomena. ""It is quite plausible to implement cell-like systems with densely packed DNA on a chip,"" says Simmel. DNA condensation could then be used to improve the control of gene expression and copying of genetic information in these kinds of artificial cells. In principle, it is also possible to use the densely packed DNA molecules to relay and distribute signals and information via a kind of conducting path on such biochips. Condensation and decondensation could be used as on/off switches with good temporal control. Friedrich Simmel would not be a passionate researcher if he did not, in addition to technical application perspectives, have his eye on basic physics. ""We also want to understand the conditions of the phase transition during condensation,"" says Simmel. ""For this we have ideal conditions on the chip. We can precisely control where the condensation occurs and how long it takes."" This is somewhat like supercooled water or beer in the freezer box, in which the liquid freezes abruptly starting at a specific point with a crystallization seed and then spreads outwards from there. The only difference is that the phase transition is not controlled by temperature, but rather the concentration of positively charged molecules.The research was funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, the German Research Foundation via the Excellence Cluster Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), the Israel Science Foundation and the Minerva 80 Foundation.","Published: August 16, 2016"

Nearly everybody will at some point in their lives take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; mefenamic acid, a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), is routinely used for period pain. The findings are published today in a paper authored by Dr Brough and colleagues, in the respected journal Nature Communications. Dr Brough and Dr Catherine Lawrencesupervised PhD student Mike Daniels, and postdoc Dr Jack Rivers-Auty who conducted most of the experiments. Though this is the first time a drug has been shown to target this inflammatory pathway, highlighting its importance in the disease model, Dr Brough cautions that more research is needed to identify its impact on humans, and the long-term implications of its use. The research, funded by the Medical Research Council and the Alzheimer s Society, paves the way for human trials which the team hope to conduct in the future. Around 500,000 people in the UK have Alzheimer s disease which gets worse over time, affecting many aspects of their lives, including the ability to remember, think and make decisions. In the study transgenic mice that develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease were used. One group of 10 mice was treated with mefenamic acid, and 10 mice were treated in the same way with a placebo. The mice were treated at a time when they had developed memory problems and the drug was given to them by a mini-pump implanted under the skin for one month. Memory loss was completely reversed back to the levels seen in mice without the disease. Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome , which damages brain cells Dr Brough said:  There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer s disease worse.  Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome , which damages brain cells.  He added:  Until now, no drug has been available to target this pathway, so we are very excited by this result.  However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don t always faithfully replicate the human disease.  Because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known, the time for it to reach patients should, in theory, be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs.  We are now preparing applications to perform early phase II trials to determine a proof-of-concept that the molecules have an effect on neuroinflammation in humans.  Dr Doug Brown, Director of Research and Development at Alzheimer s Society, said:  Testing drugs already in use for other conditions is a priority for Alzheimer s Society - it could allow us to shortcut the fifteen years or so needed to develop a new dementia drug from scratch.  These promising lab results identify a class of existing drugs that have potential to treat Alzheimer s disease by blocking a particular part of the immune response. However, these drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for Alzheimer s disease at this stage   studies in people are needed first. ","Published: August 16, 2016"

(Source: Nature Microbiology) Mouse models are extensively used in pharmaceutical and medical research, and it is known that the communities of microbes in their intestine can have a significant impact on the research output. However, there is still insufficient information available about many bacteria inhabiting the intestine of mice. For the first time, a collection of cultured bacterial strains provides comprehensive information on the mouse gut microbiota: Scientists at the Technical University of Munich were able to isolate, characterize, and archive a hundred strains, including 15 hitherto unknown taxa. They are microscopically small and live both on humans and animals. They can help with recovery from an illness or literally make you sick: Billions of micro-organisms, most of which are found in the intestines, as well as on the skin and other regions of the body, living in symbiosis with the host. These tiny beings are of central importance, and experts refer to them as intestinal microbiota or the microbiome. Decoding its characteristics and obtaining a better understanding of it is what scientists at the Central Institute for Nutrition and Food Research (ZIEL) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) are working on. 76 Cultured Bacterial Species Identified and Archived One key to obtaining information about the interactions between gut bacteria and their host are mouse models. However only a handful of mouse intestinal bacteria have been made publicly available and fully characterized so far. This is a highly limiting factor for research, because it complicates the annotation of data obtained by molecular techniques, and because it has been shown that gut microbiomes are to some extent specific to their host, and researchers have been using strains of other origin in mouse models. Dr. habil. Thomas Clavel from ZIEL and colleagues describe a new resource in ""Nature Microbiology"" which, for the first time, contains a hundred cultured bacterial strains from the mouse gut microbiome. For this study, 1500 cultures were examined, and 76 different species were identified and archived. ""The goal of our work was to take a big initial step towards decoding the cultured fraction of gut bacterial communities in mice. There is still a lot left to do. We will be making our work available to scientists around the world and hope that others will also help to find the pieces to complete the puzzle"", said Clavel, who has been researching various bacteria in gut microbiomes at the TU Munich for ten years. Although the mouse gut microbiome presents a number of similarities with the human microbiome, the work showed that around 20 percent of the strains in the collection prefer colonizing the intestines of mice. In order to better understand colonization processes in the intestine, bacteria first need to be identified and characterized in detail. ""Because mouse models are indispensable for preclinical studies, the resource now made available shall contribute to a better understanding of microbe-host interactions and to a higher degree of standardization"", said Clavel. New Bacteria with Specific Functions For the first time, the researchers were able to characterize new bacteria with important functional properties: For example Flintibacter butyricum produces the short-chain fatty acid butyrate from both sugars and proteins a rare property in the realm of intestinal bacteria. Butyrate is a main product of fermentation in the intestine, and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and positive effects against metabolic diseases in numerous studies.  ""We still have a lot of gaps in our knowledge about gut microbiomes, but with the publicly available database of cultured mouse gut bacteria and their genetic material, we are now a little closer to our goal"", Thomas Clavel from the TUM stated enthusiastically.","Published: August 16, 2016"

This suggests some related underlying illness processes   even though known genetic variations associated with the disorders overlap by only 5 percent, say researchers. Their study, which pinpointed the developmental trajectories of the suspect genes in the monkey brain, also identified divergent timing of risk gene activation that might help to explain the differing courses of the illnesses. Autism-related genes first switched on in newborn neurons during prenatal development, while schizophrenia risk genes didn t activate until infancy.   This suggests that genetic risk for autism may have more to do with prenatal processes, such as the birth of new neurons, while schizophrenia risk genes may impact processes underway during infancy, such as refinement of neuronal circuitry. The delay is consistent with schizophrenia s much later onset of symptoms in late adolescence/early adulthood, the researchers note. The insights into the transcriptional origins of human mental illness were made possible by an NIMH-funded map  of gene expression in the rhesus monkey brain across pre- and post-natal development.  The map was developed by a scientific team of 100 researchers led by Ed Lein, Ph.D. , of the Allen Institute for Brain Research, who reported on their findings July 13, 2016 in the journal Nature. The study focused on brain regions and developmental milestones linked to human mental illness. It turns out that only 9 percent of genes differ in their developmental trajectories between rhesus monkeys and humans   compared to 22 percent differing between rats and humans. Even though uniquely human disease and its specific brain circuitry can t be modeled in non-human primates, comparing our brains with those of more closely related evolutionary cousins enhances understanding of human-specific features of brain development, say the researchers.  This tremendous resource is freely available to the research community and will guide important research into the causes of many neurodevelopmental disorders for years to come,  said Michelle Freund, Ph.D., of the NIMH Office of Technology Development and Coordination, which funded the project.","Published: August 16, 2016"

Gary Blissard of the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University is the co-senior author. The researchers have published their work ""Multifaceted biological insights from a draft genome sequence of the tobacco hornworm moth, Manduca sexta"" in the journal Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The scientists have made the genome sequence available to the public through the National Agricultural Library.  ""This project represents years of collaborative research across the world,"" said Kanost, who studies insect immune systems. ""We wanted to provide these valuable data to scientists, and our hope is that this sequenced genome will stimulate new research in molecular studies of insects."" The tobacco hornworm, or Manduca sexta, develops into the Carolina sphinx moth. The name Manduca comes from the Latin word for glutton because these caterpillars eat so much. Manduca sexta occurs naturally in North, Central and South America and is a known pest to gardeners: It eats the leaves of tomato plants and also can be found on pepper, eggplant and potato plants. Crops and weeds from this plant family, which includes tobacco, produce chemicals such as nicotine that deter feeding by most insects, but not Manduca sexta, which makes its physiology especially interesting to scientists. The sequenced genome can lead to improved molecular biology, physiology and neurobiology research in insects and also may help in developing future new methods for insect pest management. The tobacco hornworm is a good model species because its large size   the caterpillar can measure up to 4 inches long   makes it easy to gather tissue samples. ""Some of the same kind of proteins exist in caterpillar blood and human blood,"" Kanost said. ""These proteins have similar functions in the immune system. By studying mechanisms and molecules, we can look at the similarities and differences between caterpillars and humans in how immunity functions and evolves."" Kanost has studied the tobacco hornworm for decades, and he and Blissard decided to start the collaborative project to sequence the tobacco hornworm's genome in 2009. Kanost's research focuses on proteins in caterpillar's blood and how insects protect themselves against infections. Collaboratively, the research team sequenced the DNA that encodes the genes as well as the RNA from the insect at different developmental stages to identify when different genes are expressed and in which tissues and organs.  Kanost and the Kansas State University research team prepared and purified the DNA of the tobacco hornworm and sent the samples to the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center in Houston, which performed the genome sequencing.  The international team used a common computer system so that the researchers from around the world could analyze the gene sequences based on their areas of expertise. By combining their specialties, the researchers created the official gene set.

Weiss, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Hematology, and study author Elizabeth A. Traxler. An international team of scientists led by researchers at St. Jude Children s Research Hospital has found a way to use CRISPR gene editing to help fix sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia in blood cells isolated from patients. The study provides proof-of-principle for a new approach to treat common blood disorders by genome editing.  Our approach to gene editing is informed by the known benefits of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin,  said Mitchell J. Weiss, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Hematology and one of the study s lead authors.  It has been known for some time that individuals with genetic mutations that persistently elevate fetal hemoglobin are resistant to the symptoms of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, genetic forms of severe anemia that are common in many regions of the world. We have found a way to use CRISPR gene editing to produce similar benefits.  Fetal and adult hemoglobin are two different molecular forms of the essential oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. Hemoglobins are made up of different combinations of four molecular subunits. Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia are caused by mutations in a gene encoding an adult-expressed subunit termed  beta.  Disease becomes apparent after birth as the levels of adult hemoglobin take hold and levels of fetal hemoglobin decline. These mutations can affect the survival of red blood cells and inhibit oxygen delivery to tissues, causing impaired function of different organs with devastating consequences for patients. Fetal hemoglobin lacks beta subunits and has gamma subunits instead. Thus, beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease associated mutations, which impair the production or function of the beta subunit, do not cause problems with fetal hemoglobin, which can transport oxygen effectively in adults. Experts have known for some time that inhibiting or reversing  gamma-to-beta  switching of hemoglobin subunits can raise levels of fetal hemoglobin in adults and significantly ameliorate the debilitating symptoms of beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease.  Our work has identified a potential DNA target for genome editing mediated therapy and offers proof-of-principle for a possible approach to treat sickle cell and beta-thalassemia,  added Weiss.  We have been able to snip that DNA target using CRISPR, remove a short segment in a  control section  of DNA that stimulates gamma-to-beta switching, and join the ends back up to produce sustained elevation of fetal hemoglobin levels in adult red blood cells.  When the scientists edited the DNA of blood-forming stem cells derived from patients with sickle cell disease, they were able to activate those genes and produce red blood cells that had enough fetal hemoglobin to be healthy. Recently, scientists have used several gene editing approaches to manipulate blood-forming stem cells for the possible treatment of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, including repair of specific disease-causing mutations and other strategies to inhibit gamma-to-beta switching. All of these approaches remain untested in patients.  Our results represent an additional approach to these existing innovative strategies and compare favorably in terms of the levels of fetal hemoglobin that are produced by our experimental system,  said Weiss.  Using genome editing to restore the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is an attractive possibility, because it can be achieved relatively easily using current technologies. The condition is known to be benign in people who inherit similar naturally occurring mutations. At this stage, the scientists emphasize that it is still too early to begin clinical trials of the new gene editing approach. The researchers want to refine further the gene editing process and perform other experiments to minimize potentially harmful off-target mutations before in-human clinical trials are considered.  Additionally, it will be important to compare different approaches head-to-head to determine which one is safest and most effective.","Published: August 16, 2016"

A new study used single cell sequencing technology to provide previously unknown details about how and when CNAs impact tumor formation and growth, information that may have significant implications for diagnosis and treatment. The research results, published in the Aug. 15 online issue of Nature Genetics, challenge the prevailing belief CNAs take place slowly and gradually over time. Instead, study findings revealed chromosomal changes occur in short, punctuated  bursts  at the earliest stages of tumor growth.  The current model asserts CNAs are acquired gradually and sequentially over extended periods of time, leading to successively more malignant stages of cancer,  said Nicholas Navin, Ph.D., professor of Genetics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and lead author of the paper.  Another model is punctuated evolution in which CNAs are acquired in short bursts of crisis, followed by stable clonal expansion that form the tumor mass. Our study suggests punctuated copy number evolution is common in TNBC patients.  Navin s study supports the  bursts  model and demonstrates the majority of CNAs are acquired at the earliest stages of tumor evolution. The discovery is important since most genomic studies have focused on a single point in time, after a tumor has been surgically removed, making it difficult to study the natural history of chromosome evolution during tumor growth. The finding also indicated other cancers may demonstrate similar CNA behavior.  Our preliminary data in cancers such as prostate, colon, liver and lung suggest a punctuated model of copy number evolution is also likely to be operative in other solid cancers,  said Navin.  This model has important implications for our evolutionary understanding of cancer growth dynamics and for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of TNBC patients.  The research team developed a new method called highly multiplexed single-nucleus sequencing (HM-SNS) to investigate CNA s clonal substructure and evolution in a cohort of 12 TNBC patients, whose tumors had been surgically removed prior to further therapy. HM-SNS allows researchers to sequence the genomes of single tumor cells and study multiple cells simultaneously, both lowering the cost and boosting data analysis for such studies.","Published: August 16, 2016"

The study, funded by the NIH s Parkinson s Disease Biomarkers Program and published in Neurology, may provide a new tool for testing experimental medications aimed at alleviating symptoms and slowing the rate at which the diseases damage the brain.  If you know that in Parkinson s disease the activity in a specific brain region is decreasing over the course of a year, it opens the door to evaluating a therapeutic to see if it can slow that reduction,  said senior author David Vaillancourt, Ph.D., a professor in the University of Florida s Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology.  It provides a marker for evaluating how treatments alter the chronic changes in brain physiology caused by Parkinson s.  Parkinson s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that destroys neurons in the brain that are essential for controlling movement. While many medications exist that lessen the consequences of this neuronal loss, none can prevent the destruction of those cells. Clinical trials for Parkinson s disease have long relied on observing whether a therapy improves patients  symptoms, but such studies reveal little about how the treatment affects the underlying progressive neurodegeneration. As a result, while there are treatments that improve symptoms, they become less effective as the neurodegeneration advances. The new study could remedy this issue by providing researchers with measurable targets, called biomarkers, to assess whether a drug slows or even stops the progression of the disease in the brain.  For decades, the field has been searching for an effective biomarker for Parkinson s disease,  said Debra Babcock, M.D., Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  This study is an example of how brain imaging biomarkers can be used to monitor the progression of Parkinson s disease and other neurological disorders.   The Parkinson s Disease Biomarkers Program is an essential part of moving towards the development of treatments that impact the causes, and not just the symptoms, of Parkinson s disease,  added NINDS program director Katrina Gwinn, M.D. Dr. Vaillancourt s team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure activity in a set of pre-determined brain areas in healthy controls, individuals with Parkinson s disease, and patients with two forms of  atypical Parkinsonism    multiple systems atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)   that have symptoms similar to those of Parkinson s disease. The researchers selected the specific brain regions, which are critical for movement and balance, based on the findings of past studies in people with these three conditions. The participants each underwent two scans spaced a year apart, during which they completed a test that gauged their grip strength. The healthy controls showed no changes in neural activity after a year, whereas the participants with Parkinson s showed reductions in the response of two brain regions called the putamen and the primary motor cortex. Previous research had shown reduced activity in the primary motor cortex of Parkinson s patients, but the new study is the first to suggest that this deficit worsens over time. Activity decreased in MSA patients in the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the superior cerebellum, while the individuals with PSP showed a decline in the response of these three areas and the putamen. Dr. Vaillancourt s team now hopes to use its newly discovered biomarkers, in addition to one it had previously identified, to test whether an experimental medication known to improve Parkinson s symptoms also slows the progression of those brain changes.  These markers allow us to evaluate disease-modifying therapeutics because we know that the control group doesn t change over a year but patient groups do,  Dr. Vaillancourt explained.  We can see whether a therapeutic prevents that change from occurring, and if it does, then that suggests it might have a disease-modifying effect.  The study was supported by the NIH (NS052318, NS075012, NS082168). The NINDS is the nation s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.","Published: August 16, 2016"

This newfound function of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins, reported recently in Science,  could open up new ways of thinking about PARP proteins that can lead to therapeutic opportunities,  said senior author Dr. W. Lee Kraus, Director of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences at UT Southwestern. In recent years, PARP-inhibiting drugs have received significant attention as potential cancer therapies. The first PARP inhibitor was approved by the FDA in 2014 for certain ovarian cancers, and about 140 clinical trials   including several at UT Southwestern   are currently examining the impact of these drugs on different types of cancer. To date, most studies have looked at PARP inhibitors only in terms of their effects on DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic integrity, said Dr. Kraus, also Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Pharmacology, and holder of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Distinguished Chair in Reproductive Biology Sciences.  People tend to think that PARP inhibitors work only by blocking DNA repair   an important cellular function that can promote the killing of cancer cells when inhibited,  he said.  However, our studies show that PARPs also play key roles in gene regulation and RNA synthesis, which are distinct from DNA repair but can also be lethal when inhibited or altered.  The researchers initially developed an innovative chemical-genetic assay to monitor the enzymatic activity of three different PARP family members and to identify the proteins targeted and modified by the three proteins.  After we developed the technology and realized how powerful it was for identifying PARP targets, we repurposed the method to examine ADP-ribosylation across the genome,  said Dr. Kraus, whose laboratory studies the basic mechanisms of signaling and gene regulation by small molecules and how these pathways relate to human physiology. The researchers focused on a protein complex called negative elongation factor, or NELF, which is a target of PARP-1, one of the PARP protein family members. NELF is involved in transcriptional regulation, a major process by which cells control gene activity.  We were able to show that modification of NELF by PARP-1 in breast cancer cells alters how genes are turned on and off, potentially changing the biology of the cells,  Dr. Kraus said.  This is a new connection.  The team s findings have therapeutic implications beyond cancer, Dr. Kraus said.  PARPs also play a key role in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, and there is strong evidence from animal models that links PARP inhibitors to improved outcomes in both types of diseases,  he said.  By discovering a new aspect of the biology of PARPs, we have expanded our understanding of what these proteins do. Our results open new avenues that go beyond DNA repair for using PARP inhibitors to treat cancer and other diseases.  Other UT Southwestern authors who contributed to this study included Dr. Yonghao Yu, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry, a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research, and a CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research; Dr. Yajie Zhang, a postdoctoral researcher in Biochemistry; and Dr. Bryan Gibson, a postdoctoral researcher in Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The Microsoft Kinect is a 3D depth-sensing camera used in interactive video activities such as tennis and dancing. It can be hooked up to an Xbox gaming console or a Windows computer. See Also: New MRI technique offers faster diagnosis of multiple sclerosis A team of researchers led by McGill University postdoctoral fellow Farnood Gholami, supervised by Jozsef K vecses from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Centre for Intelligent Machines, collaborated with Daria Trojan, a physiatrist in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery working at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, to test whether the Kinect could detect the differences in gait of MS patients compared to healthy individuals. In current clinical practice, the walking movement of MS patients is usually assessed by their doctors, and subjective evaluations may distort results: two different clinicians may give the same patient different evaluations. Using a camera that detects movement and computer algorithms that quantify the patients' walking patterns can reduce potential for human error. Gholami captured the movement of 10 MS patients and 10 members of an age-and-sex-matched control group using the Kinect device. The MS patients had previously been assessed for gait abnormalities using the traditional clinician method. Using the data, the team then developed computer algorithms that quantified gait characteristics of MS patients and healthy people. The investigators found that gait characteristics measured with the Kinect camera and analyzed with the developed algorithms were reproducible when assessed at one visit and were different between MS patients and the healthy individuals. Moreover, the gait characteristics of MS patients obtained by the algorithm were correlated with clinical measures of gait. In addition, the algorithms could mathematically define the characteristics of gait in MS patients at different severity levels, accurately determining his/her level of gait abnormality.

People give to charity for numerous non-altruistic reasons, such as showing off their generosity to others. To isolate pure altruism from other motivations, researchers triangulated methods from the three fields. See Also: Shocking new role found for the immune system: Controlling social interactionTheir goal was to find a sweet spot where altruism is done for the simple joy of seeing others benefit without expecting personal rewards or recognition, said Ulrich Mayr, head of the UO Department of Psychology and lead author on a paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. In an experiment with 80 men and women, ages 18-67, all with similar work and life experiences, the participants made real decisions about either giving cash to a charity or keeping it for themselves. This method, said co-author William T. Harbaugh, was based on a basic principle of economic research: ""Look at what people do, not what they say."" The researchers also used functional MRI to look at brain regions associated with value and rewards as each subject watched various scenarios involving money going either to themselves or to charities. The participants also took detailed psychological assessments of their personality traits. Replicating an earlier study published in the journal Science in 2007 by Mayr, Harbaugh and UO doctoral student Daniel Burghart, the results showed that for some people neural reward areas were more active when money went to themselves than to charities. This, Mayr said, can be interpreted as a self-interested neural response. Read Next: Anxiety can kill your social status Others showed more neural reward when they witnessed money going to a charity. These individuals, whose neural responses suggest altruistic tendencies, also gave more money when they had a choice. They also showed a stronger expression of pro-social personality traits. The five-member research team said the pattern points to a strong underlying dimension that they labeled as general benevolence, which reflects altruistic tendencies based on measures drawn from neuroscience, behavioral economics and psychology. General benevolence is more strongly expressed in the second half of the life span, the researchers found. People older than 45 receive more neural reward from seeing others better off, they give more money away and they score higher on pro-social personality traits than those under 45. ""Our approach allowed us to look at commonalities in the different approaches to assess altruism,"" Mayr said. ""It is exciting that the three very different methods converge on a common general benevolence dimension and that we can reliably measure pure altruism."" Religiosity also showed a moderate, positive relationship, but gender, political orientation and annual income did not. The finding that income was not a factor, the researchers said, indicated that the correlation they saw with age ""was not simply due to older adults being generally wealthier."" The approach also made it possible to identify brain areas associated with each of the different behavioral signs of general benevolence and where they converge, said co-author Jason Hubbard, a doctoral student in psychology. Since general benevolence increases with age, Mayr said, it suggests the possibility that life experiences may plant the seeds of pure altruism in people, allowing them to grow into the desire to contribute to the public good. ""There has been a lot of interest in the role that personality plays in important policy goals,"" said co-author Sanjay Srivastava, a professor of psychology. ""There are two big questions: what affects how personality develops, and what are the consequences of developing in different ways?

The new study used the costly MRI technology on 80 subjects versus the pool of 19 in the earlier study. While the higher number of subjects helps make the case that the findings are robust, Mayr said, larger studies still are needed to gather more confirmation on the group's conclusions.

Probably not much, to the casual listener. But in the mind of one famously eclectic singer-songwriter, the two songs are highly similar. That's one of the surprising findings of an unusual neuroscience study based on brain scans of the musician Sting. See Also: Listening to classical music modulates genes responsible for various brain functions The paper, published in the journal Neurocase, uses recently developed imaging-analysis techniques to provide a window into the mind of a masterful musician. It also represents an approach that could offer insights into how gifted individuals find connections between seemingly disparate thoughts or sounds, in fields ranging from arts to politics or science. ""These state-of the-art techniques really allowed us to make maps of how Sting's brain organizes music,"" says lead author Daniel Levitin, a cognitive psychologist at McGill University. ""That's important because at the heart of great musicianship is the ability to manipulate in one's mind rich representations of the desired soundscape."" The research stemmed from a serendipitous encounter several years ago. Sting had read Levitin's book This Is Your Brain on Music and was coming to Montreal to play a concert. His representatives contacted Levitin and asked if he might take a tour of the lab at McGill. Levitin whose lab has hosted visits from many popular musicians over the years readily agreed. And he added a unique twist: ""I asked if he also wanted to have his brain scanned. He said 'yes'."" So it was that McGill students in the Stewart Biology Building one day found themselves sharing an elevator with the former lead singer of The Police, who has won 16 Grammy Awards, including one in 1982 for the hit single ""Don't Stand So Close To Me."" Read Next: Researchers look into the brains of music fansBoth functional and structural scans were conducted in a single session at the brain imaging unit of McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute, the hot afternoon before a Police concert. A power outage knocked the entire campus off-line for several hours, threatening to cancel the experiment. Because it takes over an hour to reboot the fMRI machine, time grew short. Sting generously agreed to skip his soundcheck in order to do the scan. Levitin then teamed up with Scott Grafton, a leading brain-scan expert at the University of California at Santa Barbara, to use two novel techniques to analyze the scans. The techniques, known as multivoxel pattern analysis and representational dissimilarity analysis, showed which songs Sting found similar to one another and which ones are dissimilar based not on tests or questionnaires, but on activations of brain regions. ""At the heart of these methods is the ability to test if patterns of brain activity are more alike for two similar styles of music compared to different styles. This approach has never before been considered in brain imaging experiments of music,"" notes Scott Grafton. ""Sting's brain scan pointed us to several connections between pieces of music that I know well but had never seen as related before,"" Levitin says. Piazzola's ""Libertango"" and the Beatles' ""Girl"" proved to be two of the most similar. Both are in minor keys and include similar melodic motifs, the paper reveals. Another example: Sting's own ""Moon over Bourbon Street"" and Booker T. and the MG's ""Green Onions,"" both of which are in the key of F minor, have the same tempo (132 beats per minute) and a swing rhythm.

The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, could help uncover the molecular origins of this devastating disease, and may be used to develop preventative treatments for at-risk individuals to be taken well before symptoms appear. The results, by researchers from the University of Cambridge, identified a specific signature of a group of genes in the regions of the brain which are most vulnerable to Alzheimer s disease. They found that these parts of the brain are vulnerable because the body s defence mechanisms against the proteins partly responsible for Alzheimer s disease are weaker in these areas. Healthy individuals with this specific gene signature are highly likely to develop Alzheimer s disease in later life, and would most benefit from preventative treatments, if and when they are developed for human use. Alzheimer s disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterised by the progressive degeneration of the brain. Not only is the disease currently incurable, but its molecular origins are still unknown. Degeneration in Alzheimer s disease follows a characteristic pattern: starting from the entorhinal region and spreading out to all neocortical areas. What researchers have long wondered is why certain parts of the brain are more vulnerable to Alzheimer s disease than others.  To answer this question, what we ve tried to do is to predict disease progression starting from healthy brains,  said senior author Professor Michele Vendruscolo of the Centre for Misfolding Diseases at Cambridge s Department of Chemistry.  If we can predict where and when neuronal damage will occur, then we will understand why certain brain tissues are vulnerable, and get a glimpse at the molecular origins of Alzheimer s disease.  One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer s disease is the build-up of protein deposits, known as plaques and tangles, in the brains of affected individuals. These deposits, which accumulate when naturally-occurring proteins in the body fold into the wrong shape and stick together, are formed primarily of two proteins: amyloid-beta and tau.  We wanted to know whether there is something special about the way these proteins behave in vulnerable brain tissue in young individuals, long before the typical age of onset of the disease,  said Vendruscolo. Vendruscolo and his colleagues found that part of the answer lay within the mechanism of control of amyloid-beta and tau. Through the analysis of more than 500 samples of healthy brain tissues from the Allen Brain Atlas, they identified a signature of a group of genes in healthy brains. When compared with tissue from Alzheimer s patients, the researchers found that this same pattern is repeated in the way the disease spreads in the brain.  Vulnerability to Alzheimer s disease isn t dictated by abnormal levels of the aggregation-prone proteins that form the characteristic deposits in disease, but rather by the weaker control of these proteins in the specific brain tissues that first succumb to the disease,  said Vendruscolo. Our body has a number of effective defence mechanisms which protect it against protein aggregation, but as we age, these defences get weaker, which is why Alzheimer s generally occurs in later life. As these defence mechanisms, collectively known as protein homeostasis systems, get progressively impaired with age, proteins are able to form more and more aggregates, starting from the tissues where protein homeostasis is not so strong in the first place. Earlier this year, the same researchers behind the current study identified a possible  neurostatin  that could be taken by healthy individuals in order to slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer s disease, in a similar way to how statins are taken to prevent heart disease. The current results suggest a way to exploit the gene signature to identify those individuals most at risk and who would most benefit from taking a neurostatin in earlier life. Although a neurostatin for human use is still quite some time away, a shorter-term benefit of these results may be the development of more effective animal models for the study of Alzheimer s disease. Since the molecular origins of the disease have been unknown to date, it has been difficult to breed genetically modified mice or other animals that repeat the full pathology of Alzheimer s disease, which is the most common way for scientists to understand this or any disease in order to develop new treatments.  It is exciting to consider that the molecular origins identified here for Alzheimer s may predict vulnerability for other diseases associated with aberrant aggregation   such as ALS, Parkinson s and frontotemporal dementia,  said Rosie Freer, a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry and the study s lead author.  I hope that these results will help drug discovery efforts   that by illuminating the origin of disease vulnerability, there will be a clearer target for those working to cure Alzheimer s.   The results of this particular study provide a clear link between the key factors that we have identified as underlying the aggregation phenomenon and the order in which the effects of Alzheimer s disease are known to spread through the different regions of the brain,  said study co-author Professor Christopher Dobson, who is Master of St John s College, Cambridge.  Linking the properties of specific protein molecules to the onset and spread of neuronal damage is a crucial step in the quest to find effective drugs to combat this dreadful neurodegenerative condition, and potentially other diseases related to protein misfolding and aggregation.  Addressing these problems represents the core programme of research of the Centre for Misfolding Diseases, which is directed by Chris Dobson, Tuomas Knowles and Michele Vendruscolo. The primary mission of the Centre is to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular origins of the variety of disorders associated with the misfolding and aggregation of proteins, which include Parkinson's disease, ALS and type II diabetes as well as Alzheimer's disease, and then to use such understanding for the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies.","Published: August 13, 2016"

Previously it was thought that in Finland approximately a thousand people suffer subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) every year most of them adults of working age. Up to half of those afflicted die within a year. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is typically caused by a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, which leads to a sudden increase in the intracranial pressure. Smoking is a key risk factor for SAH. See Also: Smoking thins vital part of brain A Finnish study published in the journal Neurology looked at changes in the incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage over a period of 15 years (1998-2012), and these were contrasted with changes in the prevalence of smoking. The results indicated that the number of people afflicted with SAH was nearly half of the previously assumed figure and that the number was in rapid decline, a trend which was particularly apparent in younger generations. Within fifteen years, the prevalence of SAH had decreased by 45% among women, and 38% among men, under 50. During the same period, the prevalence of SAH decreased by 16% among women, and 26% among men, over 50. Smoking among Finns aged 15-64 decreased by 30% during the monitoring period. Credit: Miikka Korja / University of Helsinki  ""It is extraordinary for the incidence of any cardiovascular disease to decrease so rapidly at the population level in such a short time,"" says Professor Jaakko Kaprio from the University of Helsinki, one of the primary authors of the study and director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland. ""Even though we cannot demonstrate a direct causation in nation-wide studies, it is highly likely that the national tobacco policies in Finland have contributed to the decline in the incidence of this type of severe brain haemorrhage."" Cerebral aneurysms are fairly common they are present in up to more than 10% of people over the age of 70 but most of them never rupture. For decades, researchers have been searching for factors which could be used to identify persons at high risk of aneurysm ruptures and who should consequently be treated. ""Previous studies have indicated that smoking is one of the most important susceptibility factors for rupturing aneurysms, so in that sense the now established connection between a decrease in smoking and a decrease in SAH is not surprising,"" says the other primary author of the new study, Miikka Korja, a neurosurgeon at Helsinki University Hospital. Dr. Miikka Korja points out that in most countries the incidence of SAH is unknown, as patients who immediately die of a haemorrhage outside of hospital are often erroneously classified as having succumbed to heart failure. In Finland, autopsies are conducted in most cases where a death occurs outside of hospital, confirming the cause of death. Learn More: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified ""According to the research, approximately one fourth of people with subarachnoid haemorrhages have died outside of hospital or in the emergency room.

In a new study published in the journal Science, a team of researchers from the University of Liege and the University of Surrey have scanned the brains of 33 participants across such a 2-day sleep deprivation period and following recovery sleep. Activity in several brain regions, and in particular subcortical areas, followed a 24-hour rhythmic (circadian) pattern the timing of which, surprisingly, varied across brain regions. See Also: Altered circadian rhythm worsens Parkinson's disease, researchers showOther brain regions, in particular frontal brain areas, showed a reduction in activity with time awake followed by a return to pre-sleep-deprivation levels after recovery sleep. Some brain regions displayed a pattern which was a combination of a rhythmic pattern and a decline associated with time awake. Even more surprising, the researchers discovered that these effects of sleep loss on brain activity were much more widespread when the participants performed a simple (reaction time) task compared to a more complex memory-reliant task. In each participant 13 brain scans were obtained: 12 during the sleep deprivation period and one following recovery sleep. The data were aligned with the melatonin rhythm which is a hormonal marker of the human brain circadian pacemaker, i.e. a marker of brain time. This variety in brain responses and the prominent circadian rhythm component shed new light on the complexity of the mechanisms by which the brain responds to sleep loss. It also shows that the time of day at which we scan the brain has a prominent effect on the picture we get. Behavioural observations have long suggested that brain function is influenced by the duration of wakefulness and the biological time of day (circadian rhythmicity). During a period of sleep deprivation performance does not deteriorate linearly with time awake. It remains constant during the day, rapidly deteriorates during the biological night and then slightly improves the next day. The current findings demonstrate that these two processes and this time course can also be detected at the level of brain responses as assessed by fMRI which provides measures of brain activity. In addition they show that the relative contribution of sleep loss and time of day effects varies across brain regions. Professor Derk-Jan Dijk from the University of Surrey said: ""It is very gratifying to see directly at the level of fMRI-detected brain responses that circadian rhythmicity and lack of sleep both have such a profound influence on brain function.

Preclinical studies of Fragile X and the Fragile X-related disorders are hampered by the lack of low-cost and sensitive, yet simple methods. National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA) researchers have now developed a set of assays that are robust, cheap enough for routine research use, and may be suitable for initial patient screening, according to a new report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics.

""Careful analysis of the total number of repeats, the number of interruptions in the repeat tract, and the methylation status of the FMR1 gene is important for a proper understanding of an individual's risk of transmission of larger alleles to their offspring and to their personal risk of disease pathology.

Read Next: Blood test may shed new light on fragile X related disorders The new assays have the ability to amplify alleles with up to approximately 1,000 repeats, even in samples from patients who are mosaic, i.e., who have a mixture of cells with different repeat numbers. The assays are sensitive enough to analyze saliva samples with minimal purification. Testing can be completed within a timeframe similar to that of recent commercial diagnostic assays (less than 24 hours to determine repeat size and/or methylation status, less than 24 hours to determine the interruption status and percent methylation) and are comparable in terms of hands-on time required. These assays make it possible to detect even small changes in DNA methylation, making them useful in the hunt for new drugs to reverse the effects of repeat expansion. ""The basic assays for repeat number, methylation status, and the number of uninterrupted repeats cost less than $5, the mark typically considered the threshold for population-based screening,"" said Bruce Hayward, PhD, a Senior Research Fellow in the Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology and the report's first author. To develop these assays, the researchers modified an established PCR assay that was capable of sizing only small alleles to enable it to size larger alleles. ""Realizing the potential broader utility of the sizing assay, we then expanded its abilities to include both methylation and interruption status. We showed that these assays perform robustly even in the most challenging of situations,"" said Dr. Hayward.

Prior to this, researchers around the world had assumed that this was a purely passive process. An international team led by diabetes expert Matthias Tsch p reported in the journal Cell that transportation of sugar into the brain is regulated by so-called glia cells that react to hormones such as insulin or leptin; previously it was thought that this was only possible for neurons. See Also: Using magnetic forces to control neurons, study finds brain is vital in glucose metabolismThe rapid rise in obesity and the associated spread of type 2 diabetes represent an enormous challenge for our society. No efficient and safe medicines to prevent or stop this development are available. The failure to develop adequate treatments is thought to be primarily due to the fact that the molecular machinery controlling systemic metabolism still remains mostly unknown. Matthias Tsch p of the Chair for Metabolic Diseases at TUM and Director of the Division of Metabolic Diseases and also of the Helmholtz Diabetes Center (HDC) at Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, is investigating how control centers in the brain remotely control our metabolism in order to adjust optimally to our environment. The brain has the highest sugar consumption of all organs and also controls for example hunger feelings. ""We therefore suspected that a process as important as providing the brain with sufficient sugar was unlikely to be completely random,"" said Dr. Cristina Garc a-C ceres, neurobiologist at the HDC and the study's lead author. ""We were misled by the fact that nerve cells apparently did not control this process and therefore first thought it to occur passively. Then we had the idea that glia cells such as astrocytes*, which had long been misunderstood as less important 'support cells', might have something to do with transporting sugar into the brain."" Don't Miss: Obesity and diabetes symptoms in mice improved by reversing brain inflammation The scientists therefore first examined the activity of insulin receptors on the surface of astrocytes, molecular structures which respond to insulin to influence cell metabolism. Here they found that if this receptor was missing on certain astrocytes the result was less activity in neurons that curb food uptake (proopiomelanocortin neurons). At the same time, adaption of metabolism to challenges like sugar intake became impaired. With the help of advanced imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography, the scientists were able to show that hormones such as insulin and leptin act specifically on 'support' glia cells to regulate sugar intake into the brain, like a 'sugar switch'. Without insulin receptors, astrocytes became less efficient in transporting glucose into the brain, particularly in the area of the satiety centers, which are located in the hypothalamus. ""Our results showed for the first time that essential metabolic and behavioral processes are not regulated via neuronal cells alone and that other cell types in the brain, such as astrocytes, play a crucial role,"" explains study leader Matthias Tsch p, who also heads the drug discovery division at the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD). ""This represents a paradigm shift and could help explain why it has been so difficult to find sufficiently efficient and save medicines for diabetes and obesity until now."" Read Next: Study shows long-term effects of type 2 diabetes on the brain, thinking According to the scientists, numerous new studies will now be necessary to adjust the old model of purely neural control of food intake and metabolism with a concept where astrocytes and possibly even immune cells in the brain also play a crucial role. Once there is a better understanding of the interaction between these various cells, the idea is to find ways and substances that modulate pathways on multiple cell types to curb sugar addiction and ultimately provide better treatment to the growing number of obese and diabetic individuals.

In recent work, neuroscientists at Columbia University demonstrate that a set of neurons trained to fire in unison could be reactivated as much as a day later if just one neuron in the network was stimulated. Though further research is needed, their findings suggest that groups of activated neurons may form the basic building blocks of learning and memory, as originally hypothesized by psychologist Donald Hebb in the 1940s. See Also: Children's impulsive behaviour is related to their brain connectivity ""I always thought the brain was mostly hard-wired,"" said the study's senior author, Dr. Rafael Yuste, a neuroscience professor at Columbia University. ""But then I saw the results and said 'Holy moly, this whole thing is plastic.' We're dealing with a plastic computer that's constantly learning and changing."" The researchers were able to control and observe the brain of a living mouse using the optogenetic tools that have revolutionized neuroscience in the last decade. They injected the mouse with a virus containing light-sensitive proteins engineered to reach specific brain cells. Once inside a cell, the proteins allowed researchers to remotely activate the neuron with light, as if switching on a TV. The mouse was allowed to run freely on a treadmill while its head was held still under a microscope. With one laser, the researchers beamed light through its skull to stimulate a small group of cells in the visual cortex. With a second laser, they recorded rising levels of calcium in each neuron as it fired, thus imaging the activity of individual cells. Before optogenetics, scientists had to open the skull and implant electrodes into living tissue to stimulate neurons with electricity and measure their response. Even a mouse brain of 100 million neurons, nearly a thousandth the size of ours, was too dense to get a close look at groups of neurons. Optogenetics allowed researchers to get inside the brain non-invasively and control it far more precisely. In the last decade, researchers have restored sight and hearing to blind and deaf mice, and turned normal mice aggressive, all by manipulating specific brain regions. Read Next: Changes in brain connectivity protect against developing bipolar disorderThe breakthrough that allowed researchers to reprogram a cluster of cells in the brain is the culmination of more than a decade of work. With tissue samples from the mouse visual cortex, Yuste and his colleagues showed in a 2003 study in Nature that neurons coordinated their firing in small networks called neural ensembles. A year later, they demonstrated that the ensembles fired off in sequential patterns through time. As techniques for controlling and observing cells in living animals improved, they learned that these neural ensembles are active even without stimulation. They used this information to develop mathematical algorithms for finding neural ensembles in the visual cortex. They were then able to show, as they had in the tissue samples earlier, that neural ensembles in living animals also fire one after the other in sequential patterns. The current study in Science shows that these networks can be artificially implanted and replayed, says Yuste, much as the scent of a tea-soaked madeleine takes novelist Marcel Proust back to his memories of childhood. Pairing two-photon stimulation technology with two-photon calcium imaging allowed the researchers to document how individual cells responded to light stimulation. Though previous studies have targeted and recorded individual cells none have demonstrated that a bundle of neurons could be fired off together to imprint what they call a ""neuronal microcircuit"" in a live animal's brain. ""If you told me a year ago we could stimulate 20 neurons in a mouse brain of 100 million neurons and alter their behavior, I'd say no way,"" said Yuste, who is also a member of the Data Science Institute. ""It's like reconfiguring three grains of sand at the beach."" The researchers think that the network of activated neurons they artificially created may have implanted an image completely unfamiliar to the mouse. They are now developing a behavioral study to try and prove this. ""We think that these methods to read and write activity into the living brain will have a major impact in neuroscience and medicine,"" said the study's lead author, Luis Carrillo-Reid, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia. Don't Miss: Dyslexic readers have disrupted network connections in the brain Dr. Daniel Javitt, a psychiatry professor at Columbia University Medical Center who was not involved in the study, says the work could potentially be used to restore normal connection patterns in the brains of people with epilepsy and other brain disorders. Major technical hurdles, however, would need to be overcome before optogenetic techniques could be applied to humans. The research is part of a $300 million brain-mapping effort called the U.S. BRAIN Initiative, which grew out of an earlier proposal by Yuste and his colleagues to develop tools for mapping the brain activity of fruit flies to more complex mammals, including humans.

Take a single bolt out of that machine and something could go wrong a part ceases to move at the proper speed perhaps, or worse, an entire system fails. But what if you removed that hypothetical bolt and the  machine  actually worked better? What if missing that one part, for instance, helped the body burn fuel more efficiently, or prevented a glitch that would otherwise cause the machine to fall into disrepair? Were that the case, then perhaps studying that part and its function within the larger machine might reveal more about how the machine works or might even suggest ways to fix things if the machine broke down. Scientists have found that something akin to that in human genetics, where research has uncovered a handful of so-called  loss-of-function  (LoF) mutations that appear to help protect individuals from certain diseases. These mutations are slight variations in an individual s genetic code that essentially  break  a gene, causing the gene to produce an incomplete (or  truncated ) protein that doesn t function in the body the way it normally would. In 2006, scientists found that such LoF mutations in the gene PCSK9, which produces a protein involved in cholesterol regulation, were associated with lower LDL cholesterol and a lower risk of heart attack. Subsequently, an LoF mutation in the gene CARD9 was found to confer protection against ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn s disease, two debilitating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Such findings are promising because they point to a specific part of the genome that may be involved in inhibiting disease, suggesting potential therapeutic targets.  The hypothesis is that if you inhibit that gene, you will mimic the effect of the mutation, which is to protect the individual from disease. This makes these loss-of-function mutations an attractive lead for drug developers,  explains Manuel Rivas, a computational scientist in the Broad Institute s Medical and Population Genetics (MPG) Program. To track down the mutation, Rivas and colleagues, including senior author Mark Daly, who is co-director of Broad s MPG Program, sequenced genes in regions of the genome that had been previously linked to IBD. Samples that they sequenced came from over 3,000 individuals some with UC or Crohn s disease, and others who were healthy controls. The team looked at the sequencing data for evidence of mutations that resulted in  broken  genes that did not produce functional proteins. The search produced a short list of LoF mutations that they then studied more closely, comparing the prevalence of these mutations in IBD sufferers versus healthy individuals.  The assumption is that if you see many more copies of the LoF mutation in healthy controls compared to individuals who suffer from the disease, then that suggests a protective effect,  Rivas says. The process led them to a single mutation in RNF186, a gene that s biological function is just starting to be deciphered. Individuals with UC were unlikely to carry this mutation, while it was much more common in the healthy controls. Since those with the  broken  gene tended not to get UC, the findings suggest that the gene and the protein it produces might somehow play a role in the development of the disease. That makes RNF186 and its protein a promising focus for follow-up studies to determine whether they, or related biological pathways, might make effective targets for therapeutics.  The nice thing about these protective alleles that disrupt or knockout the function of a gene is they get us closer to understanding the biological role of the gene what it does in health and disease,  says Daly, who is also founding chief of the Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.  That s why there is great enthusiasm for this approach of looking for mutations that break genes; these insights can directly inform the development of new therapies that will have genetic evidence suggesting their safety and efficacy.  One of the keys to finding such mutations, the researchers say, is access to large collections of genetic samples. Since these LoF mutations may be rare, they may only appear and so may only be detectable in large studies. For this study, the researchers benefited from the availability of large sample collections and the willingness of scientists at several institutions and in many countries to share data. Access to the deCODE database turned out to be particularly helpful. deCODE houses and analyzes vast amounts of data from genetic samples taken from Iceland. Since the Icelandic population is relatively isolated, specific rare mutations may be passed on and retained among the people who live on the island, and can therefore appear with greater frequency than in other populations. For instance, the mutation found in RNF186 was four times more common in the population represented in the deCODE data than in other data sets.  We are incredibly grateful to our colleagues around the globe who were willing to openly share their data. It was that spirit of collaboration that enabled this discovery to be confirmed so rapidly,  Daly says. Now that the mutation has been identified, the next steps are to explore the function of the RNF186 protein more in depth and to determine what role it may play in UC. The goal is to elucidate the biology underlying the disease enough that drug developers can explore potential treatments that may mimic the effects of the mutation. That path has worked thus far for PCSK9, where the LoF mutation was shown to help protect against heart attack. That discovery has inspired treatments currently in clinical trials. The researchers are also looking to follow up this study with others seeking LoF mutations.  For me as a statistical geneticist, I m interested in taking this approach to a broader set of traits and diseases and integrating many other data types. Focusing on these  broken  genes has proven to be a valuable approach; it helps us efficiently home in on relevant biology,  Rivas says.","Published: August 12, 2016"

In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka, a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University at the time, discovered how to revert adult connective tissue cells, called fibroblasts, back into immature stem cells that could differentiate into any cell type. These so-called induced pluripotent stem cells won Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in medicine just six years later for their promise in research and medicine. Since then, researchers have discovered other ways to convert cells between different types. This is mostly done by introducing many extra copies of  master switch  genes that produce proteins that turn on entire genetic networks responsible for producing a particular cell type. Now, researchers at Duke University have developed a strategy that avoids the need for the extra gene copies. Instead, a modification of the CRISPR genetic engineering technique is used to directly turn on the natural copies already present in the genome. These early results indicate that the newly converted neuronal cells show a more complete and persistent conversion than the method where new genes are permanently added to the genome. These cells could be used for modeling neurological disorders, discovering new therapeutics, developing personalized medicines and, perhaps in the future, implementing cell therapy. The study was published on August 11, 2016, in the journal Cell Stem Cell.  This technique has many applications for science and medicine. For example, we might have a general idea of how most people s neurons will respond to a drug, but we don t know how your particular neurons with your particular genetics will respond,  said Charles Gersbach, the Rooney Family Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and director for the Center for Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering at Duke.  Taking biopsies of your brain to test your neurons is not an option. But if we could take a skin cell from your arm, turn it into a neuron, and then treat it with various drug combinations, we could determine an optimal personalized therapy.   The challenge is efficiently generating neurons that are stable and have a genetic programming that looks like your real neurons,  says Joshua Black, the graduate student in Gersbach s lab who led the work.  That has been a major obstacle in this area.  In the 1950s, Professor Conrad Waddington, a British developmental biologist who laid the foundations for developmental biology, suggested that immature stem cells differentiating into specific types of adult cells can be thought of as rolling down the side of a ridged mountain into one of many valleys. With each path a cell takes down a particular slope, its options for its final destination become more limited. If you want to change that destination, one option is to push the cell vertically back up the mountain that s the idea behind reprogramming cells to be induced pluripotent stem cells. Another option is to push it horizontally up and over a hill and directly into another valley.  If you have the ability to specifically turn on all the neuron genes, maybe you don t have to go back up the hill,  said Gersbach. Previous methods have accomplished this by introducing viruses that inject extra copies of genes to produce a large number of proteins called master transcription factors. Unique to each cell type, these proteins bind to thousands of places in the genome, turning on that cell type s particular gene network. This method, however, has some drawbacks.  Rather than using a virus to permanently introduce new copies of existing genes, it would be desirable to provide a temporary signal that changes the cell type in a stable way,  said Black.  However, doing so in an efficient manner might require making very specific changes to the genetic program of the cell.  In the new study, Black, Gersbach, and colleagues used CRISPR to precisely activate the three genes that naturally produce the master transcription factors that control the neuronal gene network, rather than having a virus introduce extra copies of those genes. CRISPR is a modified version of a bacterial defense system that targets and slices apart the DNA of familiar invading viruses. In this case, however, the system has been tweaked so that no slicing is involved. Instead, the machinery that identifies specific stretches of DNA has been left intact, and it has been hitched to a gene activator. The CRISPR system was administered to mouse fibroblasts in the laboratory. The tests showed that, once activated by CRISPR, the three neuronal master transcription factor genes robustly activated neuronal genes. This caused the fibroblasts to conduct electrical signals a hallmark of neuronal cells. And even after the CRISPR activators went away, the cells retained their neuronal properties.  When blasting cells with master transcription factors made by viruses, it s possible to make cells that behave like neurons,  said Gersbach.  But if they truly have become autonomously functioning neurons, then they shouldn t require the continuous presence of that external stimulus.  The experiments showed that the new CRISPR technique produced neuronal cells with an epigenetic program at the target genes matching the neuronal markings naturally found in mouse brain tissue.  The method that introduces extra genetic copies with the virus produces a lot of the transcription factors, but very little is being made from the native copies of these genes,  explained Black.  In contrast, the CRISPR approach isn t making as many transcription factors overall, but they re all being produced from the normal chromosomal position, which is a powerful difference since they are stably activated. We re flipping the epigenetic switch to convert cell types rather than driving them to do so synthetically.  The next steps, according to Black, are to extend the method to human cells, raise the efficiency of the technique and try to clear other epigenetic hurdles so that it could be applied to model particular diseases.  In the future, you can imagine making neurons and implanting them in the brain to treat Parkinson s disease or other neurodegenerative conditions,  said Gersbach.  But even if we don t get that far, you can do a lot with these in the lab to help develop better therapies. ","Published: August 12, 2016"

Bees can smell these subtle changes, and glasshouse experiments have shown that bumblebees prefer infected plants over healthy ones.   Scientists say that by indirectly manipulating bee behavior to improve pollination of infected plants by changing their scent, the virus is effectively paying its host back. This may also benefit the virus: helping to spread the pollen of plants susceptible to infection and, in doing so, inhibiting the chance of virus-resistant plant strains emerging. The authors of the new study say that understanding the smells that attract bees, and reproducing these artificially by using similar chemical blends, may enable growers to protect or even enhance yields of bee-pollinated crops.  Bees provide a vital pollination service in the production of three-quarters of the world s food crops. With their numbers in rapid decline, scientists have been searching for ways to harness pollinator power to boost agricultural yields,  said Dr John Carr, Head of Cambridge s Virology and Molecular Plant Pathology group.  Better understanding the natural chemicals that attract bees could provide ways of enhancing pollination, and attracting bees to good sources of pollen and nectar   which they need for survival,  Carr said. He conducted the study with Professor Beverley Glover, Director of Cambridge University Botanic Garden, where many of the experiments took place, and collaborators at Rothamsted Research. CMV is transmitted by aphids   bees don t carry the virus. It s one of the most prevalent pathogens affecting tomato plants, resulting in small plants with poor-tasting fruits that can cause serious losses to cultivated crops. Not only is CMV one of the most damaging viruses for horticultural crops, but it also persists in wild plant populations, and Carr says the new findings may explain why:  We were surprised that bees liked the smell of the plants infected with the virus   it made no sense. You d think the pollinators would prefer a healthy plant. However, modelling suggested that if pollinators were biased towards diseased plants in the wild, this could short-circuit natural selection for disease resistance,  he said.  The virus is rewarding disease-susceptible plants, and at the same time producing new hosts it can infect to prevent itself from going extinct. An example, perhaps, of what s known as symbiotic mutualism.  The increased pollination from bees may also compensate for a decreased yield of seeds in the smaller fruits of virus-infected plants, say the scientists. The findings also reveal a new level of complexity in the evolutionary  arms race  between plants and viruses, in which it is classically believed that plants continually evolve new forms of disease-resistance while viruses evolve new ways to evade it.  We would expect the plants susceptible to disease to suffer, but in making them more attractive to pollinators the virus gives these plants an advantage. Our results suggest that the picture of a plant-pathogen arms race is more complex than previously thought, and in some cases we should think of viruses in a more positive way,  said Carr. Plants emit  volatiles , air-borne organic chemical compounds involved in scent, to attract pollinators and repulse plant-eating animals and microbes. Humans have used them for thousands of years as perfumes and spices. The researchers grew plants in individual containers, and collected air with emissions from CMV-infected plants, as well as  mock-infected  control plants. Through mass spectrometry, researchers could see the change in emissions induced by the virus. They also found that bumblebees could smell the changes. Released one by one in a small  flight arena  in the Botanic Gardens, and timed with a stopwatch by researchers, the bees consistently headed to the infected plants first, and spent longer at those plants.  Bees are far more sensitive to the blends of volatiles emitted by plants and can detect very subtle differences in the mix of chemicals. In fact, they can even be trained to detect traces of chemicals emitted by synthetic substances, including explosives and drugs,  said Carr. Analysis revealed that the virus produces a factor called 2b, which reprograms genetic expression in the tomato plants and causes the change in scent. Mathematical modelling by plant disease epidemiologist Dr Nik Cunniffe, also in the Department of Plant Sciences at Cambridge, explored how the experimental findings apply outside the glasshouse. The model showed how pollinator bias for infected plants can cause genes for disease-susceptibility to persist in plant populations over extremely large numbers of generations. The latest study is the culmination of work spanning almost eight years (and multiple bee stings). The findings will form the basis of a new collaboration with the Royal Horticultural Society, in which they aim to increase pollinator services for cultivated crops. With the global population estimated to reach nine billion people by 2050, producing enough food will be one of this century s greatest challenges. Carr, Glover and Cunniffe are all members of the Cambridge Global Food Security Initiative at Cambridge, which is involved in addressing the issues surrounding food security at local, national and international scales. The use of state-of-the-art experimental glasshouses at Cambridge Botanic Garden, and equipment at Cambridge and Rothamsted, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust.","Published: August 12, 2016"

The Zika virus contains 10 proteins, but only NS4A and NS4B matter when it comes to microcephaly, according to a USC-led study published in the journal Cell Stem Cell on Aug. 11. These miscreant proteins, researchers discovered, have two shared life goals: to handicap fetal brain formation and to mobilize their malevolent forces. Researchers said they are the first to examine three strains of Zika in second trimester human fetal neural stem cells. Previous studies created tiny neural stem cell organoids from adult origin. The USC-led study, a collaborative effort between the virology and neurobiology disciplines, is also the first to examine Zika virus on the molecular level, said Jae Jung, senior corresponding author and distinguished professor and chair of the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.  We now know the molecular pathway, so we made the first big step toward target therapy for Zika-induced microcephaly,  Jung said.  Years from now, one shot or a series of shots could target the proteins NS4A and NS4B or their collaborators.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April confirmed that Zika virus causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects, but it was unclear how. Jung and his colleagues explained the molecular mechanisms that lead to the devastating condition.  This field moves so fast; however, no one has examined the viral proteins in Zika before,  said Jung, holder of the Fletcher Jones Foundation chair in molecular microbiology and immunology.  The scientific community knows what the Zika virus does but not who is responsible. It s the difference between saying this nation s Olympic team earned a gold medal or saying the swim team won the gold medal. My lab is scrutinizing the jobs Zika proteins have in the creation of disease.  How the two miscreant Zika proteins operate The miscreant Zika proteins smack a cellular signaling gatekeeper called  Akt-mTOR pathway  until it is disoriented and can no longer properly guard brain development and autophagy regulation, the cell s recycling factories. Autophagy usually digests and kills pathogens; however, when a family of viruses called flaviviruses (dengue, hepatitis C and Zika) infects a cell, autophagy helps the virus proliferate.  Zika loves and needs autophagy,  Jung said.  Zika raises the activity in this recycling factory so they can use the energy and nutrients there to replicate. It s possible that since Zika is using most of the energy, the neuronal stem cells are left with metabolic deficits. Thus the chances for them to differentiate and mature into neurons and other brain cell types is much lower.  In short, Zika NS4A and NS4B proteins stunt brain development and prod autophagy to mushroom so that the virus could spread. When these two key proteins hijacked fetal neural stem cells, the size of brain organoids were, on average, halved, according to the study. Working collaboratively, the two proteins stunted the growth of fetal neural stem cells further by 65 percent. Moreover, differentiation of neural stem cells into mature brain cells, such as neurons and star-shaped supporting cells called astrocytes, was reduced by up to 51 percent. Taking the next step USC researchers are already working on experiments to better demonstrate the functions of NS4A and NS4B in brain organoids and in mouse models, said Zhen Zhao, corresponding co-author and an assistant professor of research physiology and biophysics. He worked with Berislav Zlokovic, director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at Keck Medicine of USC.  It is important to remember that not every pregnant woman infected with Zika virus gives birth to a baby with microcephaly,  Zhao said.  Nevertheless, we are trying to develop a cure for that percentage that does get Zika-related microcephaly.  Scientists are still looking for effective biomarkers to indicate when a pregnant woman who has been infected with Zika needs intervention. MRI is one possibility, but more work needs to be done, Zhao said.

We have demonstrated that two of the three most serious banana fungal diseases have become more virulent by increasing their ability to manipulate the banana s metabolic pathways and make use of its nutrients,  said UC Davis plant pathologist Ioannis Stergiopoulos, who led the effort to sequence two of the fungal genomes.  This parallel change in metabolism of the pathogen and the host plant has been overlooked until now and may represent a  molecular fingerprint  of the adaption process,  he said.  It is really a wake-up call to the research community to look at similar mechanisms between pathogens and their plant hosts.  The banana is one of the world s top five staple foods. About 100 million tons of bananas are produced annually in nearly 120 countries. But the fruit suffers from an  image problem,  giving consumers the appearance that it is and always will be readily available, said Stergiopoulos. It s an image problem that he fears could prove fatal to the entire banana industry in the very near future. In reality, the global banana industry could be wiped out in just five to 10 years by fast-advancing fungal diseases. And that would prove devastating to millions of small-scale farmers who depend on the fruit for food, fiber and income. Already, Sigatoka   a three-fungus disease complex   reduces banana yields by 40 percent. The Sigatoka complex s three fungal diseases   yellow Sigatoka (Pseudocercospora musae), eumusae leaf spot (Pseudocercospora eumusae) and black Sigatoka (Pseudocercospora figiensis)   emerged as destructive pathogens in just the last century. Eumusae leaf spot and black Sigatoka are now the most devastating, with black Sigatoka posing the greatest constraint to banana production worldwide. The constant threat of the disease requires farmers to make 50 fungicide applications to their banana crops each year to control the disease.  Thirty to 35 percent of banana production cost is in fungicide applications,  Stergiopoulos said.  Because many farmers can t afford the fungicide, they grow bananas of lesser quality, which bring them less income.  And for those growers who can afford fungicide, the applications pose environmental and human-health risks. To make matters worse, all commercial  dessert  bananas   those most commonly found in grocery stores   are of the Cavendish variety.  And unlike a tomato or green bean, which are grown from seeds, bananas are grown from shoot cuttings.  The Cavendish banana plants all originated from one plant and so as clones, they all have the same genotype   and that is a recipe for disaster,  Stergiopoulos said, noting that a disease capable of killing one plant could kill them all. Stergiopoulos and colleagues sequenced the genomes of eumusae leaf spot and black Sigatoka, comparing their findings with the previously sequenced yellow Sigatoka genome sequence. They discovered that this complex of diseases has become lethal to banana plants not just by shutting down the plant s immune system but also by adapting the metabolism of the fungi to match that of the host plants. As a result, the attacking fungi can produce enzymes that break down the plant s cell walls. This allows the fungi to feed on the plant s sugars and other carbohydrates.  Now, for the first time, we know the genomic basis of virulence in these fungal diseases and the pattern by which these pathogens have evolved,  Stergiopoulos said.","Published: August 12, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/biopsies-for-noninvasive-breast-cancer-188665,Biopsies for Noninvasive Breast Cancer Experts say testing is redundant with current treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For patients with the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer, routine testing for estrogen and progesterone receptors in tissue taken at the first  needle  biopsy is both unnecessary and wasteful, according to results of a study led by Johns Hopkins pathologists. The results for people with ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS were persuasive enough that The Johns Hopkins Hospital last January ended the practice of routinely conducting so-called core needle biopsy hormone receptor testing.  If you apply our local results nationally, these unnecessary initial hormone receptor tests currently come with an annual price tag of around $35 million,  says Pedram Argani, M.D., professor of pathology and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and senior author of a study published in the August issue of The American Journal of Surgical Pathology.  Our results indicate that s an expense without any justification. If these tests were routinely eliminated, the savings would be substantial.  Argani also directs the Breast Pathology Service at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. Each year thousands of women   and a small number of men   have  core needle biopsies,  a sampling of suspect breast tissue carried out under a local anesthetic by a radiologist. In the laboratory, pathologists determine if the small cylinder of extracted tissue contains cancer and, if it s there, make an initial classification of what kind   either noninvasive or invasive. The study focused solely on people newly diagnosed with DCIS, a noninvasive cancer that s still contained within the milk ducts of the breast where it originated, and has not spread in the breast or elsewhere. For the study, the Hopkins team reviewed the pathology and medical records of 58 such patients who, within a two-year period beginning in January 2011, had core needle biopsies showing DCIS and follow-up excision at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The rationale for doing the testing has always been that patients with hormone receptor-positive DCIS after excision can take relatively nontoxic medications such as tamoxifen to block the receptors and help prevent the DCIS from recurring. However, there are multiple reasons not to automatically ( reflexively ) test a core biopsy showing DCIS for hormone receptors, Argani says. First, regardless of the core biopsy hormone receptor testing results, the standard of care in the U.S. after needle biopsy for DCIS is that the breast tissue still remaining in the suspect area is surgically removed (excised) by lumpectomy or mastectomy. Hence, the core biopsy hormone receptor results do not affect therapy. Second, Argani adds,  almost 20 percent of the time, the excision reveals that the noninvasive DCIS that the core needle biopsy caught is actually accompanied by invasive breast cancer. So you have to receptor-test the invasive cancer that the core biopsy missed. That means the testing of the core biopsy with DCIS was useless.  Third, when the surgical excision contains DCIS alone (as it does about 80% of the time) and the core biopsy result was negative, most physicians would recommend retesting of the DCIS in the surgically excised specimen since hormone receptor expression can be heterogeneous and a small biopsy could miss a positive area. While hormone-blocking therapy specifically for receptor-positive DCIS can modestly lower the chance of tumor recurrence, prior studies have shown that therapy ultimately has no effect on a patient s survival. Plus, hormone-disabling medications like tamoxifen carry side effects, including a higher than usual risk of blood clots.  Two-thirds of our DCIS study patients did not receive hormone therapy,  Argani says,  even after excision confirmed their hormone-receptor positive DCIS status. So analyzing their needle biopsies or surgical excisionsfor receptors would have clearly been unnecessary for them.    Today, approximately one woman gets a DCIS diagnosis for every four women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, the National Cancer Institute reports. Fortunately, for DCIS a Stage 0 cancer the outlook is good. The 10-year survival rate for women after a lumpectomy is 96 to 98 percent, apparently regardless of other treatment. The average age of discovery is in the mid-50s. In the Hopkins study, unnecessary early receptor analysis cost about $140.00 per patient for preparing a trustworthy stained slide and for the pathologist s study of it.  Extrapolating that to the roughly 60,000 U.S. patients diagnosed with DCIS yearly puts the cost at about $8.5 million,  Argani adds.  The unnecessary cost of automatically testing DCIS in excisions when the information is not used is $26.5 million, which adds up to $35 million dollars per year in the U.S.  The millions saved could save 9,000 children and adults from dying of malaria worldwide, the study authors say, or provide 61,000 hungry American families a year s food.","Published: August 12, 2016"

A: Between 85 to 90 percent of lung cancers are non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and response to standard treatment is typically poor. Some subsets of patients with metastatic disease have seen improved survival thanks to recently developed therapies that target particular lung cancer mutations in the EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways. Mutations in the Ras protein family   including Kras   are frequently detected in NSCLC, but drugs directly targeting Ras mutations in NSCLC have not been effective. Understanding the critical cellular process of autophagy and its role in Kras-driven tumor cells may lead to new therapeutic approaches for NSCLC. Q: What is autophagy and how does this process relate to what we already know? A: Cells eat themselves in times of starvation and stress by a process called autophagy. It was long believed that autophagy allows cells to digest and recycle part of themselves to support their metabolism and survive interruptions in their supply of nutrients.   But whether this is true, and what the recycling was needed for, was not known. Cancer cells turn on autophagy and use it to survive too, even more so than normal cells.  Previously, the White and Guo groups discovered that cancer cells activated by the Ras protein family require autophagy for cell maintenance, metabolic stress tolerance and tumor development. When Ras proteins are  switched on,  they have the ability to turn on other proteins that can activate genes responsible for cell growth and survival. Therefore, understanding what autophagy does can reveal an inherent weakness exploitable for cancer therapy. Q:  How did your team approach the work and what did you learn? A:  The Guo, Chang and White groups at Rutgers worked together with the Rabinowitz group at Princeton University to find out how autophagy enables cancer cells to survive stress. Using the tumor derived cell lines generated from genetically engineered mouse models for Kras-driven NSCLC, we traced the path of intracellular components cannibalized by autophagy through an analytical laboratory technique known as mass spectroscopy. We found that cancer cells do indeed breakdown and recycle themselves to survive starvation. This cannibalization of cellular parts provides fuel to the powerhouses of the cell, the mitochondria, to maintain their energy levels.  Thus, blocking autophagy cuts off the fuel supply to the powerhouses, creating and energy crisis and ultimately cancer cell death. Q: What is the implication of this finding? A:  This finding suggests that cutting of  fuel  to cancer cells by blocking autophagy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for Kras-driven lung cancers. Future research should clarify if the autophagy pathways identified in Kras-driven lung cancers can be applied to other forms of cancer.","Published: August 12, 2016"

The researchers identified approximately 12 genes associated with these traits.   Our strongest focus is on specific genes related to aggression toward unfamiliar humans and dogs, which are associated with highly relevant genes at two genome regions,  said Carlos Alvarez, PhD, principal investigator in the Center for Molecular and Human Genetics in The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital.  Those genes are consistent with the core fear and aggression neural pathway known as the amygdala to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  The findings not only relate to the most important dog behavioral problems but are also likely to be highly relevant to human anxiety disorders, according to Dr. Alvarez.  While the most immediate implications are for veterinary behavioral medicine   genetic testing for risk of specific types of fear and aggression, the long term implications for adults and children with anxiety disorders are encouraging.  Because these risk variants are common across dog breeds, the canine veterinary setting provides an ideal testbed for new therapies targeting those biochemical pathways. Once it is determined which neuronal circuits are affected by the risk variation, this will likely reveal drug targets that could be inhibited or activated to increase or decrease the emotional behavioral effects. Those findings can immediately be tested in pet dog patients under owner consent. And, if those therapies are effective in dogs, they can then be applied to humans with similar conditions. Knowledge of the affected pathways will also provide biomarkers that can be used to identify the patients who are most likely to respond to such treatments.   This project has only just begun,  said Dr. Alvarez.

Peanut OIT involves eating small, gradually increasing amounts of peanut protein daily. Low-dose and high-dose OIT were safe and equally effective at suppressing allergic immune responses to peanut, investigators found. The work was partly supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, both part of the National Institutes of Health. Previous studies with older children showed that peanut OIT can offer some protection against potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis caused by peanut exposure. In this study, researchers led by Wesley Burks, M.D., of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, assessed whether giving OIT to younger children whose duration of peanut allergy was short could alter the course of the allergy and allow safe introduction of peanut into the diet. The study team enrolled 40 peanut-allergic children aged 9 to 36 months. They randomly assigned participants to either high-dose peanut OIT with a target daily dose of 3,000 milligrams peanut protein or a low-dose regimen with a target dose of 300 milligrams. Nearly all participants experienced some side effects, such as abdominal pain, but these were generally mild, and required little or no treatment. After receiving OIT for 29 months on average, participants avoided peanut completely for four weeks before attempting to reintroduce it into their diets. Almost 80 percent of participants successfully reintroduced peanut with no allergic response, with no significant differences between the low-dose and high-dose arms. Comparison of the OIT-treated children with a control group of 154 peanut-allergic children who had avoided peanut showed that OIT-treated children were 19 times more likely to successfully incorporate peanut into their diets. The investigators are continuing to monitor the OIT-treated participants to assess the long-term treatment outcomes. Currently, the NIAID-supported Immune Tolerance Network is conducting a randomized trial called IMPACT to determine whether peanut OIT can lower the risk of allergic reactions, induce tolerance and change the immune responses of peanut-allergic children aged 12 to 48 months.","Published: August 12, 2016"

The proposed levels would reduce the amount of copper released into the environment, which could potentially play a role in reducing antimicrobial resistance. EFSA s Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) recommends that copper content in complete feed for piglets should not exceed 25 mg per kg (down from 170 mg/kg). The maximum content of copper in complete feed for dairy cows and cattle should be reduced from 35 mg/kg of feed to 30 mg/kg, the Panel says. For most other animal groups the currently authorised upper levels are unchanged except for goats where the Panel recommends an increase. The recommended levels are considered sufficient to satisfy the nutritional needs for copper of these animal groups. The FEEDAP Panel s work is based on an extensive systematic literature review and data collected from Member States and stakeholders. The Panel estimates that the reduction of copper in feed for piglets would reduce the release of copper into the environment through manure by 20%. In the scientific opinion, EFSA experts also suggest that reducing copper in feed could help to reduce antimicrobial resistance in pigs and in the environment. This is because some studies indicate   as one of several hypotheses   that the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance could potentially be linked to the genetic proximity of some antibiotic and copper resistance genes.

But knowing for sure what you re getting inside a bun can be difficult.  Now scientists have devised a method that could help prevent frankfurter fraud, which is especially important for those who can t eat certain types of meats. They report their approach in ACS  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Instances of food adulteration have caused several global scandals in recent years. Some caused serious illness and even death, such as the addition of melamine to baby formula in China. And other incidents didn t affect people s health but might have violated cultural or religious dietary restrictions, particularly with respect to the kinds of meat that adherents can consume. Currently, testing the authenticity of a meat product involves sampling its DNA, amplifying the genetic material with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and looking for certain markers. But existing methods often only search for one, long DNA sequence, which could break down during food processing and lead to false results. Md. Eaqub Ali and colleagues wanted to come up with a more reliable approach. The researchers developed a technique to look for pairs of short DNA sequences from beef, buffalo and pork in hot dogs. They used their approach on 20 beef franks that they bought in markets in Malaysia, where the researchers are based. Testing showed their target sequences were stable under food processing conditions. The researchers also found that all of the hot dogs labeled as  beef  also contained buffalo meat.

The ability to image the epigenetic machinery in the human brain can provide a way to begin understanding interactions between genes and the environment,  says Jacob Hooker, PhD, of the Martinos Center, senior author of the report.  This could allow us to investigate questions such as why some people genetically predisposed to a disease are protected from it? Why events during early life and adolescence have such a lasting impact on brain health? Is it possible to  reset  gene expression in the human brain?  A key epigenetic mechanism is the packaging of DNA into chromosomes, in which it wraps around proteins called histones forming a structure called chromatin. Modification of histones by the addition or removal of molecules called epigenetic factors can regulate whether or not an adjacent gene is expressed. One of the most important of these factors is the acetyl molecule, addition of which allows a gene to be transcribed and removal of which   called deacetylation   prevents transcription.  Enzymes called histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important regulators of gene transcription, and one group of HDACs has been linked to important brain disorders. Several established neuropsychiatric drugs are HDAC inhibitors, and others are currently being studied as potential treatment for Alzheimer s disease and Huntington s disease. Martinostat was developed in Hooker s laboratory and is patterned after known HDAC inhibitors in order to tightly bind to HDAC molecules in the brain. PET scans with Martinostat of the brains of eight healthy human volunteers revealed characteristic patterns of uptake   reflecting HDAC expression levels   that were consistent among all participants. HDAC expression was almost twice as high in gray matter as in white matter; and within gray matter structures, uptake was highest in the hippocampus and amygdala and lowest in the putamen and cerebellum. Experiments with brain tissues from humans and baboons confirmed Martinostat s binding to HDAC, and studies with neural progenitor stem cells revealed specific genes regulated by this group of HDACs, many of which are known to be important in brain health and disease.   HDAC dysregulation has been implicated in a growing number of brain diseases, so being able to study HDAC regulation both in the normal brain and through the progression of disease should help us better understand disease processes,  says Hooker, who is an associate professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School.  We ve now started studies of patients with several neurologic or psychiatric disorders, and I believe Martinostat will help us understand the different ways these conditions are manifested and provide new insights into potential therapies.

But the procedure is so toxic that it is currently used to treat only the most critical cases. Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have come up with a way of conducting the therapy that, in mice, dramatically lowers its toxicity. If the method eventually proves safe and effective for humans, it potentially could be used to cure autoimmune diseases like lupus, juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis; fix congenital metabolic disorders like  bubble boy  disease; and treat many more kinds of cancer, as well as make organ transplants safer and more successful.  There is almost no category of disease or organ transplant that is not impacted by this research,  said Irving Weissman, MD, a co-author of the research and professor of pathology and of developmental biology at Stanford. A paper describing the technique was published Aug. 10 in Science Translational Medicine. The paper s senior author is Judith Shizuru, MD, PhD, professor of medicine. The lead authors are research associate Akanksha Chhabra, PhD; former graduate student Aaron Ring, MD, PhD, who is now on the faculty at Yale; and Kipp Weiskopf, MD, PhD, a former graduate student who is now a resident at Brigham and Women s Hospital. Noxious treatment To successfully transplant blood stem cells, a patient s own population of blood stem cells must be killed. Currently, this is done using chemotherapy or radiotherapy, treatments that are toxic enough to damage a variety of organs and even result in death.  The chemotherapy and radiation used for transplant damage DNA and can cause both immediate problems and long-term damage to many tissues in the body,  Shizuru said.  Among the many known toxic side effects, these treatments can cause damage to the liver, reproductive organs and brain, potentially causing seizures and impairing neurological development and growth in children.  For these reasons, blood stem cell transplantation is used only when the risks of serious disease outweigh the complications from the transplant. To avoid these terrible side effects, the Stanford researchers composed a symphony of biological instruments that clear the way for blood stem cell transplantation without the use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Using antibodies The scientists started with an antibody against a cell surface protein called c-kit, which is a primary marker of blood stem cells. Attaching the antibody to c-kit resulted in depletion of blood stem cells in immune-deficient mice.  However, this antibody alone would not be effective in immune-competent recipients, who represent a majority of potential bone marrow transplant recipients,  Chhabra said. The researchers sought to enhance the effectiveness by combining it with antibodies or with biologic agents that block another cell surface protein called CD47. Blocking CD47 liberated macrophages to  eat  target cells covered with c-kit antibody, Chhabra said. With the CD47 marker blocked and the antibody attached to c-kit proteins, the immune system effectively depleted the animals  blood-forming stem cells, clearing the way for transplanted blood stem cells from a donor to take up residence in the bone marrow and generate a whole new blood and immune system. Comparing blood stem cell transplants to planting a new field of crops, Shizuru noted that the researchers not only found a safer way to clear the field for planting, but  we also used safer techniques to seed the new blood-generating cells.  Currently, bone marrow transplants involve a mix of cells that includes blood stem cells as well as various immune cells from the donor, which can attack the tissue of the transplant recipient. This immune attack results in what is called graft-versus-host disease, which can damage tissues and even kill patients. Building on knowledge gained from previous research, the team purified the donor tissue so that it contained only blood stem cells and not the other immune cells that cause graft-versus-host disease. The success of these techniques in mice raises hopes that similar techniques will succeed in human patients.  If it works in humans like it did in mice, we would expect that the risk of death from blood stem cell transplant would drop from 20 percent to effectively zero,  Shizuru said.  New era in disease treatment   If and when this is accomplished, it will be a whole new era in disease treatment and regenerative medicine,  said Weissman, who is director of the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, as well as the director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research and Medicine. Once a patient s blood and immune system can safely be replaced, any disease caused by the patient s own blood and immune cells could potentially be cured by a one-time application of blood stem cell transplantation, they said. Safely replacing a patient s blood and immune cells will get rid of the cells that attack their own tissues and produce disease like rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes. A method of safely doing blood stem cell transplants would also potentially make organ transplantation safer and easier, the researchers said. Currently, people who get an organ transplant must for the rest of their lives stay on drugs that keep their immune systems from attacking the transplanted organ.  Even if you are on immunosuppressants, most organ transplants diminish in function or fail over time, and the immunosuppressive drugs themselves make the patient more susceptible to life-threatening infections or newly forming cancers,  Weissman said. But if blood and immune stem cells from the organ donor can be transplanted at the same time as the organ, the new immune system will recognize the donated organ and not attack it, the researchers said.  The transplanted cells, the donated organ and the patient s own tissues all learn to coexist,  Shizuru said.  The donor blood stem cells re-educate the immune system of the patient, and the transplanted organ doesn t get kicked out.  Blood and immune stem cell transplants may also be critical to making the new era of regenerative medicine a success. If stem cells for organs or tissues like heart or liver are grown for general transplantation   that is, not designed specifically for one patient   the patient will require immune conditioning through blood stem cell transplantation so that the stem cells are not rejected as foreign bodies, the researchers said.","Published: August 12, 2016"

Drugs that reduce estrogen levels in the body often are effective in reducing tumor size and preventing recurrence of the cancer. But some tumors become resistant to these therapies and continue to grow and spread. A new analysis of breast tumors, before and after hormone-reduction therapy, reveals the extreme genetic complexity of these tumors and the variety of responses that are possible to estrogen-deprivation treatments. The findings also suggest that analyzing a single sample of the breast tumor is insufficient for understanding how a patient should best be treated. The study, led by researchers at The McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Baylor College of Medicine, appears in the journal Nature Communications.  Estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers are not created equal,  said co-senior author Elaine R. Mardis, PhD, the Robert E. and Louise F. Dunn Distinguished Professor of Medicine and co-director of the McDonnell Genome Institute.  Each woman s disease can have a range of responses to estrogen-lowering drugs. This study demonstrates that reducing estrogen levels in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer changes the genetics of the tumor, and these changes may be important for deciding how best to treat a patient after the surgical removal of the tumor.  The researchers analyzed 22 breast tumors before and after four months of treatment with aromatase inhibitors, drugs commonly given to post-menopausal women with breast cancer. After menopause, the ovaries no longer produce estrogen, and aromatase inhibitors block the body s remaining production of the hormone. Successful treatment reduces the size of a tumor before it is surgically removed, and the therapy has been shown to improve long-term outcomes for patients.  In the post-treatment tumor samples, we found many new mutations or enrichment of mutations already seen in the pre-treatment samples,  said co-senior author Matthew J. Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor.  This means that under the environmental stress of the treatment, the tumors are spawning new sub-clones that subsequently can survive and grow despite therapy, and that is why we are having difficulty in the end treating estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. We found this result in the majority of tumors we studied.  The majority of the tumors analyzed   18 of 22   had complex genetic landscapes and dynamic responses to hormone deprivation therapy, meaning that many of the gene mutations present in the tumors before and after treatment were different. For example, in one patient, certain mutations present in 92 percent of the initial tumor were totally absent in samples taken after four months of aromatase inhibitor therapy.  The broad implication is that patients who undergo aromatase inhibitor therapy for several months prior to surgery should be re-evaluated immediately before their operation to determine how the tumor may have changed in response to the therapy,  Mardis said.  Such information can help indicate whether further estrogen suppression treatment is likely to contribute to a lower risk of relapse.  The researchers analyzed only one tumor that had a complex but stable genetic landscape, meaning it was largely unchanged by aromatase inhibitor treatment. Another tumor had very simple and stable genetics before and after treatment. And two patient samples indicated evidence of two independent but intertwining tumors with separate genetic origins.  It was surprising to find two  collision  tumors in a group of only 22 patients,  said first author Christopher A. Miller, PhD, an instructor in medicine at Washington University.  This hints that collision tumors may be more common than we have previously realized. In these cases, estrogen suppression was the right approach for one of the tumors, but not the other, which limited the effectiveness of the treatment.   Our study also demonstrated that even single tumors can evolve in response to therapy very quickly,  Miller added.  This suggests that sequencing a tumor at diagnosis is not enough. Periodically scanning a tumor s genome to understand how it is changing may ultimately help us evolve our treatment strategies to match.  The study also reinforced past research suggesting that mutations in a gene called ESR1 are associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitor therapy, but the analysis did not identify any new genes that may also be responsible for conferring resistance to these drugs.","Published: August 12, 2016"

Norah Spears, the corresponding author at the University of Edinburgh, said:  In a study involving mouse tissue, we have shown that etoposide can damage the development of the ovaries while a fetus is in the womb. The drug affects the germ cells in the ovaries, which are the cells that give rise to eggs. This is important because it could mean that the fertility of the offspring could be affected in later life.  Etoposide is considered safe for women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. However, information on the long-term effects of chemotherapy treatment on the future fertility of female fetuses exposed to chemotherapy is limited. Norah Spears said:  This study suggests that chemotherapy treatment may have important longer term effects on the babies of women who undergo chemotherapy while pregnant which would only become apparent in adulthood. This is an issue that has not been explored until now. Studies looking at the effects of taking chemotherapy drugs during pregnancy have focused on the immediate effects, such as increased miscarriage rates or severe fetal abnormalities.  Ovarian follicles are the basic units of the female reproductive system, each containing an immature egg cell, called an oocyte. The process by which oocytes become enclosed in follicles starts about 17 weeks into fetal development and is only completed in late pregnancy. The researchers found that exposure of mouse ovaries to etoposide before follicles had formed caused the death of most germ cells. The few remaining germ cells went on to form unhealthy follicles. Once oocytes were enclosed in follicles, etoposide had no significant adverse effects. The researchers collected fetal and neonatal ovaries from mice and cultured them in the laboratory (in vitro). They then exposed groups of six ovaries each to different doses of etoposide. The doses were considered low relative to those normally administered to patients undergoing chemotherapy. When fetal ovaries were treated with etoposide prior to follicle formation, this resulted in dose-dependent damage. Total follicle numbers declined by 72% to 90% in response to medium and high doses of etoposide respectively. In neonatal ovaries after follicle formation, etoposide only had minor effects, even at doses higher than those used to treat fetal ovaries. Norah Spears added:  Our work indicates that female mouse germ cells are particularly susceptible to damage by etoposide at a specific early developmental stage, immediately prior to follicle formation, and that there could be possible consequences to the fertility of females born to women who were treated with etoposide during the second trimester of their pregnancy.  The researchers caution that despite of the value of in vitro methods like the one used in this study for preliminary screening, effects observed in vitro may not necessarily be observable in living organisms (in vivo). Further research is needed to determine whether the adverse effects of etoposide in germ cells are caused by damages to the DNA or because etoposide affects other processes such as transcription, and to see whether the adverse effects of etoposide in germ cells are also found in human cases. Norah Spears said:  A woman s reproductive lifespan is determined before birth, while the ovaries are developing in the womb. The second trimester of pregnancy is particularly important as this is when female germ cells form follicles which will determine how many eggs a woman will be able to release in her lifetime. If the results we have seen in these mouse studies are found to be replicated in humans, some of that germ cell supply would be lost, which could later result in early menopause, thus reducing the woman s fertility window.

Wearable displays also have the potential to enhance cognitive ergonomics, or more simply, make it less mentally taxing to complete certain tasks. But before technologies like Google Glass become a part of daily life, engineers need a way to monitor exactly how they affect the brain in everyday situations. See Also: Concern over claims about how technology affects young brainsAt Drexel University, researchers have developed a portable system that can do just that. The system uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS, to measure a person s brain activity. The applications for fNIRS are seemingly endless from training air traffic controllers and drone operators, to studying how students with disabilities learn best, or why different people are more receptive to certain Super Bowl commercials.  This is a new trend called neuroergonomics. It s the study of the brain at work cognitive neuroscience plus human factors,  said Hasan Ayaz, PhD, associate research professor in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems and a member of Drexel s CONQUER CollabOrative. The phrase was coined by the late Raja Parasuraman, a former professor at George Mason University and study co-author. Until now, most studies involving fNIRS took place indoors. Though participants wearing the system could move around freely while being monitored, they were still observed within laboratory confines. A group of Drexel biomedical engineers, in collaboration with researchers at George Mason University, have now brought their portable fNIRS system  into the wild.  In their study, published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, the researchers successfully measured the brain activity of participants navigating a college campus outdoors. Read Next: Blind lead the way in brave new world of tactile technology The researchers wanted to compare one group of participants navigating campus with Google Glass to another group using Google Maps on an iPhone. Their goal was to measure mental workload (how hard the brain is working) and situation awareness (the perception of environmental elements), in order to see which device was less mentally taxing. They found that overall, users using Google Glass had a higher situation awareness and lower mental workload than their peers navigating with an iPhone. However, the researchers also found that users wearing Google Glass fell victim to  cognitive tunneling,  meaning they focused so much more of their attention to the display itself, that they easily ignored other aspects of their surroundings.  What we were able to see were the strengths and weaknesses of both. Now that we know we are able to capture that, we can now improve their design,  said Ayaz, the study s principal investigator.  This opens up all new areas of applications. We will be able to analyze how the brain is functioning during all of these natural activities that you cannot replicate in artificial lab settings.  fNIRS is a way to measure oxygenation levels in the prefrontal cortex the part of the brain responsible for complex behaviors like decision making, cognitive expression and personality development. Greater activity in this area of the brain signals that a person is a novice, and therefore must work harder, at an activity. When someone masters a skill, the processing of information moves toward the back regions of the brain. In the past, researchers had to use secondary tasks to measure the  user-friendliness  of an augmented reality product, like Google Glass. For instance, while a person was navigating with a maps application, they would be asked to recall a series of sounds played to them through headphones. If their responses were inaccurate, this implied that their brain had to work harder to pay attention to the primary task at hand. For comparison, the Drexel researchers also used secondary tasks to measure mental workload and situation awareness. However, they found that these tasks were intrusive and ultimately unnecessary. The fNIRS system was able to accurately assess brain activity during the task and examine differences between a hand-held display and wearable display.

However, we also observed evidence that some of the advantages of head-mounted displays are overshadowed by their suboptimal display symbology, which can be overly attention grabbing,  said Ryan McKendrick, PhD, the study s lead author and now a cognitive scientist at Northrop Grumman Corporation. Since the research team found that Google Glass users experienced some cognitive tunneling while navigating, they suggest that future studies identify other brain biomarkers induced by this  blindness  to the outside world. By identifying cognitive tunneling biomarkers, engineers could  greatly advance display design for navigation, training and other tasks  that wearable displays are expected to enhance.

A team led by Dr. David Brough from The University of Manchester found that the anti-inflammatory drug completely reversed memory loss and brain inflammation in mice. See Also: Research discovers neuroprotective protein in blood is biomarker of Alzheimer's disease Nearly everybody will at some point in their lives take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; mefenamic acid, a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), is routinely used for period pain. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr. Brough and Dr. Catherine Lawrence supervised PhD student Mike Daniels, and postdoc Dr. Jack Rivers-Auty who conducted most of the experiments. Though this is the first time a drug has been shown to target this inflammatory pathway, highlighting its importance in the disease model, Dr. Brough cautions that more research is needed to identify its impact on humans, and the long-term implications of its use. The research, funded by the Medical Research Council and the Alzheimer's Society, paves the way for human trials which the team hope to conduct in the future. Around 500,000 people in the UK have Alzheimer's disease which gets worse over time, affecting many aspects of their lives, including the ability to remember, think and make decisions.

One group of 10 mice was treated with mefenamic acid, and 10 mice were treated in the same way with a placebo. The mice were treated at a time when they had developed memory problems and the drug was given to them by a mini-pump implanted under the skin for one month. Memory loss was completely reversed back to the levels seen in mice without the disease. Dr. Brough said: ""There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer's disease worse. ""Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome, which damages brain cells."" He added: ""Until now, no drug has been available to target this pathway, so we are very excited by this result. ""However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. ""Because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known, the time for it to reach patients should, in theory, be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs.

The brain and the gut are connected by intricate neural networks that signal hunger and satiety, love and fear, even safety and danger. These networks employ myriad chemical signals that include dopamine, the powerful neurotransmitter most famous for its role in reward and addiction. See Also: The immune system, microglia, and the brain Duke University researchers have shown that manipulating dopamine signaling in the nervous system of the nematode worm C. elegans can control inflammation in the gut. The study, which appears in Current Biology, provides a proof of principle that the immune system can be controlled using drugs originally designed to target the nervous system, such as antipsychotics. ""We are talking about an existing set of drugs and drug targets that could open up the spectrum of potential therapeutic applications by targeting pathways that fine-tune the inflammatory response,"" said Alejandro Aballay, PhD, a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke School of Medicine. ""It is a big leap from worms to humans, but the idea of targeting the nervous system to control the immune system could potentially be used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn's disease,"" Aballay said. Recent research suggests that the wiring between the gut and the brain is involved in many other maladies, including autism, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Read Next: Missing link found between brain, immune system -- with major disease implicationsAballay believes that C. elegans provides an excellent model for dissecting this complex cross-talk between the nervous system and the immune system. This tiny, transparent worm has a simple nervous system, consisting of only 302 neurons compared to the roughly 100 billion neurons in the human brain. Yet the worm also has a very basic, rudimentary immune system. Aballay and his team first stumbled upon the gut-brain connection a few years ago when they were studying the immune system of C. elegans. The worms were subjected to a barrage of chemicals in search of immune activators that could protect against bacterial infections. Out of more than a thousand different chemical compounds, they identified 45 that turned on an immune pathway. Curiously, half of those were involved in the nervous system, and a handful blocked the activity of dopamine. In this study, Aballay decided to examine the effects of dopamine and dopamine signaling pathways on immunity. Graduate student Xiou Cao blocked dopamine by treating animals with chlorpromazine, a dopamine antagonist drug used to treat schizophrenia and manic depression in humans. He found that these worms were more resistant to infection by the common pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa than counterparts that hadn't received the drug. When Cao then treated the animals with dopamine, it generated the opposite effect, rendering them more susceptible to infection. The researchers believe their findings indicate that dopamine signaling acts by putting the brakes on the body's inflammatory response so it doesn't go too far. Don't Miss: Shocking new role found for the immune system: Controlling social interaction""Worms have evolved mechanisms to deal with colonizing bacteria,"" Aballay said. ""That is true for us as well. Humans have trillions of microorganisms in our guts, and we have to be careful when activating antimicrobial defenses so that we mainly target potentially harmful microbes, without damaging our good bacteria or even our own cells in the process."" ""The nervous system appears to be the perfect system for integrating all these different physiological cues to keep the amount of damage in check,"" Aballay said. Aballay plans continue his studies in C. elegans to identify the different cues involved in fine-tuning the immune response. He also thinks it is worth looking at different analogues or different doses of dopamine antagonists to see if their effects on psychosis can be separated from their effects on immunity.

He used a brain-machine interface, allowing him to control the movements of a lower-limb robotic exoskeleton. This unprecedented scientific demonstration was the work of the Walk Again Project (WAP), a nonprofit, international research consortium that includes Alan Rudolph, vice president for research at Colorado State University (CSU), who is also an adjunct faculty member at Duke University's Center for Neuroengineering. See Also: Spinal stimulation helps four patients with paraplegia regain voluntary movement Barely two years after the demonstration, the WAP has released its first clinical report, published in Scientific Reports. They report that a group of patients who trained throughout 2014 with the WAP's brain-controlled system, including a motorized exoskeleton, have regained the ability to voluntarily move their leg muscles and to feel touch and pain in their paralyzed limbs. This, despite being originally diagnosed as having a clinically complete spinal cord injury in some cases more than a decade earlier. The patients also regained degrees of bladder and bowel control, and improved cardiovascular function, which in one case resulted in a reduction in hypertension. This is the first study to report that long-term brain-machine interface use could lead to significant recovery of neurological function in patients suffering from severe spinal cord injuries. The WAP researchers theorize that the long-term training regimen likely promoted brain reorganization and activated dormant nerves that may have survived the original spinal injury from 3 to 14 years earlier. The Walk Again Project rehab protocol includes a virtual reality component. Credit: AASDAP  The researchers are led by neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis, director of the Duke University Center for Neuroengineering and president of the Alberto Santos Dumont Association for Research Support. They say they do not yet know the limits of this clinical recovery, since patients have continued to improve since the World Cup demo. However, they believe their initial findings could influence future clinical practices for paraplegic patients by upgrading brain-machine interfaces from a simple assistive technology to a potential new therapy for spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Paper co-author Rudolph joined the WAP team prior to coming to CSU in 2013. A former program manager at DARPA, Rudolph led a brain-machine interface research effort starting in 1998 that helped the Duke neuroengineers develop pre-clinical demonstrations. These efforts led to the human clinical trials in the Walk Again Project. Rudolph also started a nonprofit foundation, the International Neuroscience Network Foundation, that works closely with AASDAP, which supports the WAP. Rudolph was recruited by Nicolelis in 2011 to manage the WAP, leading the transdisciplinary, international group of 100 scientists in communication and meeting deadlines. Rudolph also connected the project with CSU's Idea-2-Product 3-D printing lab, which custom-printed the liner of a helmet worn by the paraplegic patients.

Credit: Colorado State University  Until now, no clinical study employing brain-machine interfaces in patients suffering severe spinal cord injuries reported any neurological improvements. Nicolelis believes this was due to the short-term nature of those studies, which usually involved only one human subject. In addition, none of these studies included detailed neurological evaluations to search for clinical improvement. For the Scientific Reports study, the researchers trained eight paraplegic patients for a year on what they call the Walk Again Neurorehabilitation protocol. Seven patients had been classified as having a complete injury, according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, and one was classified with an incomplete injury. See Also: Neuroprosthetics for paralysis: an new implant on the spinal cord The brain-machine interface consisted of multiple EEG recording electrodes embedded in a cap on the patient's scalp, fitted over the brain areas controlling movement in the frontal lobe. In a virtual reality component of the rehab protocol, the patients wearing an Oculus Rift head-mounted display were shown a three-dimensional avatar of a person, and were asked to imagine movements of their own bodies so they could make the avatar walk. All patients learned to use only their brain activity to move the avatar. They received a continuous stream of tactile feedback, every time the avatar's feet touched the ground. This feedback was delivered through mechano-vibrating elements in a long-sleeved ""tactile shirt."" The WAP research was, in part, the inspiration for Rudolph to launch a virtual reality research initiative at CSU. Plans are in place for launching a virtual reality lab, and for a hack-a-thon in October. For component No. 2 of the WAP protocol, the patients also used a Lokomat, a robotic gait orthosis placed on a treadmill, which enabled them to perform walking motions while suspended by a harness. In this component, the patients used the same EEG cap to trigger the Lokomat movements while receiving tactile feedback. In a third component, the patients operated a brain-controlled motorized exoskeleton custom designed for the project. The exoskeleton is the same one demonstrated at the 2014 World Cup. The combination of visual and haptic feedback was critical to the training paradigm, Nicolelis said. ""The addition of tactile feedback that was coherent with the visual feedback created a very realistic walking illusion for the patients when they controlled a virtual avatar or the robotic exoskeleton."" Importantly, Nicolelis said, the researchers saw significant changes in the EEG patterns in the patients' brains. In the spinal cord, the combination of brain reorganization and muscle exercise may have also induced sprouting of new connections, the researchers theorized.

Analysis of biopsies before treatment did not indicate who would respond in this unique longitudinal study of 53 melanoma patients treated with two immune checkpoint inhibitors between October 2011 and March 2015.  Before treatment, analyzing samples with a 12-marker immune panel or a 795-gene expression panel, you can t tell who will respond with any degree of certainty. On treatment, there were night-and-day differences between responders and non-responders,  said Jennifer Wargo, M.D., associate professor of Genomic Medicine and Surgical Oncology. Their findings, if confirmed in larger studies, could help guide treatment with drugs that block PD-1, a protein on T cells that shuts down those specialized immune system attack cells. PD-1 inhibitors, and another drug that blocks a protein called CTLA-4, remove separate brakes on T cells, unleashing the immune system to attack cancer. Response rates range from 8 to 44 percent of patients given the drugs separately, with many having complete responses that last for years.  Identifying biomarkers to help determine who should receive these drugs has been the subject of much research, but the team noted that biomarkers have not strongly or exclusively predicted response. Their research suggests that assessment of adaptive immune responses should be considered in early on-treatment biopsies after initiation of therapy, Wargo said, and may provide far more value than analysis of pretreatment samples, at least until better pre-treatment biomarkers are identified. The study is part of MD Anderson s Cancer Moon Shots Program, designed to reduce cancer deaths by accelerating the development of new approaches based on scientific discoveries.  This project of the Melanoma Moon Shot demonstrates the approach of the Adaptive Patient-Oriented Longitudinal Learning and Optimization (APOLLO) platform, which uses serial biopsies and deep molecular analyses to understand tumor response to treatment. The researchers assembled a cohort of longitudinal tumor samples from patients and analyzed each biopsy for gene expression and the presence of certain types of T cell and protein markers such as expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, the ligand found on tumor and other cells that activates PD-1. Patients were treated with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab (Yervoy). Biopsies followed, when feasible, after the second or third treatment and at progression. 13% patients had a clinical benefit, defined as either absence of disease, tumor shrinkage or stable disease for at least six months.  There were no immune biomarker differences between responders and non-responders before treatment.  After treatment began, the presence of killer T cells was significantly higher in the tumors of responders. The remaining patients proceeded to treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor pembroluzimab (Keytruda). 28% of the 46 responded. Before treatment, three immune markers were slightly elevated in responders compared to non-responders, but values overlapped the two groups.  Profound and highly statistically significant  differences between responders and non-responders were found in nearly all of the 12 immune markers in the early anti-PD1 on-treatment biopsies.   These included the density in the tumor of killer CD8 T cells, CD4 helper T cells, and CD3 T cells that also assist killer cells, as well as the presence of PD-1, PD-L1 and the immune checkpoint molecule LAG-3. In this study, tumor samples were collected when technically feasible and safe to perform at multiple time points after written informed consent was obtained under IRB-approved protocols. For example, for those undergoing anti-PD1 treatment, 24 patients had pretreatment biopsies (seven responders, 17 non-responders), 11 had on-treatment biopsies (five responders, six non-responders) and 12 provided tumor samples at progression. The team s findings have implications for treatment and further research to understand how melanoma responds to or resists treatment.  We could start by treating with anti-PD1, do an early on-treatment biopsy and, based on that, either continue or add ipilimumab or another agent,  Wargo said. Such a strategy has the potential to more accurately apply these drugs to patients who will benefit and avoid the cost and potential side effects for patients who won t benefit and need alternative therapies. Immune response analysis was conducted by the moon shots Immunotherapy Platform, led by Jim Allison and Padmanee Sharma. Allison invented immune checkpoint blockade as a potential cancer treatment and was honored with the 2015 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for his pioneering work. As with the immune profiling, the gene expression panel turned up significant differences between responders and non-responders only at the on-treatment biopsy for anti-PD1. Significant differences were found in 411 differentially expressed genes in responders. Most differences involved increased expression in the responding patients of genes involved in immune response.  Only six genes were lower in responders, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), which is involved in the generation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis. This suggests a targetable mechanism for resistance to treatment, Wargo said, which is consistent with findings by others.  Anti-PD1 therapy is being tested with VEGF inhibitors in clinical trials now. Potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to PD-1 based therapy were also identified through defects in interferon signaling and altered antigen processing and presentation   essentially allowing tumors to  hide  from killer T cells.  Another paper will more fully report genomic results.","Published: August 11, 2016"

Previously, it wasn t known how the virus acquires the building blocks of genetic material it needs, called nucleotides. Importantly, it also wasn t known how HIV does this without setting off the cells alarm systems that are poised to detect foreign DNA. HIV is surrounded by a protein shell called the capsid. It has now been found that HIV hides within the capsid while it builds DNA. The interdisciplinary team used a hybrid approach that involved discerning the atomic structure of the capsid in different states and creating mutant versions of HIV viruses to see how this altered infection. This allowed the researchers to discover iris-like pores in the capsid that open and close like those in the eye. These pores suck in nucleotides needed for replication at great speed while keeping out any unwanted molecules. This helps to explain why HIV is so successful at evading the immune system.   After they identified these capsid pores the team then went on to design an inhibitor molecule that could block them   hexacarboxybenzene. Once the pores were blocked by the molecule, the HIV virus was unable to copy itself and became non-infectious. Hexacarboxybenzene cannot cross the cell membrane of human cells to gain access to the virus, but the researchers suggest that drugs could be designed in the future with similar properties but able to enter the cell. Another option is to look at drugs currently used in treating HIV, called reverse transcriptase inhibitors, to see if there are ways of improving their transit through these pores thereby enhancing their activity. Dr Leo James at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology said:  We used to think that the capsid came apart as soon as the virus entered a cell but now realise that the capsid protects the virus from our innate immune system. The channels we ve discovered explain how the fuel for replication gets into the capsid to allow the viral genome to be made.  Dr David Jacques at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said:  We have already designed a prototype inhibitor that directly targets the channel. We predict that this feature may be common to other viruses and will be an attractive target for new antiviral drugs, including new treatments for HIV and related viruses.  Dr Tim Cullingford, Programme Manager for Chemical Biology at the MRC, said:  This collaborative work between Leo James s laboratory at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge and Greg Towers at UCL really illustrates the value of taking an interdisciplinary approach to discovery research. The combination of atomic-level structural work with virology has enabled them to make a finding that will shape the direction of future work in this area. ","Published: August 11, 2016"

Such secondary tumours are formed when individual cells break away from the main tumour and travel through the bloodstream to distant areas of the body. To do so, they have to pass through the walls of small blood vessels. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim and Goethe University Frankfurt have now shown that tumour cells kill specific cells in the vascular wall. This enables them to leave the vessels and establish metastases, a process facilitated by a molecule called DR6. The most common cause of cancer deaths is not the primary tumour itself but metastases that subsequently form. Most tumour cells spread via the bloodstream. To do so, individual tumour cells have to enter blood vessels and leave the bloodstream again at remote locations. Together with scientists at the universities of Cologne and Heidelberg, the Research Group led by Stefan Offermanns, Director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research and professor at Goethe University Frankfurt, has now succeeded in clarifying the underlying mechanism. The researchers, working with cell cultures, first observed how individual tumour cells kill specific cells in the vascular wall, called endothelial cells. This process, known as necroptosis, enabled cancer cells to overcome an endothelial cell layer in the laboratory.  We were then able to show in studies on mice that the same process occurs in living organisms,  says Boris Strilic, first author of the study. The scientists also found that endothelial cells themselves give the signal for their own death: To do this, the vascular wall cells have a receptor molecule called Death Receptor 6 (DR6) on their surface.  When a cancer cell comes into contact with it, a protein on the cell s surface, known as APP, activates DR6. This marks the start of the cancer cells  attack on the vascular wall, which culminates in the necroptosis of wall cells,  Strilic explains. The Max Planck researchers then showed that less necroptosis of endothelial cells and less metastasis occur in genetically modified animals in which Death Receptor 6 is disabled.  This effect was also found after a blockade of DR6 or the cancer-cell protein APP, thus confirming our previous observations,  Strilic says. It is still not entirely clear whether the cancer cells migrate directly through the resulting gap in the vascular wall or whether there is an indirect effect:  We have evidence that many more molecules are released when the vascular wall cell dies and that they render the surrounding area more permeable to cancer cells,  says Offermanns.  This mechanism could be a promising starting point for treatments to prevent the formation of metastases,  says Offermanns. First, however, it must be determined whether a blockade of DR6 triggers unwanted side effects. It must also be determined to what extent the observations can be transferred to humans.","Published: August 11, 2016"

This programme will develop next generation biosensors to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections and also to determine which bacterial strain has caused the infection so that the correct antibiotic can be quickly administered. This will allow for more targeted use of antibiotics, reducing the number of wrongly prescribed treatments and increasing efficacy for patients, which will contribute to a reduction in anti-microbial resistance (AMR). AMR is a major challenge for global healthcare. There is a growing global increase in the number and type of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and stagnation in the development of new antibiotics and viable alternatives. The current lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools for infectious diseases often leads to inappropriate antibiotic prescription, which has had a direct and significant impact on the increase of AMR, including the methicillin resistance of staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This also leads to poor control of potentially life-threatening infections such as clostridium difficile, and the continued increase in hospital caught infections.  Affimer technology is an engineered alternative to antibodies that can capture a target, such as a bacterial or viral protein, with a high degree of specificity. Affimer reagents can be used to create accurate diagnostic tests and laboratory assays, and can also be developed as new therapeutic candidates. The development of the biosensors will take place at Leeds University in the Groups of Professors Christoph Walti (Electronic Engineering) and Mike McPherson (Biochemistry). Avacta will provide support for the development of Affimer reagents that will be incorporated into the biosensors to facilitate the specific capture of bacterial biomarkers.  As part of the collaborative agreement between Avacta and the University of Leeds, Avacta will have the first rights to commercialise the new Affimer reagents and new diagnostic tests developed under the programme. Alastair Smith, Avacta Group Chief Executive commented,  I am delighted that the potential of Affimer reagents to improve rapid diagnostics has been recognised by the Medical Research Council through this substantial funding. The combination with the innovative microfluidic devices developed at Leeds University is very promising and could lead to a new class of rapid test device.  ""There is a growing, global need for diagnostic tests that differentiate bacterial strains. Anti-microbial resistance is a huge issue for healthcare providers and one that is only going to get worse if the prescription of antibiotics is not targeted by accurate and rapid diagnostics. This programme fits perfectly with our near term commercial strategy to focus on developing Affimer reagents for rapid diagnostics. It will deliver valuable Affimer reagents that are specific to key bacterial strains, which can be developed into a range of third party diagnostic platforms. In the longer term the programme will also deliver novel, microfluidic, rapid test devices, which may surpass existing technologies. ""This is another example of the continued strong momentum behind the Affimer technology and I look forward to reporting on progress on this and other applications. ","Published: August 11, 2016"

Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).  For many years, chemicals with unknown toxicities, such as PFASs, were allowed to be used and released to the environment, and we now have to face the severe consequences,  said lead author Xindi Hu, a doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard Chan School, Environmental Science and Engineering at SEAS, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.  In addition, the actual number of people exposed may be even higher than our study found, because government data for levels of these compounds in drinking water is lacking for almost a third of the U.S. population   about 100 million people.  PFASs have been used over the past 60 years in industrial and commercial products ranging from food wrappers to clothing to pots and pans. They have been linked with cancer, hormone disruption, high cholesterol, and obesity. Although several major manufacturers have discontinued the use of some PFASs, the chemicals continue to persist in people and wildlife. Drinking water is one of the main routes through which people can be exposed. The researchers looked at concentrations of six types of PFASs in drinking-water supplies, using data from more than 36,000 water samples collected nationwide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 2013 to 2015. They also looked at industrial sites that manufacture or use PFASs; at military fire-training sites and civilian airports where firefighting foam containing PFASs is used; and at wastewater-treatment plants. Discharges from these plants   which are unable to remove PFASs from wastewater by standard treatment methods   could contaminate groundwater. So could the sludge the plants generate, which is frequently used as fertilizer. The study found that PFASs were detectable at the minimum reporting levels required by the EPA in 194 out of 4,864 water supplies in 33 states across the United States. Drinking water from 13 states accounted for 75 percent of the detections: California, New Jersey, North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Georgia, Minnesota, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Illinois, in order of frequency of detection. Sixty-six of the public water supplies examined, serving six million people, had at least one water sample that measured at or above the EPA safety limit of 70 parts per trillion (ng/L) for two types of PFASs, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Concentrations in some locations ranged as high as 349 ng/L for PFOA and 1,800 ng/L for PFOS. The highest levels of PFASs were detected in watersheds near industrial sites, military bases, and wastewater treatment plants   all places where these chemicals may be used or found.  These compounds are potent immunotoxicants in children and recent work suggests drinking-water safety levels should be much lower than the provisional guidelines established by EPA,  said Elsie Sunderland, senior author of the study and associate professor at both the Harvard Chan School and SEAS.","Published: August 11, 2016"

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/pinpointing-ebolas-weak-spots-205419,Pinpointing Ebola s Weak Spots New study illuminates structure of mystery protein  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) now have a high-resolution view of exactly how the experimental therapy ZMapp targets Ebola virus. The new study is also the first to show how an antibody in the ZMapp  drug cocktail  targets a second Ebola virus protein, called sGP, whose vulnerable spots had previously been unknown.  This sGP protein is tremendously important,  said TSRI Professor Erica Ollmann Saphire, who co-led the study with TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward.  This is the roadmap we need to target the right molecules in infection.   Determining the proper balance in targeting these two Ebola proteins will be key to building improved therapeutics,  added Ward. Zooming in on ZMapp Scientists need detailed images of Ebola virus s molecular structure. Like enemy reconnaissance, structures can show where Ebola is vulnerable and how medical treatments can neutralize it. TSRI scientists are harnessing an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (in which a sample is pelted with electrons) to create high-resolution, 3-D images of Ebola virus and the antibodies that fight it.  We re at the cutting edge of our ability to resolve high-resolution protein complexes,  said TSRI Research Associate C. Daniel Murin, co-first author of the new study with TSRI Research Associate Jesper Pallesen. In the new study, the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to see exactly how Ebola virus interacts with the three antibodies in the ZMapp experimental therapy produced by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, also a study collaborator. The researchers had imaged these interactions at a low resolution in a 2014 study, but the new study revealed substantially more details, including the exact angles the antibodies use to approach the molecule on the surface of the virus, termed its surface glycoprotein (GP), and the individual amino acid contact points at which the antibodies bind GP. This information provides new clues to researchers trying to make the antibodies even more effective.  The three components of ZMapp, now resolved at high-resolution, can be further engineered in a structure-based manner for improved potency,  said Ward. Solving an Elusive Structure Next, the researchers took a closer look at one of the three antibodies that make up ZMapp, called 13C6. This antibody is unique because it can also target the soluble Ebola protein sGP. sGP s role in infection is a mystery. Ebola virus makes the protein profusely, indicating that it is important, but then sGP appears just to float in a person s blood serum. One theory is that sGP may be essential in the natural host  reservoir.   Eighty to ninety percent of what Ebola virus makes in infection is this shed molecule,  said Saphire.  It s like a smoke screen, and we need to know where it is similar to our target GP and where it is different.  To add to the mystery, Ebola makes GP and sGP using the same gene. A small difference in the way the gene is read changes how the molecules are shaped and changes their roles. One obstacle to understanding sGP is that it is too small to be seen with cryo-electron microscopes. To solve this problem, the researchers added  bulk  by pairing sGP with antibodies, including 13C6. This allowed them to kill two birds with one stone they could see sGP s structure while also studying how antibodies interact with it. The new image shows the binding sites, or  epitopes,  the antibody targets.  We can see hot spots on this virus that we can hit,  said Pallesen.","Published: August 11, 2016"

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-tech-joins-the-battle-against-hep-b-203015,New Tech Joins the Battle Against Hep B A method for  silencing  RNA that emerged from a University of Wisconsin Madison spinoff company is in clinical trials in Europe  Asia and the United States against hepatitis B  an infection that can destroy the liver  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. When RNA is silenced through RNA interference, or RNAi, the genes that cause disease are inactivated. Theoretically, the technique could cure viral or genetic disease. The silencing technique being used by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals was invented at Mirus Bio, a spinoff from the UW Madison Department of Pediatrics lab of Jon Wolff, and was shown to be effective using technology licensed from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccine. Even among those who are not vaccinated, the immune system usually clears the infection. But in 10 percent of cases,  the virus produces proteins that dampen the immune response, allowing those infections to become chronic,  says David Lewis, chief scientific officer at Arrowhead Pharmaceutical s research facility in Madison. Arrowhead is in the midst of a private stock offering aimed at raising $45 million to advance the hepatitis B drug and another aimed at treating a rare, hereditary liver and lung disease called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. About 340 million people worldwide, including 2 million in the United States, have a chronic hepatitis B infection that can result in liver cancer or a loss of the liver s essential metabolic functions. The research facility in Madison is owned by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals of Pasadena, California.  Our strategy,  Lewis says,  is to use RNAi to decrease the production of the viral proteins that weaken the immune system, allowing it to recover to the point that it will be able to clear the virus like it does in the other 90 percent of people who become infected.  DNA operates through RNA, and when RNA interference was discovered in 1998, it seemed like a magic bullet that could fight disease by specifically shutting down problematic genes. That promise was difficult to achieve, and no FDA-approved RNAi medicine has yet reached the market, although two are in the final phase of clinical trials. In general, the short strands of designer RNA used in RNAi either target the unwanted RNA for destruction, or clog it up so it can t produce a protein. The process by which RNAi splits messenger RNA, is a  natural process,  Lewis says.  Almost all cells have this capability. It s another level of control over gene expression.  In gene expression, DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein. During the early development of RNAi, the short strands of RNA that were injected into the body usually were excreted, producing no benefit. The result was  very expensive pee,  Lewis says. But when Lewis and others at Mirus invented a system to connect the strand of RNA to a molecule that could lock onto liver cells, the door seemed open to finding a strategy for RNAi, at least in liver disease. RNAi seemed so promising that pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche bought Mirus  RNAi division in 2008, although it left the lab in Madison. Within three years, Roche changed its mind and sold the business to Arrowhead, which likewise left the research and development in Madison. Arrowhead now employs 90 at University Research Park and in Middleton. About 340 million people worldwide have a chronic hepatitis B infection, which can result in liver cancer or a loss of the liver s essential metabolic functions. Lewis learned about RNAi while working in the lab of Sean Carroll, a UW Madison geneticist who studies the genetic controls that give animals their characteristic body structures.  Sean wanted to know how genes used in the butterfly wing could make different patterns, and so he wanted to manipulate where the genes are expressed,  Lewis says. For his postdoctoral project,  I expressed these genes in the wrong places, or knocked them down with RNAi to see their effects.  Lewis, who worked on the technology to target liver cells at Mirus, moved to Roche and then to Arrowhead. The company is also developing other RNAi drugs, including some for a cardiovascular condition, but most of its effort is going toward phase 2 (dosing level) trials for hepatitis B. It s a complex task, Lewis says.  Every country has its own regulatory requirements, and it s truly a massive effort to file all those applications in over a dozen countries.  The hepatitis drug is being tested at different dosing schedules, sometimes in combination with other antiviral drugs, Lewis says.  This drug will not, by itself, clear the virus,  he stresses.  That s the job of the immune system. Even if they still have viral DNA hiding somewhere, now the immune system can recognize a cell that produces viral antigens and destroy it.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gene-variant-explains-differences-in-diabetes-drug-response-195881,Gene Variant Explains Differences in Diabetes Drug Response International precision medicine study advances understanding of the biology of Metformin  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The first results from a large international study of patients taking metformin, the world s most commonly used type 2 diabetes drug, reveal genetic differences among patients that may explain why some respond much better to the drug than others. The insight could ultimately help physicians predict which patients will need higher doses than others to produce the same health effects, or need to be prescribed different drugs altogether. Moreover, the inclusion of a large, ethnically diverse research cohort subset in the study revealed a much higher prevalence of the metformin-enhancing gene variant in African Americans than in other ethnic groups, highlighting the importance of including diverse cohorts in precision medicine studies. Metformin has been around for 50 years and currently helps hundreds of millions of people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar and lower their risk of complications that lead to heart, eye and kidney disease. Recently, the drug has also shown benefits against a wide array of other diseases, including cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome, fatty liver disease, Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease, and is even in clinical trials as a potential anti-aging drug. But despite the hopes surrounding metformin, the drug is hit or miss for diabetes patients: more than one-third of people with type 2 diabetes fail to respond to normal doses of the drug. The reason for this variability has been murky; in fact, despite metformin s long history, it s still not clear precisely how the drug actually works. The new study   published Aug. 8 in the journal Nature Genetics   is the first result from the Metformin Genetics Consortium, an international collaboration led by Kathy Giacomini, PhD., a professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences in UC San Francisco s schools of Pharmacy and Medicine and Ewan Pearson, PhD, professor of diabetic medicine at the University of Dundee in Scotland.   Right now we treat most people with type 2 diabetes the same,  Giacomini said,  but we wanted to discover whether there might be a specific genetic marker that could let us take a precision medicine approach to prescribing and dosing this common diabetes medication.  Genetic Variants Associated with Metformin Response The researchers performed a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS)* of 13,123 participants to identify genetic variants associated with differences in metformin response, and found a common variant of the gene SLC2A2 that was correlated with a strong response to the drug. This finding makes sense, Giacomini said, because the gene encodes GLUT2, a glucose transporter protein responsible for regulating the movement of glucose between the liver, the blood and the kidneys. Gene expression data from 1,226 human liver samples confirmed that people with this variant had less GLUT2 in the liver and other metabolic tissues, which led to a reduced ability to manage blood glucose. Metformin, which slows the liver s production of glucose, appears to be able to reverse this deficit, which could explain its blockbuster efficacy in these patients.  Metformin is an old drug that is widely used, yet we are still discovering more about how it works,  said co-lead author Sook Wah Yee, PhD, a researcher in Giacomini s lab.  Although we ve known that GLUT2 is important for glucose transport for many years, we had not previously thought that variation in the gene encoding this transporter would alter how metformin works.  Linking Gene Variant to Body Weight The researchers also identified a compelling link between the new genetic variant and higher body weight, in line with previous clinical observations that metformin is particularly effective in overweight patients.  The normal dose of metformin used to treat patients with diabetes is between 500mg and 2000mg,  said co-lead author Kaixin Zhou, PhD, a lecturer at the University of Dundee.  We have found that overweight people who carry two copies of the genetic variant respond much better to metformin, equivalent to receiving an extra 550mg of the drug.  The new findings suggest that the biological causes of high blood sugar, the hallmark of type 2 diabetes, could be different in different people, and highlight the importance of a precision medicine approach to diabetes treatment, the researchers say.  This is an exciting discovery that demonstrates how a patient s genetics can determine how well, or poorly, a drug works,  Pearson said.  We need to undertake further clinical studies before we can change the way we use metformin, but this finding suggests that some patients should be treated with higher doses than others to achieve the same effect. This really does move us a step closer to truly targeted therapy in the treatment of diabetes.   This is the largest precision medicine study on an anti-diabetic drug performed to date, and is only made possible by the truly international collaboration of the Metformin Genetics Consortium,  Giacomini added. Benefiting from Diverse Study Population In addition, Giacomini said,  we were able to analyse data from the largest published sample of African American patients on metformin thanks to the highly diverse participants from the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health, supported by Kaiser Permanente.  These results revealed that the newly discovered metformin-enhancing gene variant is particularly prevalent in African Americans, nearly half of whom carry two copies of the variant gene, compared to only about 10 percent of Caucasians. Future studies by the Metformin Genetics Consortium, Giacomini said, will be investigating more specifically how ethnicity plays into metformin drug responses, as well as how genetics plays into side effects of the drug that make it hard for some patients to tolerate effective doses.","Published: August 11, 2016"

The study, which was published in Environmental Science & Technology, found that the thermal decomposition of propylene glycol and glycerin, two solvents found in most  e-liquids  (the substance that is vaporized by the e-cigarette), leads to emissions of toxic chemicals such as acrolein and formaldehyde.  Advocates of e-cigarettes say emissions are much lower than from conventional cigarettes, so you re better off using e-cigarettes,  said Berkeley Lab researcher and the study s corresponding author Hugo Destaillats.  I would say, that may be true for certain users for example, long time smokers that cannot quit but the problem is, it doesn t mean that they re healthy. Regular cigarettes are super unhealthy. E-cigarettes are just unhealthy.  In the paper,  Emissions from electronic cigarettes: Key parameters affecting the release of harmful chemicals,  Destaillats and a team of researchers simulated vaping using three types of e-liquids in two different vaporizers operated at various battery power settings. The two e-cigarettes were quite different, one fairly cheap with one heating coil, the other more expensive with two heating coils in parallel. The researchers used gas and liquid chromatography to determine what was in the vapor, looking at the first puffs as well as later puffs after the device heated up and reached a  steady state.  Not all puffs are equal One finding was that the first and last puffs produce widely varying emissions. Using a custom-built vaping apparatus emulating realistic vaping habits, researchers drew on the e-cigarette by taking puffs lasting 5 seconds every 30 seconds. They found that vapor temperature rose quickly in the first 5 to 10 minutes until reaching a steady state temperature at around the twentieth puff. Correspondingly, emissions levels between the first few puffs and the steady state increased by a factor of 10 or more in some cases, depending on the device, the battery voltage, and the emitted compound. For example, for acrolein, a severe eye and respiratory irritant, a single-coil e-cigarette operated at 3.8 volts emitted 0.46 micrograms per puff in the first five puffs, but at the steady state it emitted 8.7 micrograms per puff.  When you apply the same voltage to the double-coil e-cigarette you see a lot less emissions,  said co-author and Berkeley Lab researcher Lara Gundel.  We think it has to do with lower temperatures at each of the coil surfaces.  For comparison, conventional cigarettes emit 400 to 650 micrograms of acrolein per cigarette, accounting for both mainstream and sidestream emissions. Assuming 20 puffs on an e-cigarette is equivalent to smoking a conventional cigarette, Gundel said, then total emissions of acrolein for an e-cigarette are about 90 to 100 micrograms. Separately, to test effects due to device aging, researchers used a single device over nine consecutive 50-puff cycles without cleaning. Again, emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein all either carcinogens or respiratory irritants increased with usage.  In some cases we saw aldehyde levels increase 60 percent between cycles 1 and 9,  said co-author and Berkeley Lab researcher Mohamad Sleiman. The researchers note in their paper:  This effect is consistent with the buildup of polymerization byproducts on or near the coil leading to accumulation of the sort of residues that are often referred to in the blogosphere as  coil gunk  or  caramelization.  Heating these residues would provide a secondary source of volatile aldehydes.  Lastly, because many e-cigarettes allow users to control the voltage, the researchers systematically investigated the effect of voltage on emissions. They found that as the voltage increased, both the amount of e-liquid consumed per puff and the vapor temperature were higher. In the case of acrolein and formaldehyde, the amount formed at the highest voltage of 4.8V was an order of magnitude higher than the amount at the lowest voltage of 3.3V. Destaillats takes pains to note that the results do not mean that e-cigarettes are safe to use at lower temperatures.  We found there are emissions of toxic chemicals at any temperature at which you use the device,  he said.  And the higher the temperature, the more emissions.  Two new carcinogens detected Because there is an immense variety of e-cigarettes as well as e-liquids, the Berkeley Lab researchers decided to focus on an element that is common to all of them: the solvent in the e-liquid. Almost all e-liquids use a combination of propylene glycol and glycerin in varying proportions as a solvent.  Both are used for making artificial smoke on stage,  Destaillats said.  The ratio between the two determines things like the volume of vapor cloud that you produce. They are considered safe for food.  However, there have been few if any studies on the safety of heating and inhaling propylene glycol and glycerin.  People are not drinking the liquids they re vaping them,  said Sleiman.  So what counts is the vapor.  The researchers vaporized liquids consisting solely of the solvents to verify that they were the source of the emissions. In all, the researchers detected significant levels of 31 harmful chemical compounds, including two that had never been previously found in e-cigarette vapor propylene oxide and glycidol, both of which are probable carcinogens.  Understanding how these compounds are formed is very important,  Destaillats said.  One reason is for regulatory purposes, and the second is, if you want to manufacture a less harmful e-cigarette, you have to understand what the main sources of these carcinogens are.

After the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981, the discovery of fullerenes in 1985 and Drexler's dystopian presentation of nanotechnology in the book Engines of Creation (Engines of Creation) in 1986, nanomaterials made its entrance in large areas of materials development industry. An important group nanomaterials are the mesoporous material having pores or voids with diameters between 2 and 50 nm (nanometer). Such materials currently being developed for multiple applications - the supply of medicines and vaccines, regeneration of bone tissue, chromatography, catalysis and for moisture adsorption and gas separation. For such applications it is important to tailor the pore structure of the material. Until now this has been achieved by the use of organic template molecules or swelling agent that must be removed by high temperature before the material can be used. In a publication presented in the RSC Advances, researchers from the Department of nanotechnology and functional materials at Uppsala University, in collaboration with researchers from Stockholm University, for the first time shown that it is possible to tailor the pore structure of mesoporous materials, Upsalite  without using organic molecules as templates or swelling agents, but instead only control the energy input during the production process. This simplifies the synthesis of mesoporous materials and thus expected to be important for industrial scale up. Moreover, the researchers show that the amorphous structure of the poorly soluble antifungal drug itraconazole can be stabilized in Upsalites  pores, and that the release rate of the drug can be controlled by adjusting the pore size. - This discovery opens new possibilities to stabilize the large number of poorly soluble substances that are in the pipeline at the research and development departments of the big drug companies, says Maria Str mme, professor of nanotechnology at Uppsala University.","Published: August 11, 2016"

The goal of the partnership is to accelerate the development of a stable, rapid-acting, ultra-concentrated insulin of up to 1,000 U/mL, which will not only offer a vastly superior mealtime insulin product for people requiring >200 U/day, but is also a critical step towards the advancement of the miniaturization of delivery devices, including next-generation artificial pancreas systems for people with type 1 diabetes. Arecor and JDRF will work closely together on the project, and JDRF will provide Arecor with up to $900,000 in milestone funding over 12 months to complete product development to the end of pre-clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling (PK/PD). Enabling Next-Generation Technology and Improved Quality of LifeNext-generation device technology such as wearable, continuous administration patch pumps and implants are critical future developments for people living with diabetes, improving glycemic control and compliance, thus reducing adverse states such as hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as well as overall complications and mortality. Currently available prandial insulins are available at concentrations of up to 200 U/mL. The development of acceptable formulations of these insulins at concentrations of up to 1,000 U/mL will reduce the dosing volume by 5- to 10-fold, and thus enable the miniaturization of the delivery devices. Increasing insulin concentration is a significant formulation challenge both from an in-vitro and in-vivo perspective. In-vitro, it leads to an increase in viscosity and impairment of stability. In-vivo, increasing the concentration of insulin delays the onset of action. Arecor is applying its proven formulation expertise and proprietary platform technology to overcome the in-vitro and in-vivo challenges to optimize an ultra-concentrated insulin with a PK/PD profile similar to current rapid-acting insulin analogs. Sarah Howell, CEO of Arecor, said, ""We are delighted to be partnering with the JDRF as a leading global organization in type 1 diabetes research. This partnership will accelerate the development of Arecor's reformulated, ultra-concentrated, rapid-acting insulin program, which is a critical unmet need in the drive towards new miniaturized insulin-delivery technology. Ultra-concentrated insulin is an important product component in our portfolio of next-generation diabetes products."" ""We are delighted to partner and collaborate with Arecor.

They do not indicate the direction of a movement. This perception only arises in the brain through the comparative computations of light signals coming from adjacent image points. Engineers, physicists and neurobiologists have been debating the exact nature of these computations for around 50 years. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have now combined two theories about these computations, which were previously considered to be alternative hypotheses and discovered that they are carried out in a single neuron. See Also: Bug eyes: Tiny glasses confirm 3-D vision in insects Flies are usually very difficult to catch. No wonder they invest around ten percent of their brain in the detection and processing of image motion. For the fly, a hand approaches in slow motion and the fly's evasive manoeuvre has long been triggered before any real danger arises. Scientists have been researching for decades how the fly brain can perceive and process movements so quickly and accurately. ""Our goal is slowly coming into view, and we are close to completely decoding the neuronal circuit of motion perception in the fly,"" says Alexander Borst, who has been working on this problem with his Department at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology for quite some time. The scientists have now come one step closer to the answer: They have provided experimental data that combine two theories previously considered as alternatives. Over 50 years ago, two rival theoretical models were developed which attempted to explain how information about the direction of motion could be computed from the signals transmitted by adjacent image points. One theory states that light stimuli along one direction, referred to as the preferred direction, enhance each other. In contrast, the other model assumes that light stimuli along the opposite direction, known as the null direction, suppress each other. In both cases, a weak direction-selective signal arises, which must then be further processed and amplified. ""Interestingly, however, we discovered that already the first cells that respond to the motion stimuli the T4 and T5 cells display strong directional selectivity,"" reports Alexander Borst. In order to resolve this discrepancy, the neurobiologists refined a test set-up so that they were able to stimulate individual functional columns of the fly brain in succession and record the responses of the directionally-selective T4 cells. The data they collected and the corresponding computer simulations were clear: T4 cells intensify the input signals when they run along their preferred direction and suppress them when they run along the null direction. Both of the proposed mechanisms are thus implemented in the T4 cells of the fly brain, and what was thought to be an 'either-or' scenario became an 'as-well-as' one. ""It's no wonder that these cells can differentiate so accurately between motion directions,"" says J rgen Haag, first author of the study. ""Nature's solution is more complicated than either of the proposed models."" Don't Miss: A new system for color visionIn their computer simulations of such a combined mechanism, the Max Planck researchers required three different input signals to the T4 cells. Interestingly, however, T4 cells receive input signals from four other cells. This would suggest that the fourth still unknown input signal to the T4 cells contains a further surprise in relation to the final computation. ""Needless to say, we would now also like to know what kind of information the T4 cells receive via this fourth channel,"" says Alexander Borst, explaining the next step in the research process. ""We will then be able to show for the first time how information about motion direction is calculated in a neural network from individual image points.""

This is because endothelial cells are sensitive to blood flow and also interact with blood cells through molecules on their surface, so that blood coagulation and platelet function are modulated. In normal  hemostasis , the endothelium prevents deadly blood loss and clot formation. However, dysfunction or inflammation of the endothelium may result in aberrant blood coagulation inside the vessels, leading to life-threatening blockages or hemorrhage. ""Abnormal blood coagulation and platelet activation are major medical problems and the ways we study them now are overly simplified,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""Clinicians currently do not have tools to monitor hemostasis that take into account physiologically-important interactions between endothelial cells and flowing blood."" Until now, the crucial interface between endothelial cells and circulating blood has not been accurately replicated in a practical diagnostic device, due to the challenge of incorporating living endothelial cells into a robust testing tool. Now, a team led by Ingber at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University has discovered that endothelial cells need not be  living  in order to confer their effects on blood coagulation. A new device developed by the team, published in August in the journal Biomedical Microdevices, could monitor blood clot formation and diagnose effectiveness of anti-platelet therapy, by microengineering tiny hollow channels lined by chemically 'fixed' human endothelial cells that more closely mimic cellular and vascular flow conditions inside a patient s body than a bare surface. ""It s a bioinspired device that contains the endothelial function of a diseased patient without having actual living cells, and this greatly increases the robustness of the device,"" said the study s first author Abhishek Jain, Ph.D., a former Wyss Institute Postdoctoral Fellow who has recently been appointed Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M University. This blood coagulation diagnostic can even be used to study the effects of endothelial inflammation on the formation of blood clots, which is highly relevant in patients suffering from atherosclerosis, a chronic disease that builds up plaque leading to hardening and narrowing of blood vessels. ""This is one of the first examples of how a microfluidic cell culture system could have added value in clinical diagnostics,  said study co-author Andries van der Meer, Ph.D., a former Wyss Institute Postdoctoral Fellow who is now Assistant Professor in Applied Stem Cell Technologies at University of Twente, The Netherlands.  Using chemically fixed tissue that is no longer alive offers a clear, low-risk path toward further testing and product development."" A previous study by Ingber and his team showed that recreating the physicality and blood flow of vasculature within microfluidic channels allowed them to predict precise times that blood might clot, with potential applications in real-time monitoring of patients receiving intravenous anticoagulants in order to prevent complications such as stroke and vascular occlusion. Their latest device adds another layer of complexity by embedding the functionality of the vascular endothelium within a diagnostic tool that might be manufactured, stored and shipped for clinical use, which was never before considered possible. ""Our efforts to mimic the vascular system in a meaningful way within a microfluidic device has led to two avenues of technology development, which could potentially be combined in the future to develop portable tools suited for diagnosing and even discovering what disease states lead to blood clotting,"" said Ingber. ""Together they represent a new suite of physiologically-relevant microdevices that incorporate critical mechanical cues, and which could have near-term impact on our understanding and prevention of dysfunctional hemostasis.""","Published: August 10, 2016"

The study authors estimate that 6 million or more people may be drinking water contaminated with these highly fluorinated chemicals   in this case, poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). These chemicals are used widely to extinguish liquid fuel fires and during training exercises, and are referred to as aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) because they contain a fluorocarbon surfactant, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), that reduces surface tension and increases spreading over the liquid.  During fire-fighting practice drills, large volumes of these toxic chemicals wash into surface and ground waters and can end up in our drinking water,  said Arlene Blum, a co-author of the study and visiting scholar in the Department of Chemistry at UC Berkeley.  Such persistent chemicals should only be used when essential, and never for training.  The study, which appears Aug. 9 in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, was based on levels of contaminants in drinking water measured in EPA s Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3) study. These measurements suggest that at least six million people have drinking water that exceeds the recent EPA health advisory levels for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Using sophisticated mapping technology, the researchers traced possible sources of contamination to fire-fighting foam at military sites and airports, industrial sites and wastewater treatment plants. Blum, the founding director of the Green Science Policy Institute in Berkeley, said that a major conclusion from these studies is that the problem of fluorinated chemicals in our nation s drinking water is enormous. The available water data only reveals the tip of an iceberg of contaminated drinking water.  Our results point to the need for the EPA to enact enforceable regulations to protect the health of the millions of Americans being exposed to PFAS in their drinking water,  said co-author Thomas Bruton, a graduate student in UC Berkeley s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Another study by Harvard researchers appearing in the Aug. 9 issue of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives connects early life exposure to the fluorinated chemicals to reduced immune responses that persist into adolescence. A recent study in the same population found that mothers with higher exposures to these substances were capable of breastfeeding their children a shorter time span, perhaps due to adverse effects on hormonal functions. Other authors of the study are Elsie Sunderland, Cindy Hu and Courtney Carignan of Harvard University and Simona Balan of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. Bruton s work was funded by the U.S. National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program and UC Berkeley s Superfund Research Center.

Our goal is to develop drug carriers that we can direct to any part of the body, hold them there until they release their payload, then direct them away all done using a small magnet,  said Ratneshwar Lal, professor of bioengineering, mechanical engineering and materials science in the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego.  More importantly, we want to direct these drug carriers through places in the body where drugs typically can t pass, like the blood-brain barrier,  Lal said. This would offer a new way to target and treat brain diseases like Alzheimer s disease and glioblastoma, the most malignant of brain tumors. In a previous study, Lal and his team have shown that they can magnetically guide nanoparticles safely through the blood-brain barrier in mice. Now, the team has taken its research a step further by making nanobowls that could be used to store and carry drugs, and potentially be used to detect diseased cells and tissue. The nanobowls, which are at the proof-of-concept stage, are bowl-shaped silica nanoparticles smaller than the width of a human hair coated in a layer of gold, with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles sandwiched in between the silica and gold layers. In a recent paper published in the journal Nanoscale, researchers showed that the nanobowls could be moved around by a small magnet, are capable of going inside normal and cancerous cells and could be used to detect the presence of low abundance molecules. Researchers created the nanobowls in a multi-step synthesis. They first made templates of spherical silica nanoparticles with partially exposed polystyrene cores. The silica surface was functionalized, then coated with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles followed by a layer of gold. The polystyrene cores remained untouched and were washed away with an organic solvent, leaving behind a cavity to create the nanobowl. Researchers showed they could use a small magnet to move the nanobowls through a hydrogel.  This suggests a potential use of the nanobowls for magnetically controlled delivery through soft tissues,  the researchers reported in the Nanoscale paper. Because of their gold coating, the nanobowls could be used for imaging. In their experiments, researchers showed that molecules in extremely low concentrations, which are typically impossible to see spectroscopically, were easily detected in the presence of the nanobowls. This feature has applications in detecting disease markers early on, researchers said. Lastly, the nanobowls could be taken in by live cells. Researchers incubated the nanobowls with both normal and cancerous prostate cell lines. Within two hours, the nanobowls were found inside the cells. As a next step, Lal and his team plan on making caps for the nanobowls that can be triggered to open on demand to release drugs.  This would enable us to control the release of drug payloads in our system,  Lal said.","Published: August 10, 2016"

The cartilage has special properties that enable it to absorb energy, bear weight, and lubricate the joints so they can function seamlessly. In osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks and wears away. Bones under the cartilage may then rub together, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and disability. Osteoarthritis affects more than 27 million Americans age 25 and older, making it the most common type of arthritis. It typically affects the knees, hips, lower back, neck, and hands. Treatments include exercise, medications to control pain, and surgery to reposition or resurface the joint or to replace it with an artificial one. Restoring the cartilage in these joints would be an important advance in the treatment of osteoarthritis. A team led by Dr. Farshid Guilak, formerly of Duke University and now at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, previously engineered a scaffold to guide stem cells into cartilage-producing cells. The group set out to build on this work by incorporating a gene transfer approach to induce cells to produce an anti-inflammatory compound to prevent further joint degradation. The research was supported in part by NIH s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). Results were published on August 2, 2016, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists formed 3-D woven textile scaffolds from a biomaterial approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The 22-mm scaffolds were shaped over a mold to mimic a hip joint surface and attached to a nylon mesh to maintain their shape. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds could be altered by varying the weave architecture. Adult human fat-derived stem cells obtained from liposuction waste were seeded onto the outer surface of the porous scaffolds. The cells and scaffolds were maintained in tissue culture for 38 days. During this time, the cells grew to evenly cover the scaffolds. They produced a matrix made up of proteins, such as collagens, that are key components of joint cartilage. The matrix created a smooth, glistening appearance over the scaffolds. The scientists next engineered a harmless virus to contain a gene with instructions to make the anti-inflammatory molecule IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). They attached this viral vector to the scaffolds and then added the stem cells, which attached and grew. When they added a chemical to the culture media to turn on the gene, the cells produced high levels of IL-1Ra. When inflammatory molecules were added to the cultures, the IL-1Ra prevented the production of a joint-damaging protein. The researchers are now refining the system components and testing customized implants in animal models.  Our hope is to prevent, or at least delay, a standard metal and plastic prosthetic joint replacement,  Guilak says.","Published: August 10, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-breast-cancers-resist-chemotherapy-197192,How Breast Cancers Resist Chemotherapy Researchers discovered an unexpected way that breast cancers cells with mutant BRCA  or BRCA  genes acquire drug resistance and evade chemotherapies  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human proteins that help to repair damaged DNA. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, the resulting abnormal proteins may be unable to properly repair DNA. Cells with such mutations are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer. Together, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for about 20-25% of hereditary breast cancers and 5-10% of all breast cancers. Mutations in these genes also increase the risk of ovarian and other types of cancer. The reduced ability to repair DNA makes cancer cells with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation sensitive to treatment with DNA-damaging drugs. But breast cancers eventually acquire resistance to these drugs. One way that tumors develop chemoresistance is through restoration of a DNA repair process called homologous recombination. However, scientists have recently uncovered other roles for BRCA1 and BRCA2 after DNA is damaged. A team of researchers led by Drs. Andre Nussenzweig and Shyam Sharan at NIH s National Cancer Institute (NCI) examined the roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA replication, the process by which the cell copies DNA strands in preparation for cell division. Their study appeared on July 20, 2016, in Nature. During DNA replication, the enzymes that copy DNA create structures called replication forks. The movement of a replication fork as it migrates along a DNA molecule can be disrupted by DNA damage. This interruption of replication fork migration results in what is called a stalled fork. Certain proteins are recruited to stalled forks to stabilize, repair, and restart the replication fork. Forks that aren t repaired are degraded by other enzymes. When a replication fork stalls, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins protect the newly synthesized strands of DNA. When these proteins are absent, the replication fork is destabilized and the newly synthesized DNA is degraded. Thus, lack of BRCA1 and BRCA2 increases genomic instability and enhances sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs. The researchers identified several proteins that actively promote destabilization of replication forks. These proteins, which include PTIP, CHD4, and PARP1, help to recruit enzymes that degrade newly synthesized DNA. Their absence protected the DNA at replication forks and reversed the drug sensitivity of BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutant cells. An analysis of clinical information showed that expression of PTIP correlated with how patients with BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutant cancers responded to treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Levels of these proteins might thus be a useful biomarker for predicting and tracking patient responses in the clinic.  A deeper knowledge of the processes that drive drug resistance in BRCA1/2-mutant tumors will lead to novel therapeutic approaches that target tumor-specific vulnerabilities,  Nussenzweig adds.","Published: August 10, 2016"

A new study, published today in Nature, suggests that a single class of drugs could be used to treat all three. Wellcome-funded researchers at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) have identified a chemical that can cure all of these diseases in mice. It also does not harm human cells in laboratory tests, providing a strong starting point for drug development. Chagas, leishmaniasis and sleeping sickness have different symptoms, but are all caused by parasites called  kinetoplastids    a type of single-celled organism. The parasites share similar biology and genetics, which led scientists to think it might be possible to find a single chemical that could destroy all three.  The team at GNF tested over 3 million different chemicals and identified a compound, GNF6702, which was effective against the parasites but did not damage human cells. They refined this starting compound to make it more potent before testing in it mice. Senior study author Frantisek Supek from GNF said:  We found that these parasites harbour a common weakness. We hope to exploit this weakness to discover and develop a single class of drugs for all three diseases.  Dr Stephen Caddick, Director of Innovation at Wellcome, said:  These three diseases lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually, yet they receive relatively little funding for research and drug development. We hope that our early stage support for this research will provide a basis for the development of new treatments that could reduce suffering for millions of people in the poorest regions of the world.  Existing treatments for the three diseases are expensive, often have side effects and are not very effective. The fact that GNF6702 does not seem to have any adverse effects in mice suggests that it might have fewer side-effects than existing drugs, although this will need to be explored in human studies. GNF6702 is now being tested for toxicity before it can be moved in to clinical trials. The project was led by Frantisek Supek at GNF, in collaboration with researchers at the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), University of York, University of Washington and the University of Glasgow.

In collaboration with Jordi Solana and Nikolaus Rajewsky and other colleagues from the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) in Germany and the University of Toronto, CRG group leader Manuel Irimia studied the patterns of gene activity in stem cells in these unusual animals. They found that they  mix and match  certain parts of their genes in particular ways   a process known as alternative splicing*. The same analysis of flatworm cells that had changed (differentiated) into more specific cell types revealed a different mixture of gene parts. Looking more closely, the team discovered that two families of molecules   CELF and MBNL   work as a kind of  yin and yang  switch, enabling cells to flip between different patterns of alternative splicing. CELF molecules guide gene splicing patterns linked to self-renewal of stem cells, while MBNL factors favour differentiation. The study builds on Irimia s previous research showing that MBNL proteins and alternative splicing patterns are important in human and mouse embryonic stem cells as they differentiate into other cell types. Previously, scientists have discovered certain proteins, known as transcription factors, that are important for maintaining embryonic stem cells in mammals. However, these particular molecules do not play the same roles in the stem cells of invertebrate organisms such as flatworms, which split off from the ancestors of mammals around 600 million years ago, suggesting that they are quite new in evolutionary terms.  Discovering that this kind of alternative splicing mechanism exists across such a wide evolutionary range suggests that it is very ancient, and may be equally important as transcription factors for giving animal stem cells their unique properties  says Irimia.  Furthermore, understanding how this  yin and yang  switch is flipped and activates particular patterns of alternative splicing could one day lead to more improved methods for generating and differentiating stem cells, which could be used be used for regenerative medicine.

Continual improvement through plant breeding underpins food security globally,  says senior author Associate Professor Jason Able, Head of Agricultural Science within the University s School of Agriculture, Food and Wine at the Waite campus.  With the world s population set to reach more than nine billion by 2050, we need to intensify our efforts in breeding new cereals and other food plants with improvements in yield, quality and disease resistance.  Technologies based on gene regulation by small RNA have been known about for some time. We hope to be able to embrace that technology for a new plant breeding strategy. We call it SMARTER cereal breeding: Small RNA-Mediated Adaptation of Reproductive Targets in Epigenetic Regulation.  It s a fancy acronym which basically means using these small molecules during plant development to control characteristics such as reproductive timing.  Improving yield potential and stability under different growing conditions is a major focus in plant breeding research at the Waite campus. Crop production, particularly across Australia, can suffer significant yield losses due to environmental stresses including drought and heat.  We can use these newly developed technologies to alter gene expression in a controllable and precise manner, to enhance stress tolerance and alter reproductive processes, such as the timing of flowering to avoid environmental stresses,  says Associate Professor Able.  These SMARTER cereal breeding strategies could be one of the most promising solutions to improving agricultural productivity, by developing varieties with superior agriculturally and economically desirable traits and, most importantly, improved grain yield for growers.

But because they depend on databases that contain people s medical histories, they carry privacy risks. An attacker armed with genetic information about someone   from, say, a skin sample   could query a database for that person s medical data. Even without the skin sample, an attacker who was permitted to make repeated queries, each informed by the results of the last, could, in principle, extract private data from the database. In the latest issue of the journal Cell Systems, researchers from MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Indiana University at Bloomington describe a new system that permits database queries for genome-wide association studies but reduces the chances of privacy compromises to almost zero. It does that by adding a little bit of misinformation to the query results it returns. That means that researchers using the system could begin looking for drug targets with slightly inaccurate data. But in most cases, the answers returned by the system will be close enough to be useful. And an instantly searchable online database of genetic data, even one that returned slightly inaccurate information, could make biomedical research much more efficient.  Right now, what a lot of people do, including the NIH, for a long time, is take all their data   including, often, aggregate data, the statistics we re interested in protecting   and put them into repositories,  says Sean Simmons, an MIT postdoc in mathematics and first author on the new paper.  And you have to go through a time-consuming process to get access to them.  That process involves a raft of paperwork, including explanations of how the research enabled by the repositories will contribute to the public good, which requires careful review.  We ve waited months to get access to various repositories,  says Bonnie Berger, the Simons Professor of Mathematics at MIT, who was Simmons s thesis advisor and is the corresponding author on the paper.  Months.  Bring the noise Genome-wide association studies generally rely on genetic variations called single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced  snips ). A SNP is a variation of one nucleotide, or DNA  letter,  at a specified location in the genome. Millions of SNPs have been identified in the human population, and certain combinations of SNPs can serve as proxies for larger stretches of DNA that tend to be conserved among individuals. The new system, which Berger and Simmons developed together with Cenk Sahinalp, a professor of computer science at Indiana University, implements a technique called  differential privacy,  which has been a major area of cryptographic research in recent years. Differential-privacy techniques add a little bit of noise, or random variation, to the results of database searches, to confound algorithms that would seek to extract private information from the results of several, tailored, sequential searches. The amount of noise required depends on the strength of the privacy guarantee   how low you want to set the likelihood of leaking private information   and the type and volume of data. The more people whose data a SNP database contains, the less noise the system needs to add; essentially, it s easier to get lost in a crowd. But the more SNPs the system records, the more flexibility an attacker has in constructing privacy-compromising searches, which increases the noise requirements. The researchers considered two types of common queries. In one, the user asks for the statistical correlation between a particular SNP and a particular disease. In the other, the user asks for a list of the SNPs in a particular region of the genome that correlate best with a particular disease. In the first case, the system returns a widely used measure of correlation called a p-value. Here, the p-value would be modified   augmented or reduced by some random factor   in order to ensure privacy. In the second case, the system has some chance of returning not the top-scoring SNPs in a given region, but several of the top-scoring SNPs and maybe one or two lower-scoring ones. To calculate the probability that a given SNP will make it into the results, the researchers use a measure called the Hamming distance, which indicates how far away a lower-scoring SNP is from the one that it s replacing. This turns out to yield more useful results than relying on the p-value. Finding an efficient algorithm for calculating Hamming distances on the fly is one of the system s chief innovations. Ironing out differences The other is that the system corrects for a problem common in population genetics called population stratification.  The standard example is that a particular SNP is closely linked to being lactose intolerant,  Simmons explains.  Let s say that people in East Asia are more likely to be lactose intolerant than someone in, say, Northern Europe. But also Northern Europeans tend to be taller than people from East Asia. A naive method would suggest that this particular SNP has an effect on height, but it s really a false correlation.  The researchers  algorithm assumes that the largest variations in a given population are the results of differences between subpopulations, filters those differences out, and hones in on the ones that remain.  Since Homer s attack in 2008, the biomedical community has been debating to what extent and to whom genomic and phenotypic databases should be made accessible,  says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, a professor of computer science at the  cole Polytechnique F d rale de Lausanne, referring to a paper by Nils Homer, then a graduate student at the University of California at Los Angeles, on determining whether a given person s genetic data is present in a database.  In parallel, Cynthia Dwork and other computer scientists have developed the concept of differential privacy, the theory of which is now well-understood. The authors of this paper make a crucial contribution, because they provide concrete examples of how differential privacy can be used to protect the privacy of genome-wide association studies in heterogeneous human populations. Hopefully, this will encourage the biomedical community to test this promising approach at large scale and, if it s successful, define best practices and develop related tools.

And how can it be stopped early in the process? Now, a new laboratory model of Parkinson's is giving scientists an inside look at what happens in the brain years before motor symptoms appear. Specifically, it demonstrates how abnormal alpha-synuclein proteins, which are strongly associated with Parkinson's, gradually spread from an area of the brain implicated in the early stages of the disease to other regions of the brain ultimately damaged by the disease. The findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. See Also: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity Parkinson's is primarily a disease of aging, with most cases diagnosed after age 60. By the time symptoms appear, more than half of the brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger needed for voluntary movement, have died. What triggers this process is unknown, although evidence points to a combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Strong evidence also suggests that clumps of abnormal alpha-synuclein play a role in the disease process. In recent years, scientists have found links to the early stages of Parkinson's in other areas of the body, namely the gut and the nose. ""Better models that mimic the early stages of the disease will allow us to more precisely study Parkinson's and, by extension, find new ways to potentially stop it before it progresses,"" said Van Andel Research Institute researcher Nolwen Rey, PhD, the study's first author. ""We know that specific signs of Parkinson's, including a loss of sense of smell, appear years before the onset of motor symptoms. Our new model replicates the phase that occurs long before diagnosis and, importantly, gives us a powerful tool to test novel interventions that might prevent the onset of Parkinson's as we know it."" The study demonstrates that alpha-synuclein travels along nerve cells in the olfactory bulb the part of the brain that controls sense of smell prior to the onset of motor symptoms and that this area may be particularly susceptible to the spread of alpha-synuclein, ultimately causing deficits in the sense of smell. Clumps of alpha-synuclein eventually reach several additional brain regions, including the brainstem area that houses dopamine cells.

In the first effort of its kind, the research team developed a machine-learning program that scoured the whole human genome to predict which genes may contribute to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The results of the program's analyses a rogue's gallery of 2,500 candidate genes vastly expand on the 65 autism-risk genes currently known. Researchers have recently estimated that 400 to 1,000 genes underpin the complex neurodevelopmental disorder. See Also: Interactions between cortical and subcortical regions important in hypersensitivity in ASDThis newest research provides a manageable, ""highly enriched"" pool from which to pin down the full suite of ASD-related genes, the researchers said. Many of the newly implicated genes have never been studied for their possible roles in ASD. Following up on these leads will help scientists delve deeper into autism's strong  yet byzantine genetic basis, as well as possibly lead to new diagnostic and treatment techniques. The paper is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience and the researchers have made their results available online. ""Geneticists can now focus on the top-ranked autism-risk gene predictions from our machine-learning program, both to direct future genome sequencing studies and to prioritize individual genes for experimental studies,"" said co-lead author Arjun Krishnan, an associate research scholar at Princeton's Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics. ""The method we developed can, for the first time, identify ASD-associated genes even if they have not been previously linked to autism in genetic studies,"" said Olga Troyanskaya, senior author of the paper and a Princeton professor of computer science and genomics, as well as deputy director for genomics at the Simons Center for Data Analysis. ""It is vitally important that we begin to explore underappreciated aspects of how autism arises and might someday be treated."" Autism has emerged in recent decades as one of the most common developmental disorders. The disorder, which has no cure, is characterized by difficulties in communicating, learning and socializing. Children often are not diagnosed until they are 3 or 4 years old. However, intervention services, such as physical and behavioral therapy, in a child's first few years have been shown to improve development. Therefore, clinicians are keen on detecting autism as early as possible. Learn More: Altered cell cycle gene activity underlies brain overgrowth in toddlers with autism ""It is very important that we improve ways to diagnose kids with autism earlier so we can do earlier interventions,"" Krishnan said. ""Furthermore, getting a handle on where, when and how autism spectrum disorders arise during brain development will be absolutely critical for drug and treatment development in the decades ahead."" ""This study is elegant, sophisticated and comprehensive,"" said Daniel Geschwind, director of the Center for Autism Research and Treatment at the University of California-Los Angeles, who is familiar with the study but had no role in it. ""It pulls together essentially all of the data out there on using network-based approaches to better understand autism."" Other Princeton researchers involved in the study are graduate student and co-lead author Ran Zhang, as well as graduate student Victoria Yao, lab manager Chandra Theesfeld and scientific software engineer Alicja Tadych. The other Simons Foundation authors are Aaron Wong, Natalia Volfovsky, Alan Packer and Alex Lash. Funding came primarily from the National Institutes of Health (U.S.). The researchers began with a ""functional interaction network"" of the human brain they had originally constructed little more than a year ago. The network describes how genes in the human genome work together in the brain's molecular circuits. While every cell in the human body contains a complete set of genetic instructions for the whole body, only a portion of these genes are ""turned on"" in any given cell at any given point in development or everyday life. Mutations to genes can prevent them from working in concert with other genes, leading to dysfunction and illness. ""We have so many types of cells in our body, and though each cell has the same set of genes, or the same box of tools, each cell type can perform very different activities by wiring these tools in different ways,"" Krishnan said. ""We want to discover and understand the disruptions to the genetic toolkit in the brain of people with autism to learn about its origins."" The brain-specific network the researchers relied on pooled results from thousands of previous experiments, each of them revealing piece-by-piece how genes function together throughout the human body. Next, the team applied their machine-learning program to this network. The program quickly sifted through the entire network of more than 100 million gene interactions to draw out information, learning characteristics that indicate a connection to autism, and honing the quality of returns as they proceeded. Just as teachers offer students positive and negative feedback, the Princeton and Simons Foundation team trained the machine-learning program on the connectivity patterns of known ASD-associated genes, as well as human disease genes with no association to neurodevelopment. Based on those initial cues, the program then analyzed all 25,825 genes in the human genome, seeking any interaction patterns that resemble those of ASD-related genes. Encouragingly, within its top 10 percent of ranked predictions around 2,500 genes the program correctly identified numerous ASD-associated genes that were different from the known ones initially used to ""train"" the computer program. More importantly, the program highlighted several brand-new, compelling candidate genes with no prior genetic evidence tying them to autism. ""These novel genes for autism risk are great candidates for further study,"" Krishnan said. To gain context for their findings, the researchers considered their gene-prediction results alongside a map of gene expression in the developing brain compiled by neuroscientists at the Yale University School of Medicine. A distinct pattern of gene activity and inactivity popped up in babies' brains while in utero. Through the prenatal into the late-fetal stages, altered development occurred broadly across neural regions related to autism by previous studies. These regions include the cerebellum, which coordinates and integrates muscle movement and sensory information, as well as the striatum, which is involved in motivation, planning and decision-making. Read Next: Brains with autism adapt differently during implicit learning ""It is quite clear in our findings that the signal for autism is really there in early development,"" Troyanskaya said. ""The signal is regionally diffuse, implying autism is likely a disorder of general brain development, and not just one specific brain region."" A significant portion of the genes with a predicted link to autism have no known function in the brain, Troyanskaya said. ""Although the human genome was mapped early last decade, we still don't know what a majority of human genes do,"" she said. ""Our study underlines the fact that we have a great deal yet to learn about the operation of genes in the brains of neurotypical and autistic people.""

See Also: Sleep in a dish: Researchers isolate smallest unit of sleep to date When the NREM sleep of subjects had lasted at least three minutes, researchers gave magnetic pulses that induced a weak electric field and activated neurons. After a series of pulses, the subject was woken with an alarm sound, and they were then asked whether they had dreamed and to describe the content of the dream. 'It is traditionally thought that dreaming occurs only in REM sleep. However, as also our study demonstrates, subjects woken from NREM sleep are also able to give accounts of their dreams in more than half of cases,' Post-doctoral Researcher Jaakko Nieminen from Aalto University explains. 'EEG showed that the deterministic brain activity produced by magnetic pulses was notably shorter in people who did not dream, i.e. were unconscious, than in people who had dreamt. We also observed that the longer the story about the dream, the more the subject's EEG resembled that measured from people who were awake,' Dr. Nieminen explains. EEG responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation during NREM sleep when subjects dreamt (red line) and did not dream (blue line). When subjects did not dream, 200 milliseconds after the stimulation, a strong deflection was visible in their EEG.

These disorders are associated with changes to the brain structure: for example, the hippocampus in the temporal lobe is usually smaller in affected individuals than in healthy ones. It is not yet known whether these changes to the brain structure are a result of the disorders and their accompanying medications, or whether they are already present before the onset of symptoms. See Also: Researchers identify signature of microbiomes associated with schizophrenia Together with a research group from the University of Basel, Fabienne Harrisberger and Stefan Borgwardt examined the brain structures of individuals exhibiting an elevated risk of psychosis, and those of individuals experiencing the onset of psychotic symptoms for the first time. Initially, scientists from the Adult Psychiatric Clinic of the University Psychiatric Clinics (UPK) and the Transfaculty Research Platform Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences (MCN) observed no appreciable difference between the hippocampi of individuals at high risk and those of patients. Next, together with scientists from the Transfaculty Research Platform, they investigated whether any known schizophrenia risk genes are associated with the hippocampus. This appears to be the case: the greater the number of risk genes a person possessed, the smaller the volume of their hippocampus regardless of whether they were a high-risk study participant or a patient. This means that a group of risk genes is connected with a reduction in the size of a critical region of the brain before the disorder manifests itself. This result is significant for the understanding of neurobiological factors contributing to schizophrenia. It is well-known that none of the wider risk factors (e.g. genes, environment, unfavorable social situation) can be used to predict the onset of psychosis in a specific individual. However, the discovery may be of use for the treatment of schizophrenia.

See Also: The immune system, microglia, and the brain The research team examined the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for forming new memories, and the site where neurons continue be formed throughout life. During an allergic reaction, there was an increase in the numbers of new neurons in the hippocampus, raising the question: what could be the consequences of allergies on memory? The formation and functioning of neurons is linked to the brain's immune cells, the microglia. To the scientists surprise, they found that the same allergic reaction that kicks the body's immune system in high gear, has opposite effect on resident immune cells of the brain. The microglia in the brain were deactivated in brains of these animals. ""It was highly unexpected to see the deactivation of microglia in the hippocampus,"" explained Barbara Klein, one of the authors of the study: ""Partly because other studies have shown the reverse effect on microglia following bacterial infection.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mutations-linked-to-immunotherapy-resistance-201765,Mutations Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance Researchers uncover mutations in tumors of three patients with advanced melanoma that allowed the tumors to become resistant to the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab  Keytruda    ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For many patients with melanoma whose tumors shrink after treatment with a class of immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, their tumors eventually grow back despite continued treatment. A new study has identified genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for this acquired treatment resistance in at least some of these patients. The researchers found mutations in tumors from three patients with advanced melanoma that allowed the tumors to become resistant to the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda ). Specifically, the mutations enabled the tumors to avoid recognition and attack by immune cells. The results are of ""significant interest"" because checkpoint inhibitors are now used to treat several kinds of cancer, said James Gulley, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Genitourinary Malignancy Branch in NCI s Center for Cancer Research. Understanding how tumors acquire resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is critical, the study authors wrote, and may help guide the development of targeted therapies that could counteract resistance. Immune Checkpoints The immune system includes several so called checkpoint proteins that keep immune responses from becoming too strong. For example, binding of the protein PD-1 on T cells to the protein PD-L1 or PD-L2 on other cells suppresses the immune response. Cancer cells and cells in the environment surrounding a tumor sometimes express PD-L1, preventing immune attack. Several immune checkpoint inhibitors target PD-1 or PD-L1, preventing them from binding and thereby allowing the immune system to attack tumor cells. Inhibitors of PD-1 and PD-L1 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat several cancer types. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor that is approved to treat some patients with advanced melanoma and advanced lung cancer. Although treatment with PD-1 inhibitors causes tumors to shrink (or disappear entirely) in approximately one-third of patients with advanced melanoma, the tumor grows back (or relapses) despite continued treatment in up to one-quarter of these patients. To investigate how tumor resistance to PD-1 inhibitors arises, Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D., of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and his colleagues sequenced the DNA of tumors from four patients with metastatic melanoma who initially responded to pembrolizumab but then relapsed after 1 to 2 years of treatment. For each patient, they compared mutations in tumor biopsies taken before treatment and after relapse to identify alterations that were acquired after treatment and may have contributed to treatment resistance. In all four patients, more than 90% of mutations were found in both biopsies, which allowed the research team to focus on the few mutations that were unique to the relapsed tumors, explained the study s first author, Jesse Zaretsky, an M.D. Ph.D. student in the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program. Mechanisms of Resistance Immune checkpoint inhibitors ""release the brakes"" on the immune system, allowing T cells to become active and secrete a cytokine called interferon gamma. Interferon gamma suppresses the growth of cancer cells through a signaling pathway that requires JAK proteins. Two of the four patients studied had mutations in either JAK1 or JAK2, the genes that code for JAK proteins, in their relapsed tumors. In both cases the mutation generated a shortened, nonfunctional protein. Using cell lines from the patient who acquired a JAK2 mutation, the researchers found that the mutated JAK2 protein disrupted the interferon gamma signaling pathway. These cells also had reduced expression of genes whose products allow T cells to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. The authors also found that interferon gamma did not inhibit growth of the JAK2-mutant tumor-derived cells or melanoma cells lines that lacked either JAK1 or JAK2.  This may not be the only mechanism of resistance,  Dr. Gulley said, but  this is one additional piece of the puzzle of how we could overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.  Genetic analysis of biopsies from the third patient revealed a mutation in the B2M gene in the relapsed tumor.B2M helps cells express proteins on the cell surface that immune cells use to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Acquired B2M mutations have been shown in other studies to promote tumor resistance to immunotherapy, Zaretsky explained, and these new findings appear to confirm the earlier research. Thus, the researchers concluded that mutations in JAK1, JAK2, and B2M promote resistance to pembrolizumab by allowing tumor cells to avoid recognition and attack by immune cells. The researchers did not identify any genetic abnormalities related to PD-1 inhibitor resistance in the fourth patient, suggesting that the relapsed tumor may have acquired resistance through a nongenetic mechanism.  Case four is a true mystery,  said Zaretsky. Learning More The research team is now building on this research to find ways of overcoming checkpoint inhibitor resistance. ""We re starting to model these mutations in cell lines and mouse models so we can study their interaction with the immune system and begin testing other therapies, or combinations of therapies with PD-1 inhibitors, to try and overcome the resistance,"" Zaretsky said. Because the findings only reflect mechanisms of PD-1 inhibitor resistance in four patients, additional studies will be needed to determine how prevalent these mechanisms are in other melanoma patients, said Dr. Gulley. ""We don t know if these identified mutations will represent 80% of patients that develop resistance or 10%, but what we do know is that resistance to immune cell recognition or killing is at least one mechanism.""","Published: August 9, 2016"

Beekeepers typically apply pesticides to hives to rid them of harmful parasites such as Varroa mites.  Although helpful for ridding hives of parasites and pathogens, the chemicals in beekeeper-applied pesticides can be harmful to the bees,  said Mark Williams, an associate professor of horticulture in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and lead author.  Our research suggests that pesticides could specifically impact the microbes that are crucial to honey bee nutrition and health.  For the project, the team extracted genomic data from honeybees that lived in hives that were treated with pesticides (three different kinds) with those that were not. Samples were pulled from hives in three separate Blacksburg locations. Honeybees from chlorothalanil-treated hives showed the greatest change in gut microbiome, said Williams, who is also affiliated with the Fralin Life Science Institute.   Looking ahead, the team plans to investigate the specific changes in gut microbiota activities that affect honeybee survival. Honeybees are the foundation of successful high-value food production.

The disease originates in a lymphoid organ (lymph node, spleen, or bone marrow) before spreading through the blood to infiltrate not only other lymphoid organs but also other tissues. Every year, nearly 2,000 people in Switzerland are diagnosed with lymphoma, a disease that can be very aggressive, resisting standard treatments with chemotherapeutic drugs. Today, researchers at the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG), Switerland, give a new hope to patients. Their innovative approach consists in using an antibody able to neutralize a specific protein to block the migration of lymphoma cells, thus preventing the disease from developing. This still experimental immunotherapeutic strategy paves the way for new treatments against lymphoma. The results can be read in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology.  Lymphocytes, a special type of white blood cell, are essential components of the immune system. But like any other cell, they are not safe from carcinogenic mutations that can cause uncontrolled proliferation. They can then circulate freely in the blood and spread to the lymphatic system, thus causing a tumor called lymphoma.  Lymphoma cells only become truly dangerous when they leave the blood vessels and multiply in the lymphatic system.  Since they cannot survive in the blood for long, these malignant cells are compelled to find a more accommodating environment   such as the lymphatic system   where they can proliferate. We decided to focus on this Achilles heel by containing them in the blood so as to prevent any resulting harm , explains Thomas Matthes, Professor at UNIGE, Faculty of Medicine, and Doctor at HUG, who supervised the study together with Beat Imhof, Professor at UNIGE, Faculty of Medicine.

In our mice, we observed the nearly-complete disappearance of already-present tumor cells in the organs.   This discovery is in line with the recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, a field that focuses on the design of treatments based on the human immune system.

An early microbial imbalance, or dysbiosis, is predictive for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, a chronic lung disease of prematurity. The extremely low birth-weight, or ELBW, infants in this study had an average birth weight of 1 pound, 8 ounces. Researchers found that the ELBW infants who went on to develop life-threatening BPD showed abnormal microbial colonization patterns at birth, as compared to pre-term infants who did not get BPD.  Right at birth, your respiratory microbiome can possibly predict your risk for BPD,  said Charitharth Vivek Lal, M.D., assistant professor in the UAB Pediatrics Division of Neonatology and the lead investigator of this study. The study also suggests that the  healthy  pattern of colonization seen in the BPD-resistant ELBW infants   with increased abundance of Lactobacillus   is protective.  We speculate that the early airway microbiome may prime the developing pulmonary immune system, and dysbiosis in its development may set the stage for subsequent lung disease,  the researchers say in their paper in Scientific Reports, one of the Nature Publishing Group journals.  Should a disordered airway microbiome prove to be involved in the pathogenesis of disease, it will be of immediate interest to attempt to develop novel therapeutic interventions.  Lal says this is the first unbiased airway microbiome analysis to be done immediately at birth   all the early saline aspirates from the tracheas of the newborns were collected at or within six hours of delivery. It is also the only infant airway microbiome analysis to be validated at a second medical center. After the first group of 23 ELBW infants and 10 full-term infants were studied at the Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, UAB Women & Infants Center, samples from a second group of 14 ELBW infants were studied in collaboration with Vineet Bhandari, M.D., at Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia. About half of the ELBW infants at both sites, all of them extremely pre-term, later developed BPD. The differences in the microbiomes between infants who were BPD-resistant and BPD-predisposed were similar for infants in both Birmingham and Philadelphia. Extremely premature infants are at risk for BPD, which is the most common lung pathology of these tiny infants and a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and health care expenditures. Adults and children who had BPD as infants have lungs that failed to develop properly and are more prone to worse lung function, asthma, lung infections and pulmonary hypertension. The researchers also looked at the airway microbiomes of 18 ELBW infants with established BPD and found that their microbiomes had a decreased diversity of types of microbes, and the pattern was very different from those of ELBW infants shortly after birth or full-term infants at birth. As to specific groups of microbes, the phylum Proteobacteria, which includes bacteria like E. coli, appeared to be involved in BPD pathology, and the genus Lactobaccillus, part of the phylum Firmicutes, appeared to be involved in disease protection. Lal and colleagues found decreased Lactobacillus abundance in the airway microbiomes of 10 infants born to mothers who had chorioamnionitis   an infection of the membranes of the placenta and an independent risk factor for BPD   as well as decreased Lactobacillus abundance at birth in the airways of the BPD-predisposed, ELBW infants, as compared to BPD-resistant infants. Research elsewhere has suggested a beneficial role for Lactobacillus against airway diseases and for lung development.  I predict that researchers will study the use of respiratory probiotics, and the role of the gut-lung microbiome axis in the future,  Lal said. For five ELBW infants who later developed BPD, the researchers collected periodic airway microbiome samples from birth through 9 weeks and saw extremely similar patterns of change in the microbiomes over time. As for the source of the microbes, Lal and colleagues wrote,  As it is commonly believed that colonization of neonates originates in the birth canal, we were surprised to find that the airway microbiome of vaginally delivered and caesarean section-delivered neonates were similar, which suggests that the microbial DNA in the airways is probably transplacentally derived, consistent with reports that the placenta has a rich microbiome.  The researchers speculate that this transmission of bacteria or bacterial DNA to the in-utero infant could be via blood or amniotic fluid.","Published: August 9, 2016"

Receptors on the outside of cells were known to launch the signaling process, which alerts proteins that trigger a cascade of events leading to the desired response, followed by a desensitization mechanism that allows cells to return to baseline. In recent years, however, the process has shown additional complexity that seemed to defy foundational assumptions, notably in how and where these signals can arise within the cell. Now researchers at Duke Health, led by Robert Lefkowitz, M.D., report that they appear to have solved this enigma. Lefkowitz, a James B. Duke Professor of Medicine at Duke and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, shared the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for describing cell signaling molecules and defining the underlying science for how therapies such as beta blockers and antihistamines can use them to advantage. In a study published online Aug. 4 in the journal Cell, Lefkowitz -- along with co-lead authors Alex R. B. Thomsen and Thomas J. Cahill III and colleagues -- describe a new paradigm for how a class of cell surface receptors known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate the signaling mechanism of cells. Classically, it was known that GPCRs located along the plasma membrane inside the cell activate G proteins, which are the molecular switches that transmit signals from external sources into the cell s interior, telling the cell how to function. The activation process is followed by desensitization, led by a protein called beta-arrestin that binds to the receptor, blocking further activation of G proteins and pulling the receptor to the inside of the cell in a process termed internalization or endocytosis. The end result of these two processes is to silence receptor signaling, allowing cellular function to return to status quo. In recent years, however, scientists learned that some GPCRs continue to signal to G proteins even after beta-arrestin has been deployed and the receptors were internalized in the cellular compartments, called endosomes. These observations challenged the known scheme. The Lefkowitz team -- using a variety of biochemical, biophysical and cell-based methods -- describe the existence, functionality and architecture of previously unknown super structures of receptors, which they ve called  mega-plexes."" These mega-plexes differ from the typical couplings of the receptors and beta-arrestin, binding simultaneously through their core region with G protein and through a tail region with beta-arrestin. Since beta-arrestin only interacts with the receptor tail, the entire inner surface of the receptor is exposed, enabling the receptor to keep activating the G protein.  The formation of such mega-plexes explains how G proteins can continue to send signals after being internalized by GPCRs,  Lefkowitz said.  This opens a whole world of possibilities yet to be explored to manipulate this duality of signaling from outside and inside the cell for therapeutic benefit.  Co-lead author Thomsen said some previous studies showed that the cells respond differently when G protein signaling occurs from different cellular compartments.  As a result, pharmaceutical drugs developed in the future, if they are capable of regulating signaling at specific compartments, might be able to better treat certain diseases while having fewer side effects,  Thomsen said. He added that such research is in its infancy and clinical applications are years away.","Published: August 9, 2016"

They maintain proper protein function and, importantly, prevent the inappropriate accumulation of damaged proteins. For example, accumulation of damaged proteins such as beta amyloid, tau and synuclein are thought to be very important in the development of diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease. Aug. 1 in the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, a Health Science Center research team led by Rui Sousa, Ph.D., and Eileen M. Lafer, Ph.D., both professors of biochemistry in the School of Medicine, presented data that show how heat shock proteins break apart protein complexes. They found that when heat shock proteins with molecular weight 70 (Hsp70s) are recruited to protein complexes, rather than simply binding to these complexes, the Hsp70s collide with them and generate a force that dissolves the complexes.  No one knew how the heat shock proteins pull apart bad protein complexes,  Dr. Sousa said.  At the molecular level, everything is moving, colliding and bumping, and smashing into other components of the cells. We found that the system moves Hsp70s to where they are needed. Once this occurs, collision pressures pull things apart.  Model system Previous attempts to glean this information failed because the proteins studied were too heterogeneous of too many different sizes, shapes and actions to isolate the Hsp70 behavior. The UT Health Science Center team studied clathrin, a protein that is uniform in size and shape and is important in making intracellular cages that transport other proteins. Previously clathrin was only available from animal specimens, making it very difficult to manipulate experimentally. Dr. Lafer made a technical breakthrough when she was able to grow clathrin in bacteria for the first time using recombinant DNA technology. The clathrin could then be genetically engineered for mechanistic studies. Dr. Lafer grew clathrin  cages shaped like microscopic soccer balls that provided the biological raw material for Dr. Sousa and the team to study the force that occurs with Hsp70 collisions. The clathrin model system could be manipulated to yield precise results. A wrecking machine Dr. Sousa gave this analogy of the study: The heat shock protein is like a worker with an ax who, when moved to a wood pile, begins swinging. The wood pile represents a protein complex. The scientists give the worker both thick trees and thin trees to swing at, and spindly wood and hard wood. They change the angle of the wood pile, and every other variable, to learn how this affects the chopping. By making variants of clathrin with recombinant DNA technology, team members were able to manipulate this biological material in ways that allowed them to determine the mechanism by which it is taken apart by Hsp70.  This work was a tour de force, requiring the convergence of exceptional biochemical and molecular genetic skills with a deep understanding of the principles of physical chemistry,  said Bruce Nicholson, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Biochemistry at the Health Science Center.  Such insights into the most basic aspects of protein chemistry and cell biology are often, as in this case, driven by a curiosity to find out how the molecular machines that drive our bodies work. But from these basic pursuits of scientific curiosity will often stem great benefits to human health.  Hsp70 in disease Understanding Hsp70 behavior may have relevance to human disease. By increasing Hsp70 function, scientists cured Huntington s, a neurodegenerative disease, in a fly model. Cancer is another interesting focus. Tumors rely on Hsp70s to survive, so lowering Hsp70 function is a topic in cancer research.  This is an impressive study that not only improves our understanding of cellular biology, but could lead to therapeutic discoveries for neurodegenerative diseases,  said Francisco Gonz lez-Scarano, M.D., dean of the School of Medicine and executive vice president for medical affairs of the Health Science Center.  It is a tribute to scientists who ask hard questions and develop tools to answer them. My congratulations to the team.   We attacked this problem because it was a really important question in cellular biology,  Dr. Lafer said.  We didn t do it because we wanted to cure neurodegenerative disease or cancer. We know, however, that when we attack really important questions in science and biology, it ultimately leads to translational applications down the line.   Sometimes as a scientist you just increase understanding of the way the world works,  Dr. Sousa said.  This is something scientists have wanted to know. ","Published: August 9, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gene-mutation-helped-modern-humans-adapt-to-smoke-exposure-195536,Gene Mutation Helped Modern Humans Adapt to Smoke Exposure  A genetic mutation may have helped modern humans adapt to smoke exposure from fires and perhaps sparked an evolutionary advantage over their archaic competitors  including Neandertals  according to a team of researchers  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Modern humans are the only primates that carry this genetic mutation that potentially increased tolerance to toxic materials produced by fires for cooking, protection and heating, said Gary Perdew, the John T. and Paige S. Smith Professor in Agricultural Sciences, Penn State. At high concentrations, smoke-derived toxins can increase the risk of respiratory infections. For expectant mothers, exposure to these toxins can increase the chance of low birth weight and infant mortality. The mutation may have offered ancient humans a sweet spot in effectively processing some of these toxins -- such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- compared to other hominins. ""If you're breathing in smoke, you want to metabolize these hydrophobic compounds and get rid of them, however, you don't want to metabolize them so rapidly that it overloads your system and causes overt cellular toxicity,"" said Perdew. The researchers, who released their findings in the current issue of Molecular Biology and Evolution, suggest that a difference in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor -- which regulates the body's response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- between humans, Neandertals and other non-human primates may have made humans more desensitized to certain smoke toxins. The mutation in the receptor is located in the middle of the ligand-binding domain and is found in all present-day humans, Perdew added. Ligands are small molecules that attach to receptor proteins in certain areas in much the same way that keys fit into locks. ""For Neandertals, inhaling smoke and eating charcoal-broiled meat, they would be exposed to multiple sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to be carcinogens and lead to cell death at high concentrations,"" said Perdew. ""The evolutionary hypothesis is, if Neandertals were exposed to large amounts of these smoke-derived toxins, it could lead to respiratory problems, decreased reproductive capacity for women and increased susceptibility to respiratory viruses among preadolescents, while humans would exhibit decreased toxicity because they are more slowly metabolizing these compounds."" There is evidence that both humans and Neandertals used fire, according to George Perry, assistant professor of anthropology and biology, Penn State, who worked with Perdew. ""Our hominin ancestors -- they would technically not be called humans at that time -- were likely using fire at least a million years ago, and some infer an earlier control and use of fire approximately 2 million years ago,"" said Perry. Fire would have played an important role for both humans and Neandertals. ""Cooking with fire could have allowed our ancestors to incorporate a broader range of foods in our diets, for example, by softening roots and tubers that might otherwise have been hard to chew,"" Perry said. ""Cooking could also help increase the digestibility of other foods, both in chewing time and reduced energetic investment in digestion."" Fire also provided warmth, particularly in the higher latitudes, according to Perry. ""Besides heating and cooking, humans used -- and still use -- fire for landscape burning and as part of hunting and gathering, and now as part of agriculture,"" said Perry. The study may also lend support to a recent theory that the invention of cooking may have helped humans thrive, according to Perdew. He also suggested that the receptor might give humans a better tolerance for cigarette smoke, allowing people to smoke, but also putting them at risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. ""Our tolerance has allowed us to pick up bad habits,"" Perdew said. The researchers used computational and molecular techniques to examine the difference in the genetics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon tolerance between humans and Neandertals. They examined a genomic database of humans, Neandertals and a Denisovan, a hominin more closely related to Neandertals than humans. ""We thought the differences in aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand sensitivity would be about ten-fold, but when we looked at it closely, the differences turned out to be huge,"" said Perdew. ""Having this mutation made a dramatic difference. It was a hundred-fold to as much of a thousand-fold difference."" In contrast, the sensitivity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor for some endogenous -- produced in the body -- ligands is the same between human and Neandertal, which further illustrates that modern humans may have adapted to specific environmental toxin exposures through this critical mutation in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.","Published: August 9, 2016"

The study will be conducted as an investigator-sponsored study, as part of a strategic clinical research collaboration between MSD (known as Merck in the US and Canada) and MD Anderson Cancer Center aimed at evaluating Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA, in combination with various treatments and novel drugs. The open-label, single center, single-arm Phase 2 study aims to evaluate the potential of BL-8040 with KEYTRUDA in pancreatic cancer and will focus on the mechanism of action by which both drugs might synergize. In addition to assessing clinical response, the study will include multiple assessments to evaluate the biological anti-tumor effects induced by the combination. BioLineRx will supply BL-8040 for the study, which is expected to commence later this year. In June 2016, the Company announced the filing of the regulatory submissions required tocommence a separate Phase 2a study focusing on evaluating the clinical efficacy of BL-8040 in combination with KEYTRUDA, also for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. This trial, named the COMBAT study, will be conducted under a collaboration agreement between BioLineRx and MSD announced in January 2016. The study is expected to commence shortly after receipt of regulatory approval, anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. BL-8040, BioLineRx's lead oncology platform, is a CXCR4 antagonist that has been shown in several clinical trials to be a robust mobilizer of immune cells and to be effective at inducing direct tumor cell death. Additional findings in the field of immuno-oncology suggest that CXCR4 antagonists may be effective in inducing the infiltration of anti-tumor T cells into the tumor. Therefore, when combined with KEYTRUDA, which blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes, BL-8040 has the potential to enable activated T cells to better reach tumor cells in the fight against pancreatic cancer. ""We are very excited that MSD and MD Anderson Cancer Center selected BL-8040 to be tested under their collaboration.

See Also: New treatment for neuropathy? How cone snail venom minimizes pain ""The general thought has been that these cells are supposed to be beneficial in the nervous system under normal conditions"" said Long-Jun Wu, a professor of cell biology and neuroscience at Rutgers University. ""But, in fact, in those with this neuropathic pain these cells known as microglia, have proliferated and instead become toxic."" In new research, published in both Nature Communications and Cell Reports, Wu and his team discovered that chronic neuropathic pain caused by nerve damage as a result of an injury, surgery or a debilitating disease like diabetes or cancer could be greatly reduced in animals if the injury was treated targeting microglia within a few days. ""If we can catch that window within one to five days to inhibit microglia after nerve injury, we can partially reverse the development of chronic pain,"" said Wu. ""If we were able to deplete the microglia cells causing the condition before nerve injury occurs, we can permanently prevent it."" Neuropathy occurs when nerves are injured from trauma or disease and can also be the result of a surgical procedure. This type of pain, unlike physiological pain, persists even after the injured nerve has healed and is often resistant to pain relievers like acetaminophen and naproxen. While opiates are used to alleviate pain, they have side effects and are not always effective for neuropathic pain patients. In laboratory studies on mice, Wu and his colleagues used chemotherapy drugs to prohibit the microglia brain immune cells from proliferating, similar to the treatment used by oncologists to prevent cancer cells from multiplying. The results from Wu's laboratory showed that this chemotherapy drug reduced the amount of pain the mice experienced after the injury occurred. ""What needs to be done is prevent the microglia cells from multiplying in the first place,"" said Wu. ""It had been thought that these cells were beneficial in a normal brain, but our research discovered how these cells function under neuropathic pain condition and initiate the problem."" Although scientists have studied microglia cells in relationship to neuropathic pain for the past two decades, Rutgers is the first to pinpoint the exact role the cells have in the initiation and maintenance of the condition. Wu and his colleagues found that the proliferation of these types of cells is one of the major contributors of microglial pain. Learn More: Researchers identify a new cause of inherited neuropathyThis discovery could lead to the development of more effective painkillers with fewer side effects, he said.

By scanning the brains of children before and after they learned to read, the researchers found that they could predict the precise location where each child's visual word form area (VWFA) would develop, based on the connections of that region to other parts of the brain. See Also: Study sheds light on how words are represented in the brain Neuroscientists have long wondered why the brain has a region exclusively dedicated to reading a skill that is unique to humans and only developed about 5,400 years ago, which is not enough time for evolution to have reshaped the brain for that specific task. The new study suggests that the VWFA, located in an area that receives visual input, has pre-existing connections to brain regions associated with language processing, making it ideally suited to become devoted to reading. ""Long-range connections that allow this region to talk to other areas of the brain seem to drive function,"" says Zeynep Saygin, a postdoc at MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research. ""As far as we can tell, within this larger fusiform region of the brain, only the reading area has these particular sets of connections, and that's how it's distinguished from adjacent cortex."" Saygin is the lead author of the study, which is published in Nature Neuroscience. Nancy Kanwisher, the Walter A. Rosenblith Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a member of the McGovern Institute, is the paper's senior author. The brain's cortex, where most cognitive functions occur, has areas specialized for reading as well as face recognition, language comprehension, and many other tasks. Neuroscientists have hypothesized that the locations of these functions may be determined by prewired connections to other parts of the brain, but they have had few good opportunities to test this hypothesis. Don't Miss: After learning new words, brain sees them as picturesReading presents a unique opportunity to study this question because it is not learned right away, giving scientists a chance to examine the brain region that will become the VWFA before children know how to read. This region, located in the fusiform gyrus, at the base of the brain, is responsible for recognizing strings of letters. Children participating in the study were scanned twice at 5 years of age, before learning to read, and at 8 years, after they learned to read. In the scans at age 8, the researchers precisely defined the VWFA for each child by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity as the children read. They also used a technique called diffusion-weighted imaging to trace the connections between the VWFA and other parts of the brain. The researchers saw no indication from fMRI scans that the VWFA was responding to words at age 5. However, the region that would become the VWFA was already different from adjacent cortex in its connectivity patterns. These patterns were so distinctive that they could be used to accurately predict the precise location where each child's VWFA would later develop. Although the area that will become the VWFA does not respond preferentially to letters at age 5, Saygin says it is likely that the region is involved in some kind of high-level object recognition before it gets taken over for word recognition as a child learns to read. Still unknown is how and why the brain forms those connections early in life. Learn More: Concentrating on word sounds helps reading instruction and intervention The MIT team now plans to study whether this kind of brain imaging could help identify children who are at risk of developing dyslexia and other reading difficulties. ""It's really powerful to be able to predict functional development three years ahead of time,"" Saygin says. ""This could be a way to use neuroimaging to try to actually help individuals even before any problems occur."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

But health records of nearly 50,000 active-duty U.S. Army soldiers between 2011 and 2014 shows that s not the case, according to a study led by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine.   People who carry two copies of the sickle cell gene variant have sickle cell disease, which brings a drastically shortened life span of only 40 to 60 years, as well as lifelong bouts of intense pain. In contrast, those carrying just one copy of the gene variant have what s called sickle cell trait. Earlier studies have suggested that the health consequences of sickle cell trait might be dire, including higher mortality from a potentially fatal condition called exertional rhabdomyolysis. ER, which occurs when molecules from the breakdown of muscles end up in the kidneys, has been known to fell football players, often when they are practicing too hard in the hot sun without drinking enough water. (ER is distinct from heat exhaustion, however.) Likewise, ER is a risk for soldiers on active duty. Yet, in the first-ever longitudinal cohort study of sickle cell trait in African-American soldiers of all ages, researchers have found they suffered no increase in mortality. Lianne Kurina, PhD, and a team of medical researchers found that having sickle cell trait does not increase the risk of death. Case reports suggesting a connection between sickle cell trait and deaths of individual patients have dominated the medical literature, according to the new study. A paper published in 1987 reported a 2,800 percent increase in the risk of exertion-induced sudden deaths among African-American military recruits thought to have sickle cell trait. But the actual sickle cell status of every individual was not known. Despite relatively weak evidence, Kurina said, it s been assumed that sickle cell trait increases the risk of death, of exertional rhabdomyolysis and of heat stroke. This assumption has led to mandated screening by organizations such as the Air Force, the Navy and the NCAA. But the American Society for Hematology and other organizations have argued that screening programs raise questions about job discrimination. The Army typically screens only before combat deployment and high-altitude activities, the study said. For the study, the researchers reviewed the health records of 47,944 African-American soldiers who served on active duty between 2011 and 2014 and for whom sickle cell status was known. The researchers got the health records from the Stanford Military Data Repository data set, which Nelson and Kurina created. The repository includes all digitally recorded health encounters at military medical facilities or civilian institutions, general health information and official records of physical performance and mortality of all active-duty U.S. Army soldiers. The data in the repository are de-identified to protect privacy. Kurina and her colleagues found that the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis was only 54 percent higher among African-American soldiers with sickle cell trait than among those without it. A 54 percent increase might sound like a lot, but it s far less than the 300 percent increase caused by some ordinary prescription drugs. And smoking, obesity and increasing age each incur a heightened risk of ER that is about the same as sickle cell trait, the study showed. A major reason for the difference between the current study and previous ones, Kurina said, may be better safety for active-duty soldiers. As of 2003, soldiers who are engaged in strenuous exercise are required to drink plenty of fluids, build up to strenuous exercise gradually and take regular rests when it s hot. All of these measures are known to reduce exercise-related fatality rates, regardless of whether individuals have sickle cell trait, the study said.  Another critical difference between our study and the earlier, population-based studies is that in our study, we knew the sickle cell status of everyone in the population,  said Kurina. She and her team looked only at soldiers whose sickle cell status was confirmed by blood tests taken during their years of service, instead of from self-reported sickle cell status or past medical history, as had been done in the other studies.  The most important thing to come out of this study is the really reassuring news that under conditions of universal precautions against dehydration and overheating, we don t see an elevation in the risk of mortality in people with sickle cell trait,  said Kurina. It happens, she noted, that the lead author of the 1987 paper went on to propose and validate the measures adopted by the Army to mitigate dehydration and overheating. The study s results call into question the need to screen service members with sickle cell trait, especially with better safety precautions during intense exertion, Kurina said.","Published: August 8, 2016"

Their surprising results show that cancer drugs interact with the proteasome somewhat differently than previously thought, paving the way for the development of more effective cancer therapies. Malignant cancer cells not only grow and divide faster than healthy cells in our bodies, they also produce much more waste. This makes cancer cells more dependent on the cell s most important waste disposal units, large protein complexes known as proteasomes, which break-down defective proteins and remove them from circulation. Due to this dependence, treatments for some cancers, such as a type of bone marrow cancer known as multiple myeloma, are designed to specifically target the proteasome. Once the activity of the proteasome is blocked, the cancer cell becomes overwhelmed by the build-up in waste, and eventually dies. However, exactly how this mechanism works is not fully understood. Now, a team of researchers from EMBL in Hamburg and the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G ttingen, have succeeded in solving the 3D atomic structure of the proteasome in unprecedented detail. The results, published in Science, reveal just how cancer drugs block the activity of the proteasome, and pave the way for the development of more effective proteasome inhibitors for cancer therapy. In order to study the 3D atomic structure of the proteasome, the scientists first had to produce protein crystals of the large protein complex. But such large molecules are notoriously difficult to crystallise. So first an optimised production pipeline was established which enabled the scientists to produce large amounts of protein and crystals before moving for analysis to the EMBL crystallography beamlines on the DESY campus in Hamburg. At the beamline, powerful X-rays are shone at the crystals, creating distinctive patterns as the X-rays bounce off the atoms in the molecule, determining their exact position. As a result of the careful preparation, cutting-edge equipment available to the scientists at the beamline, and the high quality X-ray light source, the scientists were able to reveal a structure of unprecedented detail, down to the position of single atoms. In addition to solving the structure of the proteasome by itself, the group were also able to resolve the structure of the molecule bound together with four different inhibitor drugs, either already in use in the clinic, or currently in clinical trials.  The substantial improvement in resolution compared to previous research has allowed us to establish the exact chemical mechanism by which inhibitors block the proteasome. This knowledge makes it possible to optimise inhibitor design and efficacy   since only inhibitors tailored to the proteasome shut it down completely,  says Ashwin Chari, project group leader from the Department of Structural Dynamics headed by Holger Stark at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. Importantly, their findings revealed a surprising detail in the way the inhibitor drugs bind to the proteasome, and it s not as scientists previously thought. The results show that in contrast to previous assumptions, a 7-ring structure including a methylene group form at the interface where the proteasome and inhibitor bind.  Even though a methylene group just comprises one carbon atom and its two associated protons amidst the more than 50,000 atoms of the proteasome, it decisively influences which chemical features make the inhibitor most effective in blocking the proteasome,  says Thomas Schneider, who leads the group at EMBL.  This has to be taken into account when developing new inhibitors and searching for new drug candidates,  adds Stark. The researchers have already filed a patent application for the chemical procedure to design such inhibitors.  Clinical applications are always preceded by knowledge about targets   therefore, the details, where every atom counts, make all the difference,  EMBL beamline scientist Gleb Bourenkov concludes.","Published: August 8, 2016"

""Seeing galectin-3 interact with GAGs and proteoglycans is like finding a rose in the petunias it's very unexpected,"" says Tarun Dam, who led the study. ""It's fair to say that this requires revisiting the reported biological functions of GAGs, proteoglycans and galectin-3."" Glycobiology focuses on sugar-coated proteins and the proteins that bind to them. They drive many biological processes in our bodies, from directing white blood cells to infected tissues to serving as biomarkers in cancer assays. For decades, researchers have assumed that two groups of these sugar-seeking proteins lectins and GAGBPs (GAG binding proteins) lived similar, but notably separate lives. ""Some proteins are multitaskers, most notably galectin-3, and our bodies' biochemical pathways do not play out in simple, linear processes,"" Dam says, adding that he and his lab were still surprised to observe a lectin, galectin-3, interacting with proteoglycans and GAGs. ""We triple-checked and quadruple-checked this data, and we found consistency in experiment after experiment."" Dam and his team started out with a conventional method called a hemagglutination inhibition assay to determine if galectin-3 recognized GAGs and proteoglycans. Then they used a technique called isothermal titration calorimetry to precisely observe the carbohydrate-binding properties of galectin-3, which verified that the lectin and GAGs could interact. Dam says his lab's work in outlining this unexpected protein interaction is just the beginning and suggests that the known biological processes involving GAGs, proteoglycans and galectin-3 may not be as straightforward as they appear. Now that glycobiologists know that galectin-3 and GAGs can interact, the entire community will need to figure what that means for the many biochemical reactions driven by these sugar-loving proteins and their binding partners. One example is cancer treatments.  GAGs are well known for their role in controlling growth factor proteins, which tend to run rampant as cancerous tumors grow. GAGs and proteoglycans are also involved in metastasizing cancer cells that spread and sprout by traveling and breaking out of the bloodstream. Galectin-3 could be interfering with this process or even amplifying it. It could also be affecting pharmaceuticals that target GAGBPs.   In addition to cancer research, galectin-3 and GAGBP are known to individually push biochemical processes affecting the immune system and nervous system. Dam compares this new line of research to storytelling, complete with expectation-meeting heroes; with the plot twist, it's like a masked character has been revealed and it's someone the readers already knew. ""Now we have to reconsider the whole drama, retracing the steps and actions of that character,"" he says. ""In our next steps, we are using cell lines and animal models to study this interaction in a cellular context."" Dam and his team's initial observation is unexpected, but opens up new possibilities for the role of galectin-3. A better understanding of the glycobiology and biomechanics will enhance many health research fields, perhaps leading to more nuanced treatments for cancer, immunodeficiency, neural growth and inflammation.","Published: August 8, 2016"

The p53 tumour suppressor protein is best known for its capacity to bind DNA and control gene expression at the level of transcription. Mutations that abolish the DNA binding activity are frequently found in human cancers. However, it has been known that p53 also harbours RNA binding capacity but this capacity and its cell biological role has been vastly overshadowed by its DNA-binding activity. Together with his collaborators, Robin F hraeus, guest professor at the Department of Medical Biosciences at Ume  University and Research Director at Inserm in France, could show that p53 suppresses the synthesis of its negative regulator MDMX via a direct interaction between p53 and the MDMX mRNA. The researchers also show that RNA binding per se is not sufficient to suppress MDMX synthesis and that an additional trans-suppressor domain of p53 is also required. A classic p53 mutation that prevents DNA binding was shown to have differentiated activity towards MDMX synthesis.  We found mutant p53 proteins that do not bind DNA instead have an effect towards mRNA translation,  says Robin F hraeus, who led the study.  It has been known that mutant p53s can promote tumour growth but it is not clear what lies behind this activity and RNA binding offers one possibility. ","Published: August 8, 2016"

But obstacles still stand in the way of engineering these malleable cells to self-renew or expand. One of those obstacles is an incomplete picture of how cells interact with their environment.  Cells do not simply reside within a material, they actively reengineer it  says Kelly Schultz,  Characterizing how cells behave in 3D synthetic material is critical to advancing the design of biomaterials used in wound healing, tissue engineering and stem cell expansion.  Schultz recently received a three-year grant from National Institutes of Health to study how cells remodel their microenvironment   a crucial step toward engineering cells to move through synthetic material and tissue more quickly for faster wound healing and tissue regeneration. Schultz will build on previous work in which she and her colleagues revealed that during attachment, spreading and motility, cells degrade material in the pericellular region directly around the cell in an entirely different manner than researchers had previously believed. Before Schultz s earlier study, scientists believed cells moved through material while simultaneously degrading it   like Pac Man gobbling up dots while moving through a video game maze. Utilizing microrheology, a technique that measures the properties and states of matter, Schultz and her colleagues made a discovery that overturned this notion. After encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells in a hydrogel, the team measured dynamic interactions between the cells as they moved through material. They made an unexpected observation: the cells pause before moving. They discovered that from a stationary position, Point A, a given cell secretes an enzyme. They hypothesize that the enzyme is bound with an inhibitor that temporarily stops the enzyme from degrading the material while it s being sent to Point B. Starting at Point B, the enzyme begins to  gobble up  the material that surrounds the cell. Only then does the cell move on to its next location. The inhibitor, the team observed, prevents the enzyme from degrading the material while the cell is secreting it. Armed with this information, Schultz and her team now aim to  inhibit the inhibitor.  That is, they seek to identify which inhibitor, or combination of inhibitors, is responsible for stopping the enzyme from degrading the material while it s being secreted. Once identified, the researchers hope to  tune  the inhibitor to shut off during secretion so that the cell will move through and degrade the material faster. Engineering the cell to move faster is important for wound healing, Schultz says. The sooner the cells arrive at the wound site, the sooner they can start to regenerate the tissue.  Our goal is to prevent the cell from stalling, encouraging it to become active right away and arrive at the wound site at twice the speed,  said Schultz. With broad implications for biomaterial design, Schultz s project will focus on a range of tissues, from adipose to bone, to measure how changing the physical environment might alter the strategies cells use to degrade the material. She works with mesenchymal stem cells   a type of adult stem cell that has the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types. Hydrogel offers two advantages. First, it mimics tissue well, providing an ideal physical environment to characterize cell behavior in 3D. Hydrogels are more than 90 percent water, are very porous and can be  tuned  to change properties to mimic anything from bone to fat. Second, once the hydrogel is implanted in a human, it can be used as a scaffold to restructure a wound of a size that the body cannot heal.  For example, if a patient is missing a piece of bone that is too large to heal   or regenerate   on its own, a hydrogel structure can be implanted,  said Schultz.  Inside the structure are stem cells that have been given an environment that would push them down a lineage into bone cells. Once implanted the stem cells reproduce themselves,  filling in  the part of the bone that is missing. While the bone is growing outside the implant, new tissue is growing on the inside   speeding healing. As the bone regenerates, the implant disintegrates.  To make the hydrogel structures, Schultz mixes polymers, peptides, stem cells and microparticles. The microparticles enable the material properties of the hydrogel to be measured during cell-mediated degradation.  We take videos of the microparticles and observe their movement,  said Schultz.  The amount they wiggle reveals their properties and enables us to see spatially what s occurring. That is how we characterized the unexpected degradation profile.  The recording process described above is known as multiple particle tracking microrheology. This same method will be used to identify the role of inhibitors. Cells secrete four different enzyme inhibitors, called tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The researchers will inhibit each to discover which one is responsible for stopping the material degradation, or if it is a combination of them. Schultz and her collaborators will also mimic diverse tissue types in order to observe how the inhibitors might change depending on the material. Schultz s studies will focus on the remodeling of synthetic scaffolds by human mesenchymal stem cells. The techniques and strategies she and her team develop are expected to contribute to the understanding of cell-material interactions and to identify how these interactions can be exploited to manipulate cellular behavior for 3D cell culture platforms and tissue regeneration applications.","Published: August 8, 2016"

The findings could impact efforts to produce specific types of cells for future therapies to treat a broad range of diseases, as well as aid the understanding of which cells are affected by drugs that influence cell specialization.  We found that the stem cell-specific protein OCT4 primes certain genes that, when activated, cause the cell to differentiate, or become more specialized,  said Laszlo Nagy, M.D., Ph.D., professor and director of the Genomic Control of Metabolism Program at SBP s Lake Nona campus and senior author of the study.  This priming customizes stem cells  responses to signals that induce differentiation and makes the underlying genetic process more efficient.  Differentiation matters As an organism such as a human develops from its simplest, earliest form into maturity, its cells transition from a highly flexible state stem cells to more specialized types that make up its tissues. Many labs are trying to recapitulate this process to generate specific types of cells that could be transplanted into patients to treat disease. For example, pancreatic beta cells could treat diabetes, and neurons that produce dopamine could treat Parkinson s. What OCT4 does OCT4 is a transcription factor a protein that regulates gene activity that maintains stem cells  ability to give rise to any tissue in the body. OCT4 works by sitting on DNA and recruiting factors that either help initiate or repress the reading of specific genes. The new study shows that, at certain genes, OCT4 also collaborates with transcription factors that are activated by external signals, such as the retinoic acid (vitamin A) receptor (RAR) and beta-catenin, to turn on their respective genes. Vitamin A converts stem cells to neuronal precursors, and activation of beta-catenin by Wnt can either support pluripotency or promote non-neural differentiation, depending on what other signals are present. Recruitment of these factors  primes  a subset of the genes that the signal-responsive factors can activate. The big picture  Our findings suggest a general principle for how the same differentiation signal induces distinct transitions in various types of cells,  added Nagy.  Whereas in stem cells, OCT4 recruits the RAR to neuronal genes, in bone marrow cells, another transcription factor would recruit RAR to genes for the granulocyte program. Which factors determine the effects of differentiation signals in bone marrow cells and other cell types remains to be determined.  Next steps  In a sense, we ve found the code for stem cells that links the input signals like vitamin A and Wnt to the output cell type,  said Nagy.  Now we plan to explore whether other transcription factors behave similarly to OCT4 that is, to find the code in more mature cell types.  If other factors also have this dual function both maintaining the current state and priming certain genes to respond to external signals that would answer a key question in developmental biology and advance the field of stem cell research.

The study was published in the August edition of the journal Brain.            The Alzheimer s Association estimates that if we had a prevention that merely pushed back the clinical symptoms of the disease by five years, it would almost cut in half the number of people projected to develop dementia,  says Annie Racine, a doctoral candidate and the study s lead author.  That translates into millions of lives and billions of dollars saved.            Dr. Sterling Johnson, the study s senior author, says that while brain changes   such as the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and tangles of another substance called tau   are markers of the disease, not everyone with these brain changes develops Alzheimer s symptoms.          Until now, we haven t had a great way to use the biomarkers to predict who was going to develop clinical symptoms of the disease,  Johnson says.  Although the new algorithm isn t perfect, now we can say with greater certainty who is at increased risk and more likely to decline.  The research team recruited 175 older adults at risk for Alzheimer s disease, and used statistical algorithms to categorize them into four clusters based on different patterns and profiles of pathology in their brains. Then, the researchers analyzed cognitive data from the participants to investigate whether these cluster groups differed on their cognitive abilities measured over as many as 10 years.   As it turns out, the biomarker panels were predictive of cognitive decline over time. One cluster in particular stood out. The group that had a biomarker profile consistent with Alzheimer s   abnormal levels of tau and beta-amyloid in their cerebrospinal fluid   showed the steepest decline on cognitive tests of memory and language over the 10 years of testing. About two-thirds of the 22 people sorted into this group were also positive for the APOE4 gene the greatest known risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer s disease compared with about one-third in the other clusters.   At the other end of the spectrum, the largest group, 76 people, were sorted into a cluster that appears to be made up of healthy aging individuals. They showed normal levels on the five biomarkers and did not decline cognitively over time. In between, there were two clusters that weren t classified as Alzheimer s but who don t seem to be aging normally either. A group of 32 people showed signs of mixed Alzheimer s and vascular dementia. They had some of the amyloid changes in their cerebrospinal fluid, but also showed lesions in their brains  white matter, which indicate scarring from small ischemic lesions which can be thought of as minor silent strokes. The other cluster of 45 people had signs of brain atrophy, with brain imaging showing that the hippocampus, the brain s memory center, was significantly smaller than the other groups. The authors speculate this group could have intrinsic brain vulnerability or could be affected by some other process that differentiates them from healthy aging.  Both the in-between clusters showed non-specific decline on a test of global cognitive functioning, which further differentiates them from the healthy aging cluster. The study participants came from a group of more than 1,800 people enrolled in two studies   the Wisconsin Alzheimer s Disease Research Center (WADRC) study and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer s Prevention (WRAP). Both groups are enriched for people at risk for getting Alzheimer s because about   of participants have a parent with the disease.  This study shows that just having a family history doesn t mean you are going to get this disease,  Johnson says.  Some of the people in our studies are on a trajectory for Alzheimer s, but more of them are aging normally, and some are on track to have a different type of brain disease.  A comprehensive panel of biomarkers   such as the one evaluated in this study   could help to predict those variable paths, paving the way for early interventions to stop or slow the disease.","Published: August 8, 2016"

For example, human tumor cells are routinely grown in mice to study cancer disease processes and to evaluate potential treatment strategies. To advance regenerative medicine, it is common practice to validate the potency of pluripotent human cells   which can become any tissue in the body   through introducing them into rodents. With recent advances in stem cell and gene editing technologies, an increasing number of researchers are interested in growing human tissues and organs in animals by introducing pluripotent human cells into early animal embryos. Formation of these types of human-animal organism, referred to as  chimeras , holds tremendous potential for disease modeling, drug testing, and perhaps eventual organ transplant. However, uncertainty about the effects of human cells on off-target organs and tissues in the chimeric animals, particularly in the nervous system, raises ethical and animal welfare concerns. Currently, the 2009 NIH Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research specifically prohibit introducing human pluripotent cells into nonhuman primate blastocysts and the breeding of animals into which human pluripotent cells may have contributed to the germ line (egg or sperm cells).  Given the direction of the science, however, NIH felt that it was an appropriate time to consider whether further policy provisions regarding other chimera models were needed before making funding decisions. Therefore, as I wrote about last fall, NIH instituted a funding moratorium in September 2015 (NOT-OD-15-158) for research proposing to introduce human pluripotent cells into animal embryos prior to gastrulation stage the beginning of development of the three germ layers. Since the moratorium was issued, NIH has reviewed the state of the science and also convened a workshop in November 2015 to bring together leading experts in the field of chimera research and animal welfare.  Today, NIH has published in the Federal Register and the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts a proposal to make two changes to our policy in this area, for which we are seeking public comment (a table summarizing the proposed changes also appears at the end of the blog to assist stakeholders.) First, NIH is establishing an internal NIH steering committee to provide programmatic input to NIH Institute and Center Directors in making funding decisions for two areas of research in which: 1. human pluripotent cells are introduced into non-human vertebrate embryos, up through the end of gastrulation stage, with the exception of non-human primates, which would only be considered after the blastocyst stage, or 2. human cells are introduced into post-gastrulation non-human mammals (excluding rodents), where there could be either a substantial contribution or a substantial functional modification to the animal brain by the human cells. NIH is seeking public comment on the proposed scope of the chimera research to be considered by the NIH steering committee. The committee will focus on the experimental design and likely nature of the chimeric animal model. The committee s work will be independent of the peer review process. This committee will also monitor new developments in this field and provide analysis and advice to NIH leadership as needed. NIH is also seeking comment on modifications to the NIH Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research, where we propose to slightly expand the current prohibition on the introduction of human pluripotent cells into non-human primate embryos to include the preblastocyst stage, and to clarify that NIH will not fund research involving the breeding of animals where the introduction of any type of human cell may result in human egg or sperm development. These actions are consistent with recently updated guidelines from the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), which suggest that a specialized review of certain types of chimera research is appropriate. The ISSCR guidelines also contain useful suggestions of best practices for experimental design, which I encourage the research community to consider.  I am confident that these proposed changes will enable the NIH research community to move this promising area of science forward in a responsible manner. I encourage those interested in this field to provide comments on these proposals referred to in the related links. While NIH awaits public comment, the moratorium on NIH funding for such research (NOT-OD-15-158) will remain in effect.","Published: August 8, 2016"

However, the exact molecular mechanisms underpinning sepsis and its progression are unclear.  Now, Professor Masahiro Nishibori and co-workers at Okayama University, Shujitsu University and Kinki University, Japan, have shown that a naturally-occurring protein called histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) plays a significant role in the prevention of sepsis. They found that HRG controls the shape and activity of white blood cells called neutrophils, enabling them to flow freely and respond correctly in the fight against sepsis. Nishibori s team aimed to verify the role of HRG   a protein produced and secreted by the liver - because HRG levels decrease rapidly in patients when sepsis takes hold. HRG is known to be involved in the regulation of immune responses, as well as prompting antibacterial and antifungal activity. The team induced sepsis in one group of mice, keeping a healthy group as controls. They purified HRG from human blood plasma, and treated some of the septic mice with a dose of the protein. The researchers found that the HRG mice quickly regained locomotor activity, and began to recover from sepsis. Further investigations showed that the mice exhibited far less inflammation in the lungs than their non-treated counterparts. Neutrophils in the HRG mice were smooth and spherical in shape, allowing them to flow freely through microcapillaries and veins. The septic mice, however, had deformed neutrophils with irregular shapes. This in turn triggered unwanted activity because the deformed neutrophils became attached to other cells, creating cell clusters that limited blood flow.  The decrease in plasma HRG constitutes the fundamental pathway for septic pathogenesis,  state the authors in their paper published in eBioMedicine (2016).  Supplementary therapy with HRG may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of septic patients.  ","Published: August 8, 2016"

Now, using that innate reflex as inspiration, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers have developed a noninvasive way to treat potentially harmful breathing problems in babies who were born prematurely. The technique uses a simple device that tricks babies' brains into thinking they are running, which prompts them to breathe. See Also: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth Each year, about 150,000 babies are born after only 23 to 34 weeks of gestation, which puts them at risk for apnea of prematurity, a condition in which breathing stops, often for several seconds, accompanied by severe falls in oxygenation. The condition occurs because in infants whose systems not yet fully formed the respiratory system ignores or cannot use the body's signals to breathe. Compounding the danger, premature newborns' lungs are not fully developed, and therefore do not have much oxygen in reserve. When breathing stops in these periods of apnea, the level of oxygen in the body goes down, and the heart rate can drop. That combination can damage the lungs and eyes, injure the nerves to the heart, affect the hormonal system (which can lead to diabetes later in life), or injure the brain (which can result in behavioral problems later in life). Hospitals use a range of approaches to minimize the duration of premature babies' breathing pauses placing them on their stomach, forcing air into the lungs with a facemask and giving caffeine to stimulate the brain but none is perfect and each carries other risks. According to Dr. Ronald Harper, a distinguished professor of neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, even newborns have the innate mechanism that triggers increased breathing. ""When our feet hit the ground running, we flex muscles and joints that have nerve fibers leading to the brain which signal that the body is running,"" he said. ""This message is coupled with another set of fibers to parts of the brain that regulate breathing and sends a signal that those parts need to increase breathing. Fortunately, that coupling exists even in extremely young infants."" The idea to use an external breathing device to treat apnea of prematurity arose over a cup of coffee between Harper and Dr. Kalpashri Kesavan, a neonatologist at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, when the conversation turned to how a baby's breathing could be supported if the brain was told the baby was running or walking. Learn More: Study finds four factors predict neurodevelopmental outcomes for children with low birth weight Harper's lab, which focuses on brain mechanisms that drive breathing during sleep, had already developed a device that he had intended to test for treating people with breathing problems. The device is a pager-sized box with wires that connect to small disks which are placed on the skin over the joints of the feet and hands. (Placing them on the hands is another nod to how the human body evolved: Early humans ran on all fours, so nerves in the hands are still involved in signaling the brain that the body is running.) Once the battery-powered machine is turned on, the disks gently vibrate, which triggers nerve fibers to alert the brain that the limb is moving. ""We thought that if this reflex were going to work for any kind of sleep disorder with breathing problems, then premature infants would be the No. 1 target, because breathing stoppages are so common and have the potential to do so much injury,"" Kesavan said. ""It's almost like it was naturally made for them."" The researchers tested the device on 15 premature infants who were born after 23 to 34 weeks of gestation, and who were experiencing breathing pauses and low oxygen. The disks were placed on one hand and one foot, and the device was turned on for six hours at a time, followed by six hours off, for a total of 24 hours. The scientists compared the babies' vital signs during the periods when the device was on with the times when it was off. They found that when it was on, the number of incidents when babies' oxygen levels were low was reduced by 33 percent and the number of breathing pauses was 40 percent lower than when it was off. The device also reduced low-heart-rate episodes by 65 percent, which is especially significant because slow heart rate can impair the flow of blood to vital tissues. The findings are published online in the journal PLOS ONE. The researchers now plan to study the approach on a larger number of patients and over a longer period of time. They'll also study the effects of the device on blood pressure and other cardio-respiratory measures, as well as its impact on sleep quality. Breathing stoppages typically wake infants, and reducing the number of pauses in their breathing should lead to less disturbed sleep. While most premature babies eventually grow out of their breathing problems, it can take weeks to months before their respiratory systems develop sufficiently to allow them to breathe on their own at all times. Don't Miss: EPO: Protecting brains of very preterm infants ""Long-term use of the device could decrease breathing pauses, maintain normal oxygen levels, stabilize the cardiovascular system and help improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants,"" Kesavan said. ""We may be able to bring about this change with something that is noninvasive, drug-free and has no side effects, and there is nothing better than that."" Harper is also testing the device on adolescents who suffer breathing problems due to spinal cord injuries and adults with sleep-disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea.

This protein, called CRYPTOCHROME, has proven anti-inflammatory effects in cultured cells and presents new opportunities for the development of drugs that may be used to treat inflammatory diseases and conditions, such as arthritis. See Also: Inflammation attacks brain's reward center ""By understanding how the biological clock regulates inflammation, we can begin to develop new treatments, which might exploit this knowledge,"" said Julie Gibbs, PhD, a researcher involved in the work and arthritis research UK career development fellow at the Centre for Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Institute of Human Development at the University of Manchester, United Kingdom. ""Furthermore, by adapting the time of day at which current drug therapies are administered, we may be able to make them more effective."" To make this discovery, Gibbs and colleagues harvested cells from joint tissue of healthy mice and/or humans. These cells, called fibroblast-like synoviocytes, are important in the pathology that underlies inflammatory arthritis. Each of these cells keeps a 24-hour rhythm, and when this rhythm was disrupted by knocking out the cryptochrome gene there was an increased inflammatory response. This suggests that the cryptochrome gene product, the CRYPTOCHROME protein, has significant anti-inflammatory effects. To test this hypothesis, researchers administered drugs designed to activate the protein to determine if protection against inflammation could be achieved and it was.

By comparing the genomes of rats that drank compulsively with those that abstained, Purdue and Indiana University researchers identified 930 genes associated with alcoholism, indicating that it is a highly complex trait on par with human height influenced by many genes and the environment. See Also: The genetics of alcoholism The study confirmed genes previously identified as being linked to alcoholism and uncovered new genes and neurological pathways, some of which could be promising targets for treatment. But the sheer number of genes that contribute to the trait suggests pharmaceutical treatments for alcoholism could be difficult to develop, said William Muir, professor of genetics. ""It's not one gene, one problem,"" he said. ""This trait is controlled by vast numbers of genes and networks. This probably dashes water on the idea of treating alcoholism with a single pill."" One of the best predictors of alcoholism in humans is the drinking behavior of their families. But to what extent this link can be chalked up to inherited genetics versus a shared environment has been poorly understood and a challenge to study: Parsing out the influence of genetics on drinking habits from other factors such as stress, boredom or peers who drink is not possible in humans. ""It's very difficult to tease out the difference between what your genes are telling you to do and what you choose to do,"" Muir said. To gain insights into genes that contribute to alcoholism, Muir and Feng Zhou, a professor of neuroscience at Indiana University School of Medicine, used a model based on rats, mammals with which we share a majority of genes. Beginning with a population of genetically diverse rats, researchers at the Indiana Alcohol Research Center bred two lines: one group that displayed classic clinical signs of alcoholism and another that completely abstained from alcohol. Read next: Alcohol exposure during pregnancy affects multiple generationsBreeding rats to drink was no small challenge and required several decades, Muir said. Like most animals, rats tend to have a natural aversion to drinking a high concentration of alcohol. ""But typical of any genetic study, there's always an outlier - in this case, a rat that will drink large amounts,"" he said. Choosing and breeding the rare rats that would take a tipple of pure grain alcohol eventually yielded a line of rats that compulsively drank to excess, preferred alcohol to water, drank to maintain intoxication, performed tasks to receive alcohol and showed signs of withdrawal if alcohol was absent. Still, rats responded to intoxication in individualized ways, Zhou said. ""Under the influence of alcohol, some rats became docile and fell asleep in a corner while others became aggressive,"" he said. The researchers sequenced and compared entire genomes from 10 rats in each line to determine genetic characteristics of drinking and abstaining. They also repeated the experiment with two additional lines of alcohol-seeking and teetotaler rats to discern which gene alterations were the result of natural selection and which were random genetic crosses. The results highlighted 930 genes associated with excessive drinking behavior, the vast majority of which are in genetic regulatory regions, not coding regions, as many researchers previously expected. Muir compared coding regions to a car and regulatory regions to the gas and brake pedals that determine the car's speed. ""We all have the genes for alcoholism, but our genetic abilities to control it differ,"" he said. While the researchers stressed that the genetic complexity of alcoholism complicates potential treatments, they pinpointed the glutamate receptor signaling pathway which can control a sense of reward in the brain might be a possible target for treatments due to the number of alcoholism-associated genes it contains. Learn More: Link between genetic variation and alcohol dependence found One of the next steps in the research is to verify that the genes identified in alcoholic rats are relevant to human alcoholism. Though the study shows there is a large genetic component to alcoholism, environment still plays a crucial role in shaping people's drinking habits, the researchers said. ""Even with the same genetics, one person might be prone to getting drunk while another doesn't drink at all,"" Zhou said. ""Your environment can trigger the expression of genetic tendencies toward alcoholism."" Or, as Muir put it, ""You can't just blame your drinking on your parents.""

But new discoveries reported by an international team of scientists may help explain what happens in the developing brains of babies still in the womb, causing them to be born with small brains and heads. See Also: Special fats proven essential for brain growthThe findings may also help scientists who are frantically trying to figure out why the Zika virus causes the same issue in some babies born to mothers who catch the virus from a mosquito bite. In two new papers in the American Journal of Human Genetics, the researchers report new findings about a key protein involved in the process that generates the many new cells required to build a normal size brain. Though the new studies didn't involve Zika-related microcephaly, they may provide clues that other scientists can use to investigate how Zika virus disrupts brain development. Stephanie Bielas, PhD, a University of Michigan Medical School assistant professor of human genetics who helped lead the new research, says the findings also provide insight into what is required for brains to develop normally. ""There's so much we don't understand about human brain development that we're just starting to uncover,"" she says. ""This shows the devastating impact of interrupting cell biology critical for this process."" Both of the new papers focus on the role of citron kinase, a protein important during the process of mitosis, where one cell divides to make two cells. Cell division is the foundation of normal growth and development. CIT, as the protein is called for short, helps in the final stages of cell division that separates the two ""daughter"" cells, called cytokinesis. That's when the two new cells, each with their own copy of the DNA from the original ""parent"" cell, sever the connections between them. Learn More: Why neural stem cells may be vulnerable to Zika infectionYears ago, research in animals showed that problems with the gene that contains the instructions for making the animal form of citron kinase could lead to microcephaly. But until now, that link hadn't been proven in humans. The researchers now say that CIT is critical to building a normally sized human brain. To make this discovery, the researchers turned to families from Egypt, France and Turkey that had one or more microcephalic babies. Some of them died soon after birth, the others developed intellectual disabilities that result from having a too-small brain. Studying these babies' genes and brain tissue gave clues to the importance of CIT, and the problems that arise when the CIT gene is mutated. Where normal brain cells have only one nucleus - the pouch containing the DNA and other important structures - many cells in microcephalic brain tissue had multiple nuclei. This suggested that something had happened to prevent new cells from dividing properly. Another tool helped the researchers take the study even further: stem cells. With the parents' permission, they obtained skin cells from the surviving children and used relatively new techniques to transform them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This essentially turns back the clock on the cells, making them able to develop into nearly any type of cell. The researchers then grew the iPSCs under special conditions that coaxed them to develop into neural progenitor cells - the kind of cells that in a developing embryo grow and divide rapidly to become the future child's brain. ""There's a lot of evidence now that in microcephaly, there aren't sufficient numbers of neural progenitor cells to build the normal-size brain,"" says Bielas. ""Since the cells that form the structures of the brain, and develop into the different types of cells are born from this pool of actively dividing cells. This aspect of human brain development is a key issue to study."" Bielas points out that studying rare spontaneous cases of microcephaly such as those in the families that took part in the study offers a chance to identify genes important for brain development and understand the impact of deleterious small genetic mutations. ""Often in genetics, we identify seemingly obscure genes as the genetic basis of disorders; we don't know what they do or where and when they're active,"" she notes. ""But in the case of citron kinase, we knew what a mutation in the gene did in animal models. These newly published findings confirm that CIT mutations are not only linked to severe microcephaly in humans, but are also associated with a smooth, unfolded brain surface - a condition known as lissencephaly - that isn't usually seen in brain disorders linked primarily to defects in neural progenitor cell mitosis."" Related: Slow stem cell division may cause small brains Bielas and her colleagues are now growing brain ""organoids"" balls of brain tissue grown from iPSCs or human embryonic stem cells with edited genes to study this issue further. The hope is that by studying microcephaly's origins in human cells that mimic the developing brain, they can see what might be going on more clearly in human brain development that wouldn't be detected in animal models. Some Zika researchers are also using this promising model system to study the virus's effect on human neural progenitor cells. Bielas is also seeking more families whose babies have been born with non-Zika microcephaly, to contribute skin and DNA samples that may yield even more clues about the condition's origins. ""We need to know how microcephaly genes are contributing to such a profound human disorder,"" says Bielas. ""It's a puzzle. So let's figure it out.""

Published in Nature Genetics the researchers also found the first clear evidence of genetic differences between two forms of the disease, and that one form can be traced back to healthy parents. To help them understand the genetic causes of heart disease, researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and their international collaborators sequenced and analysed the protein-coding segments of the genome - known as the exome - of 1,900 CHD patients and their parents. CHD is one of the most common developmental defects, occurring in 1 per cent of the population world-wide and affecting 1.35 million new-borns with CHD every year. It causes problems like holes in the heart, which in severe cases can require corrective surgery. Heart disease can cause life-long disability and is the largest cause of infant mortality in the western world after infectious disease. Most CHD patients   around 90 per cent - have only isolated defects of the heart, and are called non-syndromic. The remaining 10 per cent of patients are described as syndromic CHD patients who have additional developmental problems such as abnormalities in other organs or an intellectual disability. It had previously been thought that both of these forms of the disease might be caused by spontaneous new mutations which are present in the child and absent in the parents. The study confirmed that the rarer syndromic CHD patients often had spontaneous new mutations likely to interfere with normal heart development that were not seen in the parents. However, it also showed that non-syndromic CHD patients did not have such spontaneous mutations, and for the first time conclusively showed that they often inherited damaging gene variants from their seemingly healthy parents. Parents who have a child with CHD often want to find out how likely it is that any future children will be affected. While even larger studies are needed to pinpoint the exact combination of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to heart disease, understanding these factors could one day help doctors advise parents more accurately about their chances of having a second child with the disease. Studying these new mutation events across the genome, the researchers also found three new genes in which mutations can cause rare syndromic CHD disorders. This could help further studies identify biological mechanisms important for normal development of the embryo.  We are aiming to understand the genetics of the development of the human heart. This is the first study to quantify the role that rare inherited variants play in non-syndromic CHD, and is extremely valuable as these patients make up 90 per cent of CHD patients worldwide. We are trying to find the subset of genes with the highest risk of causing non-syndromic CHD.   As these are rare disorders this has meant sharing data globally so we can properly investigate the genetic origins of this disease   the families that shared these data and chose to be involved in this study have helped push forward understanding of these disorders.   Here, research has shown for the first time that congenital heart defects are often a question of genetic inheritance. In the future, as a direct result of this research, doctors may be able to offer much clearer advice to families where one member has congenital heart disease.   Previous smaller scale studies have hinted at the possibility that non-syndromic CHD could be caused by inherited gene variants, but this is the first time that we have been able to show it with statistical evidence. This was only possible due to the global collaboration of centres in the UK, Germany, Belgium, Canada, the United States of America and Saudi Arabia integrating data from many clinicians on a large number of families. We now know that some of the causative factors of the disease are inherited from their healthy parents, which will be extremely helpful for designing future studies of non-syndromic CHD, helping to understand what causes the disease.

Deleting individual genes in this way provides valuable clues to the genes  function.  JAX and two other NIH funded centers are part of a worldwide effort, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), to genetically and systematically determine the function of every mammalian gene, one gene at a time. The consortium is engaged in the immense task of producing and phenotyping (collecting physiological data from) these mice. Mouse models of genes with common functionality between mice and humans can lead to new models of human disease, which are useful for drug screening, preclinical studies and deeper understanding of biological and disease mechanisms. Under the new grant, Braun says, JAX will take advantage of powerful new gene editing technology, known as CRISPR/Cas9, to generate, breed, cryopreserve and clinically assess the health and well-being of 1,000 lines of mice. The research team will work with the scientific community to select genes of exceptional interest, genes for which little is presently known, and genes predicted to function in select pathways. For each of the new mouse lines, JAX will assess body weight and composition, metabolic and physiological parameters, and behavioral and cognitive function at several age points, and make both the mice and the resulting data available to the worldwide scientific community prior to publication.","Published: August 5, 2016"

Completing the work will give science a complete map of mitochondrial function and help discover the origins of more than 150 poorly understood diseases associated with mitochondria. New features of that map are taking shape today. Two related studies led by the Pagliarini lab identify functions for three little-known mitochondrial proteins that play either a direct or potential role in disease. Mitochondria are tiny organelles that exist in all human cells except red blood cells and consume about 95 percent of the oxygen people breathe in order to manufacture adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical currency of the cell. Mitochondrial diseases strike about 1 in 4,000 people and there are currently no licensed therapies available beyond treatments with vitamins and supplements.  We began by trying to learn something about what these proteins do by understanding what other proteins they physically interact with,  says Pagliarini. To do this, Pagliarini s group partnered with the UW Madison laboratory of Josh Coon, whose group specializes in mass spectrometry and protein analysis. Using the Coon lab s powerful spectrometry techniques, they gained clues about the functions of uncharacterized proteins by mapping their interactions with known ones. Together, the two groups create protein association maps, much like deciphering a protein social network.  Our analysis required over 1,000 mass spectrometry experiments, each taking several hours to complete,  says Emily Wilkerson, a graduate student in the Coon lab.  In our first paper, we found about 2,000 interactions that we think are particularly robust out of more than 100,000 total,  adds Pagliarini.  These top 2 percent of interactions are really telling us something about protein function and will be very useful to the research community in the years ahead.  The studies already helped assign function to three previously unknown proteins. The first one plays a key role in the assembly of complex I, the first of a series of protein complexes used to create ATP. Complex I deficiencies represent the largest class of inborn errors of metabolism. The team revealed that complex I does not function when missing this protein.  Patients with complex I deficiencies are unable to turn sugar and other sources of fuel into energy,  says Brendan Floyd, a UW Madison MD-Ph.D. student and a co-author of the study.  They can t make ATP and complete other processes. Symptoms can be very wide-ranging, from severe inborn diseases that are fatal, to effects later in life related to the inability to grow properly or exercise.  Floyd says the team confirmed this finding by examining the case of a patient with a complex I disorder. That patient appeared to have a deficiency in the protein the team identified. Two other newly defined proteins are players in the production and use of coenzyme Q, a molecule that is essential to energy production within all cells. Coenzyme Q has been called the  spark plug  of the cell since all fuels being broken down by mitochondria to produce ATP rely on its action. Inborn coenzyme Q deficiencies can lead to brain and muscular disorders, and coenzyme Q can be in lower quantities in people with cancer, diabetes, heart conditions, Parkinson s and other diseases. Floyd says the identification of protein function can be an essential first step in the eventual quest to develop therapies. Protein function discoveries in the past 20 years have been the impetus for therapies for cystic fibrosis, and the ability to inhibit certain types of protein expression is at the heart of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. Pagliarini says these findings only scratch the surface of what useful information may be found in his group s protein interaction database. The second paper identified a link between a protein used in coenzyme Q synthesis and the development of cerebellar ataxia, which leads to abnormalities in balance, gait and eye movement. An international collaboration with H l ne Puccio and colleagues at the University of Strasbourg in France was key for the work. The researchers found that the protein is required for assembling other coenzyme Q-related proteins into a complex inside mitochondria. By working with Craig Bingman, a protein crystallographer in the UW Madison Department of Biochemistry, the team also captured new snapshots of this protein in action. Jonathan Stefely, a Morgridge postdoctoral research associate and co-author, says the research will continue for many more missing steps in the pathway that produces coenzyme Q. The molecule can only be produced in the body and does not come from diet.  If we know the biochemical functions of proteins throughout this pathway, we might be able to design therapies or drugs that bypass a dysfunctional step in coenzyme Q production,  he says. Pagliarini says these findings only scratch the surface of what useful information may be found in his group s protein interaction database, which is public and available to the research community. This initial project focused on 50 uncharacterized proteins that, based on literature searches, showed some likelihood of being associated with human disease.  We hope that researchers around the world will use our data to further understand how these mitochondrial protein work, thereby giving us a chance to fix them when they malfunction,  says Pagliarini.","Published: August 5, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/method-to-study-critical-hiv-protein-developed-200837,Method To Study Critical HIV Protein Developed Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories and Northeastern University have developed a new technique to study how a critical HIV protein changes shape  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.More than 36 million people worldwide, including 1.2 million in the U.S., are living with an HIV infection. Today s anti-retroviral cocktails block how HIV replicates, matures and gets into uninfected cells, but they can t eradicate the virus. Mike Kent, a researcher in Sandia National Laboratories  Biological and Engineering Sciences Center, is studying a protein called Nef involved in HIV progression to AIDS with the ultimate goal of blocking it. He and his collaborators have developed a new hybrid method to study this HIV protein that compromises the immune system. The method also could work on many other proteins that damage cellular processes and cause diseases. Nef goes to the membrane of the infected cell and tricks the cell into destroying its own immune system signaling receptors, allowing the infected cell to evade the immune system. Nef also hijacks cellular communications to make it easier for the virus to reproduce. In order to interact with the host proteins, Nef needs to change shape. This shape-changing protein is so important that rhesus monkeys infected with a version of the closely related Simian immunodeficiency virus that lacks the Nef protein don t develop immune deficiency symptoms.  Nef is a protein essential for AIDS. It accomplishes its missions by altering signaling and receptor trafficking. It binds to critical immune system receptors and then signals your cells to destroy them. If you know how this protein works, you have a better shot at developing drugs to stop it,  said Kent. Combining two techniques reveals Nef structure and function Kent and Bioanalytical Chemistry professor John Engen s team at Northeastern University combined two known biophysical techniques to discover how Nef changes structure to perform its functions. Kent is an expert at neutron reflectometry, a technique that gets nanometer-scale structural information about films and biological membranes. His team used this technique to compare the global structure of Nef in its membrane-bound form versus its inactive, membrane-free form. Engen s forte is hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, a technique that measures the local structure and flexibility of proteins. The team used it to get information on the local structure and dynamics of Nef when it s bound to the membrane. The global information from the neutron reflectometry shows only the average location of Nef relative to the membrane. The local dynamics from hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry are acquired for many small portions of the protein, showing the flexibility of 30 overlapping sections that collectively cover 90 percent of Nef. Together they construct a more complete picture of Nef and its structural changes. The global and local, peptide-specific information supported a widely held assumption that, in binding to the membrane, Nef changes its structure to interact with signaling receptors and other host proteins: a hypothesis without support, until now.  People have been studying Nef for a long time and there was a model of what people thought the protein might look like and might do. Nef is a difficult protein to study because you can only crystalize the folded part of the protein, and about half of the protein is unstructured. In addition, you can t study the membrane-bound form by crystallography,  said Kent.  It s the first time anybody had measured these kinds of structural changes and the results were consistent with the hypothetical model,  Kent continued.  Details of these shape changes provide important new molecular insights into how Nef functions.  This method could lead to new assays for drug screening. To combine the two techniques, the team first needed to make a special apparatus. It needed to contain a flat lipid monolayer, made of saturated fats, which mimicked the biological membrane. It also had to be integrated with equipment at neutron sources for neutron reflection measurements, and allow rapid exchange of the watery support layer for the hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments. Another challenge was correctly producing the Nef protein. In infected cells, Nef is tagged with a special lipid that serves to anchor Nef to the cell membrane. Engen s team had to produce Nef that contained this essential lipid, known as a myristate group. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health. The neutron reflection measurements were performed at the Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. New method could answer many questions about HIV, other diseases With the hybrid method and unique apparatus in hand, the team is seeking funds to answer additional questions about Nef.  We studied it alone; now we want to study it with its binding partners, with the host proteins and the complexes that it forms, and in the presence of drug molecules or inhibitors,  Kent said.  Stopping it from binding with its partners or inhibiting it from adopting the conformation that leads to receptor degradation would have important medical implications.  Tom Smithgall of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, a co-author on one of the team s papers, is currently screening for potential drugs that might block Nef s actions. Kent also hopes to apply this hybrid method to other important structural problems of membrane-associated proteins, including virus maturation; the fusion of viruses with host cell membranes; the workings of bacterial toxins such as botulinum, tetanus and diphtheria; and cell-signaling dysfunctions ranging from cancer to regulating cholesterol levels.  There is a lot of potential for combining these two techniques in a more general sense. There are no other ways to get this kind of specific, direct information about essential membrane proteins. This is a significant niche of biological problems that could not be addressed before our work, and we ve made some big steps forward. The future benefit depends on how broadly we can apply the method beyond just this one HIV protein,  said Kent.","Published: August 5, 2016"

The botulinum toxins cancel nerve signals to the muscles, creating paralysis that can last for months. Given its extraordinary toxicity, doses are typically measured in trillionths of a gram, and targets are carefully chosen to silence only the desired motor nerves. When Botox and related botulinum drugs entered the market,  the idea was that they are safe to use, they stay where they are injected, and you don t have to worry about toxin going to the central nervous system and causing weird effects,  says Edwin Chapman, an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and professor of neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin Madison. The concern that this powerful toxin can move beyond the injection site was reinforced in 2009, when the Food and Drug Administration added a prominent warning to prescribing information  to highlight that botulinum toxin may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulism,  including  unexpected loss of strength or muscle weakness.   Understand that swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening and there have been reports of deaths related to the effects of spread of botulinum toxin.  Additionally, physicians have seen puzzling results from treatment, adds Ewa Bomba-Warczak, a doctoral candidate in neuroscience.  In many cases, after an injection for a disabling spasm of neck muscles called cervical dystonia, there is no change in muscle tone but the patient finds relief and is perfectly happy. That result can t be explained by the local effects.  In a study published today (Aug. 4, 2016) in Cell Reports, senior author Chapman, first author Bomba-Warczak and colleagues present clear evidence that toxin is moving between neurons in a lab dish. The study looked at mouse neurons in wells connected by tiny channels that allow growth of axons   the long fibers that neurons use to communicate. In tests of two botulinum toxins, the researchers saw toxin molecules entering the injected cell, as expected. Once inside a neuron, botulinum toxin cleaves proteins responsible for fusion of chemical containers, known as vesicles, with the plasma membrane. This fusion event releases chemical signals that underlie communication with muscles, and the inability to fuse leads to the temporary paralysis caused by botulinum toxin. Using antibodies to identify fragments of the damaged proteins, Chapman s group showed that toxin molecules were moving to nerve cells in wells that had not initially received the harmful molecules.  Every time one fraction of the toxin acts locally (on the first nerve cell it contacts), another fraction acts at a distance,  says Chapman.  It s unknown how far they travel, which likely depends on the dose of toxin and other factors.  Co-author Jason Vevea, a UW Madison postdoctoral fellow, produced videos showing tagged molecules of botulinum toxin moving along the axons connecting neurons. Botulinum toxins were first described in the 1800s, and have long been a subject of research at UW Madison. Allergan PLC, which markets four versions of botulinum toxin, reported global Botox sales of nearly $2 billion in 2015. Injected botulinum toxin is taken up in axons and reaches the cell body, shown in green, before being transported into different neurons, shown in red. DIAGRAM: EWA BOMBA-WARCZAK By finding that toxin molecules don t always stay where they are injected, Chapman says the Wisconsin study answers a long-standing question about mobility, but raises several more.  We have seen that these toxins enter neurons at the injection site, causing the desired local paralysis, but Ewa and Jason have shown unambiguously the existence of a second entry pathway that takes some of the toxin molecules to other neurons.  The research, done in a lab dish, removes variables that have plagued similar studies performed in animals, Chapman says.  We wanted to see if we could build an in vitro (in a dish) system that allows direct visualization of this putative movement, in a way that s simple, easy to interpret, and unambiguous. Do they move, or do they not?  Chapman wonders about the effects of extraordinarily powerful toxin molecules that travel the neural networks. Local effects have, until now, been deemed the sole effects. But could part of its effects be due to the transported toxin? These questions could be answered by genetically engineering the Clostridium bacteria that make botulinum toxin to alter the toxin s structure, Chapman says.  We may be in a position to mutate the part of the toxin that attaches to a receptor on the neuron so it can only enter the local pathway, not this new pathway we have described.  If only the local effects matter for medicine, tomorrow s versions of this ancient toxin molecule may be able to alleviate symptoms from wrinkles to severe muscle spasms without moving beyond the target neurons.  I have a hard time imagining that any physician is going to want to inject something they know can move about when they have an option to use something that stays put,  Chapman says.  It s an exciting prospect, supplanting a $2 billion drug with a safer drug. ","Published: August 5, 2016"

The device, about the size of a U.S. quarter, contains a single muscle strip and a small set of motor neurons. Researchers can influence and observe the interactions between the two, within a realistic, three-dimensional matrix.   The researchers genetically modified the neurons in the device to respond to light. By shining light directly on the neurons, they can precisely stimulate these cells, which in turn send signals to excite the muscle fiber. The researchers also measured the force the muscle exerts within the device as it twitches or contracts in response. The team s results, published online today in Science Advances, may help scientists understand and identify drugs to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig s disease, as well as other neuromuscular-related conditions.  The neuromuscular junction is involved in a lot of very incapacitating, sometimes brutal and fatal disorders, for which a lot has yet to be discovered,  says Sebastien Uzel, who led the work as a graduate student in MIT s Department of Mechanical Engineering.  The hope is, being able to form neuromuscular junctions in vitro will help us understand how certain diseases function.  Uzel s coauthors include Roger Kamm, the Cecil and Ida Green Distinguished Professor of Mechanical and Biological Engineering at MIT, along with former graduate student and now postdoc Randall Platt, research scientist Vidya Subramanian, former undergraduate researcher Taylor Pearl, senior postdoc Christopher Rowlands, former postdoc Vincent Chan, associate professor of biology Laurie Boyer, and professor of mechanical engineering and biological engineering Peter So. Closing in on a counterpart Since the 1970s, researchers have come up with numerous ways to simulate the neuromuscular junction in the lab. Most of these experiments involve growing muscle and nerve cells in shallow Petri dishes or on small glass substrates. But such environments are a far cry from the body, where muscles and neurons live in complex, three-dimensional environments, often separated over long distances.  Think of a giraffe,  says Uzel, who is now a postdoc at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University.  Neurons that live in the spinal cord send axons across very large distances to connect with muscles in the leg.  To recreate more realistic in vitro neuromuscular junctions, Uzel and his colleagues fabricated a microfluidic device with two important features: a three-dimensional environment, and compartments that separate muscles from nerves to mimic their natural separation in the human body. The researchers suspended muscle and neuron cells in the millimeter-sized compartments, which they then filled with gel to mimic a three-dimensional environment. A flash and a twitch To grow a muscle fiber, the team used muscle precursor cells obtained from mice, which they then differentiated into muscle cells. They injected the cells into the microfluidic compartment, where the cells grew and fused to form a single muscle strip. Similarly, they differentiated motor neurons from a cluster of stem cells, and placed the resulting aggregate of neural cells in the second compartment. Before differentiating both cell types, the researchers genetically modified the neural cells to respond to light, using a now-common technique known as optogenetics. Kamm says light  gives you pinpoint control of what cells you want to activate,  as opposed to using electrodes, which, in such a confined space, can inadvertently stimulate cells other than the targeted neural cells. Finally, the researchers added one more feature to the device: force sensing. To measure muscle contraction, they fabricated two tiny, flexible pillars within the muscle cells  compartment, around which the growing muscle fiber could wrap. As the muscle contracts, the pillars squeeze together, creating a displacement that researchers can measure and convert to mechanical force. In experiments to test the device, Uzel and his colleagues first observed neurons extending axons toward the muscle fiber within the three-dimensional region. Once they observed that an axon had made a connection, they stimulated the neuron with a tiny burst of blue light and instantly observed a muscle contraction.  You flash a light, you get a twitch,  Kamm says. Judging from these experiments, Kamm says the microfluidic device may serve as a fruitful testing ground for drugs to treat neuromuscular disorders, and could even be tailored to individual patients.  You could potentially take pluripotent cells from an ALS patient, differentiate them into muscle and nerve cells, and make the whole system for that particular patient,  Kamm says.  Then you could replicate it as many times as you want, and try different drugs or combinations of therapies to see which is most effective in improving the connection between nerves and muscles.  On the flip side, he says the device may be useful in  modeling exercise protocols.  For instance, by stimulating muscle fibers at varying frequencies, scientists can study how repeated stress affects muscle performance.  Now with all these new microfluidic approaches people are developing, you can start to model more complex systems with neurons and muscles,  Kamm says.  The neuromuscular junction is another unit people can now incorporate into those testing modalities.  This research was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation.","Published: August 5, 2016"

Unrepaired, these attacks cause mutations that can promote the development of cancer, hence the importance of rapid and efficient DNA repair. To do this, the cell mobilizes a series of enzymes that must be perfectly coordinated to identify and repair the damaged parts of their genetic heritage. The complexity of this process has long prevented researchers to understand what were the mechanisms at work.  With the development of nanotechnology, a team consisting of biologists and physicists was able to film live enzymes in mending DNA abyss. Their series of studies was initiated in 2012 1 , when the team focused on the start of the repair mechanism. They have now for the first time, the repair process in its entirety.  With a specialized microscope, which allows both to manipulate and observe DNA molecules and proteins, researchers observed DNA molecule damaged by ultraviolet light. They added RNA polymerase, an enzyme that normally ""reads"" the DNA code to begin the expression on his information in the form of protein, but which ""locks"" being played when it arrives on a damaged part of the DNA. It is through this blockage of RNA polymerase that repairs are carried out. Specifically, the researchers could observe how a series of proteins (Mfd, UvrA, then uvrB UvrC) have succeeded, each with its specific activity, and are to contact them to interact with the RNA polymerase and repair damaged DNA by UV rays.  in determining the order in which these components act and characterizing how they take turns, these studies have established what are the critical steps of the process.  This discovery could foster new applications, the time in the fight against cancer and one against bacteria. Indeed, when the cancers are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy - whose effect is to damage the DNA of cancer cells - is that their cells have just turned this DNA repair mechanism. We can consider new ways to inhibit at key mechanisms for this repair. In addition, bacteria such as the cause of tuberculosis employ very similar proteins Mfd to proliferate. Thus, having identified how these proteins interact with each other may also be useful in the fight against pathogenic bacteria.","Published: August 5, 2016"

The study was led by Ravi Radhakrishnan, a professor in the departments of bioengineering and chemical and biomolecular engineering in Penn s School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Ramakrishnan Natesan, a member of his lab. Also contributing to the study were Richard Tourdot, a Radhakrishnan lab member; David Eckmann, the Horatio C. Wood Professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine;Portonovo Ayyaswamy, the Asa Whitney Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics in Penn Engineering; and Vladimir Muzykantov, a professor of pharmacology in Penn Medicine. Nanocarriers can be designed with molecules on their exteriors that only bind to biomarkers found on a certain type of cell. This type of targeting could reduce side effects, such as when chemotherapy drugs destroy healthy cells instead of cancerous ones, but the biomechanics of this binding process are complex. Previous work by some of the researchers uncovered a counter-intuitive relationship that suggested that adding more targeting molecules on the nanocarrier s surface is not always better. A nanocarrier with more of those targeting molecules might find and bind to many of the corresponding biomarkers at once. While such a configuration is stable, it can decrease the nanocarrier s ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues. Having fewer targeting molecules makes the nanocarrier more selective, as it will have a harder time binding to healthy tissue where the corresponding biomarkers are not over-expressed. The team s new study adds new dimensions to the model of the interplay between the cellular surface and the nanocarrier.  The cell surface itself is like a caravan tent on a windy day on a desert,  Radhakrishnan said.  The more excess in the cloth, the more the flutter of the tent. Similarly, the more excess cell membrane area on the  tent poles,  the cytoskeleton of the cell, the more the flutter of the membrane due to thermal motion.  The Penn team found that different cell types have differing amounts of this excess membrane area and that this mechanical parameter governs how well nanocarriers can bind to the cell. Accounting for the fluttering of the membrane in their computer models, in addition to the quantity of targeting molecules on the nanocarrier and biomarkers on the cell surface, has highlighted the importance of these mechanical aspects in how efficiently nanocarriers can deliver their payloads.  These design criteria,  Radhakrishnan said,  can be utilized in custom designing nanocarriers for a given patient or patient-cohort, hence showing an important way forward for custom nanocarrier design in the era of personalized medicine.

The Eliminate Dengue Program is an international, non-profit research collaboration led by Prof Scott O Neill of Monash University, Australia. The team is developing a natural method for controlling mosquito-transmitted diseases, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. The Brazil project team, led by Dr Luciano Moreira (FIOCRUZ/Centro de Pesquisas Ren  Rachou, Brazil), is applying the method towards controlling the spread of ZIKV. The researchers infect the mosquitoes with naturally occurring bacteria, called Wolbachia, that reduce the ability of the mosquitoes to transmit the disease-causing virus to humans. Wolbachia occurs naturally in up to 60% of all insect species and is passed to new generations during reproduction. Dr Moreira notes,  One of the most important features of our project is how sustainable it is. After we release Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into an area over the period of a few months, they increase and maintain their prevalence naturally without us having to continually release more mosquitoes.  Dr Moreira s team uses IDT s ZEN  Double-Quenched Probes to monitor the persistence of viruses within the mosquito population. Their recent research in Brazil shows that by dispersing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, they can significantly reduce risk of transmission of ZIKV and dengue virus. Now IDT is donating reagents to Eliminate Dengue Brazil so that additional research can be completed quickly and efficiently.

White matter is the tissue that connects areas of the brain and allows for information to be communicated between regions. Our brains naturally shrink with age, but scientists are increasingly recognizing that obesity already linked to conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease may also affect the onset and progression of brain aging; however, direct studies to support this link are lacking. See Also: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice In a cross-sectional study, researchers looked at the impact of obesity on brain structure across the adult lifespan to investigate whether obesity was associated with brain changes characteristic of aging. The team studied data from 473 individuals between the ages of 20 and 87, recruited by the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience. The results are published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging. The researchers divided the data into two categories based on weight: lean and overweight. They found striking differences in the volume of white matter in the brains of overweight individuals compared with those of their leaner counterparts. Overweight individuals had a widespread reduction in white matter compared to lean people. The team then calculated how white matter volume related to age across the two groups. They discovered that an overweight person at, say, 50 years old had a comparable white matter volume to a lean person aged 60 years, implying a difference in brain age of 10 years. Strikingly, however, the researchers only observed these differences from middle-age onwards, suggesting that our brains may be particularly vulnerable during this period of aging. ""As our brains age, they naturally shrink in size, but it isn't clear why people who are overweight have a greater reduction in the amount of white matter,"" says first author Dr. Lisa Ronan from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, ""We can only speculate on whether obesity might in some way cause these changes or whether obesity is a consequence of brain changes."" Senior author Professor Paul Fletcher, from the Department of Psychiatry, adds: ""We're living in an aging population, with increasing levels of obesity, so it's essential that we establish how these two factors might interact, since the consequences for health are potentially serious. Learn More: Brain activity and response to food cues differ in severely obese women, study shows ""The fact that we only saw these differences from middle-age onwards raises the possibility that we may be particularly vulnerable at this age. It will also be important to find out whether these changes could be reversible with weight loss, which may well be the case."" Despite the clear differences in the volume of white matter between lean and overweight individuals, the researchers found no connection between being overweight or obese and an individual's cognitive abilities, as measured using a standard test similar to an IQ test.

This new protocol provides scientists with a robust source of GNs to study many psychiatric and neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, which are thought to develop at least in part due to GN dysfunction. See Also: An accessible approach to making a mini-brain GNs are inhibitory neurons that reduce neuronal activation, and make up roughly 20 per cent of the human brain. They work alongside excitatory neurons (ENs) to ensure balanced neural activity for normal brain function. The coordinated interplay between GNs and ENs orchestrate specific activation patterns in the brain, which are responsible for our behaviour, emotions, and higher reasoning. Functional impairment of GNs results in imbalanced neural activity, thereby contributing to the symptoms observed in many psychiatric disorders. The availability of high quality, functional human GN populations would facilitate the development of good models for studying psychiatric disorders, as well as for screening drug effects on specific populations of neurons. Scientists worldwide have been hard at work trying to generate a consistent supply of GNs in the laboratory, but have been faced with many challenges. Protocols involving multiple complex stages, poor yield, and requiring a long time to generate mature and functional GNs are just some of the limitations encountered. Don't Miss: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells Many of these limitations have now been overcome by the development of a rapid and robust protocol to generate GNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a single step. With the addition of a specific combination of factors, hPSCs turn into mature and functional GNs in a mere six to eight weeks. This is about two to three times faster than the 10 to 30 weeks required for previous protocols. In addition, this new protocol is highly efficient, with GNs making up more than 80 per cent of the final neuron population. To develop this protocol, the team from Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), A*STAR's Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) and the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI, Singapore) first identified genetic factors involved in GN development in the brain. The team then tried many different combinations of these factors, and succeeded in confirming that mature and functional human GNs were indeed generated. ""Just like how a balance of Yin and Yang is needed in order to stay healthy, a balance of ENs and GNs is required for normal brain function. We now know a fair bit about ENs because we have good protocols to make them. However, we still know very little of the other player, the GNs, because current protocols do not work well. Yet, when these GNs malfunction our brain goes haywire,"" commented Dr. Alfred Sun, a Research Fellow at NNI and co-first author of the publication alongside Mr. Qiang Yuan, an NUS Graduate School PhD student. Learn More: Growing functioning brain tissue in 3D ""Our quick, efficient and easy way to mass produce GNs for lab use is a game changer for neuroscience and drug discovery. With increased recognition of the essential role of GNs in almost all neurological and psychiatric diseases, we envisage our new method to be widely used to advance research and drug screening,"" said Dr. Shawn Je, Assistant Professor in the Neuroscience and Behavioural Disorders Programme at Duke-NUS, and senior author of the study. The speed and efficiency of generating GNs with this new protocol provides researchers unprecedented access to the quantities of neurons necessary for studying the role of GNs in disease mechanisms.

As people age, their peripheral and central auditory system (areas of the brain that help to intake and interpret sound) decline in function and plugging into other parts of the brain is needed to compensate, according to Dr. Claude Alain, senior investigator of the study and Assistant Director of the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences. To adapt for hearing loss, the speech motor area of the brain's frontal lobe steps in to help an older adult interpret someone talking in a noisy room, according to a study published in Nature Communications. See Also: How does the brain respond to hearing loss? ""Prior research found that there's a change in the brain and how it acts when older adults listen to speech and noise, but people didn't know the nature of this change,"" says Dr. Alain. ""Our study was able to show that we appear to tap into the speech motor areas, regions of the brain that are important for speech articulation and production, and use that information to identify speech embedded in noise."" The study analyzed the brain activity of 16 young and 16 older adults and their ability to identify syllables, while the level of noise changed in the background. This finding is important because it paves the way for programs to be designed to assist seniors with hearing loss and to adapt the way hearing aids are developed. Significant hearing loss is one of the most common chronic health conditions in older adults that affects 90 per cent of seniors who are 80 years and older. A loss of hearing greatly affects an older adult's ability to socialize and their quality of life. ""If you have impaired hearing, you try to correct that with a hearing aid or assistive listening devices, but it can be difficult to tweak the mechanical aspect to zoom in on a person's voice,"" says Alain. ""By showing there are other brain areas that affect hearing you can design training programs that target these brain areas to see if we can improve their use."" Don't Miss: Stop and listen: Study shows how movement affects hearing This research was conducted with support from a five-year Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant that allowed Dr. Alain and his team to create a prototype of a new auditory training program aimed at helping older people maintain their ability to separate speech from background noise.

Sanity hangs, in part, in the gentle balance of chemicals strung together within regions of the brain in an intricate matrix. In schizophrenia, the matrix is sharply jarred, debilitating the mind and triggering hallucinations. Now, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have created an interactive model of that matrix to fast-track research and treatment of the tormenting disorder. It uses massive amounts of research data to simulate major systemic chemical changes in the brains of schizophrenia sufferers but depicts them in simple, colorful graphics. Don't Miss: Researchers identify signature of microbiomes associated with schizophrenia Clinicians could use it to help patients and their loved ones better understand the chemical underpinnings of the disease and therapeutic alternatives. And researchers could test out hypotheses virtually, quickly and easily, and get a better overall sense of the disease. Research on schizophrenia can be a bit compartmentalized. ""Most researchers study a disease from their own specialty's focus and perspective. Then they may form a hypothesis based on dopamine or glutamate or some other single neurotransmitter,"" said research engineer Zhen Qi from the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. ""Our model integrates all neurotransmitter systems."" Researchers Zhen Qi and Eberhard Voit data-mined the collective scientific knowledge on a key schizophrenia symptom and engineered a brain chemistry simulator around it. Credit: Micah Eavenson, Melanie Goux / Georgia Tech  The research results have been published in the journal Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects. ""Dopamine triggers reward systems in the brain,"" Qi said. ""Illegal drugs like amphetamines work with it. Dopamine makes you feel good."" Serotonin is subtler, and has mainly auxiliary functions. It sometimes counteracts dopamine's effects. Norepinephrine is also well-known. Together with other substances, these neurotransmitters help regulate the activities of at least 11 regions of the brain to do things like orchestrating parts of consciousness, including working memory. Learn More: Understanding the components of memory Qi and his team built the computational model around the neurochemistry behind that cognitive function, which goes badly awry in schizophrenia. Working memory is short-term recollection that lends the mind coherence. It remembers what we saw, said or did seconds ago and what we want to do seconds from now. Hallucinations may be the eye-catching, popularized symptom of schizophrenia, but the disease's impairment of working memory, though less attention-grabbing, arguably debilitates sufferers more. ""Working memory deficits disrupt storing and processing of information as basic as letters and numbers, and they hinder the recall of stored information,"" Qi said. ""That makes learning and planning difficult."" The researchers found that there is a stark lack of medical treatment for this symptom. ""Cognitive symptoms were actually associated with schizophrenia before symptoms like hallucinations became the focus,"" said Eberhard Voit, a Georgia Tech biomedical engineer and a Georgia Research Alliance eminent scholar, who supervised the modeling effort. ""Yet, drugs for schizophrenia mainly target the latter symptoms."" Two neurotransmitters, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are crucial to working memory, as they coordinate two brain regions, the dorsal prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia. Glutamate boosts nerve transmission, and GABA tones it down, and it's important for the two to strike a balance. But other neurotransmitters associated with additional brain regions also tug at that balance. Related: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning They all hang together much like in a mobile over a baby's crib. Bump one substance, and it knocks a whole system out of whack. ""Increasing the amount of any one neurotransmitter corresponds to pulling on that mobile. But this one neurotransmitter also affects all the other neurotransmitters through an interaction web,"" Voit said. ""The new state of the mobile is very difficult to foresee."" This makes it challenging for a psychiatrist to adjust a patient's prescriptions and predict what the overall effects might be. That's where Qi's and Voit's computational model comes in. The Georgia Tech researchers collected studies on brain chemistry in schizophrenia from nearly 50 labs around the world, and mined the data. To interpret them, they consulted researchers who have dedicated their lives to exploring schizophrenia and they fed the information into differential equations representing relationships between neurochemical systems. They arrived at a novel map of the brain chemistry behind working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia. ""That is new, this map. It reflects the collective knowledge of the scientific community,"" Voit said. ""With the information assembled, we wrote code to implement this model,"" Qi said. The result is a program of the neurochemical matrix that's easy to use. Users can input varying levels of neurotransmitters, and the matrix model simulates the labyrinthine domino effects they have on each other. But the output to the user is much simpler, even playful. ""What the user sees is a mobile tilting back and forth,"" Voit said. Color-coded dots on the mobile represent neurotransmitters. If doctors or researchers tug at one, the others follow until a new state is reached. See Also: Researchers shed light on how neurons exchange neurotransmitters ""The mobile looks simple, although it takes into account the underlying complex interactions among neurotransmitters that determine the nodes in the mobile,"" Qi said. With a few months' work, a graphic user interface could be constructed to allow doctors and researchers to easily use Georgia Tech's new computational model. The more new research data other scientists add, the better Qi and Voit will be able to optimize the system and connect isolated pockets of knowledge from labs around the world to a greater whole for the greater good.

This decision follows a positive recommendation from the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in May of this year. EndolucinBeta  respectively no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is used in Targeted Radionuclide Therapy, e.g. in the field of Precision Oncology. It is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, used for radiolabeling of disease-specific carrier molecules, like antibodies or peptides. 177Lu has successfully been used for the treatment of inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors (NET) by radiolabeling with Somatostatin analogues for example with the peptide DOTATOC (Edotreotide). Somatostatin receptors are predominantly overexpressed by NETs. The radiopharmaceutical, upon binding to the Somatostatin receptor is in vivo internalized and retained by tumor cells. Upon decay, 177Lu emits cytotoxic medium-energy beta particles with a maximum range of 1.7 mm in soft tissue, which means that healthy tissue in the surroundings of the targeted tumor is minimally affected. Currently EndolucinBeta  is successfully used in investigational medicinal products for radiolabeling of peptides or antibodies.  A recently published retrospective Phase II study with DOTATOC radiolabeled with EndolucinBeta  showed promising efficacy and safety data. These results suggest and demonstrate a significant benefit, a substantially improved progression-free survival (PFS), for which n.c.a. 177Lu-DOTATOC received an Orphan Designation (EMA/OD/196/13) as a treatment of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET).

In a new study published in the journal Nature, an international team of researchers studying tens of thousands of generations of E. coli bacteria report that most new genetic mutations that were passed down were actually beneficial and occurred at much more variable rates than previously thought. The finding could have implications for treating bacterial infections.  If this holds true for our own microbiomes, it suggests that microbes are always becoming more specialized for competing in their local environment in subtle ways,  says Jeffrey Barrick, an assistant professor of molecular biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin and co-author of the new study.  This could have implications for personalized medicine, as it suggests that E. coli in my gut will evolve idiosyncratic differences from those in your gut over time, for example.  The work was made possible by a unique repository of bacterial samples collected and maintained by Richard Lenski, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Michigan State University, called the Long-term Evolution Experiment, or LTEE. The researchers sequenced the entire genomes of hundreds of versions of E. coli bacteria sampled over tens of thousands of generations to pinpoint the genes with beneficial mutations that gave the bacteria a competitive edge over their ancestors. The bacteria from different generations of the LTEE have been stored in freezers for nearly 30 years, but they were brought back to life to look for the changes in their DNA. Being able to go back into the freezer to study samples from years ago is one of the reasons Lenski calls the LTEE ""the experiment that keeps on giving."" ""One of the nice things about such a long-term experiment is that new technologies come along that didn't exist when I started the LTEE in 1988,  says Lenski, who is part of Michigan State University s BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action.  The first bacterial genome was not sequenced until 1995, and now, in this single paper, we've sequenced 264 complete genomes from this one experiment."" The team sequenced hundreds of E. coli genomes to examine how the bacteria had changed in their DNA over 50,000 generations. The researchers found more than 14,000 changes across the LTEE s 12 populations. Each population changed in different ways, but there were some important commonalities as well. Most significantly, the mutations were concentrated in a subset of the genes   those where mutations gave the bacteria a competitive edge.  We are used to thinking about evolutionary time being measured in quiet ticks, each one representing neutral mutations accumulating in genomes, with an occasional chime or gong, representing a beneficial mutation,  says Barrick.  But, under normal circumstances, the evolutionary clock for bacteria may be more cacophonous than quiet.  One of the striking differences that arose between populations is that half of them evolved to mutate at much higher rates than the other populations, even though they all started from the same ancestral strain that had a low mutation rate. In some of these ""hypermutating"" strains, the rate at which mutations accumulate ramped up early on in the experiment and then slowed down thousands of generations later. Barrick says that makes sense because over time, there are fewer ways to improve, and as more mutations accumulate, there's a growing risk of adding harmful mutations. ""Overall, it's interesting that mutation rates are so evolvable, and that they naturally adjust to be high and then low depending on how well adapted a population is to its environment, even in this very stripped down microcosm version of the real world,"" says Barrick. This suggests that a key assumption behind techniques for dating how long ago two related organisms began to diverge   namely, that mutations accumulate at a stable rate over time -- might not accurately represent the true dynamics for many microbes. This paper is the product of several collaborations. Barrick and members of his research group created software for analyzing the genomes. Their work was important for accurately reconstructing the evolutionary histories of the populations and for counting the relative contributions of different types of mutations to genomic evolution.","Published: August 4, 2016"

Their study has implications for a much more common disease: tuberculosis. The study results, posted online in the journal Immunity, could lead to new therapies for arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis (ARC) syndrome. It also suggests connections to tuberculosis (TB): a hard-to-treat bacterial illness that the World Health Organization calls  a top infectious disease killer worldwide.  ARC syndrome is a rare, fatal genetic disease that results in liver, kidney, and bile duct dysfunction as well as abnormalities in the skin, joints, and musculoskeletal systems. There is no treatment, and most patients die before their second birthday. The syndrome is also associated with recurrent infections and sepsis, the latter of which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes as an  overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection.   Our findings indicate that, rather than being an indirect consequence of failures in other organ systems, ARC s inflammatory complications could reflect direct roles of the ARC gene Vps33B in innate immunity,  said Dr. Chandrashekhar Pasare, Associate Professor of Immunology at UT Southwestern and co-senior author of the study.  By identifying a novel and crucial role for Vps33B in regulating innate immunity, these findings point to the possibility of developing new therapies for treating ARC syndrome. It may be possible to identify drugs that target the pro-inflammatory pathways that our research indicates fail to get switched  off  properly in ARC,  said Dr. Helmut Kr mer, Professor of Neuroscience and Cell Biology at UT Southwestern and co-senior author of the study. Fewer than 300 cases of ARC have been reported worldwide, with the vast majority of them linked to inheriting two mutated copies of Vps33B, Dr. Kr mer added. The scientists generated fruit fly and mouse models of ARC syndrome by deleting the Vps33B gene. Cells from mice or flies lacking the Vps33B protein showed exaggerated inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccaride (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacteria known to stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of immune system cells, which activate an immune response, Dr. Kr mer said. Their work fits into a decades-long innate immunity story based at UT Southwestern that features the research of Dr. Bruce Beutler, Director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense. Dr. Beutler, who is a Regental Professor and holds the Raymond and Ellen Willie Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research, in Honor of Laverne and Raymond Willie, Sr., shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the activation of innate immunity, the body s first line of defense against infection. The current study looks at the other side of the innate immune response: the less-understood area of how the inflammatory response is inactivated or turned off, the researchers explained.  We found that Vps33B is important for disease-fighting white blood cells (macrophages) to clear the invading bacteria from the cells after the TLRs have carried them inside. Normally, both the bacteria and the receptors are digested by the macrophage cell, thus switching off the inflammatory immune response before it goes out of control to become sepsis,  explained Dr. Pasare, holder of the J. Wayne Streilein, M.D. Professorship in Immunology and a Louise W. Kahn Scholar in Biomedical Research. The new study indicates that lack of Vps33B and the protein it encodes blocks that degradation step so that inflammation cannot be turned off, leading to enhanced inflammation and causing symptoms of sepsis and susceptibility to recurrent infections, the researchers said.  Although ARC syndrome is very rare, other researchers have reported that in order to survive in the host, the mycobacterium that causes TB inhibit the function of the protein encoded by Vsp33B. This inhibition was thought to be due to a reduced ability of the immune cells to digest the TB bacteria; however, our study suggests that the exaggerated inflammation seen in TB could be a result of an inability to terminate inflammatory response,  Dr. Pasare said. The scientists hope to investigate that question in future research. Dr. Pasare and Dr. Kr mer said this collaboration is an example of the unique research environment at UT Southwestern that facilitates investigators with diverse interests and expertise coming together to solve important scientific questions.","Published: August 4, 2016"

Neuropathy, damage or disease affecting the peripheral nervous system, can range from rare conditions linked to a patient s exome to more common causes like diabetes and viral infections. Neuropathies can affect both motor and sensory neurons, producing muscle weakness, numbness, pain, and a wide range of symptoms. The study was published in the journal, Science Signaling and was a collaboration between the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee; and Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. These types of discoveries underscore the importance of the families who volunteer to participate in clinical research.  This case superbly illustrates how the intensive study of children with very rare neurological disorders can lead quickly to a deep knowledge of a specific genetic condition, as well as uncover mysteries of the nervous system relevant to a wide spectrum of disorders,  said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., director of NINDS. In their report, researchers examined a 10-year-old child with early onset, progressive neuropathy primarily affecting his ability to walk, grasp, and perform fine motor skills. When the patient s complete genetic makeup, or genome, was analyzed, a mutation was found in the gene associated with the protein KCC3. This protein is important for the ability of cells to respond to swelling. When a neuron swells, KCC3 is involved in the mechanism that drives fluid out, returning the cell to normal. In the absence of this protein (in what is called a loss-of-function mutation), extreme swelling of the neurons can occur, which in turn leads to nerve damage. In the study, the patient s mutation affected the ability of KCC3 to turn off once it was no longer needed, leading to the opposite effect shrunken neurons that also fail to communicate properly. This is referred to as a gain-of-function mutation, causing the affected protein to behave in a new and damaging way.  This protein, KCC3, has been connected to other forms of neuropathy in the past,  said Carsten G. Bonnemann, M.D., a senior investigator in the Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section at NINDS and a senior author of the paper.  What s unique here is that this is the first time that we have seen a gain-of-function mutation in the KCC3 protein that leads to neuropathy.  Loss-of-function KCC3 mutations often affect the development of the brain, producing detrimental cognitive changes in addition to both sensory and motor neuropathies. In contrast, the patient described in this report had neuropathy only in the motor neurons and showed no behavioral or developmental changes.  We wanted to take a closer look at the direct effects of this mutation on the muscles and nerves, so we created a mouse model with the same genetic change as our patient,  said Dr. Bonnemann.  When we tested this mouse, we saw many of the same physical deficits, including problems with movement and coordination, and a decrease in the ability of neurons to send signals to the muscles. This shows that this mutation is likely to be the main cause for our patient s neuropathy.  While the exact mechanism that causes the neuropathy remains unclear and will be the focus of further study, identifying a specific molecular target, KCC3, opens the door to studies of potential treatments using U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. One such drug, furosemide (also known by its trade name, Lasix), is a diuretic that is prescribed to treat fluid retention, kidney disorders, and high blood pressure. Furosemide is part of a class of drugs that inhibits the function of KCC3 in a way that is unaffected and even enhanced by the gain-of-function mutation.    We were able to identify what this particular mutation does, so we have a specific target for therapeutic development. Because furosemide inhibits the function of the transporter that is improperly activated in our patient, we may one day be able to use drugs like furosemide to intervene in the progression of neuropathies caused by this type of mutation,  said Dr. Bonnemann.

Scientists at NIAID s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) developed the investigational vaccine   called the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine   earlier this year. The study is part of the U.S. government response to the ongoing outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 50 countries and territories have active Zika virus transmission (link is external). In the United States and its territories, more than 6,400 Zika cases have been reported.  Although Zika infections are usually asymptomatic, some people experience mild illness lasting about a week. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly, as well as other severe fetal defects of the brain and other organs. There are no vaccines or specific therapeutics to prevent or treat Zika virus disease.  A safe and effective vaccine to prevent Zika virus infection and the devastating birth defects it causes is a public health imperative,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  NIAID worked expeditiously to ready a vaccine candidate, and results in animal testing have been very encouraging. We are pleased that we are now able to proceed with this initial study in people. Although it will take some time before a vaccine against Zika is commercially available, the launch of this study is an important step forward.  The NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine approach is similar to that used for another investigational vaccine developed by NIAID for West Nile virus. That vaccine candidate was found to be safe and induced an immune response when tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The investigational Zika vaccine includes a small, circular piece of DNA   called a plasmid   that scientists engineered to contain genes that code for proteins of the Zika virus. When the vaccine is injected into the arm muscle, cells read the genes and make Zika virus proteins, which self-assemble into virus-like particles. The body mounts an immune response to these particles, including neutralizing antibodies and T cells. DNA vaccines do not contain infectious material   so they cannot cause a vaccinated individual to become infected with Zika   and have been shown to be safe in previous clinical trials for other diseases.  A team of scientists here at NIAID worked tirelessly to rapidly develop this vaccine for clinical testing,  said John Mascola, M.D., director of NIAID s VRC.  DNA or gene-based vaccines induce antibodies, but they also can activate the cell-mediated immune response, which ultimately could yield strong and durable protection against disease.  The Phase 1 clinical trial, called VRC 319, is led by Julie E. Ledgerwood, D.O., chief of the VRC s clinical trials program. Volunteers will be divided randomly into four study groups of 20 people each. After enrollment, all participants will receive a vaccination at their first visit via a needle-free injector that pushes the vaccine fluid into the arm muscle. Half of the participants will receive one additional vaccination eight weeks or 12 weeks later. The remaining participants will receive two additional vaccinations: one group of 20 participants will receive a second vaccine at week four and a third at week eight; the other group of 20 participants will receive a second vaccine at week four and a third at week 20. All participants will receive the same dose at each vaccination. Following each vaccination, participants will remain at the study site for observation for a minimum of 30 minutes so clinicians can monitor for any adverse reactions. Participants will receive a diary card to use at home to record their temperature and any symptoms for seven days following each vaccination. All participants will return for follow-up visits within a 44-week time period after the first vaccination so investigators can monitor their health to determine if the vaccine is safe. The study team will review patient data daily and weekly to monitor safety. A Protocol Safety Review Team will also conduct formal interim safety reviews. At follow-up visits, investigators will also take blood samples for laboratory testing to measure the immune response to the vaccine. Participants will be asked to return for two follow-up visits at 18 months and two years following the initial vaccination so investigators can obtain additional blood samples to assess the durability of the immune response. Other study sites include the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland, School of Medicine s Institute for Global Health in Baltimore, and Emory University in Atlanta. Initial safety and immunogenicity data from the Phase 1 trial are expected by January 2017. If results show a favorable safety profile and immune response, NIAID plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in Zika-endemic countries in early 2017.","Published: August 4, 2016"

A study led by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital found that obese mice are not protected against influenza infections by vaccines that include adjuvants, raising concerns about vaccine effectiveness in obese humans who are known to be at an increased risk for severe flu. The findings appear today in the scientific journal mBio.  This is the first study to show that current strategies to bolster the effectiveness of flu vaccines protected lean mice from serious illness but fell short of protecting obese mice from infections,  said corresponding author Stacey Schultz-Cherry, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases. The strategies include increasing the vaccine dose and adding substances called adjuvants to vaccines to boost the immune response. The findings come amid ongoing concerns about flu pandemics launched by avian flu viruses and the global rise of obesity. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of adults worldwide and 42 million children under the age of 5 now qualify as obese. Obesity leaves individuals at increased risk for flu-related complications, including hospitalization and death.  There is a critical public health need to translate these findings to humans and understand vaccine response in this growing segment of the population,  Schultz-Cherry said. Vaccination remains the most effective flu prevention strategy and a key element in pandemic flu preparedness. Meanwhile, research continues at St. Jude and elsewhere to develop more effective flu vaccines, particularly for high-risk groups, including the elderly, pregnant women and obese individuals. This study used vaccines prepared from killed viruses that are the basis of flu shots. The vaccines targeted an influenza A H1N1 seasonal flu strain as well as A(H7N9), a virus considered to have the potential to trigger a human pandemic. Researchers looked at the immune response to vaccination in lean and obese mice, including how vaccine dose and different adjuvants impacted that response. Both methods have been used to improve vaccine effectiveness in older adults and other high-risk groups. While adjuvants improved the immune response to vaccinations in both lean and obese mice, the overall immune response was reduced in the obese animals compared to their lean counterparts. Following vaccination, the obese mice had lower antibody levels, including lower levels of neutralizing antibodies, and higher levels of the virus. In addition, lean mice who received vaccines with adjuvants were protected from severe flu infections. Obese mice were not.  The addition of adjuvants to the vaccines led to levels of neutralizing antibodies in both the lean and obese mice that have been considered to be protective. Surprisingly that did not translate into protection from flu infection or fatal disease in the obese animals,  Schultz-Cherry said. That suggests that obese individuals may be at risk for flu infections even if their blood antibodies reach what have been considered protective levels, she said. A four-fold increase in the dose of A(H7N9) vaccine bolstered the immune response in both lean and obese mice, but failed to protect the heavier animals from flu-related deaths. Protective antibodies from lean mice also failed to protect obese mice from flu infections.  That suggests the problem lies with the immune response of the obese animals rather than the antibodies themselves,  said first author Erik Karlsson, Ph.D., a staff scientist in the Schultz-Cherry laboratory.  The obese mice seemed more susceptible to the virus, which remained elevated following vaccination compared to blood levels in lean animals.  The virus penetrates more deeply into the lungs of obese mice, and the animals seem to have a more difficult time repairing the damage,  Schultz-Cherry said.","Published: August 4, 2016"

The UPCI team showed that when immune T cells enter the tumor microenvironment, their mitochondria which act as mini-factories inside cells, making energy and crucial reagents a cell needs to survive begin to shrink and disappear, indicating that the T cell is out of fuel and can t do its tumor-destroying job. The finding, reported online today and scheduled for next week s issue of the journal Immunity, opens the door to several potential clinical approaches that could help keep T cells functioning and boost the body s ability to fight cancer.    Immunotherapy to stimulate the body s immune system has increasingly become the way we treat people with aggressive cancers. It s effective for a subset of patients, but the truth is that only about 20 to 40 percent of patients will respond to the treatment, and it is still unclear why,  said senior author Greg M. Delgoffe, Ph.D., assistant professor of immunology and member of the Tumor Microenvironment Center at UPCI, partner with UPMC CancerCenter.  It s a huge question in the cancer immunotherapy field, and we think we ve found a big part of the answer.  As tumors grow, they build a microenvironment, which develops its own blood supply and keeps the tumor thriving, protected and voraciously consuming all available nutrients.  When T cells enter the microenvironment, it s as if they re  automobiles that suddenly had the emergency brake applied; they can t keep driving,  explained Dr. Delgoffe. Immunotherapies, like those that target negative regulators on the T cell surface, take these brakes off.  However, what we re discovering in many cases is that even though the brakes have been taken off, there isn t any fuel in the tank,  Dr. Delgoffe said. Or the lack of mitochondria in the tumor-infiltrating T cells keeps them from functioning.  This is an exciting discovery because we already have various strategies to  fill the fuel tank  and support T cell function in the tumor microenvironment,  said Dr. Delgoffe.  In laboratory experiments and tests with mice, Dr. Delgoffe and his team found that when they boosted the mitochondria in the T cells, they were better able to clear the tumor.   Dr. Delgoffe is partnering with other scientists to test various mitochondria-boosting strategies, including using drugs that already have proven safe in humans, such as those for type 2 diabetes, to stimulate T cell metabolism. He s also working with existing immunotherapy studies to further modify the T cells so that their metabolism functions better in the tumor microenvironment.","Published: August 4, 2016"

But scientists had never tracked cancer cells' search for oxygen in their early growth stages until now a step toward deeper understanding of one way cancer spreads that could help treat the disease. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, bioengineers from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pennsylvania report results showing how sarcoma cells in mice pursue a path toward greater concentrations of oxygen, almost as if they were following a widening trail of breadcrumbs. That path is suggested to lead the cells to blood vessels, through which the cells can spread to other parts of the body. ""If you think about therapeutic targets, you could target this process specifically,"" said the study's lead author, Sharon Gerecht, a professor in JHU's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and associate director of the Institute for NanoBioTechnology. Gerecht acknowledged that clinical application is a long way off. But she said these results, reached after three years of study in her laboratory, provide clues about a key part of the life cycle of soft-tissue sarcomas and also a proven way to test cancer treatments in the lab. Sarcoma is a cancer that affects connective tissue, including bones, muscles, tendons, cartilage, nerves, fat, and some blood vessels. The study focused specifically on soft tissue sarcoma that does not affect bones, which is diagnosed in some 13,000 patients a year in the United States. Roughly 25-50% of those patients develop recurring and spreading, or metastasizing, cancer. Gerecht and her seven co-authors four affiliated with Hopkins, three with the University of Pennsylvania tracked thousands of early-stage cancer cells taken from mice as they moved through a mockup of bodily tissue made of clear hydrogel in a petri dish. Hydrogel a water-based material with the consistency of gelatin replicates the environment surrounding cancer cells in human tissue. Kyung Min Park, a previous postdoctoral researcher in the Johns Hopkins lab, developed the hydrogel-cancer cell system, and Daniel Lewis, a Johns Hopkins graduate student, analyzed cellular migration and responses to rising oxygen concentrations, or ""gradients."" For this experiment, the hydrogels contained increasing concentrations of oxygen from the bottom of the hydrogel to the upper layer. That allowed researchers to track how cancer cells respond to different levels of oxygen, both within a tumor and within body tissues. Analysis of sarcoma tumors in mice, for instance, shows that the largest tumors have a large area of very low oxygen at the center. Smaller tumors have varying oxygen concentrations throughout. The researchers' first step was to show that cancer cells migrate more in low-oxygen or ""hypoxic"" hydrogels as compared with hydrogels containing as much oxygen as the surrounding atmosphere. They then looked at the direction of the cell movement. In the hydrogel, cells were found to move from areas of lower oxygen to higher. Researchers also found that the medication minoxidil widely used to treat hair loss and known by its trade name Rogaine stopped the movement of cancer cells through the hydrogel. Cancer cells are known to modify their environment to make it easier for them to move though it, but this study takes that understanding a step further, Gerecht said. ""We did not know it was the oxygen"" that effectively directs the movement, she said. ""It's suggesting oxygen gradient affects early stages of the metastasis process."" The study also demonstrates the three-dimensional hydrogel model as an effective tool for testing cancer treatments in a laboratory, the authors wrote. Gerecht said a human patient's cancer cells could be placed into the hydrogel just as the mouse cells were, allowing clinicians to see how they respond before treatments are given to patients.","Published: August 4, 2016"

(PGDx) have announced an agreement that will enable cancer patients using the Cure Forward Patient Activation platform to select PGDx as their genomic testing service provider. Under the terms of the agreement, PGDx will make its genomic testing results directly available to cancer patients through the Cure Forward platform. The data will be provided in interoperable formats, so that it can be directly applied by patients to further their own care. Further details of the nonexclusive agreement were not disclosed. At Cure Forward, patients and their families can retrieve and use molecular profiling data to understand their disease, connect with others who share their specific diagnosis and treatment history, and connect to clinical trials. The centerpiece of the Cure Forward platform is its Clinical Trial Exchange, where patients can post relevant information about themselves. Clinical trial recruiters can then view patients  anonymized profiles and invite them to apply for inclusion in relevant trials. The mechanism is designed to facilitate the process by presenting patient data in a format that can be compared against the inclusion and exclusion criteria provided by trial recruiters in their searches, including DNA biomarker criteria.  PGDx was established by cancer researchers at Johns Hopkins in response to requests from patients and their physicians for access to advanced genomic testing. We are committed to working with other innovative companies to expand that access, and it is accordingly fitting for us to join forces with Cure Forward, whose innovative platform is designed to empower patients with the DNA biomarker data that is essential for optimizing their cancer treatment,  said Douglas Ward, Chief Executive Officer at PGDx.  Cure Forward believes that adoption of precision medicine is enhanced when patients are able to participate directly, and we welcome the opportunity to support their efforts.  Results from PGDx tests will be reported to ordering physicians through diagnostic reports and patients will then be able to use information from the reports to request and receive their data through the Cure Forward platform. Receiving one s data is a legal right of all patients in the US through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This collaboration makes it easier for patients to access and use their genomic data quickly whilekeeping their physicians involved in the process.  At Cure Forward, we want every patient to be able to address their disease with the best possible science. We believe that clinical trials are an important consideration at every stage of a person s care, and we want to make it easy for people to identify trial options,  said Martin Naley, Cure Forward s Founder and Chief Strategy Officer.

Neuropathy, damage or disease affecting the peripheral nervous system, can range from rare conditions linked to a patient s exome to more common causes like diabetes and viral infections. Neuropathies can affect both motor and sensory neurons, producing muscle weakness, numbness, pain, and a wide range of symptoms. The study was published in the journal Science Signaling and was a collaboration between the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee; and Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. These types of discoveries underscore the importance of the families who volunteer to participate in clinical research.  This case superbly illustrates how the intensive study of children with very rare neurological disorders can lead quickly to a deep knowledge of a specific genetic condition, as well as uncover mysteries of the nervous system relevant to a wide spectrum of disorders,  said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., director of NINDS. In their report, researchers examined a 10-year-old child with early onset, progressive neuropathy primarily affecting his ability to walk, grasp, and perform fine motor skills. When the patient s complete genetic makeup, or genome, was analyzed, a mutation was found in the gene associated with the protein KCC3. This protein is important for the ability of cells to respond to swelling. When a neuron swells, KCC3 is involved in the mechanism that drives fluid out, returning the cell to normal. In the absence of this protein (in what is called a loss-of-function mutation), extreme swelling of the neurons can occur, which in turn leads to nerve damage. In the study, the patient s mutation affected the ability of KCC3 to turn off once it was no longer needed, leading to the opposite effect shrunken neurons that also fail to communicate properly. This is referred to as a gain-of-function mutation, causing the affected protein to behave in a new and damaging way.  This protein, KCC3, has been connected to other forms of neuropathy in the past,  said Carsten G. Bonnemann, M.D., a senior investigator in the Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section at NINDS and a senior author of the paper.  What s unique here is that this is the first time that we have seen a gain-of-function mutation in the KCC3 protein that leads to neuropathy.  Loss-of-function KCC3 mutations often affect the development of the brain, producing detrimental cognitive changes in addition to both sensory and motor neuropathies. In contrast, the patient described in this report had neuropathy only in the motor neurons and showed no behavioral or developmental changes.  We wanted to take a closer look at the direct effects of this mutation on the muscles and nerves, so we created a mouse model with the same genetic change as our patient,  said Dr. Bonnemann.  When we tested this mouse, we saw many of the same physical deficits, including problems with movement and coordination, and a decrease in the ability of neurons to send signals to the muscles. This shows that this mutation is likely to be the main cause for our patient s neuropathy.  While the exact mechanism that causes the neuropathy remains unclear and will be the focus of further study, identifying a specific molecular target, KCC3, opens the door to studies of potential treatments using U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. One such drug, furosemide (also known by its trade name, Lasix), is a diuretic that is prescribed to treat fluid retention, kidney disorders, and high blood pressure. Furosemide is part of a class of drugs that inhibits the function of KCC3 in a way that is unaffected and even enhanced by the gain-of-function mutation. We were able to identify what this particular mutation does, so we have a specific target for therapeutic development. Because furosemide inhibits the function of the transporter that is improperly activated in our patient, we may one day be able to use drugs like furosemide to intervene in the progression of neuropathies caused by this type of mutation,  said Dr. Bonnemann. This work was supported by the NIH (GM74771, MH064913-11A1, and AR056993), the NINDS intramural program, the Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, and the March of Dimes.","Published: August 4, 2016"

People diagnosed with ALS slowly lose the ability to control muscle movement, and are ultimately unable to speak, eat, move, or breathe. The cellular mechanisms behind ALS are also found in certain types of dementia. See Also: Cold-shock protein protects against neurodegeneration A recent scientific study published in Nature Medicine has found one way an RNA binding protein may contribute to ALS disease progression. Cells make RNA to carry instructions for making proteins from DNA to protein-constructing machinery. The culprit protein, TDP-43, normally binds to small pieces of newly read RNA and helps shuttle the fragments around inside nerve cell nuclei. The study describes for the first time the molecular consequences of misplaced TDP-43 inside nerve cells, and demonstrates that correcting its location can restore nerve cell function. Misplacement of TDP-43 in nerve cells is a hallmark of ALS and other neurological disorders including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Studies that characterize common mechanisms behind these diseases could have widespread implications and may also accelerate development of broad-based therapies. To find the misplaced TDP-43, the researchers viewed nerve cells donated by people who died from ALS or FTD under high powered microscopes. They discovered TDP-43 accumulates in nerve cell mitochondria, critical structures responsible for generating the enormous amount of energy nerve cells require. By physically isolating the affected mitochondria the researchers were able to pinpoint TDP-43's exact location inside the subcellular structures. They were also able to characterize variations of the protein most likely to get misplaced. Learn More: Infertile worms resist infection-induced neurodegeneration This important work was led by Xinglong Wang, PhD, from the department of pathology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and a team of scientists from his laboratory. ""By multiple approaches, we have identified the mitochondrial inner membrane facing matrix as the major site for mitochondrial TDP-43,"" explained Wang. ""Mitochondria might be major accumulation sites of TDP-43 in dying neurons in various major neurodegenerative diseases."" The researchers discovered that once inside the mitochondria, TDP-43 resumes its RNA binding role and attaches itself to mitochondrial genetic material. This disrupts the mitochondria's ability to generate energy for the cell. Wang's team was able to precisely identify the RNA in mitochondria that was bound by TDP-43 and observe the resultant disassembly of mitochondrial protein complexes. This finding provides much needed clarity on the consequences of TDP-43 misplacement inside nerve cells and opens the door for deeper studies involving a range of neurological disorders. Although the study focused on ALS and FTD, according to Wang ""mislocalization of TDP-43 represents a key pathological feature correlating strongly with symptoms in more than half of Alzheimer's disease patients."" Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 have long been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and FTD. Wang's team found that disease-associated mutations in TDP-43 enhance its misplacement inside nerve cells. The researchers also identified sections of TDP-43 that are recognized by mitochondria and serve as signals to let it inside. These sections could serve as therapeutic targets, as the study found blocking them prevents TDP-43 from localizing inside mitochondria. Importantly, Wang's team was able to keep TDP-43 out of nerve cell mitochondria in mice using small proteins which ""almost completely"" prevented nerve cell toxicity and disease progression. ""We, for the first time, provide the novel concept that the inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization is sufficient to prevent TDP-43-linked neurodegeneration,"" said Wang. ""Targeting mitochondrial TDP-43 could be a novel therapeutic approach for ALS, FTD and other TDP-43-linked neurodegenerative diseases."" Don't Miss: Dysfunctional endosomes are early sign of neurodegenerationWang has begun to develop small proteins that prevent TDP-43 from reaching mitochondria in human nerve cells, and has a patent pending for the therapeutic molecule used in the study.

See Also: This is your brain on exerciseExercise is well known for its cognitive benefits, thought to occur because it causes neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which is a key brain region for learning, memory and mood regulation. Therefore, it was a surprise in 2014 when a research study, published in the journal Science, found that exercise caused mice to forget what they'd already learned. ""It stunned the field of hippocampal neurogenesis,"" said Ashok K. Shetty, PhD, a professor in the Texas A&M College of Medicine Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, associate director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and research career scientist at the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System. ""It was a very well-done study, so it caused some concern that exercise might in some way be detrimental for memory."" The animal models in the exercise group in the previous study showed far more neurogenesis than the control group, but contrary to what one might think, these additional neurons seemed to erase memories that were formed before they started the exercise regimen. To test this, the researchers removed the extra neurons, and the mice suddenly were able to remember again. Learn More: Study shows benefits of multi-tasking on exercise ""The mice who exercised had a large number of new neurons,"" Shetty said, ""but somehow that seemed to break down the old connections, making them forget what they knew."" Shetty and his team decided to replicate this earlier research, using rats instead of mice. Rats are thought to be more like humans physiologically, with more-similar neuronal workings. They found that luckily for runners everywhere these animal models showed no such degradation in memories. ""We had completely contradictory findings from the 2014 study,"" said Maheedhar Kodali, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine and the first author of this study. ""Now we need to study other species to fully understand this phenomenon."" Shetty and his team trained their animal models to complete a task over the course of four days, followed by several days of memory consolidation by performing the task over and over again. Then, half the trained animal models were put into cages with running wheels for several weeks, while the control group remained sedentary. The rats who ran further over the course of that time had much greater neurogenesis in their hippocampus, and all rats who had access to a wheel (and therefore ran at least some), had greater neurogenesis than the sedentary group. On an average, they ran about 48 miles in four weeks, and neuron formation doubled in the hippocampus of these animals. ""This is pretty clear evidence that exercise greatly increases neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which has functional implications,"" Kodali said. ""Neurogenesis is important for maintaining normal mood function, as well as for learning and creating new memories."" This connection may help explain why exercise is an effective antidepressant. Importantly, despite differing levels of increased neurogenesis, both moderate runners and brisk runners (those who ran further than average) in Shetty's study showed the same ability as the sedentary runners to recall the task they learned before they began to exercise. This means even a large amount of running (akin to people who perform significant amount of exercise on a daily basis) doesn't interfere with the recall of memory. Don't Miss: Can physical exercise enhance long-term memory? This new research should provide some comfort to those who read the earlier research and worried that their nightly run is causing them to forget things. ""Exercise is not at all harmful,"" Shetty said. ""It doesn't cause any memory problems, and there are many studies proving its benefits for making new memories and maintaining good mood. Now, our study showed that exercise does not interfere with memory recall ability. Keep exercising, and don't worry about losing your old memories.""

After only a few weeks, both patients, which were severely hyperphagic before the study start, showed a normalization of their hunger feeling as well as a significant reduction of body weight. Results from this study have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Learn More: Obesity surgery normalizes brain opioids Our understanding of the factors involved in the dysregulation of normal body weight remains rudimentary. However it is known that mutations in certain genes play could lead to the development of early onset obesity due to a severe hyperphagia. MC4R is one example; it provides the blueprint for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), which regulates energy balance and weight. Activation of the receptor by MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) leads to a reduction in the sensation of hunger. Patients deficient in MSH show severe hyperphagia, and develop obesity within the first months of life. The study team, led by Dr. Peter K hnen a physician at the Institute for Experimental Pediatric Endocrinology treated two patients with congenital proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency. POMC is a precursor of the hormone MSH, and is secreted by the hypothalamus; deficiency causes significantly increased hunger. The researchers set out to test whether the new drug might replace the effect of the prohormone through targeted activation of the satiety center. First effects were recorded within a few weeks of the start of treatment. Patient 1, whose starting weight was 155 kg (342 lbs), achieved a total weight loss of 51 kg (122 lbs) over a period of 42 weeks; patient 2 (starting weight 152.8 kg (337 lbs)) lost a total of 20.5 kg (45 lbs) over the course of 12 weeks.

Whether it is Mozart, Hendrix, Miles Davis, or tribal drumming, few activities feel as uniquely human as music. And, indeed, for a long time, most scientists believed that Homo sapiens was the only species capable of creating and responding to rhythm and melody. Don't Miss: Move over Mozart: Study shows cats prefer their own beat This view, however, was challenged profoundly in 2009, when a cockatoo called Snowball was shown to be an able dancer. Snowball bopping along to pop songs clearly demonstrated that non-human species had the neurobiological apparatus required to process rhythmic stimuli and move in time them. And now following investigations that have shown that chimps, bonobos, parrots and budgerigars have similar capabilities a study of a head-bobbing Californian sea lion called Ronan has provided data that may aid scientists in their quest to understand the biological roots of musicality. Ronan was placed in captivity when she was about a year old after failing to thrive in the wild. Her new team of keepers had previously explored the cognitive abilities of sea lions, and in what was originally a side-project explored at weekends, Peter Cook and Andrew Rouse decided to see if Ronan could keep a beat. Rewarding her with fish treats every time she successfully nodded along to a click track, Cook and Rouse eventually found that Ronan could beat-keep better than any other non-human animal. Later, she learnt to dance to pop songs too; her favourite is Earth, Wind and Fire's Boogie Wonderland. See Also: Engineering music to sound better with cochlear implants They published an initial report in 2013 documenting this skill, which included numerous control experiments that confirmed that she was truly responding to the rhythmic input. And now in a paper in Frontiers in Neuroscience, Rouse and the team take their analysis a step further. ""A lot of the work that has been done on beat-keeping in general to show whether a person or an animal is entrained has used an observational approach, which looks at how close the animal is to each individual beat,"" explains Rouse. But such studies ""don't reveal any underlying cause."" To probe the brain mechanisms responsible for beat-keeping, Rouse says you must, ""get a person or animal moving to the beat, then change the rhythm suddenly and look at how they adapt to the change, how they find the beat again."" This is what they did. After shifting either the tempo or phase of the click track that Ronan was bobbing her head to, the researchers carefully charted how her movements were recalibrated. Something they also did by playing Boogie Wonderland at different speeds. And then they tested if a simple mathematical equation could account for the data. The equation they used was from the physics of coupled oscillators which can be as stripped down as two swinging pendulums. Applying this to the brain, the theory behind the experiment is that to move in time to music, the neural activity in auditory brain centres first oscillates in synchrony with the rhythmic input and then this oscillation entrains an oscillation in the neurons of the motor centers that drive movement. This idea lies at the core of the neural resonance theory of music. And previous studies in people had shown that the equation describes well human beat-keeping. Rouse says that they asked, ""Does Ronan's behaviour fit this proposed model? And we found that it does."" One thing that is important about Ronan is that sea lions are not ""vocal mimics."" All the previous animals that had been shown to have beat-keeping abilities had been of species that have vocal flexibility. This suggested that perhaps the skill was dependent on specialised neural circuits that are required for vocal flexibility. Ronan's achievements and their accordance with an equation that simply describes two oscillating entities (in this case, oscillating populations of active neurons) suggest that the neural underpinnings of beat-keeping may be more ancient and widespread than previously thought. Learn More: Listening to classical music modulates genes responsible for various brain functions Here, though, Rouse is cautious, he says the work doesn't specifically distinguish between theories of musicality. He says we need to look further at all theories but that this opens up ""a new avenue of exploration."" Discussing why it took so long to appreciate the beat-keeping ability of non-human creatures, and the possibility that it is a skill lying dormant in many animals, Rouse discusses just how much practice humans get; how deeply and widely music is embedded in human culture. From a very early age babies are bounced on their mothers' knees, they are exposed to nursery rhymes and music is all around them. ""This coupling between auditory and motor regions, we have kind of beaten into us from day one,"" he says, ""Other animals don't."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The research, funded by Worldwide Cancer Research, clears the way for the therapy s safer use in humans. The findings were recently published in Nano Research. Biological signalling molecules called  cytokines  are made by white blood cells in the body. Cytokine-based anticancer treatments can be very effective, but they can also cause serious immune reactions in patients, limiting their use. In an effort to reduce these unwanted side-effects, a group of Milan-based researchers including Dr Flavio Curnis and Professor Angelo Corti at the Fondazione Centro San Raffaele used the latest technology to develop a new type of targeted anticancer cytokine treatment called NGR-TNF. NGR-TNF combines a cytokine called TNF with a short  coded  protein fragment called an NGR peptide. The peptide acts much like a postcode on a letter- actively directing the drug straight to tumour blood vessels where it can cause the most damage. And they ve already had some success- a version of NGR-TNF is currently in clinical trials for patients with a rare form of cancer often caused by asbestos exposure. But the researchers wanted to go further. In this latest study they show that attaching tiny gold  nanogold  particles no bigger than a polio virus to the NGR peptide might help even more of the drug to reach the tumour. The new super-charged NGR-TNF therapy was able to delay tumour growth in cancer-prone mice without any noticeable side-effects. This suggests the drug was able to reach active levels in tumour tissue while staying at low, safe, levels everywhere else - potentially opening the door for its use in other cancers.  Cytokines like TNF have the potential to be very effective cancer treatments, but the high concentrations traditionally needed to kill cancer cells can also damage healthy cells,  says Dr Curnis.  This means TNF is currently only used to treat patients with sarcomas in the extremities.   We found that the NGR-TNF-nanogold based therapy was able to delay tumour growth in mice even at very low doses, and didn t cause any unwanted toxic reactions. These new findings provide  proof-of-concept  that NGR-tagged nanogold could potentially be used for low-dose cytokine delivery- hopefully with reduced side-effects.' The particularly unreactive nature of gold has made it popular for all sorts of medical uses over the centuries, from smallpox cures to dental fillings. And nanomedicine researchers are still exploiting the yellow metal s properties today. But this is the first time a nanomedicine combining the cancer-targeting powers of both the NGR peptide and gold particles has been developed.  We believe this new nanodrug formulation could represent a second generation of NGR-TNF,  says Dr Curnis.  The next step is now to optimize it further. Specifically, we need to improve its chemical stability and simplify the production process. It s exciting but years of work and significant investment is still needed to bring the drug to patients.  Dr Helen Rippon, Chief Executive of Worldwide Cancer Research said:  Using gold in nanomedicines to tackle cancer is a really novel and exciting area of cancer research. This project we funded in Milan is just one example of how important it is to invest in the best ideas for cancer research, no matter where in the world they come from.  This work is all still taking place in the lab and the next few steps needed to bring it to patients which will take time. But Dr Curnis and his team have got off to a great start developing a potentially new cancer nanotherapy.","Published: August 3, 2016"

As reported in the journal Nature Nanotechnology*, the IBM team s results show size-based separation of bioparticles down to 20 nanometers (nm) in diameter, a scale that gives access to important particles such as DNA, viruses and exosomes. Once separated, these particles can potentially be analyzed by physicians to reveal signs of disease even before patients experience any physical symptoms and when the outcome from treatment is most positive. Until now, the smallest bioparticle that could be separated by size with on-chip technologies was about 50 times or larger, for example, separation of circulating tumor cells from other biological components. IBM is collaborating with a team from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to continue development of this lab-on-a-chip technology and plans to test it on prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men in the U.S.  In the era of precision medicine, exosomes are increasingly being viewed as useful biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of malignant tumors. Exosomes are released in easily accessible bodily fluids such as blood, saliva or urine. They represent a precious biomedical tool as they can be used in the context of less invasive liquid biopsies to reveal the origin and nature of a cancer.  The IBM team targeted exosomes with their device as existing technologies face challenges for separating and purifying exosomes in liquid biopsies. Exosomes range in size from 20-140nm and contain information about the health of the originating cell that they are shed from. A determination of the size, surface proteins and nucleic acid cargo carried by exosomes can give essential information about the presence and state of developing cancer and other diseases.  IBM s results show they could separate and detect particles as small as 20 nm from smaller particles, that exosomes of size 100 nm and larger could be separated from smaller exosomes, and that separation can take place in spite of diffusion, a hallmark of particle dynamics at these small scales. With Mt. Sinai, the team plans to confirm their device is able to pick up exosomes with cancer-specific biomarkers from patient liquid biopsies.  The ability to sort and enrich biomarkers at the nanoscale in chip-based technologies opens the door to understanding diseases such as cancer as well as viruses like the flu or Zika,  said Gustavo Stolovitzky, Program Director of Translational Systems Biology and Nanobiotechnology at IBM Research.  Our lab-on-a-chip device could offer a simple, noninvasive and affordable option to potentially detect and monitor a disease even at its earliest stages, long before physical symptoms manifest. This extra amount of time allows physicians to make more informed decisions and when the prognosis for treatment options is most positive.  With the ability to sort bioparticles at the nanoscale, Mt. Sinai hopes that IBM s technology can provide a new method to eavesdrop on the messages carried by exosomes for cell-to-cell communications. This can elucidate important questions about the biology of diseases as well as pave the way to noninvasive and eventually affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools.  Monitoring this intercellular conversation more regularly could allow medical experts to track an individual s state of health or progression of a disease.  When we are ahead of the disease we usually can address it well; but if the disease is ahead of us, the journey is usually much more difficult. One of the important developments that we are attempting in this collaboration is to have the basic grounds to identify exosome signatures that can be there very early on before symptoms appear or before a disease becomes worse,  said Dr. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, Professor and Chairman for the Mount Sinai Health System Department of Pathology.  By bringing together Mount Sinai s domain expertise in cancer and pathology with IBM s systems biology experience and its latest nanoscale separation technology, the hope is to look for specific, sensitive biomarkers in exosomes that represent a new frontier to offering clues that might hold the answer to whether a person has cancer or how to treat it.  Sorting bioparticles at the nanoscale Lab-on-a-chip technologies have become an incredibly helpful diagnostic tool for physicians as they can be significantly faster, portable, easy to use and require less sample volume to help detect diseases. The goal is to shrink down to a single silicon chip all of the processes necessary to analyze a disease that would normally be carried out in a full-scale biochemistry lab. Using a technology called nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement, or nano-DLD, IBM scientists Dr. Joshua Smith and Dr. Benjamin Wunsch led development of a lab-on-a-chip technology that allows a liquid sample to be passed, in continuous flow, through a silicon chip containing an asymmetric pillar array. This array allows the system to sort a microscopic waterfall of nanoparticles, separating particles by size down to tens of nanometers resolution. IBM has already scaled down the chip size to 2cm by 2cm, while continuing development to increase the device density to improve functionality and throughput. Much like how a road through a small tunnel only allows smaller cars to pass while forcing bigger trucks to detour around, nano-DLD uses a set of pillars to deflect larger particles while allowing smaller particles to flow through the gaps of the pillar array unabated, effectively separating this particle  traffic  by size while not disrupting flow. Interestingly, IBM scientists noticed that nano-DLD arrays can also split a mixture of many different particle sizes into a spread of streams, much like a prism splits white light into different colors. The continuous flow nature of this technology circumvents stop-and-go batch processing typical of conventional separation techniques. Leveraging IBM s vast semiconductor expertise with its growing capabilities in experimental biology, IBM scientists used manufacturable silicon processes to produce the nano-DLD arrays for their lab-on-a-chip device.  As part of its on-going strategy, IBM researchers are working to increase the diversity of bioparticles that can be separated with their device, and improving the precision and specificity for real-world clinical applications.  *Nanoscale Lateral Displacement Arrays for Separation of Exosomes and Colloids Down to 20nm, Benjamin H.

Defenders called B-cells swarm into affected areas, unleashing antibody molecules that seek to destroy the invaders. This antibody army features a number of specialist classes: Some antibodies envelop invading pathogens or block them from entering healthy cells, while other antibodies create inflammation that can speed the healing process. Now, for the first time, Stanford researchers have mapped out how the human body creates antibodies of every class, revealing that a diverse set of antibody-producing cells springs from the same kind of ancestor.  How do we make all the players that protect us?  asked Felix Horns, a biophysics graduate student and first author of a paper published in the journal eLife.  What we ve done is measure that.  The eight-person research team was led by Horns  adviser, Stanford bioengineering Professor Stephen Quake, who believes that creating a comprehensive overview of the body s natural defense system will enable researchers to develop novel treatments for a variety of immune disorders.  This map will help us understand what goes awry in immune disease,  said Quake, who is also a professor of applied physics and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  As a result, we may be able to crack problems like allergies.  Building a family tree of B-cells To assemble their map, the researchers extracted the B-cells from blood samples from 22 young, healthy adults. Using a high-throughput genetic sequencing machine, which reads out the individual nucleotides that make up a cell s genetic code, they created a large library of antibody-producing genes from all the B-cells in the sample. They traced the lineage of B-cells by counting the number of acquired mutations in the cells  genes, finding that cells in later generations had more genetic mutations. The researchers also looked for evidence that the B-cells had switched the types of antibody they produced. This switching process allows the immune system to customize its response to incoming threats.  Each B-cell starts out as a single cell that makes a certain type of antibody,  Horns said.  If it protects you, it expands and creates descendants.  Using a variety of analytical techniques, the researchers were able to identify the various classes of antibodies and approximate their prevalence. About three-quarters of the cells the team analyzed were programmed to create the IgM antibody class. IgM is  the default class in which all antibodies are born,  Horns said.  When activated by immune challenge, they undergo class switching.  A large proportion of IgM cells switch to producing the IgG antibody class, the body s most important virus fighters. These cells can give rise to four different IgG sub-classes that have specific anti-viral properties. A lesser fraction of IgM-producing cells go on to create IgA antibodies, which fend off invading bacteria and also help  good  bacteria in the digestive tract stay in a healthy balance. The smallest number of IgM cells switch to producing the IgE antibody class, which triggers inflammation in the body and can create an allergic response if it becomes too active. Switching cells to fight disease Horns  insights into the class-switching process could lead to a range of new treatment approaches for immune disorders. In rare conditions such as hyper IgM syndrome, patients  cells lack the ability to switch antibody classes, leaving them vulnerable to a wide variety of infections. More common immune conditions may also result from class-switching defects. People with allergies, for instance, produce allergen-specific IgE antibodies, resulting in an overactive immune response. A few doctors have tried methods like  helminthic therapy,  which involves infecting patients with parasitic worms that tweak the body s antibody production. Horns envisions a more precise solution: designing drugs to mimic the signaling molecules that control the antibody class-switching process.  You can think about the worm as a very blunt instrument,  he said,  whereas you can imagine using a designer drug as a scalpel.  As a next step, Horns plans to sequence the genes of people who suffer from immune disorders. Finding out how their antibody production differs from his baseline map would be a key step toward creating drug therapies that would restore an optimal antibody balance.  Suppose we found someone who cannot make a certain type of antibody or makes it at a low rate,  Horns said.  We can convince [their] B-cells to switch to particular classes to fix the deficiency.

Additionally, a new patent is to be granted in the United States which extends the Company s intellectual property portfolio there. The main patent relating to the Affimer intellectual property is already granted in the US and Japan, and is pending in other territories. The European Patent Office has now made the decision to grant the European counterpart patent (2,279,205). Separately the US Patent Office has issued a Notice of Allowance relating to US patent application 14/478,910. This will extend the coverage of Avacta s intellectual property in the US to be in-line with the coverage now granted in Europe.  The Affimer technology is based on a small protein that has been engineered to present a  sticky  surface that can be made to bind strongly and specifically to a target of interest such as another protein, peptide or chemical. The way in which the protein has been engineered, to give it the ability to bind a target, is the core invention covered by Avacta s intellectual property.  The commercial value of this intellectual property lies partly in the use of the Affimer proteins to capture a target from a sample so that it can be detected and quantified as part of a new diagnostic test, for example, or may facilitate new laboratory assays that are used in a wide range of life sciences  research and development. Recently the Company demonstrated the benefits of Affimer technology by generating three new Affimer reagents each capable of specifically binding a protein biomarker of the Zika infection. Antibodies that bind this biomarker, without cross-reacting with biomarkers from related diseases, such as dengue fever, are not available and therefore these new Affimers offer the potential of a unique rapid diagnostic.  A further significant commercial opportunity for Affimer technology lies in therapeutic applications. If the binding of the Affimer to the target also blocks the target s normal function then this presents the opportunity to create new drugs to interrupt disease processes and provide therapeutic benefit. The Company is engaged in developing such Affimer inhibitors of disease processes involved in cancer and blood clotting, as well as working with partners to provide Affimer therapeutics for their drug programmes. Dr Alastair Smith, Avacta Group Chief Executive Officer, commented:  The granting of the European patent for the core Affimer intellectual property, as well as the extension of the scope of the patent protection in the US, is excellent news and adds further strength to our intellectual property position. We continue to develop the core technology and I look forward to updating the market regarding future patent applications as they occur.   ","Published: August 3, 2016"

Their therapeutic strategy includes a molecule on either end called an aptamer that targets, in this case, prostate cancer. Sandwiched in between are two smaller molecules, called siRNAs, that, once delivered inside the cell, can destroy the messenger RNA making those proteins. This novel combination of an aptamer on each end with two siRNAs in between also provides a new template for more effective, less toxic gene therapies for a wide range of cancers, like lung and breast cancer, that are common, complex and often deadly, said the research team at the Medical College of Georgia and Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University.  With two missiles, the binding power is increased,  said Dr. Hong Yan Liu, immunologist, biochemist and biomedical engineer at MCG s Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine.    It s also a way to get more siRNA to and inside the cell,  said the corresponding author of the study in the journal Scientific Reports. Giving the therapeutic system two arms   like the antibodies the body makes to defend against invaders   definitely gives it a better hold on its cancer target, said Dr. Jin-Xiong She, director of the Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Genomic Medicine. Liu used a three-dimensional aptamer targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, which is overexpressed on the surface of and inside prostate cancer cells, to help the siRNA find and enter the cancer cells.  We then targeted two tumor-dependent genes,  said Liu. She is talking about epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, and the aptly named survivin gene   since it prevents cells from committing suicide. Overexpression of EGFR is associated with prostate cancer that is resistant to current treatment strategies and prone to spreading to the bone. Survivin overexpression also is associated with treatment resistance, recurrence and disease spread. While the two function independently, they also can partner, sharing several signaling pathways. In fact, when EGFR inhibitors have been used previously, tumors may switch to the survivin pathway for survival. But the simultaneous attack on both by the scientists translated to suppressing the growth of cancer and the blood vessels it needs to survive in models where human prostate cancer cells were placed in immunodeficient mice and human cells were treated in a dish. Their model mimics middle-to-late stage prostate cancers, which is when this most common cancer in American males is diagnosed and when many existing therapies don t work. The small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, used to interrupt EGFR and survivin s support of prostate cancer have potential for  undruggable  cancer targets and there are plenty of them, said Dr. Daqing Wu, study co-author and cancer biologist at the Georgia Cancer Center and in the MCG Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Many of these cancer promoters hide inside cells where many drugs can t reach. Receptors on the cells surface, including EGFR, are considered  druggable,  Wu said. Still monoclonal antibody drugs already in use typically bind to the outside-membrane part of receptors, and while they are specific, they can t get inside cells where proteins like survivin also are found, Wu said. Small molecule drugs can get inside cells but typically lack specificity, which reduces their effectiveness and increases side effects.  This kind of delivery system is more practical for targeting undruggable targets,  Wu said. Cancer requires certain proteins to survive and proliferate that typically are different from healthy cells or, at least, present at much higher levels.  With this approach, you can specifically target the proteins that cancer cells are addicted to,  She said. DNA- or RNA-based therapies stop or reduce excessive production of these proteins most typically by blocking or reducing gene expression or production of the messenger RNA that ultimately makes the proteins.  When you stop protein production, cancer cells will divide and die,  She said. Like other approaches, this one isn t perfect since, for example, the synthetically produced siRNA can degrade rapidly and needs clear directions to find the target messenger RNA inside cancer cells. Next steps, which are underway, include identifying missiles and protein targets for other cancers and more for prostate cancer as well. Cancers, particularly at advanced stages, become more heterogeneous, meaning they utilize more pathways to survive and thrive, which is why most current treatments are combinations of drugs and targets. Pathways and proteins can even vary from one patient to the next with the same type of cancer, so finding multiple proteins for targeting enhances efficacy, Wu said.","Published: August 3, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/measuring-cell-growth-and-division-200453,Measuring Cell Growth and Division The improved sequencing tool from the IBS Center for RNA Research reveals dynamic changes of poly A  tails in eggs and embryos  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In the paper, published in the journal Genes and Development on July 10, the IBS research team, led by the director of the Center for RNA, V Narry KIM, presented mTAIL-seq, a hyper sensitive upgraded tool to measure poly(A) tail length of mRNAs at the genomic scale. By revealing the dynamic poly(A) regulation during the translation of RNA into protein, the study furthered our understanding as to how the fabric of life is shaped: from the color of your skin to your hair to how tall you will grow. The essential three & the building blocks of life All life on Earth requires three separate but equally essential biological molecules that serve a critical function in a cell: Proteins, DNA and RNA. Proteins are the workers; they perform diverse catalytic and structural roles within cells. Both DNA and RNA carry genetic information that s inherited from generation to generation. They are the reason why some people have black hair, others blond with blue eyes and others still with green eyes. Central dogma is a biological concept that explains how DNA and RNA interact to produce proteins. Developed in the late 50 s, by British molecular biologist Francis Crick, the concept fundamentally outlines the three stages: DNA replicates its information using many enzymes after which DNA s encoded information is transcribed into RNA whereupon a variation of RNA is translated into proteins. During the transcribing process various forms of RNA are synthesized, each has an essential function to help create a template for future construction of protein. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the architect and instructs transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) on how to correctly assemble amino acids that, when combined into chains, create proteins: the building blocks of all life. mTAIL-seq: a highly sensitive and cost effective tool to measure poly(A) tail in eggs-to-embryos development The IBS team focused on oocytes (eggs) in which maternal mRNAs are deposited in a dormant state, yet to be translated into proteins. In early embryos, where transcription is silent, the activation of the dormant mRNAs is vital for the proper production of proteins; thus a deeper understanding of the regulation of maternal mRNAs can reveal how oocytes establish the maternal characteristics of embryos. The key mechanism to controlling maternal mRNAs is the regulation of poly(A) tail: A chain booster that s added to mRNA to increase its stability and promote protein synthesis. Inside an oocyte, long poly(A) tails are added to mRNAs, allowing for them to translate and build proteins; proteins that are required for early embryonic development. The team s upgraded tool, mTAIL-seq, allows enhanced sequencing depth for mRNA at a rate of 1,000 finer than its predecessor. First author, Dr. LIM Jaechul explains further, ""We used mTAIL-seq to measure poly(A) length of maternal mRNAs in oocyte-to-embryo development. From the genomic scale analysis, we found global dynamic poly(A) tail regulation without the change of mRNA abundance."" Comparing two indices for one complete picture Ribosome profiling (RPF) data measures the efficiency of translation, from mRNA to protein, the second step in central dogma. When the RNA team compared the RPF data with data acquired from mTAIL-seq they found a strong coupling between poly(A) tail length and the translational efficiency at early embryo stage. This data, according to the team s manuscript, ""suggests that regulation of poly(A) tails in oocytes shapes the maternal characteristics {translatomic landscape} of embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development."" ""The global profiling of poly(A) tails by mTAIL-seq provides a comprehensive resource for the regulation of poly(A) tails in Drosophila {fruit flies} oocyte-to-embryo development and it help us to understand how poly(A) tail of maternal mRNA affect the production of proteins at the beginning of embryonic development,"" said the first author Dr. Mihye LEE. Due to the high sensitivity and low cost of mTAIL-seq not to mention its technical robustness and broad accessibility, the team think their invention will be a potent tool to improve understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse biological systems.","Published: August 3, 2016"

Lead researcher Professor Thomas Preiss from The John Curtin School of Medical Research at ANU said the finding opens new avenues of research into RNAs - short-lived copies of the genetic information stored in DNA. ""In studying how RNA-protein interactions govern genome function in the heart, we saw potential for both the generation of knowledge and ultimately the development of new therapy,"" Professor Preiss said. ""So we endeavoured to establish a collection of RNA-binding proteins that are active in heart muscle cells."" Heart disease is a leading cause of death in Australia with an average one death due to heart disease in Australia every 27 minutes. All cellular life uses DNA to store genetic information and to pass it on through the generations. But the information is useless unless it is copied into the chemically similar but more versatile nucleic acid molecules called RNA. RNA carries the code for making proteins, the bricks and mortar of life, but it also has noncoding regulatory roles that are particularly important in architecturally complex beings such as humans. ""In recent years we have even come to think of the genome as an RNA-making machine,"" Professor Preiss said. ""Much research is rightfully directed at understanding RNA. But RNA does not act alone, rather it functions in coordination with RNA-binding proteins."" The research team identified over one thousand such proteins by using innovative proteomic methods, developed by Professor Matthias Hentze and colleagues from EMBL, which is Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences. The new methods allowed them to catch proteins in the act of binding to RNA, and also identify what part of the protein was in contact with the nucleic acid. This led them to identify new types of protein surfaces capable of interacting with RNA. The process enabled the researchers to identify hundreds of proteins that were not known to bind to RNA. ""Many of these proteins already have a well understood day job, for example in cellular metabolism, and yet here they were interacting with RNA. We are now trying to understand why they engage in this moonlighting activity,"" Professor Hentze said. Research team member Dr Yalin Liao, also from The John Curtin School of Medical Research, said the project revealed that dozens of metabolic enzymes bound RNA. ""We started with this project thinking that we will find new proteins that help the RNA to function. But we are now also considering that in some cases there could be RNAs that help the protein to function,"" Dr Liao said. ""Our compendium of RNA-binding proteins in the heart will provide many new angles for research and could ultimately lead to a cure for heart disease.""","Published: August 3, 2016"

The findings, published online in the July issue of the journal EBioMedicine, may have important implications for breast cancer screening and prevention.  EBV, one of eight known viruses in the herpes family to infect humans, is also one of the most common viruses and is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis. More than 90 percent of the world s population carries EBV, and most individuals experience no effects from infection. In certain individuals, however, EBV has been linked to various cancers, including African Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Also, an association of EBV infection with breast cancer has been reported in several studies, but it s unclear how the virus may play a role in breast cancer development and/or progression.  To investigate, a team led by Gerburg Wulf, MD, PhD, a physician scientist in the Hematology/Oncology Division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, cultured breast cells called primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in the presence of EBV.  The researchers found that the virus binds to the CD21 receptor on normal breast cells, leading to infection. EBV infection causes the cells to take on characteristics of stem cells, which can keep dividing. When MECs were implanted into mice, EBV infection cooperated with certain cancer-causing proteins to accelerate the formation of breast cancer. When the investigators analyzed the genes of MECs infected with EBV, they found genetic characteristics associated with high-grade, estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer (an aggressive form of the disease).   We think that if a young woman develops EBV during her teenage years or later, her breast epithelial cells will be exposed to the virus and can be infected. While for most individuals, there will be no long-term consequences, in some the infection may leave genetic scars and change the metabolism of these cells,  explained Wulf.  While these are subtle changes, they may, decades later, facilitate breast cancer formation.  The research indicates that a contribution of EBV to the development of breast cancer is plausible, through a mechanism in which EBV infection predisposes MECs to become malignant but is no longer required once the cells have become cancerous.  The findings further make the case for an EBV vaccine that might protect children from infection and later EBV-associated malignancies,  said Wulf. ","Published: August 3, 2016"

Quantifying water content is one of the most common chemical tests, with more than 130 million processes carried out each year globally. Testing pharmaceutical drugs is required by the FDA and represents an important and costly investment on the part of drug manufacturers.  Every therapeutic drug has a narrow range of optimal water content, which needs to be controlled to avoid potential adverse effects on patients,  said Daniel Armstrong, UTA s Robert A. Welch Chair in Chemistry and leader of the project.  In addition to other advantages like speed and lower costs, our new system can also be automated, reducing labor costs for manufacturers with potential economic benefits for consumers.  In a paper published recently in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences on  Water determination in Solid Pharmaceutical Products using Ionic Liquids and Headspace Gas Chromatography,  Armstrong and his graduate student Lillian Frink described using a headspace gas chromatography analytical method with ionic liquid tubular capillary gas chromatographic columns, which were only commercialized this year. For the detector, they used the new Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Tracera GC-2010 Plus, which is extremely sensitive to water. Chromatography is the process of separating a chemical mixture to measure its components.  It s used in the fields of forensics, food and drug regulation and athlete testing, as well as to solve critical medical problems like determining the antibodies that are more effective in neutralizing Ebola during the last epidemic. Headspace gas chromatography or HSGC involves the measuring of volatile analytes, or chemical components, as they diffuse into a  headspace  at the top of a sealed vial containing the sample, including solids. The new method combines HSGC with the use of two different ionic liquids, one as a solvent in the tube of sample and one to line the ionic liquid column. Ionic liquids consist of a mixture of positively and negatively charged molecules and enable the separation. The researchers compared the effectiveness and accuracy of their new method against two established methods, Karl Fischer titration and  loss on drying,  which involves putting the sample in a vacuum oven over a period of hours to measure water content. They found that loss on drying took many hours to complete, where their method could analyze samples in a total of 10 minutes, five minutes to heat the samples before analysis and a five-minute chromatographic run time. At the same time, Karl Fischer titration produced inaccurate results in many of the samples of household solid pharmaceutical drugs tested, which included vitamin C, Excedrine Migraine medicine, and acetaminophen from Target and Walgreens.   In addition, using the Armstrong method, only 10 milligrams of sample was needed due to the high sensitivity of the Shimadzu detector, creating an additional advantage for manufacturers. Ten milligrams is roughly equivalent to a light dusting of powder on a finger tip.   Frederick MacDonnell, chair of UTA s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, underlined the importance of this new method to improve drug testing methods as the university increases its focus on Health and the Human Condition within the Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact.  This is an example of where basic research on ionic liquids led to a very practical outcome with clear business implications for the pharmaceutical industry,  MacDonnell said.  This may be the first new method that can really take aim at Karl Fischer titration, which has been the mainstay for measuring water content for more than 80 years.  The new paper builds on a initial research published in The Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis in 2014 that focused on measuring water content in active pharmaceutical ingredients.","Published: August 3, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/nanoparticle-cancerdrug-delivery-201910,Nanoparticle Cancer Drug Delivery In a set of studies  nanoparticles have successfully delivered chemotherapy drugs and targeted therapies to tumor blood vessels  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.In a set of studies in mice bearing human tumors, nanoparticles designed to bind to a protein called P-selectin successfully delivered both chemotherapy drugs and targeted therapies to tumor blood vessels. Targeting the blood vessels improved the delivery of drugs to tumor tissue, causing the tumors to shrink and improving how long the mice lived. A tumor s blood vessels can serve as a barrier to engineered drug-delivery systems like nanoparticles, which may not be able to cross the blood vessel wall. However, the same blood vessels may express proteins such as P-selectin that researchers can potentially exploit, by engineering their nanoparticles to recognize and latch onto those proteins, which enables them to reach the tumor. What makes P-selectin different from other nanoparticle targets, the research team that led the study showed, is that it can be  turned on  in the blood vessels of tumors that do not normally express it by exposing the tumors to certain stressful conditions in these experiments, a low dose of focused radiation. This ability to trigger the expression of P-selectin in a tumor that normally lacks the protein, they wrote, suggests that the nanoparticle may be useful against a wide range of cancer types. Turning on the Target Blood vessels in some tumors naturally express P-selectin on their surfaces, providing a target for nanoparticles. In the study, a research team led by Daniel Heller, Ph.D., of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, engineered drug-carrying nanoparticles made of a sugar-based compound called fucoidan, which is derived from algae and binds to P-selectin. The research team then confirmed P-selectin expression in the blood vessels of a variety of tumor types, including lung, ovarian, and breast cancer, and lymphoma. In laboratory experiments, their fucoidan nanoparticles latched onto tumor blood vessel cells that normally expressed P-selectin while control nanoparticles composed of a different compound did not. The same was true for tumor blood vessel cells that were induced to express P-selectin by exposure to radiation. In additional laboratory experiments using layers of tissue, the targeted nanoparticles were also able to work their way through blood vessel cells into adjacent tumor tissue. Based on these findings, the researchers tested the fucoidan and control nanoparticles in a mouse model of lung cancer that expressed P-selectin on its blood vessels. Three days after injecting the mice with the nanoparticles, the researchers found the concentration of targeted nanoparticles within tumors to be four times that of the control, non-targeted nanoparticles. The targeted nanoparticles were also more likely to be found in tumor tissue (as opposed to normal tissue) than the non-targeted nanoparticles. The researchers then conducted experiments using a mouse model of lung cancer that does not normally express P-selectin on its blood vessels. The researchers exposed a tumor in each mouse to stress using a low dose of radiation. Twenty-four hours after exposure, a substantial amount of P-selectin was found in the tumor blood vessels.  When the researchers injected these mice with nanoparticles 4 hours after they received the radiation, they found accumulations of the nanoparticles in tumor tissue similar to those seen in tumors that naturally express P-selectin. In many of the mice, the tumors disappeared completely and did not return over the 100-day course of the study. Although it requires an additional step compared with other methods for targeting nanoparticles to tumors, activating a targeted protein before administering the nanoparticles  is a very clever approach to gaining more control in the nanoparticle delivery,  said Piotr Grodzinski, Ph.D., director of NCI s Office of Cancer Nanotechnology Research.  Unexpectedly, the researchers also found that other tumors in the mice also began to express P-selectin and had their growth inhibited by the nanoparticles even though they had not been irradiated directly. This phenomenon is likely triggered by the immune system, explained Dr. Heller, and suggests that the approach may be effective for treating metastatic tumors.  We may be able to irradiate one site and get some sort of effect in other [distant] tumors,  he said.  In contemporary [cancer] treatment, you may use different therapeutic strategies for primary and metastatic tumors in the same patient,"" said Dr. Grodzinski. ""What people are trying to do with nanoparticles in general is to see if the same strategy can [be used to] treat both."" Targeting Distant Disease, Preventing Off-Target Effects In proof-of-concept studies using two models of aggressive metastatic cancers that naturally express P-selectin, mice given the targeted nanoparticle containing doxorubicin lived significantly longer (mean of 70 days) than mice given a control nanoparticle that did not target P-selectin (39 days) or mice that received no treatment (32 days). The drug was also substantially more effective when it was delivered with the nanoparticle than when it was simply infused into the blood stream, explained Dr. Heller.  When we gave one dose of doxorubicin to the mice, nothing happened,  said Dr. Heller. However, just one-sixth of that dose delivered in the nanoparticle shrank tumors and extended survival time. When they increased the amount of doxorubicin delivered in the nanoparticle, they saw tumors completely disappear in about half the mice after a single dose. The researchers also tried filling their nanoparticles with a targeted therapy called a MEK inhibitor, which blocks a molecular pathway in the body that is important to many cancers but is also active in normal skin. Many patients taking MEK inhibitors have had to discontinue the drugs or have their doses reduced because of side effects, such as a severe, painful skin rash. When encapsulated in the nanoparticle, the drug inhibited the MEK pathway in tumors but not in the mice s skin.  We expect that we might see something similar in humans, where we avoid the toxicity but get prolonged inhibition of the target, which increases the effectiveness of the drug,  said Dr. Heller.  His team is currently performing follow-up studies with other targeted therapies, and they would like to learn more about the P-selectin expression in distant tumors that they saw in their radiation studies.  Quite a lot of work needs to be done before we can test [the nanoparticles] in a phase I trial,  said Dr. Heller,  but we re definitely excited about it. ","Published: August 3, 2016"

The method could advance scientists  use of stem cells in regenerative medicine, since pluripotent stem cells can turn into any cell type in the body. The study, published in the journal Nature Methods, outlines the new sequencing technique, which measures the percentage of RNA that is methylated, or chemically modified, for each gene in the genome. RNA serves an important purpose inside cells; it carries genetic messages from DNA. These messages direct cells to make the proteins that play many critical roles in the body, but errors in how those messages are produced or regulated can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Until recently, little was known about how RNA activity is regulated by methylation of the RNA molecules. The new study looks at a specific type of RNA methylation known as m6A or N6-methyladenosine, which is a chemical modification that has a variety of functions, such as controlling how long the RNA will live in the cell and how much protein it will produce. The m6A modification is the most abundant type of RNA methylation on protein-producing RNAs. The data analyses were led by co-senior author Yi Xing, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics in the UCLA College and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA. Dr. Cosmas Giallourakis, co-senior author and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, led the development of the new sequencing technique. First authors were Benoit Molinie at Harvard Medical School and Jinkai Wang, a UCLA postdoctoral fellow.  Previously, we were only able to determine the location of m6A on the RNA, but not the amount,  said Xing, who is also a member of the UCLA Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences and director of UCLA s bioinformatics doctoral program. The ability to determine the percentage of m6A on RNA gives researchers information that could potentially help detect disease, Xing said, since m6A levels on RNA may be different in diseased cells than in healthy cells. Researchers can also use information about m6A levels to gain insights into a pluripotent stem cell s ability to turn into other types of cells. Pluripotent stem cells have two unique abilities. They can turn into any specialized cell in the body, such as skin, bone, blood or brain cells; this process is called  differentiation.  They can also create copies of themselves. These abilities hold great promise for advances in regenerative medicine. But scientists are particularly interested in understanding how to control the process through which pluripotent stem cells differentiate into specialized cell types that are safe and fully capable of regenerating aging or diseased tissue. Another challenge is maintaining pluripotent stem cells in the lab, since they have a tendency to spontaneously differentiate, at which point scientists lose the ability to control the cell s fate. Previous research by a team led by Xing and Giallourakis showed that blocking m6A prevents pluripotent stem cells from differentiating into specialized cell types, while allowing them to retain their critical pluripotent flexibility. The new sequencing technique, called m6A-LAIC-seq, is a novel method that scientists can use to obtain valuable data about RNA methylation using specialized machines that produce hundreds of millions of RNA sequences and provide insights into the molecular signature of a cell.  We are very excited about the promising data and the new tool that is now available to study m6A in a wide range of cell types including pluripotent stem cells,  Xing said.  We anticipate that our research will improve the understanding and use of pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center has received $11 million in funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Kidney cancer currently has no method of early detection and is particularly challenging to treat. The highly competitive Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) award from the NCI is the first for kidney cancer research earned by a single institution, and only the second in the nation. In a series of landmark findings over the past 20 years, UT Southwestern researchers have identified and characterized a key protein called HIF-2a involved in kidney cancer. These findings led to development of a drug therapy now in clinical trials as part of the Kidney Cancer Program. Nearly 400,000 Americans are currently living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer, which is the fourth most commonly treated cancer at UT Southwestern. Unlike several other common cancers   lung, breast, prostate, colon and cervical   there are no existing methods to find the disease early, when it is most treatable. It is usually found indirectly, through a scan performed for a different reason, for example. More than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year.  Receiving SPORE recognition for our Kidney Cancer Program is reflective of the collaborative, interdisciplinary environment that UT Southwestern has historically embraced. The early inroads that UT Southwestern researchers made in this arena serve as the ideal launching pad for future success against this devastating disease,  said Dr. J. Gregory Fitz, Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Provost and Dean of Southwestern Medical School, and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern, who holds the Nadine and Tom Craddick Distinguished Chair in Medical Science, and the Atticus James Gill, M.D. Chair in Medical Science. The UT Southwestern SPORE program involves four innovative disease and clinical research teams targeting adult and pediatric kidney cancer, as well as a patient advocate group, a developmental research program, a career enhancement program, and core facilities to support these efforts through data analysis, imaging technology, and a tissue repository. The four research teams will:  Search for biomarkers to identify kidney cancer tumors most likely to respond to a HIF-2a inhibitor, as well as to anticipate ways in which the tumor may evade the drug s impact.  Investigate the function of a gene that identifies a cluster of particularly aggressive tumors associated with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, in hopes of identifying vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drugs.  Examine kidney cancer metabolism to distinguish aggressive from less active tumors, potentially yielding a tailored treatment approach.  Test novel treatments for childhood kidney cancer by researching the implications of a Wilms tumor subtype.  This extraordinary award from the NCI supports the extensive kidney cancer research program built by our faculty over the past several years,  said Dr. Melanie Cobb, Interim Director of the Simmons Cancer Center, Professor of Pharmacology, and holder of the Jane and Bill Browning, Jr. Chair in Medical Science.  Sixteen distinguished research leaders   each nationally recognized in their field of expertise   will lead the team of more than 40 scientists that will focus on developing new approaches toward this disease which is particularly deadly.   We are translating seminal discoveries and technological innovation at UT Southwestern to expand treatment options for both adult and pediatric kidney cancer patients,  said Principal Investigator Dr. James Brugarolas, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, and Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research.  These funds will support a variety of new and ongoing activities including the development of a new drug, studies of kidney cancer subtypes in adults and children, and a novel approach to determine what small tumors may be deadly.  This award marks the second SPORE grant for UT Southwestern, which for 20 years has led a multi-institutional SPORE program in lung cancer that is the largest thoracic oncology effort in the U.S. The Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in North Texas and one of just 47 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Simmons Cancer Center includes 13 major cancer care programs. In addition, the Center s education and training programs support and develop the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians. Simmons Cancer Center is among only 30 U.S. cancer research centers to be designated by the NCI as a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site.","Published: August 3, 2016"

However, for the majority of such genes, scientists do not yet know how the variants contribute to disease   indeed, scientists do not even understand how many of the genes function. One such gene is C13orf31, found on chromosome 13. Scientists have previously shown that variants of the gene in which a single nucleotide   the A, C, G and T of DNA   differs are associated with risk for the infectious disease leprosy, and for the chronic inflammatory diseases Crohn s disease and a form of childhood arthritis known as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In a study published in the journal Nature Immunology and led by the University of Cambridge, researchers studied how this gene works and have identified a new mechanism that drives energy metabolism in our immune cells. Immune cells help fight infection, but in some cases attack our own bodies, causing inflammatory disease. Using mice in which the mouse equivalent of the C13orf31 gene had been altered, the team showed that the gene produces a protein that acts as a central regulator of the core metabolic functions in a specialist immune cell known as a macrophage (Greek for  big eater ). These cells are so named for their ability to  eat  invading organisms, breaking them down and preventing the infection from spreading. The protein, which the researchers named FAMIN (Fatty Acid Metabolic Immune Nexus), determines how much energy is available to the macrophages. The researchers used a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR/Cas9, which acts like a biological  cut and paste  tool, to edit a single nucleotide in the risk genes within the mouse s genome to show that even a tiny change to our genetic makeup could have a profound effect, making the mice more susceptible to sepsis (blood poisoning). This showed that FAMIN influences the cell s ability to perform its normal function, controlling its capacity to kill bacteria and release molecules known as  mediators  that trigger an inflammatory response, a key part of fighting infection and repairing damage in the body. Professor Arthur Kaser from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the research, says:  By taking a disease risk gene whose role was completely unknown and studying its function down to the level of a single nucleotide, we ve discovered an entirely new and important mechanism that affects our immune system s ability to carry out its role as the body s defence mechanism.  Dr Zaeem Cader, the study s first author, adds:  Although it s too early to say how this discovery might influence new treatments, genetics can provide invaluable insights that might help in identifying potential drug targets for so-called precision medicines, tailored to an individual s genetic make-up.

The research in animal models suggests that members of a cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs) small non-coding RNA molecules that play a role in regulating gene expression work together throughout the different stages of immune cell generation. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that different members of the cluster dominate different stages as disease-targeting immune cells, called B cells, develop a finding that could guide the development of therapies against autoimmune diseases.  Although the miRNAs in the cluster are all expressed, it s not like they re playing the same role different individual miRNAs within the cluster are more important than others in controlling different stages of B cell development,  said TSRI Research Associate Alicia Gonzalez Martin, who served as co-first author of the study with TSRI Professional Scientific Collaborator Maoyi Lai and Anthony B. Cooper, a TSRI researcher now at Adimab.  At different stages, one miRNA is like the lead actor and another is like a supporting actor,  added Lai. The study, published August 2, 2016, in the journal Nature Communications, was co-led by TSRI Associate Professor Changchun Xiao and TSRI Professor David Nemazee. A Key Question in Drug Development As they develop, the immune system s B cells acquire specific receptors to allow them to recognize and attack harmful pathogens. The receptor assembly process is random, and sometimes this roll of the dice leads to potentially harmful cells such as B cells that produce antibodies against the body s own tissues, causing autoimmune diseases like lupus. miRNAs appear to be crucial for healthy B cell development. Previous TSRI studies from the Xiao lab have shown that six miRNAs form a cluster called miR-17~92, whose expression has to stay at just the right level to stop cells from triggering cancers or autoimmune diseases. In the new study, the researchers investigated the roles of the six miRNAs in this cluster to see if any might be good targets for future therapeutics.  miRNA-based therapies are usually designed for certain miRNAs, not a whole cluster,  Lai explained.  If you can narrow it down to one or two important miRNAs, you can design miRNA mimics or anti-miRNAs to try to restore the normal expression level.  A Shift in Power The new study suggests that the expression of two miRNAs in this cluster, called miR-17 and miR-19, are key to healthy B cell development. By  knocking out  (disabling) expression of these select miRNAs in mouse models, the researchers found that miR-17 steps in early in B cell development, making it possible for B cells to progress through this stage and produce the receptors they need to fight infections later on. Although the pathway for this action is not yet known, the researchers found that B cells without miR-17 cannot develop effectively thus weakening the immune system. miR-19 expression is important later on in B cell development, helping to regulate the quality control  checkpoint  system that stops harmful B cells from escaping the bone marrow and causing disease. The researchers found that overexpression of miR-19 led to a reduced expression of a gene called Pten, allowing potentially autoimmune disease-causing cells to survive longer and get past the checkpoint.  Pten has been the focus of oncology studies, so it s interesting to see that this gene is also involved in tolerance checkpoints,  said Lai. Other miRNAs from the cluster are involved during both of these processes, but they appear to have minor roles. The researchers plan to continue their investigation into the roles of different miRNAs at the tolerance checkpoint stage and their roles in autoimmunity, with the goal of figuring out which might be the best to target with future therapeutics.","Published: August 3, 2016"

The majority of the data are new, but provides a meta-analysis of all available data to-date. MMV s open access Malaria Box was launched in 2011 in a bid to catalyse malaria and neglected disease drug discovery. The box, containing 400 compounds with activity against malaria, was made available to researchers upon request, free of charge, until December 2015. Around 200 research groups from around the world received the Malaria Box. In return, the researchers were asked to share their findings in the public domain. MMV also provided advice on request and in some cases facilitated studies. This published dataset on the Malaria Box compounds represents the combined effort of over 180 researchers coordinated by MMV. It reveals the immense potential of the compounds as starting points for drug discovery programmes and valuable tools for biological studies. The integration of multiple screens using the same compounds enables quick selection of those with the most potential. The data demonstrate the activity of the compounds against other pathogens including other protozoa, helminths, bacterial and mycobacterial species, the dengue fever mosquito vector, and cancer, as well as suggested mechanisms of action against malaria for 135 of the compounds. As a result, over ten new drug discovery programmes have been initiated in laboratories around the world.

The collaboration is intended to generate multiple clinical product candidates for various hematological and solid tumor cancers.  Under the terms of the agreement, Regeneron and Adicet will collaborate to identify and validate appropriate targets and work together to develop a pipeline of engineered immune cell therapeutics for the selected targets. Adicet will receive a $25 million upfront payment, as well as research funding over the course of a five-year research term. Regeneron has the option to obtain development and commercial rights for a certain number of the product candidates, and Adicet has an option to participate in the development and commercialization on these potential products or is entitled to royalty payments by Regeneron. Immune cell therapy product candidates developed and commercialized by Adicet under the agreement will be subject to payment of royalties to Regeneron.

Perhaps that's why biochemists learned how cells make proteins 70 years ago, but are just now learning how they get rid of proteins that are no longer needed or no longer work. Cells have two cellular disposal systems, said Richard Vierstra, the George and Charmaine Mallinckrodt Professor at Washington University in St. Louis. One (the proteasome, or protein-eating body) is rather like a garbage disposal and the other (the autophageosome, or self-eating body), which handles bigger messes, is more like the bin liner for a trash can. See Also: Could boosting brain cells' appetites fight disease? New research shows promise Proteasomes are typically selective whereas autophagy has generally been thought to be indiscriminate. But Vierstra and his colleague Richard Marshall, PhD, a research scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, have demonstrated that autophagy under conditions other than cell starvation is also carefully regulated. In 2015 they showed that a collection of tags and bridging receptors controls what goes into the bin liners in the model plant Arabidopsis. Marshall then decided to ""make a little foray into yeast"" to see whether the autophagy pathway is conserved outside of the plant kingdom. Now, in Cell Reports they report that the same pathway exists in yeast and probably in humans, although the bridging receptors are different in each organism. Importantly this pathway is implicated in a variety of neural pathologies, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and ALS. In each of these diseases, cells sequester broken proteins into aggregates which they are then unable to clear, to the detriment of the cells. In doing this work, the scientists devised a simple assay that enables them to quickly dissect the autophagy pathway and identify its regulatory components. This assay, they suggest, offers a way to learn more about what goes wrong in the aggregation-prone pathologies. Related: Breaking the brain's garbage disposal: Even a small problem causes big effectsThousands of enzymes roam the cell looking for unwanted or broken proteins, Vierstra said. When they find one they are tag it with a marker protein called ubiquitin. Proteins bearing ubiquitin chains then are delivered to one of the 30,000 proteasomes in the cell. If the ubiquitin chains dock with receptors on top of the proteasome, the protein is unfolded, and threaded through the orifice of the proteasome like a strand of spaghetti. Active proteases within the barrel then chop the long protein chain into smaller pieces that can be re-used. A broken protein (red) is recognized by circulating enzymes and tagged with chains of a small protein called ubiquitin. These chains are recognized by regulatory regions on top of the protesome. Once recognized, the protein is unfolded and fed down the interior of the proteosome, where it is chopped into smaller pieces that can be reused by the cell. Credit: E.M.L.  The cell needs a second system, Vierstra said, because many proteins are in very large complexes. How do you get rid of the big stuff, when the proteasome has such a small orifice? he asked. That's where autophagy takes over. In this process the cell assembles a double-walled cup-shaped vesicle that envelops the ""garbage,"" closes to form a sac, and then fuses with a sac of enzymes (a vacuole or lysosome) that then breaks down the garbage together with the sac. The scientists tested autophagy by deliberately poisoning proteasomes and watching how they were discarded. But the cell also uses autophagy to remove large protein complexes other than proteasomes, whole organelles, such as mitochondria and even pathogens, such as bacteria. In 2015 Marshall and Vierstra showed that if they killed proteasomes in Arabidopsis cells, the proteosomes were quickly decorated with ubiquitin chains and then targeted for autophagy by a bridging receptor that binds both the ubiquitin chains and a surface protein that lines the autophagic membrane, thus tethering the proteasome to the membrane. Don't Miss: New evidence in mice that cocaine makes brain cells cannibalize themselvesIn Arabidopsis, this tethering protein is called RPN10. Yeast has only a truncated form of RPN10, so Marshall was curious to see whether the pathway exists in yeast as well. He found that it does, although the tethering protein is a different one called Cue5. The abnormal protein that damages brain cells in Huntington's disease also has a ubiquitin-binding domain called a CUE domain. Alert to connection, Marshall decided to track the proteasomes after they were killed but before they were dumped. When he did this, he discovered that they clumped first. Cells sort malfunctioning proteins into two different aggregation spots, or protein graveyards, called JUNQ and IPOD, Vierstra said. The sequestration of a protein in JUNQ is reversible, but IPOD proteins are never rescued. Proteins are steered to one or another aggregation spot by molecular 'chaperones.' ""We knew from the literature that formation of IPOD aggregations required a molecular chaperone called Hsp42. It turned out that proteasome aggregation also requires Hsp42,"" Vierstra said. ""Hsp42 somehow senses that a proteasome is 'dead,' and helps sort it into an aggregate, where an enzyme covers it with ubiquitin. The ubiquitin is then recognized by the Cue5 receptor, which tethers it to the autophagy membrane,"" he said. Together, Cue5 and Hsp42 provide an important surveillance mechanism in yeast (and likely animals) that is central to maintain a healthy pool of active proteasomes, the scientists said. In the long term, the value of the research may lie less in the discovery of the Cue5 receptor and Hsp42 chaperone than in the creation of an assay that can be used to understand what goes wrong with autophagy in aggregation-prone diseases. ""These pathologies are difficult to study because they're challenging to trigger in reproducible manner,"" Vierstra said. ""But it turns out that we can trigger proteasome aggregation just by adding a drug that kills proteasomes and start the process quickly. Learn More:  Two proteins work together to help cells eliminate trash and Parkinson s may result when they don t In the assay, the proteasome are tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which makes it possible to see where they go, Vierstra explained. When the autophagic system eats a protein that is tagged with GFP, the protein disappears, but the GFP stays around. So the accumulation of free GFP serves as a surrogate for autophagy. It is this assay that allowed Marshall to quickly find the Cue5 receptor. ""We tested every known autophagy receptor knock-out in the books, "" Vierstra said. In each case free GFP appeared in the yeast vacuole, indicating that the missing receptor didn't prevent the proteasome from being broken up. Only in the case of the Cue5 knock-out was free GFP missing. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source.

See Also: Neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations Because human and rodent brains process touch in similar ways, the rodent whisker system has been used to study the sense of touch since 1909. Rodents use their whiskers essentially long, thick hairs as touch sensors to explore their environment. While hundreds of papers are published each year that use the whisker system to study sensorimotor processing, crucial aspects of the information transfer from whiskers to the brain have remained unresolved. ""Specialized cells convert touch information from the whiskers into electrical signals that the brain can interpret,"" said Mitra Hartmann, associate professor of biomedical and mechanical engineering in Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering. ""But exactly what information is represented electrically has been unclear."" Now Hartmann and her team are bringing the world closer to an answer. In a recent study, they discovered that whisker sensory neurons encode information about the forces and torques at the whisker's base. This finding could resolve fundamental questions about how touch is represented and processed by neurons in both the rat and the human brain. Learn More: Touch-sensing neurons are multitaskers The research, published in the journal eLife, brought together an interdisciplinary team that spanned five Northwestern departments. The study had two co-first authors: Nicholas E. Bush, a PhD student in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, and Christopher L. Schroeder, a recent PhD graduate in biomedical engineering. Co-senior author Sara A. Solla, professor of physiology in the Feinberg School of Medicine and of physics and astronomy in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, guided the mathematical analysis of neural responses. ""If you want to study how the brain processes sensory information, rat whiskers are a very accessible system neurologically,"" Bush said. ""We were able to look at the system in a much more detailed and rigorous manner than has been done in the past with the help of cutting edge tools and models."" The study's goal was to resolve whether touch-sensitive neurons in the whisker system encode kinematic or mechanical information, a distinction that has historically posed a major challenge. When a whisker brushes against an object, it moves in a particular direction, by a particular amount, and at a particular speed. Together, these features are known as kinematic properties. Mechanical properties, on the other hand, are related to the contact forces and torques at the whisker base. ""It has been challenging to characterize neural responses because kinematics and mechanics are so tightly coupled,"" Hartmann said. ""This coupling is especially strong when whisker motion is small and stimulation is delivered near the whisker base exactly the type of stimulation that has typically been used to date."" Don't Miss: New findings on how brain handles tactile sensations Hartmann's team developed a novel whisker stimulation paradigm to decouple kinematic and mechanical variables. Solla then guided mathematical modeling that exploited the decoupling to assess the neural encoding of tactile information. The team found that the electrical activity of whisker touch neurons was more accurately predicted by mechanics, rather than kinematics. ""This has been a long-standing discussion in the field,"" Solla said. ""We hope this becomes the unified, accepted view of how touch is processed. Sensing mechanisms share many common features, so what we learn about one sense illuminates our understanding of how all senses work."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Many of these regions of depression-linked genetic variation turn out to be involved in regulating gene expression and the birth of new neurons in the developing brain. But in a twist the researchers didn't have to sequence anyone's genes. Instead, they analyzed data already shared by people who had purchased their own genetic profiles via an online service and elected to participate in its research option. This made it possible to leverage the statistical power of a huge sample size to detect weak genetic signals associated with a diagnosis likely traceable to multiple underlying illness processes. See Also: Could depression actually be a form of infectious disease? This novel use of crowd-sourced data was confirmed with results from traditional genetics approaches in the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA). Roy Perlis, MD, MSc, of Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital a grantee of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and colleagues from industry, report on their findings in the journal Nature Genetics. It's well known that at least some depression runs in families and some risk is inherited. Yet, prior to this study, conventional genome-wide approaches had failed to reliably identify chromosomal sites associated with the illness in populations with European roots. Since depression is thought to be like fever a common set of symptoms likely rooted in multiple causes lumping together genetic data from people with different underlying illness processes likely washed out, or statistically diluted, subtle evidence of effects caused by risk genes. To increase their odds of detecting these weak genetic signals, the researchers adopted a strategy of studying much larger samples than had been used in the earlier genome-wide studies. They first analyzed common genetic variation in 75,607 people of European ancestry who self-reported being diagnosed or treated for depression and 231,747 healthy controls of similar ethnicity. These data had been shared by people who purchased their own genetic profiles via the 23 and Me website and agreed to participate in the company's optional research initiative, which makes data available to the scientific community, while protecting privacy. The researchers integrated these data with results from a prior Psychiatric Genomic Consortium genome-wide-association study, based on clinician-vetted diagnoses of more than 20,000 patients and controls of European ancestry. They then followed-up with a closer look at certain statistically suspect sites from that analysis in an independent 23 and Me ""replication"" sample of 45,773 cases and 106,354 controls. Learn More: How to tell the difference between bipolar disorder and depression In all, Perlis and colleagues found 17 genetic variations linked to depression at 15 genome locations. In addition to hinting at a link between depression and brain gene expression during development, there was also evidence of overlap between the genetic basis of depression and other mental illnesses. While the genome sites identified still account for only a fraction of the risk for depression, the researchers say the results support the strategy of complementing more traditional methods with crowd-sourced data. ""We hope these findings help people understand that depression is a brain disease, with it's own biology,"" said Perlis.

Ideally suited for portable hand-held spectroscopy devices, the system provides efficient, real-time analysis and identification of complex chemical mixtures using new Raman spectral decomposition techniques.  This approach, which is technology agnostic, can handle large spectral databases to accurately pinpoint mixtures of chemical substances. Samples composed of a mixture of different chemicals provide a much greater detection challenge than pure materials, which are typically used in laboratory studies but not representative of real world samples. This new functionality is computationally efficient enough to be implemented on hand-held Raman spectrometers, providing a portable, sensitive, non-invasive approach for chemical substance analysis. The University of Edinburgh s commercialisation arm, Edinburgh Research & Innovation (ERI), is now seeking to license this technology to industry partners who wish to deploy it as part of a commercial hardware solution. Mike Davies, Professor of Signal and Image Processing at the University of Edinburgh s School of Engineering comments;  Inputting a set of reference spectra and an unknown mixture yields the identity of the mixture elements and also their contribution percentages. It also has the capability of identifying the presence of a spectral component outside the reference library. As such it is a particularly powerful tool.  Performance has been successfully demonstrated in the identification of real mixtures in different measurement scenarios, including where component spectra are close to the device s noise level. Rhea Clewes, Senior Scientist in Chemical Sensing, DSTL, comments;  This novel software will allow us to accurately identify small amounts of hazardous chemicals much more quickly than before. This technology agnostic development allows a range of different signals to be separated, including analytical approaches beyond Raman spectroscopy. DSTL is proud to see that  outcomes  from the University Defence Research Collaboration in Signal Programming, jointly funded by DSTL and EPSRC, is producing output of immediate benefit to defence and homeland security.  Angus Stewart-Liddon, ERI s Licensing Executive, said;  This software has the ability to transform portable chemical analysis capability in the field and give instant results to the composition of chemical mixtures. It adds exceptional functionality to a hand held spectroscopy device and its application, particularly for the security industry where rapid chemical analysis of potential hazardous materials, [which] cannot be over-estimated.

The research, published August 1, 2016, in The Journal of Experimental Medicine, focused on a molecule called microRNA-155 (miR-155), a key player in the immune system s production of disease-fighting antibodies.  It s very exciting to see exactly how this molecule works in the body,  said TSRI Associate Professor Changchun Xiao, who co-led the study with Professor Wen-Hsien Liu of Xiamen University in Fuijan province, China. An Immune System Tango Our cells rely on molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) as a sort of  dimmer switches  to carefully regulate protein levels and combat disease.  People know miRNAs are involved in immune response, but they don t know which miRNAs and how exactly,  explained TSRI Research Associate Zhe Huang, study co-first author with Liu and Seung Goo Kang of TSRI and Kangwon National University. In the new study, the researchers focused on the roles of miRNAs during the critical period when the immune system first detects  invaders  such as viruses or bacteria. At this time, cells called T follicular helpers proliferate and migrate to a different area of the lymph organs to interact with B cells.  They do a sort of tango,  said Xiao. This interaction prompts B cells to mature and produce effective antibodies, eventually offering long-term protection against infection.  The next time you encounter that virus, for example, the body can respond quickly,  said Xiao. Identifying a Dancer Using a technique called deep sequencing, the team identified miR-155 as a potential part of this process. Studies in mouse models suggested that miR-155 works by repressing a protein called Peli1. This leaves a molecule called c-Rel free to jump in and promote normal T cell proliferation. This finding could help scientists improve current vaccines. While vaccines are life-saving, some vaccines wear off after a decade or only cover around 80 percent of those vaccinated.  If you could increase T cell proliferation using a molecule that mimics miR-155, maybe you could boost that to 90 to 95 percent,  said Xiao. He also sees potential for using miR-155 to help in creating longer-lasting vaccines. The research may also apply to treating autoimmune diseases, which occur when antibodies mistakenly attack the body s own tissues. Xiao and his colleagues think an mRNA inhibitor could dial back miR-155 s response when T cell proliferation and antibody production is in overdrive. For the next stage of this research, Xiao plans to collaborate with scientists on the Florida campus of TSRI to test possible miRNA inhibitors against autoimmune disease.","Published: August 2, 2016"

However, unlike the majority of cancer cells that comprise a tumour, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are often refractory to chemotherapy and are thought to be primarily responsible for relapse following cancer treatment. It has been shown that CSCs, appropriately stimulated by certain drugs, become susceptible to chemotherapy, leading to complete tumour remission once drug treatment is withdrawn.   Plasticell s proprietary Combinatorial Cell Culture  (CombiCult ) platform will be used to discover combinations of drugs, growth factors and chemotherapeutic agents that are capable of eradicating CSCs in leukaemia. The work will be carried out at Plasticell and in the laboratory of Dr. Eva Szegezdi at the Apoptosis Research Centre, NUI Galway, and is part funded by an Enterprise Partnership grant from the Irish Research Council.  Despite much progress in the war against cancer, few definitive cures have emerged in the past 60 years,  commented Dr Yen Choo, Plasticell s Executive Chairman.  However, research into cancer stem cells, together with recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, seem set to provide a string of successes in the field.

The study, which is published today in Cell and was conducted by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit at the University of Dundee, offers an insight into the role of a gene called UBQLN2 and how it helps to remove toxic protein clumps from the body and protect it from disease. Using biochemistry, cell biology and sophisticated mouse models, the researchers discovered that the main function of UBQLN2 is to help the cell to remove dangerous protein clumps   a role which it performs by first detangling clumps, then shredding them to prevent future tangles.  Protein clumps occur as part of the natural aging process, but are normally detangled and disposed of as a result of the gene UBQLN2. However when this gene mutates, or becomes faulty, it can no longer help the cell to remove these toxic protein clumps, which leads to neurodegenerative disease. Dr Thimo Kurz, from the Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, said:  The function of UBQNL2 is connected to many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson s, Alzheimer s and Huntington s disease.  These patients often have very clear clumps in their brain cells. Using mice that mimic human Huntington s disease, we found that when UBQLN2 is mutated, it could no longer help nerve cells to remove protein clumps in the brains of these mice.  Previous work has shown that when the UBQLN2 gene is faulty, it leads to a neurodegenerative disease called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS/FTD or motor-neuron disease with dementia). However until this study it was not fully understood why mutation of this gene caused disease. Now that scientists understand exactly how UBQLN2 works and what it does, they are also able to understand why its mutation appears to be so detrimental to the body. Indeed they hope that their findings will pave the way for new research into novel treatment options for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Dr Roland Hjerpe said:  The significance of this discovery goes beyond the role of UBQLN2 in motor-neuron disease with dementia.  Our study has revealed a new mechanism by which nerve cells cope with protein clumps in general, which has implications for most neurodegenerative diseases and can open up avenues for new therapeutic interventions to treat these conditions in the future.

Research specialist Stephen Campbell and Professor David Stern at the Boyce Thompson Institute report the discovery in the July 29 issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry. This repair system may have applications in agriculture and biotechnology because it could potentially be harnessed to enable proteins to become active only in the light. Many proteins contain extra sequences, called insertions, which can disrupt their function. The current paper demonstrates that the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has the necessary toolkit to repair proteins by removing these insertions. Campbell discovered this new repair system while purifying a protein from the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii that can cut RNA. Upon sequencing the protein, he identified it as RB47, a protein that was not known to have any RNA-cleaving ability. Campbell noticed that the middle of the protein was missing. When he compared the protein sequence to its corresponding gene sequence, the protein was much shorter than expected. Upon further study, Campbell found that he could detect a long version of the protein that contained an insertion and a short version that didn t. The cells make both versions when grown in the light or the dark, but only the short version can cleave RNA. The long version of the protein could be converted into the short one by mixing it in a test tube with chloroplasts from cells grown in the light and by illuminating the reaction. This process removed the interrupting insertion and restored the RNA-cutting activity of the protein. It is likely that the chloroplast maintains the machinery necessary to remove the sequence so that it can restore functionality to the protein. This new type of repair system provides intriguing possibilities for biotech applications. Because the insertion can be placed so that it interrupts a protein s function, the insertion and repair system may be useful for producing certain pharmaceuticals or protein products, such as cancer drugs, in culture, which would otherwise kill the cell. After purification, the inactive products could be treated with chloroplast factors and light to remove the insertion and activate the proteins. In future work, the researchers plan to investigate exactly how the insertion becomes spliced out of the protein and which plant factors facilitate its removal. They also aim to understand the purpose of the insertion, and whether the algae can control the splicing to respond to changes in the environment.

With respect to Zika in vitro diagnostic tests, FDA has been authorized to issue EUAs to allow for use of unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products when, among other circumstances, there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives and certain additional criteria are met.  The FDA s emergency use authorization of the VERSANT  Zika RNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) Kit from Siemens can lead us one step closer to stopping the spread of the Zika virus,  says Fernando Beils, Vice President, and Head of Molecular Diagnostics at Siemens.  Being able to quickly diagnose patients will help physicians to more efficiently manage those affected.  The VERSANT  Zika RNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) Kit is capable of detecting the presence of Zika virus, which can be an earlier indicator of Zika virus infection than anti-Zika antibodies. The molecular test is validated for plasma, serum, and urine (collected alongside a patient-matched serum or plasma specimen) from individuals meeting CDC Zika virus clinical criteria and/or CDC Zika virus epidemiological criteria, and is designed to run on the Siemens VERSANT  kPCR Sample Prep automated platform, along with several commercially available thermal cyclers. The assay must be run by laboratories in the United States that are certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C.   263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories. The VERSANT  Zika RNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) Kit has not been FDA cleared or approved and is only authorized for use for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection of Zika virus and/or diagnosis of Zika virus infection.

Starting in late 2011, the Medicines for Malaria Venture, based in Geneva, Switzerland, distributed 400 diverse compounds with anti-malarial activity free of charge to 200 labs in 30 countries. One-third of the labs reported their results in a paper published today in PLOS Pathogens,  Open source drug discovery with the Malaria Box compound collection for neglected diseases and beyond.    The results have ignited more a dozen drug-development projects for a variety of diseases.   The trial was successful not only in identifying compounds to pursue for anti-malarials, but it also identified compounds to treat other parasites and cancer,  said lead author Wesley Van Voorhis. To help lead the project, Van Voorhis took a sabbatical from his roles as a University of Washington professor of medicine (allergy and infectious diseases) and director of the Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases.   The National Cancer Institute is now working on a colon cancer drug that emerged from the testing, Van Voorhis said. Several European labs are working on anti-worm compounds, and numerous U.S. labs are investigating drugs to combat other parasites. Medicines for Malaria Venture are also working with pharmaceutical companies GSK and Novartis on related anti-malarials, he added. In their paper, researchers cited the lack of interaction between academia and industry as a major curb to innovation in drug discovery.   Much of the global resource in biology is present in universities, whereas the focus of medicinal chemistry is still largely within industry. Open-source drug discovery, with sharing of information, is clearly a first step towards overcoming that gap,  they wrote.   The Malaria Box distributed 400 diverse drug-like molecules that were most often found in industry collections, helping to bridge the gap between industry and academia. This open-access effort was so successful that Medicines for Malaria Venture has begun to distribute another set of compounds with broader potential applicability, called the Pathogen Box. The box is available now to scientific labs globally.","Published: August 2, 2016"

There is a significant unmet need for a more accurate non-invasive diagnostic test for renal transplant care. Currently, physicians rely on a combination of creatinine measures and invasive needle biopsies, which often result in inconclusive results or a diagnosis of acute rejection after the damage to the kidney is irreversible. Multiple studies have shown dd-cfDNA has a potential to be a universal marker for acute rejection for solid organs. Under this research collaboration, Natera will analyze the dd-cfDNA level of plasma samples collected at UCSF from kidney transplant patients using Natera's proprietary massively-multiplexed PCR (mmPCR) platform and proprietary statistical algorithms. Through this research collaboration, Natera and UCSF will investigate whether the routine measurement of dd-cfDNA can help predict organ injury and ultimately improve clinical outcomes. ""We are honored to be working with Professor Minnie Sarwal, an internationally recognized leader in the fields of renal and transplant medicine,"" said Matthew Rabinowitz, Ph.D., CEO of Natera. ""Collaborations of this kind advance the needs of patients, and are very efficient vehicles to further expand the range of clinically actionable applications for our technology platform."" ""The advances we've made in organ transplant over the past few decades have made a tremendous difference in our patients' quality of life, but it is still very difficult to detect quickly whether an individual patient is recovering well or rejecting the organ,"" said Sarwal, MD, Ph.D., a UCSF professor of medicine and nephrologist at UCSF Health.

However, commercial sample preparation instruments can cost $10,000 to $15,000 each, impeding their ability to be employed in limited-resource regions.  While using a 3D printer for prototyping, Season Wong, the company's co-founder, realized that 3D printers have the components needed to carry out automated nucleic acid extraction and DNA amplification at a fraction of the cost of a commercial instrument. The researchers have been working with entry level printers in the price range of $450-700. Conversion of the 3D printer consists of replacing the 3D printer's extruder with a 3D printed magnetic particle processing attachment (MPPA) designed by the company. The MPPA allows the 3D printer to hold a disposable tip comb. ""From there we can control the motors and heaters by feeding G-codes into the 3D printer,"" Wong said. G-code is the computer language used in 3D printers to control its motors' positions and other functions. By writing custom programs, the 3D printer can be programmed to mimic the actions of a sample preparation device. So far, the modified printer can process up to 12 samples simultaneously in under 13 minutes for nucleic acid extraction.  Furthermore, the team has demonstrated that the DNA extraction efficiency of the 3D printer is on par with the gold-standard spin-column method. A demonstration of the 3D printer-turned-sample preparation device can be found in the following video. Most entry-level 3D printers have one or two heating elements, one at the extruder, and the second at the heated bed. After successfully using the modified 3D printer for DNA extraction, the company tested the 3D printer's capability to amplify DNA. ""Testing the maximum allowed temperatures by the extruder and heated bed confirmed that the heaters can be used for sample incubation, isothermal DNA amplification, and even polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycling,"" said Kamfai Chan, a scientist at the company. ""We can maintain the temperature of the heated bed at over 90 C to denature DNA, a critical step needed in PCR amplification of nucleic acids,"" Chan said. To validate the performance of the device, Wong traveled to meet with collaborator Charlotte Gaydos, a professor from the Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University who is also the director of the Center for Point-of-Care Tests for Sexually Transmitted Diseases at the university. ""We packed two 3D printers in regular luggage and brought them to Professor Gaydos' laboratory, where we successfully used the 3D printers to demonstrate extraction and PCR amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis DNA from urine samples,"" Wong said. ""In the PLOS One paper, we also presented the extraction of dengue samples because we wanted to demonstrate that both DNA and RNA based extraction are feasible with our setup,"" he added. The researchers believe that the ability to convert a low-cost 3D printer into a sample preparation and PCR device opens up opportunities for diagnostics of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings. Moving forward, the company is planning to use the 3D printer to demonstrate the rapid detection for other infectious diseases and also hope to use this technology to advance STEM education in schools. Wong noted that his company has also developed very low-cost and rapid thermal cyclers that use thermoses for nucleic acid amplification and they can include building these Thermos Thermal Cyclers as part of the STEM project . ""Currently, many STEM projects are limited to exposing students to one or two subjects simultaneously. We believe our approach will enable students to learn and apply different subjects like programming, CAD drawing, molecular biology, math, and physics at the same time,"" Wong said. ""The conversion is completely reversible, so these 3D printers do not lose their printing functionality.  If the schools already have 3D printers, it won't cost them too much to implement a curriculum using our approach,"" he also emphasized.","Published: August 2, 2016"

The study, led by the University of Sheffield, is the first to create a comprehensive list of relevant cancer blood biomarkers that have been researched in the last five years. The study also groups them by molecular function and records the technologies that can be used to detect them. The team   from the Universities of Sheffield, Coventry and Warwick   started with over 19,000 scientific studies published over the last five years that investigated blood based biomarkers. Systematic review methods   including ruling out studies in fewer than 50 patients   reduced this to 4,000 studies from which the final biomarker list was compiled. Lead researcher, Dr Lesley Uttley, from the University of Sheffield s School of Health and Related Research, said:  Because of the sheer number of publications in this field, previous reviews have only been able to look at one biomarker or a small group of biomarkers. Our data mining approach allowed us to take in all relevant research findings from the five-year period, which meant we could map the full range of potential blood-based biomarkers that are particularly relevant for early detection of cancer.  The work was carried out on behalf of the Early Cancer Detection Consortium, a group of nearly 40 organisations, including universities, hospitals and commercial companies. The Consortium was funded by Cancer Research UK to investigate whether a cost-effective screening test can be used in the general population to identify people with early stage cancers. The next step will be to look in detail at the research behind each biomarker, to check that it is robust and that the biomarker could feasibly be used as part of a screening test. Biomarkers will also be grouped by cancer type at this stage. The validated biomarkers will then be put through a clinical study, using samples from cancer patients and healthy controls, to check how effectively they identify the presence of cancer. Finally, those biomarkers which work successfully in the study will be taken forward into a clinical trial, to see if the screening test works in practice and is cost-effective. ECDC Director and Molecular Pathologist at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Professor Ian Cree, said:  Our expectation is that, once the validation and clinical studies are completed, we will have a suite of around 50 biomarkers, identified using four different tests, that can go into the clinical trial. To complete the validation and the trials will take six to eight years, but in theory, we could have a test ready within three years for use in high risk groups .  Our vision is that the screen will pick up even the small amounts of these biomarkers that might be in the blood at an early stage of the cancer, without necessarily identifying which cancer they relate to. Patients would then be referred for more specific tests, that could narrow down the tumour type.  The Consortium has set up a company, Pinpoint Cancer Ltd, to take the research forward and is actively seeking investment and funding for the next stages of the project.","Published: August 1, 2016"

Pfizer Inc. has announced that it has acquired Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc., focused on developing gene therapies for the potential treatment of patients with certain rare diseases related to neuromuscular conditions and those affecting the central nervous system. This acquisition significantly expands Pfizer s expertise in gene therapy by providing them with a clinical and several pre-clinical assets that complement the company s rare disease portfolio, an advanced recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) vector design and production technology, and a fully functional Phase I/II gene therapy manufacturing facility that Bamboo acquired from the University of North Carolina earlier this year. Gene therapy is an emerging area of medical research focused on highly specialized, one-time, transformative treatments addressing the root cause of diseases caused by genetic mutation. Gene therapy is a promising investigational technology, especially for patients with rare diseases, many of which are caused by a single genetic mutation. The technology involves introducing genetic material into the body to deliver a corrected copy of a gene to a patient s cells to compensate for a defective one. The genetic material can be delivered to the cells by a variety of means, most frequently using a viral vector such as rAAV. There have been no gene therapy products approved in the U.S. to date.  The field of gene therapy research has made tremendous strides in recent years, and we are pleased to be able to further enhance our leadership position in this area through this transaction with Bamboo,  said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development.  We believe that gene therapy may hold the promise of bringing true disease modification for patients suffering from devastating diseases, and we hope to see this promise come to fruition   through new and existing in-house capabilities and potential partnership opportunities   in the years to come.  Bamboo s portfolio includes potential best-in-class rAAV-based gene therapies that will complement Pfizer s rare disease and gene therapy portfolios in two priority areas: neuromuscular, with a pre-clinical asset for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD); and central nervous system, with pre-clinical assets for Friedreich s Ataxia and Canavan disease, and a Phase I asset for Giant Axonal Neuropathy. Bamboo s approximately 11,000-square foot, fully staffed and operational manufacturing facility has experience producing Phase I/II materials using a superior suspension, cell-based production platform that increases scalability, efficiency and purity. This helps enable the DMD program and other projects requiring large amounts of rAAV. The facility, previously known as the University of North Carolina Vector Core facility, has served as a qualified supplier of rAAV vectors for several healthcare companies and academic institutions.  We believe Bamboo s industry leading capabilities in rAAV vector design and manufacturing complement Pfizer s rare disease strategy and help advance Pfizer s mission to deliver life-changing innovation to patients with the greatest needs,  said Gregory LaRosa, Chief Scientific Officer, Rare Disease Research Unit, Pfizer.  Bringing together Pfizer and Bamboo colleagues  deep scientific understanding of both rAAV biology and complex biologic manufacturing will help position us for success in this area. We are pleased to welcome Bamboo colleagues to Pfizer and look forward to working together on transformative gene therapies for patients in areas of high unmet medical need.  Jude Samulski, Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Chairman of Bamboo and a leading expert in the field of rAAV vectors with more than 25 years of experience, will be joining Pfizer. Dr. Samulski, together with the Bamboo team, will play a key role in helping to develop and accelerate Pfizer s capabilities in gene therapy.  We are pleased to begin working with Pfizer, as this represents a significant step toward bringing Bamboo s portfolio into the clinic and ultimately potential new medicines to patients,  Dr. Samulski said. Pfizer previously acquired approximately 22 percent of Bamboo s fully diluted equity during the first quarter of 2016 for a payment of approximately $43 million. Under the terms of this transaction, Pfizer acquired all of Bamboo s remaining equity for an upfront payment of $150 million, and Bamboo s selling shareholders will be eligible for potential milestone payments of up to $495 million contingent upon the progression of key assets through development, regulatory approval and commercialization.

Overall, respondents rated our pre-sales consultancy at 9 out of 10, implementation service at 8 out of 10 and helpdesk assistance at 9 out of 10, which are excellent results. Nonetheless there is still room for improvement here and in other aspects of our customer service, so we will continue to address all of these areas.  In addition to the general high scores recorded during the survey, many customers expressed their satisfaction in other ways. These included plans to upgrade their current version of Matrix; add more licenses; expand the use of Matrix to other departments and expand the use of Matrix to other sites.","Published: August 1, 2016"

Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease. Humans could be infected through contaminated water or food, such as fish and shellfish. However, whether BMAA was really present in aquatic systems, and at what levels, became the subject of a fierce scientific debate; and of the PhD thesis of Els Faassen.  In her study Faassen found BMAA to reduce survival, somatic growth, and reproduction and population growth in Daphnia magna. Animals did not adapt to BMAA exposure: exposed animals born from exposed mothers had a lower brood viability and neonate weight than animals exposed to BMAA, but born from unexposed mothers. In addition, D. magna was shown to take up BMAA from the growth medium and to transfer it to its offspring. D. magna therefore might be an important vector for BMAA transfer along the pelagic food chain, but whether BMAA plays a role in preventing zooplankton from controlling cyanobacterial blooms needs further investigation.  Els Faassen:  Although BMAA research has much progressed between the start of my thesis  work and its completion, some important questions still require an answer. Most urgently, it should be determined whether BMAA is indeed involved in the neurological diseases mentioned above, and if so, which doses trigger the onset of these diseases. Human exposure pathways should then be more systematically quantified, and it might be prudent to investigate if the occurrence of BMAA is restricted to aquatic systems, or whether sources from terrestrial systems contribute to BMAA exposure as well.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/stats-improve-insight-of-nanoparticle-risks-210084,Stats Improve Insight of Nanoparticle Risks Study concuded that through statistical methods it is possible to improve the risk assessment of nanoparticles  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. By using specific statistical methods, it has become possible to improve the risk assessment of nanoparticles. This was the conclusion of the PhD thesis that Rianne Jacobs defended on 7 July 2016 at Wageningen University. Jacobs showed that these techniques can be used in risk assessment to separate two important sources of error, which makes the results of the assessment more reliable. Nanotechnology is a relatively new, but fast growing field. As with all novel materials, nanoparticles have no history of safe use. This makes it difficult to assess the risks. To create broad societal support for nanotechnology, it is essential to understand the risks. Important questions in this respect are the following: with limited experience, how can the risks be estimated as accurately as possible, and how can we quickly acquire more understanding of these risks? With her research, Jacobs wants to help answer questions like these. Lack of Knowledge and Small Sample Sizes There are two important reasons why it is difficult to assess the risk of nanoparticles. The first reason is the lack of knowledge: how do the particles become dispersed in the environment, how do people and other organisms come into contact with the particles and how harmful are they for these organisms? This lack of knowledge leads to uncertainty in the risk assessment. The second reason is that risk assessors often have to work with small sample sizes. This results in a large margin of error in the risk assessment. In her study, Jacobs has shown how statistical methods can help risk assessors deal with this uncertainty and these small sample sizes. Uncertainty and Variability When estimating risk, researchers focus on measurements, but such measurements are never conclusive. Statistical techniques can help describe the variation in the measurements. An important consideration is that there are two separate effects: uncertainty and variability. Uncertainty results from a lack of knowledge, for example because researchers have not made enough measurements or they have not made them with sufficient accuracy. This can obviously be improved. Variability is the variation that is inherent to all natural processes and living organisms. For example, humans react differently to many substances than yeast cells do. This variation is a fact of nature; you cannot do anything to  improve  it.  Integrated Probabilistic Risk Assessment Jacobs successfully used the method known as Integrated Probabilistic Risk Assessment (IPRA) to separate these two types of variation. This method was developed to assess the health effects of chemicals on people, but Jacobs has adapted it to nanoparticles. With this method, risk assessors not only achieve a better result than with standard worst-case estimates, the method also identifies which sources of uncertainty contribute the most to the total uncertainty in the risk assessment. By focussing on these sources, the risk assessment can be improved substantially.  Examples from Practice In her investigation, Jacobs studied various applications of nanoparticles, such as nanosilica in food products, titanium dioxide in cosmetics and medicines and antibacterial silver particles. With her approach, Jacobs was able to identify the most important sources of uncertainty in these applications. Based on this identification, research can focus on the most crucial areas, which leads to substantial progress in reducing the uncertainty that currently hampers the risk assessment of nanoparticles.","Published: August 1, 2016"

These cells may be significant for developing more effective vaccines, according to a report today in the journal Immunity.  UW Medicine and Seattle Children s researchers headed the study. The findings suggest that these white blood cells, called IgM memory B cells, may be more important in the body s early response to malaria re-infection than another group of cells, called IgG memory B cells, that for years have been the focus of malaria-vaccine research, said Marion Pepper, University of Washington assistant professor of immunology. She led the research project.  The focus on IgG memory B cells in malaria vaccine development may be why malaria vaccines developed to date have not proven very effective,  Pepper said.   Malaria is a parasitic infection that is spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Latin America and Africa. The malaria parasite causes more than 200 million cases of illness and 430,000 deaths a year. The need for an effective vaccine is urgent: Drug-resistant parasites are becoming more common, as are malaria-carrying mosquitoes resistant to the insecticides. So far, however, even the most promising malaria vaccines have proven to provide only weak, short-lived protection.  B cells are a class of immune cells that produce antibodies to fight invading viruses, bacteria, and parasites. As newly formed cells, they are in an inactive, or naive, state. In this state, they have two kinds of antibody-like receptors on their surfaces, called IgM and IgD. When they encounter a protein, called an antigen, from a pathogen that matches those cell-surface receptors, the B cells become active. When this happens, some of these activated B cells immediately begin pumping out either IgM or IgD antibodies, thereby launching the immune system s initial defence. But others move to specialized centres in the spleen and lymph nodes, where they undergo a process called somatic hypermutation. This results in production of B cells that secrete antibodies that have higher affinity for the antigen and are therefore, more effective. Many also undergo a process called class switching in which they changed the type of antibody they produce, typically switching from IgM and IgD to primarily IgG.  This move creates a large population of IgG-producing B cells. After the infection has been removed, some of the activated B cells become dormant  memory B cells . These cells, which can persist for years, even for a lifetime, can be quickly reactivated should a second infection occur. They are ready to produce large amounts of the refined, high-affinity antibodies so that the invader can be neutralized before it can take hold. Because of this tendency to provide long-term protection, researchers have sought to develop vaccines that generate memory B cells capable of producing a strong IgG response to an infection. In fact, the ability of a vaccine to generate high levels of IgG in the blood is a standard measure of an experimental vaccine s potential effectiveness and a goal of vaccine developers. IgM B cells, on the other hand, were thought to provide only a transient initial response to infection, and to play only a minor role in generating a memory B cell response to re-infection. In the new study, the UW researchers used a fluorescent marker that bound to B cell receptors for a malaria parasite antigen called Merozoite Surface Protein 1. This tag allowed them to track memory B cells in previously malaria-infected mice when they were reinfected with the parasite.  The scientists found that, although there were far fewer IgM memory B cells compared to IgG memory B cells at the time of reinfection, the IgM memory B cells began to multiply far more rapidly than the IgG memory B cells.  They observed that early in the immune systems  response most of the newly formed antibody-producing cells were in fact IgM-secreting cells, not IgG-secreting cells. What s more, they found that the IgM antibodies these cells produced had undergone somatic hypermutation. They were producing high-affinity antibodies whose affinity for the Merozoite Surface Protein 1antigen was equal to that seen with IgG antibodies.  The big picture here is that in vaccine trials, researchers are just looking at IgG responses,  said Pepper.  What our findings suggest is that we may be missing a highly effective component of the immune response: IgM memory B cells. Those cells are producing refined, somatically hypermutated, high-affinity, antibodies well before IgG memory B cells are producing their antibodies. Our findings also show that IgM memory B cells are capable of producing high affinity IgG antibodies, thereby implicating them in both IgM and IgG protective responses. ","Published: August 1, 2016"

This research is an excellent example of how the benefits of  big data  critically depend upon the existence of algorithms that are capable of transforming such data into information,  said Dr. Przytycka, a senior investigator at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the NIH s National Library of Medicine. Aptamers are short RNA or DNA molecules that are capable of binding with high affinity and specificity to diverse biological targets.  Aptamers bind to their targets because of features of their sequence and structure that are complementary to the biochemical characteristics of the target s surface. Possible targets of aptamers include small organic molecules, proteins or protein complexes, virus surfaces and entire cells. This broad range of targets makes aptamers candidates for a wide variety of applications, ranging from molecular biosensors to drug delivery systems to antibody replacement. AptaTRACE is designed for use in conjunction with High-Throughput Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (HT-SELEX), a laboratory technique for identifying aptamers.  HT-SELEX allows analyses of millions of sequences to identify the candidates that undergo selection for binding to the target. The AptaTRACE tool analyzes this data to find the common features (or  motifs ) among the sequences that bind. AptaTRACE is the first algorithm that uses the full scope of sequencing data from a large number of selection rounds to capture sequence and structure features of aptamers that bind to the target. Such information allows researchers to better understand why some molecules bind and others do not. Understanding these binding motifs is critical for taking advantage of the aptamers identified via the HT-SELEX process to enable modifications that transform aptamers into drug delivery systems targeting specific cells, for example. Research describing AptaTRACE is published in the July 27 issue of Cell Systems.","Published: August 1, 2016"

Researchers studying the underlying biology of KRAS in lung cancer determined that activity resulting from the ACSL3 gene is essential for these lung cancer cells to survive, and that suppressing ACSL3 causes these lung cancer cells to die. The findings are significant because genetic mutations of KRAS occur in about 30 percent of lung cancer cases, and they are associated with aggressive, therapy-resistant disease with a poor prognosis. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Despite some recent advances, mutant KRAS remains a very challenging target. There is a dearth of treatment options for tumours initiated by this gene,  said senior author Dr. Pier Paolo Scaglioni, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology, and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. The KRAS gene (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), produces proteins called K-Ras that influence when cells divide. Mutations in K-Ras can result in normal cells dividing uncontrollably and turning cancerous.   Mutant KRAS not only promotes the growth of tumours, but also the survival of established lung cancer. Since we have no clinically-relevant effective inhibitors of mutant KRAS at this time, there has been an intense clinical interest in developing a treatment that is proven effective,  said Dr. Scaglioni, who leads the Cancer Signalling Laboratory at the Simmons Cancer Center. The team found that the enzymatic activity of ACSL3 (Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3) is needed for the mutant KRAS gene to promote the formation of lung cancer, and further demonstrated that fatty acids, which are the substrates of ACSL3 enzyme, have a critical role in lung cancer.  There is an urgent need for discovery of additional targets that inhibit lipid metabolism in cancer cells that could lead to targeted therapies: the discovery of the importance of ACSL3 in lung cancer meets this unmet need,  said Dr. Mahesh S. Padanad, first author and part of the UT Southwestern team.","Published: August 1, 2016"

Biopharmaceutical drugs, which are used in a wide range of therapies including vaccines and treatments for diabetes and cancer, are typically produced in large, centralized fermentation plants. This means they must be transported to the treatment site, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and challenging to execute in areas with poor supply chains. Now a portable production system, designed to manufacture a range of biopharmaceuticals on demand, has been developed by researchers at MIT, with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In a paper published today in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers demonstrate that the system can be used to produce a single dose of treatment from a compact device containing a small droplet of cells in a liquid. In this way, the system could ultimately be carried onto the battlefield and used to produce treatments at the point of care. It could also be used to manufacture a vaccine to prevent a disease outbreak in a remote village, according to senior author Tim Lu, an associate professor of biological engineering and electrical engineering and computer science, and head of the Synthetic Biology Group at MIT s Research Laboratory of Electronics.  Imagine you were on Mars or in a remote desert, without access to a full formulary, you could program the yeast to produce drugs on demand locally,  Lu says.   The system is based on a programmable strain of yeast, Pichia pastoris, which can be induced to express one of two therapeutic proteins when exposed to a particular chemical trigger. The researchers chose P. pastoris because it can grow to very high densities on simple and inexpensive carbon sources, and are able to express large amounts of protein.  We altered the yeast so it could be more easily genetically modified, and could include more than one therapeutic in its repertoire,  Lu says. When the researchers exposed the modified yeast to estrogen  -estradiol, the cells expressed recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH). In contrast, when they exposed the cells to methanol, the yeast expressed the protein interferon. The cells are held within a millimetre-scale table-top microbioreactor, containing a microfluidic chip, which was originally developed by Rajeev Ram, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, and his team, and then commercialized by Kevin Lee   an MIT graduate and co-author   through a spin-off company. A liquid containing the desired chemical trigger is first fed into the reactor, to mix with the cells. Inside the reactor, the cell-and-chemical mixture is surrounded on three sides by polycarbonate; on the fourth side is a flexible and gas-permeable silicone rubber membrane. By pressurizing the gas above this membrane, the researchers are able to gently massage the liquid droplet to ensure its contents are fully mixed together.  This makes sure that the one millilitre (of liquid) is homogenous, and that is important because diffusion at these small scales, where there is no turbulence, takes a surprisingly long time,  says Ram, who was also a senior author of the paper. Because the membrane is gas permeable, it allows oxygen to flow through to the cells, while any carbon dioxide they produce can be easily extracted. The device continuously monitors conditions within the microfluidic chip, including oxygen levels, temperature, and pH, to ensure the optimum environment for cell growth. It also monitors cell density. If the yeast is required to produce a different protein, the liquid is simply flushed through a filter, leaving the cells behind. Fresh liquid containing a new chemical trigger can then be added, to stimulate production of the next protein. Although other research teams have previously attempted to build microbioreactors, these have not have not had the ability to retain the protein-producing cells while flushing out the liquid they are mixed with, Ram says.  You want to keep the cells because they are your factory,  he says.  But you also want to rapidly change their chemical environment, in order to change the trigger for protein production.  The researchers have demonstrated a very logical and practical way to produce biologic drugs, according to Luke P. Lee, a professor of bioengineering at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved in the research. Their smart biologics production technique uses one of the best integrated microfluidics systems, Lee says.  It is a pragmatic solution for biomanufacturing, and the team's flexible and portable platform shows an authentic way of producing personalized therapeutics,  he says. The researchers are now investigating the use of the system in combinatorial treatments, in which multiple therapeutics, such as antibodies, are used together. Combining multiple therapeutics in this way can be expensive if each requires its own production line, Lu says.  But if you could engineer a single strain, or maybe even a consortia of strains that grow together, to manufacture combinations of biologics or antibodies, that could be a very powerful way of producing these drugs at a reasonable cost,  he says.","Published: August 1, 2016"

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/reducing-antioxidants-to-kill-cancer-cells-207054,Reducing Antioxidants to Kill Cancer Cells Research suggests reducing levels of antioxidants in pancreatic cancer cells can lead to cell death  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Reducing levels of antioxidants in pancreatic cancer cells can help kill them, newly published research reveals, suggesting an entirely new treatment strategy for the notoriously lethal illness, in which less than 5 percent of patients survive 5 years. Although it has become almost a matter of conventional wisdom in popular culture that raising antioxidant levels in the body tends to keep cancer at bay, a team at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) demonstrates in a series of sophisticated experiments that in the specific context of pancreatic cells on the road to cancer or already in a malignant state, the last thing one wants to do is to raise antioxidant levels. Oxidizing and anti-oxidizing agents are created in every cell, and are kept in a very precise balance when cells are healthy. The CSHL team, led by Professor David Tuveson, M.D., Ph.D., who is also director of research for The Lustgarten Foundation, proceeds from the insight that proliferating cancer cells present a special case: more oxidants are being made in malignant cells, but more anti-oxidants are being made, too, countering the impact of rising oxidation. Without commensurately more anti-oxidants, malignant cells will die due to excessive oxidation.  Of course, that s exactly what we want cancer cells to do   to burn themselves out,  observes Iok In Christine Chio, a postdoctoral investigator in the Tuveson lab who led experiments reported today in the journal Cell.  The therapeutic principle our lab is testing is whether, by increasing the level of oxidation in cancer cells, we can cause pre-malignant and malignant cells to die.  Most existing forms of cancer therapy, including ionizing radiation treatments and chemotherapy, depend on the killing power of oxidation. Anti-oxidants do indeed have a role in cellular health; but when it comes to killing cancer cells, they are anathema. When cells detect excessive oxidation, they literally commit suicide, following a built-in program called apoptosis. One way of increasing oxidation in cancer cells is to decrease levels of antioxidants in those same cells. A question addressed by Tuveson s team was how best to do this   and do it in a way that does not harm healthy cells. They focused on a protein called NRF2 (pronounced  nerf-2 ). Scientists call it a master regulator of redox homeostasis   by which they mean that it s one of the switches one can tweak to disturb the exquisite balance between oxidation and reduction in cancer cells. When NRF2 is active, cells synthesize a chemical called glutathione, an important antioxidant. It makes sense, then, to try to reduce NRF2 activity or knock it out of action altogether. This is not possible, for two reasons. One is that it is a transcription factor   a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. Transcription factors are famously difficult to target with drugs. But  you probably wouldn t want to knock it out, in any case,  says Chio,  because in addition to promoting production of glutathione, NRF2 has a role in regulating several hundred different genes.  One can t delete it from a cell without impacting many other processes. Tuveson, Chio and other members of the team arrived at a different strategy after conducting experiments in pancreas cells grown in the lab and testing a number of new therapeutic approaches in an animal model of pancreatic cancer.  Using a panel of pancreas organoids   spherical agglomerations of pancreas cells sampled from people with pancreatic cancer and from the healthy pancreas   they were able to observe what happens when NRF2 is completely eliminated. The test was run in normal, pre-malignant and malignant pancreas organoids. The pre-malignant organoids carried cellular mutations in the kras gene, which is aberrant in nearly all human pancreatic cancers. The malignant organoids bore that mutation plus a mutation that inactivated the powerful tumor suppressor gene p53. That mutation along with kras is seen in most human malignancies. These experiments provided a critical clue: The team saw that when NRF2 is missing, the machinery in cells that translates messages from genes into proteins   the process of protein synthesis -- is very sensitive to fluctuations in the balance between oxidants and anti-oxidants. Crucially, however, protein synthesis was not impacted in normal pancreas cells.  We were very excited when we saw this,  Chio says.  This meant that if we could find a way of reducing antioxidants, protein synthesis would only be impacted in precancerous and malignant cells, a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy.  This phenomenon is called synthetic lethality. It occurs when a condition affecting both healthy and unhealthy cells is lethal only to the unhealthy cells.  The team came up with a two-drug cocktail, which they delivered to mice that model pancreatic cancer. One of the agents, called an AKT inhibitor, is designed to inhibit the beginning of translation process that leads to protein synthesis. The other agent, called BSO, inhibits the synthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant. AKT inhibitors, administered alone, have produced only modest survival benefits in both mouse models and human patients.  We hoped that by combining them with BSO we might generate a synergy that would boost its effectiveness,  says Chio. In effect, the strategy was to mimic biochemically what would happen if they were able to knock out or reduce levels of NRF2 in cancer cells. It was the rationale for hitching BSO to the AKT inhibitor.  This is where our pancreas organoid system was so valuable,  Chio says.  We were able to test this idea and see that this approach was synthetically lethal   it did increase the killing power of the AKT inhibitor, but the synergy was not present in the setting of normal pancreas cells,  she says. In other words, normal pancreas cells were not harmed by the treatment. The team s new paper reports a synergistic effect in the mouse model of pancreas cancer, as well, proving the concept of killing more cancer by decreasing cancer cell antioxidant levels. Not fully satisfied with the survival benefit noted   comparatively small in the mice   they believe they can optimize the treatment by combining different translation inhibitors and repressors of antioxidant synthesis. This work is well under way. The approach is potentially pertinent in other cancers in which kras mutations place cells on the road to malignancy. These include certain types of lung cancer and breast cancer. Dr. Tuveson, who is director of The Lustgarten Foundation Pancreatic Cancer Research Laboratory as well as director of research for The Lustgarten Foundation and Deputy Director of the CSHL Cancer Center, says he is excited about the research.   Pancreatic cancer employs NRF2 as one of its henchmen to promote bad behavior, but the details were previously unclear,  Dr. Tuveson says.  By developing organoid models, Christine, proteomics expert Darryl Pappin of CSHL and their collaborators pursued the basic biology of NRF2 to unravel the molecular underpinnings of this protein and thereby propose new therapeutic approaches for patients.  We plan to translate Christine s findings to early phase clinical trials in the near future. ","Published: August 1, 2016"

This research is an excellent example of how the benefits of  big data  critically depend upon the existence of algorithms that are capable of transforming such data into information,  said Dr. Przytycka, a senior investigator at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the NIH s National Library of Medicine. Aptamers are short RNA or DNA molecules that are capable of binding with high affinity and specificity to diverse biological targets. Aptamers bind to their targets because of features of their sequence and structure that are complementary to the biochemical characteristics of the target s surface. Possible targets of aptamers include small organic molecules, proteins or protein complexes, virus surfaces and entire cells. This broad range of targets makes aptamers candidates for a wide variety of applications, ranging from molecular biosensors to drug delivery systems to antibody replacement. AptaTRACE is designed for use in conjunction with High-Throughput Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (HT-SELEX), a laboratory technique for identifying aptamers. HT-SELEX allows analyses of millions of sequences to identify the candidates that undergo selection for binding to the target. The AptaTRACE tool analyzes this data to find the common features (or  motifs ) among the sequences that bind. AptaTRACE is the first algorithm that uses the full scope of sequencing data from a large number of selection rounds to capture sequence and structure features of aptamers that bind to the target. Such information allows researchers to better understand why some molecules bind and others do not. Understanding these binding motifs is critical for taking advantage of the aptamers identified via the HT-SELEX process to enable modifications that transform aptamers into drug delivery systems targeting specific cells, for example. Research describing AptaTRACE is published in the July 27 issue of Cell Systems. AptaTRACE is the result of a collaboration between Dr. Przytycka s group and researchers from the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, California, led by Dr. John Burnett, and from Freiburg University, Breisgau, Germany, led by Dr. Rolf Backofen.","Published: July 30, 2016"

The study also found that people with LQTS who experience seizures are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death. See Also:  Researchers find an important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures According to research published in Neurology, there is a clear association between the heart and the brain of LQTS patients. Patients carrying LQTS genetic mutations were three times more likely to have experienced seizures in their past, compared to their family members who did not carry those mutations. Interestingly, LQTS patients who had a history of seizures also tended to have worse cardiac symptoms. David Auerbach, PhD, senior instructor of Medicine in the Aab Cardiovascular Research Institute of the University of Rochester Medical Center, and lead author of the study found seizure status to be the strongest predictor of cardiac arrhythmias the abnormal heart rhythms characteristic of LQTS. In fact, about 20% of the LQTS patients in the study who had a history of seizures had survived at least one lethal cardiac arrhythmia. Auerbach's study set a new clinical precedence for the link between seizures and LQTS and provides a case for doctors to pay more attention to what is happening in LQTS patients' brains or, more broadly, to ""look outside the classic organ of interest"" in any disease. Related: Study suggests new treatment for seizuresAs a postdoctoral fellow, Auerbach studied the heart-brain connection in a severe genetic form of epilepsy, and found that cardiac arrhythmias were one cause of sudden unexplained death in people with epilepsy. Now, he investigates the converse - whether a genetic heart disorder is also associated with issues in the brain. With funding from the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Auerbach tapped into the Rochester-based LQTS Patient Registry to answer this question. This unique resource was developed 40 years ago by the senior author of the study, Arthur Moss, MD, the Bradford C. Berk, MD, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Medicine at URMC. The registry contains information about more than 18,000 people including LQTS patients and their affected and unaffected family members, who provide a nearly ideal group of controls. ""In essence, they have the same genetic makeup, except theoretically, the LQTS-causing mutation,"" says Auerbach. To ensure that the seizures reported in the registry were not merely misdiagnosed cardiac arrhythmias, Auerbach investigated the effect of beta blockers, drugs often prescribed to LQTS patients to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. While the drugs effectively reduced patients' arrhythmias, they had no effect on seizures, minimizing the chance that the seizures were simply misdiagnosed cardiac side effects. Looking at the patients' genetic information, Auerbach and his colleagues found that patients with the three different types of LQTS (LQTS1-3) showed similar heart rhythm symptoms, but vastly different prevalence of seizures. LQTS1 and LQTS2 patients had much higher prevalence of seizures than LQTS3 or no mutation with LQTS2 at the greatest risk. Learn More: Human stem cell-derived neuron transplants reduce seizures in mice Further investigation of the LQTS-causing mutation showed that the specific location of the mutation greatly affected the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. In one location on the gene, the mutation protected against these symptoms, but in another location on the same gene, the mutation increased the risk of those symptoms. Understanding what each of these mutations does may shed new light on a basic mechanism of seizures and may provide viable therapeutic targets to treat LQTS. Auerbach says there is still a lot more work to do, but believes, ""you could begin applying these findings to patients today by telling physicians treating LQTS patients to look outside the heart.""

The normalization of dopamine systems suggests smoking-related deficits are a consequence of chronic smoking, rather than a risk factor. These findings raise the possibility that treatments might be developed that normalize the dopamine system in smokers. See Also: Smoking thins vital part of brain According to first author Dr. Lena Rademacher, postdoctoral fellow at the University of L beck in Germany, a major challenge in understanding substance-related disorders lies in uncovering why only some individuals become addicted. Researchers think some people could possess a trait that predisposes them to addiction, and suspect that brain circuits involving dopamine may be involved. Drugs of abuse release dopamine, and addiction to nicotine is associated with abnormalities in the dopamine system. But researchers are uncertain if smoking induces those abnormalities or if they already exist and contribute to risk of nicotine addiction. Don't Miss: Smoking during pregnancy associated with increased risk of schizophrenia in offspringSenior author Dr. Ingo Vernaleken, Professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, led a team of researchers examining dopamine function in chronic smokers before and after long-term cessation. The researchers used a brain imaging technique called positron emission tomography to measure an index of the capacity for dopamine production in 30 men who were nicotine-dependent smokers and 15 nonsmokers. After performing an initial scan on all participants, 15 smokers who successfully quit were scanned again after three months of abstinence from smoking and nicotine replacement. The initial scan revealed a 15-20% reduction in the capacity for dopamine production in smokers compared with nonsmokers. The researchers expected this impairment to persist even after quitting, which would suggest it could be a marker of vulnerability for nicotine addiction. ""Surprisingly, the alterations in dopamine synthesis capacity normalized through abstinence,"" said Rademacher. Learn More: Neural reward response may demonstrate why quitting smoking is harder for some The role of dopamine in vulnerability toward nicotine addiction cannot be excluded, but the findings suggest that altered dopamine function of smokers is a consequence of nicotine consumption rather than the cause.

Now, researchers from the University of Missouri (MU) have found a connection between lack of ovarian hormones and changes in the brain's pleasure center, a hotspot in the brain that processes and reinforces messages related to reward, pleasure, activity and motivation for physical exercise. Findings suggest that activation of brain receptors in that part of the brain may serve as a future treatment to improve motivation for physical activity in postmenopausal women.

The team studied the rats' use of running wheels set up in the cages before and after the rats had their ovaries removed. They also examined gene expression changes of dopamine receptors within the brain's pleasure center. The high-fit rat group had more activity in the brain's pleasure center, which correlated with greater wheel running before and after the loss of ovarian hormones. However, the high-fit rats still saw a significant reduction in wheel running after their ovaries were removed. This reduction in wheel running also correlated significantly with a reduction in their dopamine signaling levels, indicating that the brain's pleasure center could be involved.

But even before then, concerns about the unprecedented spread of Zika virus in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America had prompted NIH-funded scientists to step up their efforts to combat this emerging infectious disease threat. Over the last year, research aimed at understanding the mosquito-borne virus has progressed rapidly, and we now appear to be getting closer to a Zika vaccine. In a recent study in the journal Nature, researchers found that a single dose of either of two experimental vaccines completely protected mice against a major viral strain responsible for the Zika outbreak in Brazil. Caution is certainly warranted when extrapolating these (or any other) findings from mice to people. But, taking into account the fact that researchers have already developed safe and effective human vaccines for several related viruses, the new work represents a very encouraging milestone on the road toward a much-needed Zika vaccine for humans. The two experimental vaccines undergoing testing represent different approaches to vaccine development. One approach, developed by Dan Barouch of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, and colleagues, is a DNA vaccine composed of select snippets of genetic material from a Zika strain from Brazil. The DNA included in the vaccine encodes proteins found at the viral surface that are known to induce an immune response. Barouch and his colleagues found that a single shot of their experimental DNA vaccine could induce the production of Zika-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice. To find out whether those antibodies protected against Zika infection, they intravenously delivered live Zika virus from Brazil or Puerto Rico to mice four weeks after receiving either the vaccine or a sham shot. Unvaccinated mice developed high levels of Zika virus that lasted about six days. In contrast, vaccinated mice showed no detectable Zika virus in their bloodstream. This was, of course, very encouraging news, demonstrating that the vaccine offered complete protection against Zika strains from both Brazil and Puerto Rico. The other good news is the vaccinated mice resisted infection for at least eight weeks. The second vaccine, developed by a team at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, working in close collaboration with the NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), was produced from a purified, inactivated Zika virus from Puerto Rico. To find out whether this vaccine offered similar protection, the researchers assessed whether it was able to induce antibodies that can protect against Zika infection. The results were positive.  It will now be important to follow the animals in the coming months to assess how long Zika immunity lasts and test the vaccines in larger animals and in humans. When it comes to vaccine development, multiple options are always best. Purified, inactivated virus vaccines, such as used to develop the annual flu shot, represent a more traditional approach. But DNA vaccines, where the DNA is injected into muscle and directs the production of the relevant antigen, can offer some potential advantages. While no DNA vaccine has yet received FDA approval for human use, there is great interest in introducing this  vaccine of the future  into practice. To produce such vaccines, labs don t have to grow large batches of virus, which can take time and money. Furthermore, these vaccines allow scientists to include only selected bits of a virus known to produce the desired immune response, with essentially zero risk of inducing an active infection. At least two other Zika DNA vaccines under development at NIAID and elsewhere are showing promise. The NIAID will launch its first human vaccine safety tests of a DNA vaccine, involving about 80 volunteers, at the end of the summer or in the early fall. The tests will last about three months and should set the stage for a clinical trial to evaluate whether the vaccine guards against Zika infection in people. This fall, NIAID and Walter Reed plan to launch two clinical trials of inactivated viral vaccines, including the one described in the Nature study. The trials, each involving dozens of volunteers, will test to see whether the vaccines are safe and elicit an immune response in people. Vaccine development and testing take time. But given the rapid pace of progress, there s good reason for hope that a Zika vaccine could be a possibility in the not too distant future.","Published: July 29, 2016"

Oncolytic viruses are viruses engineered to kill cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, which subsequently elicits anti-cancer immune responses. This collaboration in oncolytic virus development adds another novel technology platform to Pfizer s cancer vaccine efforts and provides an additional tool to bolster its immuno-oncology portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer and Western Oncolytics will collaborate on preclinical and clinical development of WO-12 through Phase I trials. Following completion of Phase I trials, Pfizer has an exclusive option to acquire WO-12. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  Our goal is to combine WO-12 with our portfolio of promising investigational immunotherapies to explore how these novel combinations could help further enhance the body s immune response in fighting cancer cells,  said James Merson, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Immunotherapeutics at Pfizer.  We believe that the real advances in immuno-oncology will come from novel combinations, and cancer fighting viruses and vaccines could play a key role in helping transform cancer treatment and potentially enable us to treat more patients.  WO-12 is a preclinical investigational oncolytic virus. As an in vivo vaccine, it has the potential to be delivered directly to the tumour (intratumoural) or intravenously. More specifically, it is a virus engineered to replicate primarily in cancer cells while delivering several therapeutic genes that modulate the immune system to enhance efficacy against a range of cancers. By replicating inside cancer cells, it is designed to both kill the cancer cell and releases tumour antigens that direct the immune system to recognize the antigens and kill additional cancer cells. WO-12 has potential applications across multiple tumour types.  We believe this collaboration will create a unique opportunity to accelerate and expand the clinical testing of WO-12 as well as to examine potential combinations with other immunotherapies in the Pfizer portfolio,  said Steve Thorne, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Western Oncolytics and inventor of WO-12.","Published: July 29, 2016"

Researchers are testing a new approach to correct metabolic disorders without a whole organ transplant. Their findings appear in Science Translational Medicine. The medical research study tested gene therapy in pigs suffering from hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency. The common treatment for this disease is a drug regimen, but it is ineffective in many patients, and the long-term safety of using the drug is unknown.  Liver transplant is the only curable option in treating HT1, which is characterized by progressive liver disease,  says Raymond Hickey, Ph.D., a Mayo surgical researcher.  Using this novel approach to treat HT1 and other metabolic diseases will allow patients to avoid a liver transplant and save more lives.  Through gene therapy, the corrected liver cells are transplanted into the diseased liver, resulting in enzyme production.  This treatment is a new form of cell transplantation that utilizes the patient s own cells, so it does not require immunosuppressive drugs and, thus, avoids the side effects of those drugs,  says Scott Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D., a liver transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic. This therapy resulted in the improvement of pigs with HT1 and the prevention of liver failure. The use of nuclear imaging enables the researchers to monitor expansion of the corrected cells through a non-invasive imaging process.  Paediatric patients suffering from inborn errors of metabolism of the liver will benefit most from this therapy,  says Dr. Hickey.  More than one-fifth of all paediatric liver transplants are a result of metabolic disease.  The study also examines the use of lentiviral vectors for cell delivery in treating liver diseases, a tool traditionally used in treating blood disorders.","Published: July 29, 2016"

Priority research areas for NIMHD s precision medicine initiative include:   Development of new tools and analytic methods for integrating patient data with information about contextual factors acting at the community or population level to influence health outcomes   Development of pharmacogenomic and other precision medicine tools to identify critical biomarkers for disease progression and drug responses in diverse populations   Translation of pharmacogenomic discoveries into clinical practice including effective treatments   Investigation of facilitators and barriers to implementing precision medicine approaches in disparity populations   Understanding mechanisms that lead to differential health outcomes in common diseases in minorities and disparity populations Although scientific and technological advances have improved the health of the U.S. population overall, racial/ethnic minority populations, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and rural populations continue to experience a disproportionate share of many diseases and adverse health conditions. As the Nation s steward of biomedical and behavioural research, NIH has devoted considerable resources to characterize the root causes of health disparities, uncovering complex webs of interconnected factors (e.g., biological, behavioural, social and environmental factors) acting at multiple levels across the life course. As an important next step, research is needed that capitalizes on this knowledge to develop interventions that reduce or eliminate health disparities. Designed for broad impact, TCCs comprise regional coalitions of research institutions and partners working together to develop and disseminate effective health interventions that can be implemented in real-world settings. TCCs supported through this initiative are expected to focus on at least one priority research area, each combining expertise in precision medicine, population health disparities, and the science of translation, implementation and dissemination to address one or more documented health disparities. The proposed work must focus on one or more health disparities populations, which include Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and rural populations. Each centre will support 2-3 multidisciplinary research projects examining complementary aspects of precision medicine, focusing on interactions between biological, behavioural and contextual predictors of disease vulnerability, resilience and response to therapies in patients from disadvantaged communities. Benefits of medical advances are not always distributed equitably, often because structural or systemic factors limit the effectiveness of new diagnostic or therapeutic approaches in disadvantaged populations. Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease prevention, early detection and treatment that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, demographic factors, social determinants and lifestyle. While it holds great promise for improving patient care, its potential for reducing health disparities hinges on better understanding of the dynamic interplay between biological, behavioural, social and environmental health risk and protective factors experienced across the life course, coupled with greater inclusion of health disparity populations in research aimed at developing precision medicine interventions. The approach of this new program, which focuses on health disparity populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, rural populations and low socioeconomic populations, shares the transformative vision represented by President Obama s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), which supports the NIH s recently implemented PMI Cohort Program, a nationwide effort which seeks to build a longitudinal research cohort of 1 million or more U.S. volunteers, to produce new knowledge with the goal of developing more effective ways to prolong health and treat disease.  The core values of the President s PMI challenge the scientific community to advance population health in ways that create true benefits to all populations,  said NIMHD Director Dr. Eliseo J. P rez-Stable.  Precision medicine research endeavours must go beyond biologic and clinical markers and include social determinants of health, such as the economic, social and political conditions that influence health status. Ultimately, the TCCs will generate new knowledge about precision medicine that resonates from the community level to the national population level. ","Published: July 29, 2016"

Nodthera is based on world class research conducted within Selvita S.A. ( Selvita ), an international drug discovery company, with offices in Boston, San Francisco, Cambridge, UK and Krakow, Poland. Nodthera will be headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inflammasomes are large multiprotein complexes which assemble in a cell s cytoplasm in response to environmental danger signals and are considered an essential part of an organism s innate immune response. Activation of an inflammasome assembly leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-18. Over-activation of the NRLP3 inflammasome is implicated in a wide range of diseases that are a substantial burden on modern healthcare systems such as type 2 diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer s disease and cancer. Until recently, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been a difficult target. However, recent advances and insights from the scientific community has renewed and re-invigorated interest in targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. Selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome rather than its downstream cytokines holds great therapeutic potential. Nodthera aims to become a key player in developing inhibitors of this protein complex. Elizabeth Roper, PhD, a Partner at Epidarex Capital, led the deal and commented  Nodthera Limited has the potential to create first in class small molecule modulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex which could be a significant development in the field.  She further added,  Epidarex is delighted to be partnering with Selvita to bring this exciting science to market.   We are confident that Nodthera s therapeutic approach is exceptional and addresses an important class of intracellular receptors implicated in variety of disorders with unmet medical needs.

For many people, especially those with neurological conditions, memory impairment can be a debilitating symptom that affects every-day life in profound ways. For the first time, University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine scientists report using transcranial alternating current stimulation, or tACS, to target a specific kind of brain activity during sleep and strengthen memory in healthy people. See Also: Learning in your sleep, the right way The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, offer a non-invasive method to potentially help millions of people with conditions such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. For years, researchers have recorded electrical brain activity that oscillates or alternates during sleep; they present as waves on an electroencephalogram (EEG). These waves are called sleep spindles, and scientists have suspected their involvement in cataloging and storing memories as we sleep. ""But we didn't know if sleep spindles enable or even cause memories to be stored and consolidated,"" said senior author Flavio Frohlich, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and member of the UNC Neuroscience Center. ""They could've been merely byproducts of other brain processes that enabled what we learn to be stored as a memory. But our study shows that, indeed, the spindles are crucial for the process of creating memories we need for every-day life. And we can target them to enhance memory."" This marks the first time a research group has reported selectively targeting sleep spindles without also increasing other natural electrical brain activity during sleep. This has never been accomplished with tDCS - transcranial direct current stimulation - the much more popular cousin of tACS in which a constant stream of weak electrical current is applied to the scalp. During Frohlich's study, 16 male participants underwent a screening night of sleep before completing two nights of sleep for the study. Don't Miss: Learning to play the piano? Sleep on it! Before going to sleep each night, all participants performed two common memory exercises - associative word-pairing tests and motor sequence tapping tasks, which involved repeatedly finger-tapping a specific sequence. During both study nights, each participant had electrodes placed at specific spots on their scalps. During sleep one of the nights, each person received tACS an alternating current of weak electricity synchronized with the brain's natural sleep spindles. During sleep the other night, each person received sham stimulation as placebo. Each morning, researchers had participants perform the same standard memory tests. Frohlich's team found no improvement in test scores for associative word-pairing but a significant improvement in the motor tasks when comparing the results between the stimulation and placebo night. ""This demonstrated a direct causal link between the electric activity pattern of sleep spindles and the process of motor memory consolidation."" Frohlich said. Caroline Lustenberger, PhD, first author and postdoctoral fellow in the Frohlich lab, said, ""We're excited about this because we know sleep spindles, along with memory formation, are impaired in a number of disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's. We hope that targeting these sleep spindles could be a new type of treatment for memory impairment and cognitive deficits."" Learn More: Power naps produce a significant improvement in memory performance Frohlich said, ""The next step is to try the same intervention, the same type of non-invasive brain stimulation, in patients that have known deficits in these spindle activity patterns."" Frohlich's team previously used tACS to target the brain's natural alpha oscillations to boost creativity. This was a proof of concept. It showed it was possible to target these particular brain waves, which are prominent as we create ideas, daydream, or meditate.

This abnormal motor behavior appears only while taking L-DOPA, and it stops if the drug is stopped. However, if L-DOPA is taken again, even many months later, it quickly re-emerges. See Also: DNA methylation involved in Alzheimer's disease In research to prevent this side effect and extend the usefulness of L-DOPA which is the most effective drug treatment for Parkinson's disease University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) researchers have uncovered an essential mechanism of this long-term memory for L-DOPA-induced-dyskinesia, or LID. They report a widespread reorganization of DNA methylation a process in which the function of DNA is modified in brain cells caused by L-DOPA. They also found that treatments that increase or decrease DNA methylation can alter dyskinesia symptoms in an animal model. Thus, modification of DNA methylation may be a novel therapeutic target to prevent or reverse LID behavior. ""L-DOPA is a very valuable treatment for Parkinson's, but in many patients its use is limited by dyskinesia,"" said David Standaert, MD, PhD, the John N. Whitaker Professor and chair of the Department of Neurology at UAB. ""Better means of preventing or reversing LID could greatly extend the use of L-DOPA without inducing intolerable side effects. The treatments we have used here, methionine supplementation or RG-108, are not practical for human use; but they point to the opportunity to develop methylation-based epigenetic therapeutics in Parkinson's disease."" Learn More: Researchers pinpoint potential new drug target for protection against certain neurodegenerative diseasesThe research by David Figge, Karen Eskow Jaunarajs, PhD, and corresponding author David Standaert, Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics, UAB Department of Neurology, was recently published in The Journal of Neuroscience. Although studies of LID in animal models have shown changes in gene expression and cell signaling, a key unanswered question still remained: Why is the neural sensitization seen in LID persistent when delivery of L-DOPA is transient? The UAB researchers suspected DNA methylation changes the attachment of a methyl group onto nucleotides in DNA because methylation is known to stably alter gene expression in cells as they grow and differentiate. Furthermore, methylation changes in neurons have been shown to be involved during the formation of place memory and the development of addictive behavior after cocaine use. In general, increased DNA methylation has a silencing effect on nearby gene expression, while removal of the methyl groups enhances gene expression.

The study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, involved brain imaging of white matter in 200 children with autism, ADHD, OCD or no diagnosis. White matter is made up of bundles of nerve fibers that connect cell bodies across the brain, and enable communication between different brain regions. See Also: Study reveals subtle brain differences in men with autism""We found impairments in white matter in the main tract connecting the right and left hemispheres of the brain in children with either autism, ADHD or OCD, when compared to healthy children in the control group,"" says Dr. Stephanie Ameis, first author on the study and clinician-scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's (CAMH's) Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute. This particular white matter tract, the corpus callosum, is the largest in the brain and among the first to develop. The research team, from CAMH, the Hospital for Sick Children and Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, also found children with autism and ADHD showed more severe impairments affecting more of the brain's white matter than those with OCD. This finding may reflect the fact that both autism and ADHD typically have an onset at a much younger age than OCD, and at a time when a number of different white matter tracts are going through rapid development, says Dr. Ameis. Autism, ADHD and OCD have common symptoms and are linked by some of the same genes. Yet historically they have been studied as separate disorders. Together, these three neurodevelopmental disorders affect roughly 15 per cent of children and youth. The study is part of a major initiative, the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders Network (POND) that is examining various childhood brain-related disorders collectively, to better understand their similarities and differences, and develop more effective and targeted therapies. Many of the behaviors that contribute to impairment in autism, ADHD, and OCD, such as attention problems or social difficulties, occur across these conditions, and differ in severity from person to person. The researchers found that the brain's white matter structure was associated with a spectrum of behavioral symptoms present across these diagnoses. Children with greater brain impairment also had higher impairments in functioning in daily life, regardless of their diagnosis, said Dr. Ameis, who is also appointed at the Hospital for Sick Children. Learn More: Autism detection improved by multimodal neuroimagingThis finding has implications for our understanding of the nature of brain-related disorders, notes senior author Dr. Evdokia Anagnostou of Holland Bloorview Rehabilitation Hospital and head of the POND Network.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/fighting-cancer-through-protein-pathways-194525,Fighting Cancer Through Protein Pathways Researchers have found a new drug target within a protein production pathway critical to regulating growth and proliferation of cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Most cancer drugs are designed to halt cell growth, the hallmark of cancer, and one popular target is the pathway that controls the production of a cell s thousands of proteins. UC Berkeley researchers have now found a promising new drug target within that pathway that is appealing, in part, because it appears to control production of only a few percent of the body s many proteins, those critical to regulating the growth and proliferation of cells. The target is a protein that binds to messenger RNA (mRNA)   the cell s blueprint for making protein   and helps get it started along the production line that ends in a fully assembled protein. A drug blocking this binding protein could shut off translation of only the growth-promoting proteins and not other life-critical proteins inside the cell.  If cancer cells are making too much mRNA, you could shut them down by preventing them from using that mRNA to make protein,  said Jamie Cate, a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and of chemistry and leader of the study.  Because this binding protein is not used for general protein production   not every mRNA uses this   you may be able to get a more specific anti-cancer effect by targeting that alone.  The finding was a surprise because the protein is part of a larger assembly of proteins called eIF3   eukaryotic initiation factor 3   that has been known and studied for nearly 50 years.  No one suspected its undercover role in the cell,  said first author Amy Lee, a former UC Berkeley American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellow who is now an assistant professor at Brandeis University.  This may be because eIF3 s ability to selectively control mRNA translation is turned on only when it binds to the set of specialized mRNAs.  Binding between eIF3 and these mRNAs opens up a pocket in eIF3 that then latches onto the end-cap of mRNA to trigger the protein production, or  translation,  process.  To me, it s like finding a secret lever that opens a hidden drawer in an old-time desk,  Cate said.  The desk has been around over one and half billion years and many have studied it for decades, but we figured out how to trigger the opening.  Lee and Cate s research hints that this secret lever, which triggers translation of only a special subset of mRNAs   perhaps only 500 out of some 10,000 mRNAs produced by a cell   will be found to play a critical role in other diseases besides cancer, as well as in plants and animals.  It will be exciting to look in other organisms, such as crop plants and pathogenic fungi, to find out what mRNAs this protein regulates,  Cate said. Down the road, one could imagine finding ways of manipulating how mRNAs bind to eIF3 in all of these different systems.  The new findings by Cate, Lee and their UC Berkeley colleagues will be published online July 27, and in the Aug. 4 print issue of the British journal Nature. Hiding in plain sight Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, which means the protein production machinery goes into overdrive to provide the building materials and control systems for new cells. Hence, biologists for decades have studied the proteins that control how genes are transcribed into mRNA and how the mRNA is read and translated into a functioning protein. One key insight more than 40 years ago was that a so-called initiation protein must bind to a chemical handle on the end of each mRNA to start it through the protein manufacturing plant, the ribosome. Until now, this initiation protein was thought to be eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) for all mRNAs.  When cells don t control how the handle is used, cells can get out of control and cause cancer,  Cate said.  Up until now, this has been thought to be due to eIF4E that binds to the handle.  Earlier this year, Cate and Lee discovered that for a certain specialized subset of mRNAs   most of which have been linked somehow to cancer   initiation is triggered by a different protein in eIF3. Before, that protein was thought to be just one of a dozen or so general initiation factors required for mRNA translation. Instead, they discovered that eIF3, an assembly of 13 separate proteins, binds to unique three-dimensional structures found only in this special subset of mRNAs.  What we found is that another protein, hiding in plain sight for over four decades, can also bind the chemical handle on the end of mRNAs to promote translation,  he said.  It s a component of eIF3   a protein called eIF3d   which has never before been connected to binding the handle.  Subsequent X-ray crystallography of eIF3d revealed the structural rearrangements that must occur when eIF3 binds to the mRNA three-dimensional structures and which open up the secret compartment. The researchers plan further studies using cryoelectron microscopy to locate the actual trigger that opens the compartment.  Basically, we found the button that opens the secret door, but we don t really know what the button looks like yet,  Cate said.","Published: July 28, 2016"

The study reveals three genetically distinct farming populations living in the Near East at the dawn of agriculture 12,000 to 8,000 years ago: two newly described groups in Iran and the Levant and a previously reported group in Anatolia, in what is now Turkey. The findings, published in Nature on July 25, also suggest that agriculture spread in the Near East at least in part because existing groups invented or adopted farming technologies, rather than because one population replaced another.  Some of the earliest farming was practiced in the Levant, including Israel and Jordan, and in the Zagros mountains of Iran two edges of the Fertile Crescent,  said Ron Pinhasi, associate professor of archaeology at University College Dublin and co-senior author of the study.  We wanted to find out whether these early farmers were genetically similar to one another or to the hunter-gatherers who lived there before so we could learn more about how the world s first agricultural transition occurred.  The team s analyses alter what is known about the genetic heritage of present-day people in western Eurasia. They now appear to have descended from four major groups: hunter-gatherers in what is now Western Europe, hunter-gatherers in Eastern Europe and the Russian steppe, the Iran farming group and the Levant farming group.  We found that the relatively homogeneous population seen across western Eurasia today, including Europe and the Near East, used to be a highly substructured collection of people who were as different from one another as present-day Europeans are from East Asians,  said David Reich, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-senior author of the study.  Near East populations mixed with one another over time and migrated into surrounding regions to mix with the people living there until those initially quite diverse groups became genetically very similar,  added Iosif Lazaridis, HMS research fellow in genetics and first author of the study. Early adopters Even as advances in ancient-DNA technology have made it possible to probe population mixing and large-scale migrations that occurred thousands of years ago, researchers have had trouble studying the genetic history of the Near East because the region s warm climate has degraded much of the DNA in unearthed bones. The team overcame the problem of poor-quality DNA in part by extracting genetic material from ear bones that can yield up to 100 times more DNA than other bones in the body. The team also used a technique called in-solution hybridization to enrich for human DNA and filter out contaminant DNA from microbes. The combined techniques allowed the researchers to gather high quality genomic information from 44 ancient Near Easterners who lived between 14,000 and 3,400 years ago: hunter-gatherers from before the invention of farming, the first farmers themselves and their successors. By comparing the genomes to one another as well as to those of nearly 240 previously studied ancient people from nearby regions and about 2,600 present-day people, the researchers learned that the first farming cultures in the Levant, Iran and Anatolia were all genetically distinct. Farmers in the Levant and Iran were genetically similar, however, to earlier hunter-gatherers who had lived in the same areas.  Maybe one group domesticated goats and another began growing wheat, and the practices were shared in some way,  said Lazaridis.  These different populations all invented or adopted some facets of the farming revolution, and they all flourished.  The findings tell a different story from what researchers believe happened later in Europe, when the first farmers moved in from Anatolia and largely replaced the hunter-gatherer populations who d been living there. Mix and match Over the following 5,000 years, the Near East farming groups mixed with one another and with hunter-gatherers in Europe.  All this extraordinary diversity collapsed,  said Reich.  By the Bronze Age, populations had ancestry from many sources and broadly resembled present-day ones.  The researchers also learned how descendants of each early farming group, even as they began to intermingle, contributed to the genetic ancestry of people in different parts of the world: Farmers related to the Anatolian group spread west into Europe, people related to the Levant group moved south into East Africa, people related to those in Iran or the Caucasus went north into the Russian steppe, and people related to both the farmers in Iran and hunter-gatherers from the steppe spread into South Asia.  The Near East was the missing link to understanding many human migrations,  said Pinhasi. Finally, the study provides a few more clues about a hypothetical, even more ancient, population called the Basal Eurasians, an early diverging branch of the family tree of humans living outside Africa, whose existence Lazaridis has inferred from DNA analyses but whose physical remains have not yet been found.  Every single group from the ancient Near East appears to have Basal Eurasian ancestry up to around fifty percent in the earliest groups,  said Lazaridis. To the researchers  surprise, statistical analyses suggested that the Basal Eurasians may have had no Neanderthal DNA. Other non-African groups have at least 2 percent Neanderthal DNA. The team believes this finding could help explain why West Eurasians have less Neanderthal DNA than East Asians, even though Neanderthals are known to have lived in west Eurasia.  Admixture with Basal Eurasians may have diluted the Neanderthal ancestry in West Eurasians who have ancient Near Eastern farmer ancestry,  said Reich.  Basal Eurasians may have lived in parts of the Near East that did not come into contact with the Neanderthals.  Going forward, said Pinhasi,  We re eager to study remains from the world s first civilizations, who succeeded the samples analyzed in the study. The people everyone reads about in history books are now within the reach of our genetic technology. ","Published: July 28, 2016"

They chose dogs   mammals closer in size and biology to humans   with naturally occurring bone cancers, which also are a lot like human bone tumours. In clinical trials, the dogs tolerated the highest planned doses of cancer-drug-laden nanoparticles with no signs of toxicity. As in mice, the particles homed in on tumour sites, thanks to a coating of the drug pamidronate, which preferentially binds to degraded sites in bone. The nanoparticles also showed anti-cancer activity in mice and dogs. The researchers report their results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These findings are a proof-of-concept that nanoparticles can be used to target bone cancers in large mammals, the researchers said. The approach may one day be used to treat metastatic skeletal cancers, they said. The dogs were companion animals with bone cancer that were submitted for the research trials by their owners, said U. of I. veterinary clinical medicine professor Dr. Timothy Fan, who led the study with materials science and engineering professor Jianjun Cheng. All of the dogs were 40 to 60 kilograms (88 to 132 pounds) in weight, he said.  We wanted to see if we could evaluate these drug-delivery strategies, not only in a mouse model, but also at a scale that would mimic what a person would get,  Fan said.  The amount of nanoparticle that we ended up giving to these dogs was a thousand-fold greater in quantity than what we would typically give a mouse.  Using nanoparticles with payloads of drugs to target specific tissues in the body is nothing new, Cheng said. Countless studies test such approaches in mice, and dozens of  nanopharmaceuticals  are approved for use in humans. But the drug-development pipeline is long, and the leap from mouse models to humans is problematic, he said.  Human bone tumours are much bigger than those of mice,  Cheng said.  Nanoparticles must penetrate more deeply into larger tumours to be effective. That is why we must find animal models that are closer in scale to those of humans.  Mice used in cancer research have other limitations. Researchers usually inject human or other tumour cells into their bodies to mimic human cancers, Fan said. They also are bred to have compromised immune systems, to prevent them from rejecting the tumours.  That is one of the very clear drawbacks of using a mouse model,  Fan said.  it doesn t recapitulate the normal immune system that we deal with every day in the person or in a dog.  There also are limitations to working with dogs, he said. Dogs diagnosed with bone cancer often arrive at the clinic at a very advanced stage of the disease, whereas in humans, bone cancer is usually detected early because people complain about the pain and have it investigated.  On the flip side of that, I would say that if you are able to demonstrate anti-cancer activity in a dog with very advanced disease, then it would be likely that you would have equivalent or better activity in people with a less advanced stage of the disease,  Fan said. Many more years of work remain before this or a similar drug-delivery system can be tested in humans with inoperable bone cancer, the researchers said.","Published: July 28, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibody-drug-shows-promise-in-hiv-treatment-186664,Antibody Drug Shows Promise in HIV Treatment Researchers are a step closer to an alternative HIV treatment that has the potential for lasting effects and less frequent dosing  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Great strides have been made in recent years to develop treatment options for HIV, and the disease can now be controlled with anti-retroviral drugs. But a cure remains elusive and current medications have limitations: they must be taken daily, for life, and can cause long-term complications. Now, Rockefeller scientists report that they are one step closer to an alternative treatment that utilizes antibodies. This therapy has the potential for long-acting effects and would allow for less frequent dosing. Recently published in Nature, the findings suggest that an antibody called 3BNC117 can effectively delay the virus from rebounding in patients who temporarily suspended their anti-retroviral medications, currently the standard treatment for HIV.  These are very positive results,  says Marina Caskey, Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation in the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, headed by Michel Nussenzweig.  This is the longest any antibody has been able to delay virus rebound.  Keeping HIV at bay The 3BNC117 antibody was isolated in the Nussenzweig lab several years ago by Johannes Scheid, co-first author of this most recent publication. It was cloned from cells of an HIV-infected patient whose immune system was able to fight HIV particularly well. The virus primarily infects CD4 T cells, part of the immune system that helps protect the body from infection. 3BNC117 stops multiple strains of HIV from hijacking these cells. Anti-retroviral drugs suppress HIV by preventing its replication, but the virus remains dormant in the body, mostly in reservoirs within CD4 cells. If a patient stops taking anti-retroviral drugs, the virus is released from these reservoirs, and quickly rebounds. This small study, called a Phase IIa clinical trial, builds on a previous study from the Nussenzweig lab, in which HIV-infected patients were given the antibody without receiving other treatment. This time, the researchers tested 13 HIV-infected patients who had been treated successfully with antiviral therapy. The goal of the study was to determine whether the antibody alone would be able to maintain virus suppression in patients that were taken off anti-retroviral drugs. Caskey and colleagues found that the antibody was able to delay when the virus came back to about 10 weeks, compared to about 3 weeks in controls. Virus under pressure One of the many challenges in treating HIV is that the virus quickly mutates. As a result, patients carry many different strains that cannot be eliminated with a single medication, and each person s virus repertoire is different. An advantage of 3BNC117 is that is has the ability to fight a wide range of HIV strains, but not all; some studies suggest it can neutralize about 80 percent of viral isolates taken from patients. In this study, the researchers tried to select participants whose viral strains were likely to be a good target for 3BNC117. However, current testing methods are not very precise in predicting exactly which strains are present, and patients had varied responses.  In one-third of participants, rebound happened very late, when the antibody levels were low,  says co-first author and former graduate student in the Nussenzweig lab, Josh Horwitz.  This means that the antibody was effective at suppressing the viruses that are sensitive to it, but it s also clear that for the remaining patients with different strains of HIV, this antibody is not sufficient.  The researchers also found that the antibody was able to reduce the assortment of viral strains that rebounded, which tends to be very diverse in patients taken off antiretroviral medications.  We were excited to see a significant delay in rebound,  says Scheid,  but the reduced diversity of viruses that we saw is also promising because it will take fewer additional antibodies to target them.  The next step will be to test 3BNC117 in combination with another HIV-specific antibody, such as 10-1074, which targets the virus from a different angle, and has also been shown to decrease virus levels when given to HIV patients not on treatment.  There are a lot of factors at play here, part of which is that we are working with a diverse reservoir of viruses with different sensitivities to different antibodies,  says Caskey.  However, we are hopeful that testing the antibodies in combination will be successful in bringing us closer to better strategies to prevent and treat HIV. ","Published: July 28, 2016"

The addition of Sequenom to the LabCorp family meets our stated financial criteria, and creates a market leader in NIPT, women s health and reproductive genetics, furthering our mission to improve health and improve lives around the globe.   We are extremely excited to join LabCorp in its mission to deliver world-class diagnostic solutions,  said Dirk van den Boom, Ph.D., president and CEO, Sequenom.  Strategically, this transaction makes sense. LabCorp is the world s leading healthcare diagnostics company, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory and end-to-end drug development services. Sequenom is a pioneer in noninvasive prenatal testing for reproductive health. Over the last nine months, Sequenom has vastly enhanced its technology, operations, and business prospects. The opportunities this transaction presents are significant and important both for our reproductive health business as well as our liquid biopsy strategy. Becoming part of LabCorp helps Sequenom reach a much broader market for our innovative testing.  Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, LabCorp has formed an acquisition subsidiary, Savoy Acquisition Corp., that will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Sequenom for $2.40 per share. Following the completion of the tender offer, LabCorp expects to consummate a merger of Savoy Acquisition Corp. and Sequenom in which shares of Sequenom that have not been purchased in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same cash price per share as paid in the tender offer. The tender offer and the merger are subject to customary closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including the acquisition by Savoy Acquisition Corp. of a majority of Sequenom s outstanding shares at the time of the consummation of the tender offer and the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

Their two studies, presented at the Alzheimer s Association s International Conference in Toronto, Canada, suggest that the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) may offer a practical, low-cost alternative to other tests. In one study, researchers administered UPSIT to 397 older adults (average age of 80 years) without dementia from a multiethnic population in northern Manhattan. Each of the participants also had an MRI scan to measure the thickness of the entorhinal cortex the first area of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer s disease. Four years later, 50 participants (12.6 percent) had developed dementia and nearly 20 percent had signs of cognitive decline. The researchers found that low UPSIT scores, but not entorhinal cortical thickness, were significantly associated with dementia and Alzheimer s disease. (Low UPSIT scores indicate decreased ability to correctly identify odours.) Low UPSIT scores, but not entorhinal cortical thickness, also predicted cognitive decline, although entorhinal cortical thickness was significantly associated with UPSIT scores in those who transitioned to dementia.  Our research showed that odour identification impairment and, to a lesser degree, entorhinal cortical thickness were predictors of the transition to dementia,  said Seonjoo Lee, PhD, assistant professor of clinical biostatistics (in psychiatry) at Columbia and presenting author.  These findings support odour identification as an early predictor and suggest that impairment in odour identification may precede thinning in the entorhinal cortex in the early clinical stage of Alzheimer s disease.  In another study, researchers from CUMC evaluated the usefulness of UPSIT and tests that measure the amount of amyloid in the brain (in higher amounts, the protein forms plaques in the brains of those with Alzheimer s disease) in predicting memory decline. The researchers administered UPSIT and performed either beta amyloid PET scanning or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in 84 older adults (median age of 71 years). Of these, 58 participants had mild cognitive impairment. The researchers followed the participants for at least six months. At follow-up, 67 percent of the participants had signs of memory decline. Testing positive for amyloid with either method, but not UPSIT score, predicted cognitive decline. However, participants with a score of less than 35 were more than three times as likely to have memory decline as those with higher UPSIT scores.  Our research suggests that both UPSIT score and amyloid status predict memory decline,  said William Kreisl, MD, the Boris and Rose Katz Assistant Professor of Neurology (in the Taub Institute) and a neurologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia.  Younger age, higher education, and shorter follow-up may explain why UPSIT did not predict decline as strongly in this study as in previous studies. Although more research is needed, odour identification testing, which is much less expensive and easier to administer than PET imaging or lumbar puncture, may prove to be a useful tool in helping physicians counsel patients who are concerned about their risk of memory loss.  Current methods are only capable of clinically detecting Alzheimer s disease in the later stages of its development, when significant brain damage has already occurred. Brain imaging with PET may show the build-up of amyloid plaques in the brain years before symptoms appear, although this method is expensive. Beta amyloid can also be detected in cerebrospinal fluid through a lumbar puncture, and brain PET imaging of abnormal tau protein is rapidly advancing through research.  Our study adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential value of odour identification testing in the detection of early-stage Alzheimer s disease,  said D.P. Devanand, MD, professor of psychiatry (in neurology and in the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center) at CUMC and senior author of both studies.  Using other biomarkers of Alzheimer s disease to detect the disease at an earlier stage, which have the potential to be lower-cost and non-invasive, could lead to dramatic improvements in early detection and management of the disease,  commented Heather Snyder, PhD, director of medical and scientific operations at the Alzheimer s Association, in a statement.","Published: July 28, 2016"

The gene-editing  toolbox  provides a user-friendly solution that scientists can apply to research on cancer and other disciplines, the researchers said.  The study was published on July 26 in Nucleic Acids Research. With modern genetic engineering techniques, such as the recently developed CRISPR technologies, researchers can edit genes in experiments. This rapidly evolving field allows researchers to study important disease-related genes and may ultimately allow them to treat genetic diseases by making edits in specific sites of the human genome. However, progress has been hampered by several challenges, including the editing of unintended sites   referred to as off-target effects. Senior study author Qin Yan and his co-authors at Yale School of Medicine tackled these challenges in multiple ways. In previous systems, the genome-editing machinery was constantly turned on, leading to more off-target effects. To avoid these effects, the team first developed a strategy to make the machinery  inducible    able to be turned on and off. They used a drug to turn the machinery on just long enough to edit the genes. This approach allowed them to activate the machinery as needed and for a limited amount of time, reducing off-target effects, they said. Their gene-editing system also contained a fluorescent marker so the researchers could track whether the editing enzyme was turned on or off in cells, noted Yan, who is an associate professor of pathology and member of Yale Cancer Center. The next step was to make the process of gene editing less complex and time-consuming than previous systems. To target multiple genes simultaneously, the research team developed a simple strategy to put multiple targeting sequences in one step. Each targeting sequence allows the editing machinery to recognize one gene. With the combined gene-editing strategies   the toolbox   the researchers focused on a group of three cancer-related genes. In experiments using both cultured cells and animal models, they simultaneously deleted all three genes.  This toolbox can be used for inducible and multiple-gene targeting,  said Yan.  We streamlined what used to be a very complicated process, making it more efficient and much simpler to edit several genes at once   major advantages that other systems do not have.  The design of the system also allowed the team to conduct their work in a condensed period of time.  This toolbox will shorten our experiments significantly, from a month to a week. It s very efficient,  said Jian Cao, associate research scientist of pathology and first author of the study. In addition to its application as a stand-alone system, the toolbox could be combined with other techniques to improve gene editing in biomedical research and other fields, according to the researchers.  The overall goal is an efficient platform, and to overcome some of the problems current systems have,  said Yan.","Published: July 28, 2016"

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/nih-begins-yellow-fever-vaccine-trial-203333,NIH Begins Yellow Fever Vaccine Trial NIH has initiated an early stage clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against yellow fever  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, has begun an early-stage clinical trial of an investigational vaccine designed to protect against yellow fever virus. The Phase 1 study is evaluating whether an experimental vaccine developed by the Danish biopharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic is safe, tolerable and has the potential to prevent yellow fever virus infection. Yellow fever virus is found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa. It caused an estimated 84,000 to 170,000 severe cases of disease and 29,000 to 60,000 deaths in 2013, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Mild cases of infection can cause fever, back pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and weakness. Most people recover, but approximately 15 percent of those infected develop severe disease manifested as yellow eyes and skin (jaundice), hemorrhage and shock, resulting in potentially fatal kidney, liver or heart conditions.  Yellow fever has recently re-emerged as a major public health threat in parts of Africa. Although a vaccine exists to prevent this serious disease, it is currently in short supply, and it is not recommended for certain populations, such as pregnant women and people older than 60 years,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  We must develop new options for preventing this terrible disease.  As of July 21, 2016, the WHO has reported a total of 3,682 suspected yellow fever cases with 361 deaths in the African country of Angola. Meanwhile, another 1,798 suspected cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC), including 85 deaths. Cases with links to Angola have also been reported in Kenya and China. More than 105 million people in Africa have been vaccinated against yellow fever in mass campaigns since 2006, according to the WHO. Despite this success, vaccine supplies are limited. In addition, in very rare cases, the current yellow fever vaccine can produce severe adverse complications, such as neurologic side effects, multiple organ system dysfunction and death. For this reason, the vaccine should not be given to infants, the elderly, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems. Bavarian Nordic s experimental yellow fever vaccine, dubbed MVA-BN-YF, is based on the company s proprietary MVA-BN platform, which uses an attenuated (weakened) version of the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus as a vaccine vector to carry yellow fever virus genes into the body. According to Bavarian Nordic, more than 7,600 people, including 1,000 individuals who are immunocompromised, have been safely vaccinated with MVA-BN-based vaccines. The placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial will enroll 90 healthy men and women ages 18 to 45 who have never been infected with a flavivirus, the family of viruses that includes yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue and Zika virus, among others. Participants will be divided into six groups: One will receive the currently licensed yellow fever vaccine (15 participants) and five groups (15 participants each) will receive the investigational Bavarian Nordic vaccine, either with or without an adjuvant, a substance that is added to a vaccine to increase the body's immune response to the vaccine. The investigational vaccine will be administered intramuscularly while the licensed yellow fever vaccine will be administered subcutaneously. Trial participants will receive one or two doses of vaccine or placebo, separated by a month. Previous laboratory and animal studies have suggested that combining MVA-BN with ISA 720, an experimental immune-boosting adjuvant that has been used in prior clinical trials, induces a strong immune response after a single dose of vaccine. One goal of the study will be to assess whether two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine or a single dose of ISA 720 adjuvanted vaccine could provide protection against yellow fever.","Published: July 28, 2016"

The result of the team s four-year project is a novel gene therapeutic approach. The work was published July 20 in Science Translational Medicine, a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Chronic disease affects more than half of the world s population,  said Rodgers, professor of animal sciences and director of the Washington Center for Muscle Biology.  Most of those diseases are accompanied by muscle wasting.  It occurs with chronic infection, muscular dystrophy, malnutrition and old age,  he said.  About half the people who die from cancer are actually dying from muscle wasting and there s not one single therapy out there that addresses it. Family history inspires search for treatment  I have a strong motivation to do something about this, to do more than simply publish results,  said Rodgers, who teamed with Gregorevic of Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Australia.  My father died from cachexia,  the wasting disease caused by cancer,  and my nephew has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an incurable, fatal disease that could claim his life in his teens.  Others have tried and failed to develop treatments for muscle wasting,  Rodgers said,  and some drugs have even caused serious safety problems. Our targeted approach only affects muscle and completely avoids these problems, which is why we think we have a solution.  In the paper, lead author Catherine Winbanks, a postdoctoral fellow of Gregorevic, details how researchers built muscle in healthy mice and prevented the loss of skeletal and heart muscle in mice with tumours. Hormone s muscle-wasting effect blocked In cachexia, tumours secrete hormones that cause muscle deterioration; in effect, the body eats its own muscles, causing weakness, frailty and fatigue.  What kills a lot of people isn t the loss of skeletal muscle but heart muscle,  said Rodgers.  The heart literally shrinks, causing heart failure.  Researchers have long sought to stop this process, but failed to find a safe way. That s because the hormones that cause wasting   in particular, a naturally occurring hormone called myostatin   play important roles elsewhere in the body. Rodgers and Gregorevic needed a way to stop myostatin, but only in muscles. Their solution: an adeno-associated virus   a benign virus that specifically targets heart and skeletal muscle. The virus delivers a small piece of DNA   a signalling protein called Smad7   into muscle cells. Smad7 then blocks two signalling proteins called Smad2 and Smad3, which are activated by myostatin and other muscle-wasting hormones. By blocking those signals, Smad7 stops the breakdown of muscles.  Smad7 is the body s natural break and, by inhibiting the inhibitor, you build muscle,  Rodgers said. For cachexia patients, such a therapy could massively increase their chances of survival.  Instead of having one year to fight cancer, you d have 10 or 15,  Rodgers said. Startup works to develop commercial drug In 2015, Rodgers launched AAVogen, a company that will develop this discovery into a commercial drug, AVGN7. He has been working with Norman Ong, a technology licensing associate at WSU s Office of Commercialization, on patents, startup funding and recruitment for AAVogen. Using the funds from WSU s commercial gap fund award, Rodgers  lab will determine the minimum effective dose for AVGN7.  We want to turn WSU discoveries into real-world uses that benefit the public,  said Ong.  Dan is a very busy scientist, so we re proud to help him and AAVogen connect with the right people.   I formed this company for one purpose: to move the science into society, to see it applied,  Rodgers said.  WSU s Office of Commercialization has been instrumental and invaluable to this endeavour.  Now we have a company with the potential to save a lot of lives,  he said.","Published: July 28, 2016"

The most advanced of these vaccines is for the prevention of plague and the new funding will enable the Company to carry out a phase I clinical study starting in 2017. Although it is now a rare disease, plague bacteria are easily cultured and could be made into an aerosol for bio-terrorism with less difficulty than for other disease-causing organisms. The challenge for governments is to have access to a ready stockpile of vaccines at short notice. As Prokarium s new vaccine is stable at 4 C for over 3 years and will be delivered orally, it is ideal as a reserve and for urgent distribution to the general population. Following a successful pre-clinical programme, Prokarium, with contractors DSTL and Biokinetic Europe, will start a very rapid bench-to-clinical study to demonstrate the safety and immune response of the vaccine in humans. The goal is to produce an oral vaccine that is easy to administer, highly effective and stable for long periods in storage. The project will also serve as a clinical proof-of-concept for Prokarium s Vaxonella  platform, which promises to speed up the development of oral, thermostable vaccines in general. Prokarium s CEO Ted Fj llman commented:  We re delighted to be recognised by some of the brightest minds in vaccine research and to receive contracts from both the UK & Mexican Governments. It gives us another chance to demonstrate the wide applicability of our Vaxonella  platform, which is a strong stimulator of all arms of immunity and reduces the cost and time of vaccine R&D and manufacture.  Steve Chatfield, Chairman of Prokarium, added,  Our technology provides the means to rapidly develop and manufacture oral vaccines for emerging diseases and potential bioterrorist threats. All of our operations are based in the UK, enabling us to play our part in fulfilling the Government s aim of strengthening the UK s vaccine manufacturing capability so that it can be deployed rapidly in the face of emerging disease threats. We re well placed to take advantage of any further funding opportunities and to work with other governments and international organisations.  The new government contracts will last up to 2 years and will also enable further development of Prokarium s vaccines for the Zika virus as well as bacterial diarrhoea and enteric fever. The  1M in funding for the plague vaccine comes from an initial SBRI programme, run by Innovate UK, tapping into the pledge of  120M to the UK Vaccine Network by the UK Government, aiming to increase national resilience to new and emerging global health threats.","Published: July 28, 2016"

Other tested shellfish samples taken from shellfish production areas such as the Wadden Sea and other parts of the Oosterschelde are free of toxins, making them safe for consumption. What is TTX? Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxin that occurs naturally in (sub) tropical seas. It is highly likely to be produced by a bacterium, and can end up (directly or indirectly) via soil, water or algae in shellfish. Even in very small quantities TTX can all affect the human nervous system, therefore it is regulated by the government. TTX is best known because it can be in pufferfish. In Japan, where they like to eat these fish are annually dozens of people sick after eating puffer fish. TTX Origin Unclear It is still unclear how TTX ended up in the Oosterschelde or how it originated. The cause could be in bacteria commonly found in the marine environment and therefore also in the Oosterschelde. However, it is a complex system, wherein the interaction between water, algae, sediment organisms and plays an important role. At this time, it is not yet clear whether TTX also occurs in other organisms. RIKILT Currently Testing Daily Mussels and Oysters The Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA) and the shellfish industry let the mussels and oysters currently on daily basis test by RIKILT. Within a day it is known whether the shellfish are infected with TTX. If that is the case, they can not be harvested and sold. Analyses are performed with sophisticated chemical detection methods. Furthermore RIKILT involved as National Reference Laboratory for marine biotoxins as an expert to the government. IMARES and RIKILT Investigate the Source of TTX The shellfish sector has IMARES and RIKILT commissioned to investigate the source of TTX in the Oosterschelde. Then there any measures can be taken by the shellfish industry. The researchers hope to find out within two months, which is the source of the infection or at least to obtain good indications.   IMARES Investigates Purification Mussels and Oysters The toxin comes from the natural functioning of the ecosystem in the shellfish. Once the source is no longer available, the toxin will also through the natural system disappear from the seafood again. It is commissioned by the shellfish industry is currently investigating detoxification of shellfish. For this purpose, purification methods that are also used may be used by the mussel sector in practice. This can be possibly used the natural cleansing power of mussels.

The FSA sought the advice of the ACMSF as to whether the risk to consumers, including vulnerable groups such as, pregnant women, the young, and the elderly, from eating lightly cooked or raw shell eggs has changed since 2001, when the Committee last reviewed the subject of salmonella in eggs. Professor John Coia, Chair of the ACMSF Expert Ad Hoc group on eggs said, 'The committee has found that there has been a major reduction in the risk from Salmonella in UK hens  eggs since 2001. This is especially the case for eggs produced under the Lion Code, or equivalent schemes.

Following Committee approval and a UK wide consultation of the report, the FSA has agreed to examine its advice taking into account the Committee s conclusions and recommendations. At present, the FSA s advice to consumers is that eating raw eggs, eggs with runny yolks or any food that is uncooked or only lightly cooked and contains raw eggs, may cause food poisoning and warns vulnerable groups against eating them.  The consultation is inviting views on the recommended changes to the FSA s advice from a range of stakeholders, including food and hospitality industries, consumer and enforcement bodies, and health care practitioners.

This study represents an important step towards an effective treatment for liver fibrosis,  said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of NIH. A report of the study, led by NIAAA scientists, is now online in JCI Insight. Liver fibrosis is a gradual scarring of the liver that puts people at risk for progressive liver disease and liver failure. It may develop as a late consequence of chronic alcoholism, viral hepatitis, obesity or diabetes and can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer, yet currently there is no therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The new compound is a chemically modified version of ibipinapant, a brain-penetrating cannabinoid type 1 (CB-1) receptor antagonist used in scientific research. Senior author and NIAAA Scientific Director, Dr. George Kunos  team modified its structure to reduce its ability to penetrate the brain, and to include a molecular group that directly inhibits iNOS, the enzyme responsible for generating nitrogen compounds that promote inflammation.  Fibrosis is a multifactorial, complex disorder that can benefit from simultaneous targeting of more than one cellular process,  explained Dr. Kunos. Dr. Kunos and his NIAAA team developed a new medication that concurrently inhibits both CB-1 receptors and iNOS. The new compound was designed to have only very limited ability to enter the brain in order to avoid the psychiatric side effects that limit the usefulness of currently available, brain-penetrant CB-1 receptor-blocking compounds.  Inducible nitric oxide synthase, or iNOS, is an enzyme that has been shown to play a fundamental role in liver fibrosis pathology and is a potential target for fibrosis therapy,  said Dr. Kunos.  It is also an important factor in alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and other pathologies that promote liver fibrosis.  Previous studies have also shown that endocannabinoids, natural messengers in the body that help regulate many biological functions, play a role in liver fibrosis and, current compounds that block CB-1 receptors in the liver are moderately effective against liver fibrosis in animal models of the disease. However, because such compounds penetrate the brain and also block CB-1 receptors in the brain, they have undesirable psychiatric effects. In the current study, Dr. Kunos and his colleagues tested the compounds in two widely used mouse models of liver fibrosis unrelated to obesity. They found that the new compound was more effective in limiting fibrosis than compounds targeting either CB-1 receptors or iNOS alone. Dr. Kunos notes that, in addition to the new compound s decreased ability to cause psychiatric side effects, it has also passed preliminary screening tests for other possible side effects such as genotoxicity or interactions with other receptors or ion channels that could generate  off-target  effects. He adds, however, that the compound will require more extensive safety screening in animals before seeking FDA approval for studies of its therapeutic potential in humans. Dr. Kunos and his colleagues will collaborate with other researchers on such studies in the coming months. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the primary U.S. agency for conducting and supporting research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and alcohol problems.","Published: July 28, 2016"

The technology is based on research led by Gay M. Crooks, M.D., who has developed and refined an artificial thymic organoid (ATO) cell culture system that replicates the human thymic environment to support efficient ex vivo differentiation of T-cells from primary and reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells. Dr. Crooks is the Rebecca Smith Professor in the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. She is also a Co-director of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center and Director of the Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. Pluripotent stem cells have the potential to develop into many different cell types, including T-cells. T-cell development is complex, and attempts to generate T-cells with in vitro cell culture systems have been limited by low output of T-cells and donor-to-donor variability that cannot support further engineering or commercial-scale manufacturing. In contrast, the ATO system potentially supports efficient and scalable production of T-cells using pluripotent stem cell lines capable of indefinite self-renewal. With reproducible and consistent production of T-cells, the ATO system presents an attractive platform to facilitate additional gene-engineering steps to develop off-the-shelf allogeneic T-cell therapies. ""This ATO system represents a significant breakthrough in stem cell biology that will drive our long-term strategy to develop best-in-class allogeneic T-cell therapies,"" said David Chang, M.D., Ph.D., Kite's Executive Vice President, Research and Development, and Chief Medical Officer. ""This platform provides a renewable source of T-cells and can be further exploited with gene engineering, including chimeric antigen receptors, T-cell receptors and other gene modifications of interest, to generate potent T-cell products that have the potential to be resistant to rejection and to bear no risk of graft-versus-host disease."" Under the terms of this agreement, Kite will receive exclusive rights to use the licensed technology to develop and commercialize T-cell products in oncology. In connection with the license agreement, Kite has entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with UCLA to support ongoing preclinical research in Dr. Crooks' laboratory to optimize the ATO platform.","Published: July 28, 2016"

The neurotransmitters then activate receptors on the receiving neuron to convey excitatory or inhibitory messages. See Also: Synapses always on the starting blocks But beyond this basic outline, the details of how this crucial aspect of brain function occurs have remained elusive. Now, new research by scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM) has for the first time elucidated details about the architecture of this process. The paper is published in the journal Nature To visualize features on the sub-microscopic scale of synapses (a few millionths of an inch across), the researchers turned to an innovative technology known as single-molecule imaging, which can locate and track the movement of individual protein molecules within the confines of a single synapse, even in living cells. Using this approach, the scientists identified an unexpected and precise pattern in the process of neurotransmission. The researchers looked at cultured rat synapses, which in terms of overall structure are very similar to human synapses. ""We are seeing things that have never been seen before. This is a totally new area of investigation,"" said Thomas Blanpied, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of Physiology, and leader of the group that performed the work. ""For many years, we've had a list of the many types of molecules that are found at synapses, but that didn t get us very far in understanding how these molecules fit together, or how the process really works structurally. Now by using single-molecule imaging to map where many of the key proteins are, we have finally been able to reveal the core architectural structure of the synapse."" Learn More: Only a small portion of synapses may be active during neurotransmission In the paper, Blanpied describes an unexpected aspect to this architecture that may explain why synapses are so efficient, but also susceptible to disruption during disease: at each synapse, key proteins are organized very precisely across the gap between cells. ""The neurons do a better job than we ever imagined of positioning the release of neurotransmitter molecules near their receptors,"" Blanpied says. ""The proteins in the two different neurons are aligned with incredible precision, almost forming a column stretching between the two cells."" This proximity optimizes the power of the transmission, and also suggests new ways that this transmission can be modified. Understanding this architecture will help clarify how communication within the brain works, or, in the case of psychiatric or neurological disease, how it fails to work. Blanpied is also focusing on the activity of  adhesion molecules,  which stretch from one cell to the other and may be important pieces of the  nano-column.  He suspects that if adhesion molecules are not placed correctly at the synapse, synapse architecture will be disrupted, and neurotransmitters won t be able to do their jobs. Blanpied hypothesizes that in at least some disorders, the issue may be that even though the brain has the right amount of neurotransmitter, the synapses don t transmit these molecules efficiently. Don't Miss: Abnormalities in circadian rhythms linked to neurochemical changes in specific neurotransmitters Blanpied says that this improved comprehension of synaptic architecture could lead to a better understanding of brain diseases such as depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer s disease, and perhaps suggest new ideas for treatments. Blanpied and his colleagues will next explore whether the synaptic architecture changes in certain disorders: they will begin by looking at a synapses in a mouse model of the pathology in schizophrenia. ""The complexity of the human brain seems overwhelming. But Dr. Blanpied and his colleagues have taken an important step in helping us understand this system,  said UMSOM Dean E.

Based on an analysis of Medicaid (U.S. government health care program) claims for nearly 150,000 children diagnosed with ADHD in South Carolina between 2003 and 2013, researchers found treatment with ADHD medication made children less likely to suffer consequences of risky behaviors such as sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse during their teen years and injuries. See Also: Inside the adult ADHD brainEleven percent of children in the United States ages 4-17 have been diagnosed with ADHD and almost 70 percent of them are treated with medications. Children who are diagnosed with ADHD the chronic condition characterized by attention difficulty and/or hyperactivity and impulsiveness are known to be at higher risk for risky behaviors such as dangerous driving, drug use and risky sexual behavior. ""ADHD is such a major issue, but no one seemed to be able to give a very definite answer to the long-term effect of the medication,"" said Anna Chorniy, a Princeton University postdoctoral associate who conducted the research with Leah Kitashima, a PhD candidate at Clemson University. ""For our sample population, we were able to see everyone who had an ADHD diagnosis and track their health over time to identify any potential benefits of the medication or the lack of thereof."" Compared with children who were diagnosed with ADHD but did not receive medication, those who took medication were 3.6 percentage points less likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease, 7.3 percentage points less likely to have a substance-abuse disorder and 2.3 percentage points less likely to be injured. In absolute numbers in a sample of about 14,000 teens diagnosed with ADHD, it translates into 512 fewer teens contracting an STD and 998 fewer having a substance abuse disorder. There also would be 6,122 fewer yearly injury cases for children and teens under 19 years old. Don't Miss: The higher the elevation, the lower the rate of ADHD:Study links rates of ADHD to altitude The research is described in an article by Chorniy and Kitashima published by the journal Labour Economics. The work was supported by a grant from the Social Security Administration to the National Bureau of Economic Research. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of medications in treating the core symptoms of ADHD, little has been known about the effects of treatment on health, behavioral and educational outcomes in the long run. Evidence so far points to positive effects on some outcomes but not others. A 2014 paper by Princeton economist Janet Currie and other researchers found such treatment was actually associated with a decrease in academic performance, a deterioration in relationship with parents and an increased likelihood of depression. Other work has shown some reduction in hospital visits and police interactions. ""Many professionals and parents still doubt the existence of beneficial long-term effects of ADHD medication,"" said Helena Skyt Nielsen, a professor in the Department of Economics and Business at Aarhus University in Denmark who has studied ADHD treatment in children but wasn't involved in this research. ""Therefore, it is extremely important to collect more hard evidence on the impact of ADHD medication. Chorniy's paper is a great example that non-experimental impact assessments are very informative about the consequences of ADHD medication."" Learn More: Study highlights multiple factors of ADHD medication useThe current paper is the first of several research projects in which Chorniy paints a clearer picture of how ADHD is diagnosed and treated, as well as the associated short- and long-term effects of medication. One paper in the works with Currie combines South Carolina Medicaid claims, Vital Statistics records, Department of Education, and Department of Juvenile Justice data to provide an explanation for the rise in ADHD diagnoses and treatment, and look at the effects of recently approved medications for ADHD. ""I think all these papers together will give us a clearer picture of the reasons behind ADHD's explosion and the effects of ADHD medication,"" Chorniy said. ""Given that disadvantaged children and teens enrolled in Medicaid, a public insurance program, are disproportionately diagnosed with ADHD, these are important policy questions to address: why are there more children taking ADHD drugs today than a decade ago, what benefits do they deliver and at what cost.""

Activity in the visual processing areas of the subjects brains increased as the size of the boundaries increased. When the subjects saw the curb, however, even though it was only an inch or two tall, the brain reacted almost as vigorously as when the subjects saw a full wall. ""The curb is so important and the brain is so sensitive to it, brain activity jumps significantly when someone sees one,"" Park said.

The findings, described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide a mechanism through which oxidative stress specifically damages nerve cells in the inherited and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. See Also: Test to measure effectiveness of treatments for Huntington s disease Because cysteine deficiency and oxidative stress have been linked to other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, AIDS and cancer, the investigators say these findings may facilitate therapeutic strategies for many serious conditions. Researchers Juan Sbodio, Solomon Snyder, and Bindu Paul, all of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine's Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience, say that while there are many ways human cells regulate oxidative stress, those involving cysteine play a central role. ""If you deplete cysteine, you will affect a majority of these antioxidant defenses,"" says Paul. The researchers' past experiments in mice, published in the May 2014 issue of Nature, showed that the protein responsible for making cysteine, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), is depleted in HD. When amino acids levels are low, normal cells will activate CSE using a protein called activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4 recognizes the DNA sequences that code for proteins involved in amino acid synthesis, including CSE, and tell the cell to start up the cysteine production line for protein synthesis and generation of other protective molecules derived from cysteine. While cells deficient in cysteine can use alternate pathways for a short time, such cells are eventually overwhelmed by oxidation and die. In this study, researchers discovered that ATF4 is disrupted in cells with Huntington's disease, affecting cysteine production. Learn More: Scientists adopt new strategy to find Huntington s disease therapies To characterize this pathway, researchers grew both healthy control brain cells and brain cells derived from mice with Huntington's disease under low cysteine conditions. They found that while the healthy cells increased the activity of ATF4 under low cysteine conditions, they could not detect ATF4 in the cells from mice with Huntington's disease. This effect was unique to cysteine: When the researchers grew cells in conditions depleted of other amino acids, ATF4 levels were normal in both control and Huntington's cells. ""That intrigued us, and we wondered if elevated oxidative stress would affect the response of ATF4 because of cysteine's role in cellular defense,"" Paul says. To test this, the researchers induced oxidative stress in healthy cells by exposing them to hydrogen peroxide, a strong oxidizing agent, and then cutting off their cysteine supply. Under these conditions, the cells' expression of ATF4 was greatly reduced. Conversely, when Huntington's cells were grown in cysteine-depleted conditions but given an antioxidant, vitamin C, the cells regained their ability to create ATF4 and make their own cysteine. ""These findings implicate a vicious cycle where low levels of cysteine cause oxidative stress, which leads to decreased cysteine levels, therefore creating more oxidative stress, further slowing cysteine production,"" says Sbodio. The researchers' previous studies showed that supplementing cysteine in the diets of mice exhibiting Huntington's disease delays the progression of the disease's symptoms. The present study reveals the mechanisms through which cysteine is regulated and how oxidative stress affects this system. Don't Miss: Healthy tissue grafted to the brains of Huntington s patients also develops signs of the disease Paul and her colleagues note that antioxidants have long been noted as beneficial for promoting health, but they caution that while antioxidants can mitigate disease symptoms in the lab, much more information on cysteine's role in the body is needed before researchers can confirm its therapeutic value. In fact, the researchers pointed out that supplementing with too much cysteine could be harmful. Paul says that for some conditions, there may be benefits, but people should ""always consult their doctor before beginning any supplement. We don't want patients to self-medicate.""

These viruses can also cause severe respiratory infections in infants and young children, and cause serious illness for those with asthma and other chronic respiratory conditions. Scientists have tried unsuccessfully for years to develop treatments for rhinoviruses. Viruses work by binding to and infecting cells and then using the host cell s machinery to make more viruses (replicate) and become infectious. Thus it s important to identify the receptors on human cells that these viruses bind. A team led by Dr. Ann Palmenberg at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Dr. Michael Rossmann at Purdue University has been working to understand the structure of rhinovirus C, which is a type of enterovirus. Such studies have been hampered by the difficulty of growing the viruses in the laboratory. The researchers previously found that rhinovirus C infects cells via a specific surface receptor called cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3). In order to grow enough virus for structural analysis, the group engineered cells to have CDHR3. They then infected the cells with a type of rhinovirus C that was adapted for tissue culture. The research was supported by NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Results appeared online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on July 13, 2016. Using the imaging technique of cryo-electron microscopy, the team examined the structure of the viral particles and observed 2 forms. Full particles contained key proteins and were infectious. Empty particles (about 30% of all particles) didn t contain genetic material and weren t able to infect cells.  The empty particles may simply be byproducts of how the virus is assembled. Alternatively, the researchers suggest, the empty particles could be immune decoys.  No other rhinoviruses seem to do this naturally,  Palmenberg says. The group created 3-D structures of the full and empty particles at resolutions of 2.8   and 3.2  , respectively. They found that the outer surface of the full viral particle has 60 spike-like protrusions, or  fingers.  Other enteroviruses have smoother, spherical surfaces. These fingers might play a role in triggering immune responses. Empty particles contain fingers as well. Next to each finger is a depression, which may be where the virus surface binds with the host cell. These findings offer insights for the development of vaccines or drugs to prevent or treat infections. The scientists also found that rhinovirus C has pocket-like structures that, unlike other enteroviruses, are collapsed and partially filled. This may explain why rhinovirus C is resistant to anti-viral drugs designed to fit in the pocket.  Rhinovirus C has been the  missing link  in explaining illness caused by the common cold,  Rossmann says.  This is sure to spark major new efforts toward the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, particularly for the prevention of asthma. ","Published: July 27, 2016"

Over time, harmful amounts of this substance can accumulate in various cells and tissues in the body. This can damage a person s bones, liver, and spleen. Children with type 2 Gaucher disease can also have extensive damage to the brain, whereas those with type 1 do not. Gaucher disease occurs when a person inherits 2 defective copies of the GBA gene, which codes for glucocerebrosidase. People with even one mutation in GBA also have a higher risk of developing Parkinson s disease a disorder characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slowed movements. People with Parkinson s disease lose the cells involved in movement (dopamine neurons) and accumulate a protein called alpha-synuclein in their brains. To better understand the dysfunctional enzyme s role in Parkinson s disease, a team led by Dr. Ellen Sidransky at NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) compared cells from patients who have Gaucher disease, with and without Parkinson s disease, and healthy adults. The researchers converted skin cells into dopamine neurons. They then evaluated the enzyme s activity and the levels of the fatty material and alpha-synuclein. Results were published on July 13, 2016, in the Journal of Neuroscience. Neurons from patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who also have Parkinson s disease and those with type 2 Gaucher disease showed reduced enzyme activity and increased levels of alpha-synuclein and the fatty material compared with healthy adult cells. Neurons from patients with type 1 Gaucher disease without Parkinson s disease showed similar results, but lacked alpha-synuclein accumulation. The team next tested a small  chaperone  molecule called NCGC607 on the neurons. The molecule, which they had identified in previous work, improves the activity of glucocerebrosidase. The chaperone restored the enzyme s ability to gain entry into lysosomes the cell compartment where fatty materials are broken down and increased enzyme activity. After treatment, dopamine neurons from patients with type 2 and type 1 Gaucher disease with Parkinson s disease also showed less buildup of the fatty material and alpha-synuclein. These findings suggest that using a molecular chaperone to aid the dysfunctional enzyme may be a useful strategy for treating both diseases.  This research demonstrates how insights from a rare disorder such as Gaucher disease can have direct relevance to the treatment of common disorders like Parkinson s disease,  says NHGRI scientific director Dr. Daniel Kastner. More research is needed to determine whether using such a small molecule could be useful for treating either disease.","Published: July 27, 2016"

B cells, for example, produce specialized molecules called antibodies that attack harmful microbes. Autoimmune diseases arise when this complex system mistakenly attacks the body s own tissues. In people with pemphigus, the cells in the top layer of the skin and the mucous membranes come under immune attack. The immune system mistakenly produces antibodies against proteins known as desmogleins. These proteins help keep skin cells attached and the skin and mucous membranes intact. When desmogleins are attacked, the cells separate from each other and fluid collects in the spaces, forming blisters. The most common type of pemphigus in the United States is pemphigus vulgaris. It arises when B cells make antibodies to desmoglein-3 (Dsg3, also known as keratinocyte adhesion protein). Pemphigus can be treated with drugs that suppress the immune system or that specifically deplete B cells. However, these approaches can leave the body vulnerable to deadly infections. A team of researchers led by Drs. Aimee S. Payne, Michael C. Milone, and Christoph T. Ellebrecht at the University of Pennsylvania aimed to develop a more selective technique by adapting an emerging approach used to fight cancer. In that approach, immune system T cells are collected from patients and genetically engineered to produce special receptors on their surfaces that recognize a specific protein on tumor cells and attack the cancer. In pemphigus vulgaris, B cells make specialized receptors that recognize and target the Dsg3 protein. The researchers reasoned they could genetically engineer T cells to express portions of Dsg3, and thus specifically destroy the miscreant B cells without affecting the rest of the immune system. Their work was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). Results were published in Science on July 8, 2016. The team showed in laboratory experiments that human T cells engineered to express portions of Dsg3 killed anti-Dsg3 B cells derived from people with pemphigus vulgaris. The team tested the engineered T cells in a mouse model of pemphigus vulgaris. The engineered cells eliminated anti-Dsg3 B cells from the animals and prevented blisters from forming without any detectable side effects. With further development, this approach could potentially be used for any autoimmune disease caused by misdirected antibodies.  Our study effectively opens up the application of this anti-cancer technology to the treatment of a much wider range of diseases, including autoimmunity and transplant rejection,  Milone says. The team is now planning to test the approach in dogs, which can also develop pemphigus vulgaris.  If we can use this technology to cure [pemphigus vulgaris] safely in dogs, it would be a breakthrough for veterinary medicine, and would hopefully pave the way for trials of this therapy in human pemphigus patients,  Payne says.","Published: July 27, 2016"

Nitrogen, a key nutrient for plants, can cause problems when it leaches into water supplies. University of Illinois engineers developed a model to calculate the age of nitrogen in corn and soybean fields, which could lead to improved fertilizer application techniques to promote crop growth while reducing leaching. Civil and environmental engineering professor Praveen Kumar and graduate student Dong Kook Woo published their work in the journal Water Resources Research.  By understanding how long nitrogen stays in the soil and the factors that drive that, we can improve the precision at which we apply nitrogen for agriculture productivity,  said Kumar, also a professor of atmospheric sciences.  We may be able to apply fertilizer specifically in areas that are deficient in nitrogen, in precisely the amount that the plants need to uptake, rather than just applying it uniformly. Potentially, we could see a significant reduction in fertilizer amounts.  Plants take up nitrogen from the soil through their roots as a nutrient. Nitrogen is added to the soil through fertilizer application or by microbes in the soil breaking down organic compounds. However, when there is more nitrogen in the soil than the plants need, it leaches out into the water and can accumulate in lakes, rivers and oceans.  Nitrogen, usually in the form of nitrate fertilizer, is needed for healthy crop production, but too much is not a good thing since the excess can contaminate water supplies,  said Richard Yuretich, program director in the National Science Foundation s Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research.  Knowing how long nitrate resides in the soil will lead to more efficient agriculture that maximizes plant health without overdosing the environment.  Kumar and Woo developed a numerical model to calculate how long inorganic nitrogen has been in the soil, using a corn-corn-soybean rotation common in the Midwest. Fresh fertilizer application or microbial production of nitrates and ammonium are considered  birth,  or age zero. The researchers then computed age by the chemical reactions or transformations nitrogen goes through in the soil, mediated by moisture, temperature and microbes. The model revealed two surprising findings when comparing the average age of nitrogen in the topsoil with that in deeper layers, and in comparing corn fields with soybean fields.  The biggest surprise to me was that we found a lower average age of nitrogen in soybean fields,  Woo said.  We use fertilizer on corn, not soybeans. Yet even though we count that fresh fertilizer as age zero, we found a lower average age of nitrogen in soybean fields. We found that is mainly because soybeans uptake the old nitrogen, so the average age is reduced.  When looking at the layers of soil, the researchers initially expected that nitrogen would follow a similar age path to water: newer on top, and growing older as it migrates down through the soil. However, they found that the nitrogen topsoil had a relatively high average age when compared with the water. Looking closer, they realized that one of the forms of nitrogen, ammonium, accumulated in the topsoil.  Ammonium has a positive charge, which adheres to the soil particles and prevents it from leaching to the deeper layers,  Woo said.  Because of that, we observe relatively higher nitrogen age in the upper layers, compared with the age of the nitrate that dissolves in water, which doesn t have that barrier and can migrate down through the soil.  The researchers have established a field site to validate their model by analyzing the isotopic composition of nitrogen, oxygen and water in the runoff. They hope that their work can help farmers more efficiently use resources while also reducing contamination of water sources and marine habitats.  The idea of using age for chemical analysis is not new, but no one has studied nitrogen age in the context of an agricultural setting,  Kumar said.  By doing that, we are able to reveal patterns of stagnation in the soil, which is different than just using the concentration of nitrogen. The main idea is that there is a better way to apply fertilizer over a landscape than we do presently. We should be looking into more precise approaches. ","Published: July 27, 2016"

The most widely used first line of treatment is surgery, but this can result in incomplete removal of the tumor. Cancer cells can be left behind, potentially leading to recurrence and increased risk of metastasis. Indeed, while many patients remain cancer-free for months or even years after surgery, tumors are known to recur in up to 50 percent of cases. Conventional therapies used to prevent tumors recurring after surgery do not sufficiently differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells, leading to serious side effects. In a paper published today in the journal Nature Materials, researchers at MIT describe an adhesive patch that can stick to the tumor site, either before or after surgery, to deliver a triple-combination of drug, gene, and photo (light-based) therapy. Releasing this triple combination therapy locally, at the tumor site, may increase the efficacy of the treatment, according to Natalie Artzi, a principal research scientist at MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women s Hospital, who led the research. The general approach to cancer treatment today is the use of systemic, or whole-body, therapies such as chemotherapy drugs. But the lack of specificity of anticancer drugs means they produce undesired side effects when systemically administered. What s more, only a small portion of the drug reaches the tumor site itself, meaning the primary tumor is not treated as effectively as it should be. Indeed, recent research in mice has found that only 0.7 percent of nanoparticles administered systemically actually found their way to the target tumor.  This means that we are treating both the source of the cancer   the tumor   and the metastases resulting from that source, in a suboptimal manner,  Artzi says.  That is what prompted us to think a little bit differently, to look at how we can leverage advancements in materials science, and in particular nanotechnology, to treat the primary tumor in a local and sustained manner.  The researchers have developed a triple-therapy hydrogel patch, which can be used to treat tumors locally. This is particularly effective as it can treat not only the tumor itself but any cells left at the site after surgery, preventing the cancer from recurring or metastasizing in the future. Firstly, the patch contains gold nanorods, which heat up when near-infrared radiation is applied to the local area. This is used to thermally ablate, or destroy, the tumor. These nanorods are also equipped with a chemotherapy drug, which is released when they are heated, to target the tumor and its surrounding cells. Finally, gold nanospheres that do not heat up in response to the near-infrared radiation are used to deliver RNA, or gene therapy to the site, in order to silence an important oncogene in colorectal cancer. Oncogenes are genes that can cause healthy cells to transform into tumor cells. The researchers envision that a clinician could remove the tumor, and then apply the patch to the inner surface of the colon, to ensure that no cells that are likely to cause cancer recurrence remain at the site. As the patch degrades, it will gradually release the various therapies. The patch can also serve as a neoadjuvant, a therapy designed to shrink tumors prior to their resection, Artzi says. When the researchers tested the treatment in mice, they found that in 40 percent of cases where the patch was not applied after tumor removal, the cancer returned. But when the patch was applied after surgery, the treatment resulted in complete remission. Indeed, even when the tumor was not removed, the triple-combination therapy alone was enough to destroy it. The technology is an extraordinary and unprecedented synergy of three concurrent modalities of treatment, according to Mauro Ferrari, president and CEO of the Houston Methodist Research Institute, who was not involved in the research.  What is particularly intriguing is that by delivering the treatment locally, multimodal therapy may be better than systemic therapy, at least in certain clinical situations,  Ferrari says. Unlike existing colorectal cancer surgery, this treatment can also be applied in a minimally invasive manner. In the next phase of their work, the researchers hope to move to experiments in larger models, in order to use colonoscopy equipment not only for cancer diagnosis but also to inject the patch to the site of a tumor, when detected.  This administration modality would enable, at least in early-stage cancer patients, the avoidance of open field surgery and colon resection,  Artzi says.  Local application of the triple therapy could thus improve patients  quality of life and therapeutic outcome.  http://news.mit.edu/2016/patch-delivers-drug-gene-light-based-therapy-tumor-0725","Published: July 27, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-variability-in-cell-bank-lots-195844,Genetic Variability in Cell Bank Lots Researchers working with cancer cells from the same cell bank acquired at the same time  found that the cells were genetically different  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a surprise finding, researchers working with breast cancer cells purchased at the same time from the same cell bank discovered that the cells responded differently to chemicals, even though the researchers had not detected any difference when they tested them for authenticity at the time of purchase. Had the cells been the same, the exposure to chemicals would have produced similar results in the cells. Instead, identical experiments in two different laboratories   one at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and another at Brown University   produced very different results, even when the researchers swapped out the cells and replicated their experiment to rule out issues at the respective laboratories. Upon further testing, however, the researchers discovered that the cells had been genetically different from the time they acquired them. Researchers have long worked under the assumption that cells purchased from the same lot of a cell bank are clones   after all, they presumably result from divisions of a single cell, and therefore should all carry the same DNA. The reliability of cells is the foundation of much scientific research. The findings, being published online July 26 in the journal Scientific Reports and discussed at the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Manchester, England, were made by a research team led by scientists at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even if this was one bad batch, the discovery raises uncertainty about the reproducibility of experiments using cells that researchers have assumed were the same and contained the same DNA. For the researchers, the flawed cells cost them several years of work and close to $1 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health.  Every researcher believes that if they use cells from the same line of cells, particularly cells from the same lot of a cell bank, then they have clones that should look and act the same,  says study leader Thomas Hartung, MD, PhD, a professor in the Bloomberg School s departments of Environmental Health Sciences and Molecular Microbiology and Immunology.  We learned in this study that that is not always the case.  Cell irregularities are not unprecedented. Last year, Italian researchers reported instances of genetic instability in another tumor cell line from different laboratories. However, they did not detect instability in cells from the same lot from a single cell bank, as the Bloomberg School researchers did. Separately, three years ago, an international study using the same cell line as the Bloomberg School researchers, also failed because the cells were inconsistent, but this was not traced back to the cell source but blamed on the university laboratories.  The discovery came about when Hartung and other researchers at the Bloomberg School and Brown University were performing experiments for the Human Toxome Project, a large effort led by Hartung and taking place at six study centers across the country to better understand the toxicity of various chemicals by testing them on cell cultures. For this experiment, the researchers worked with cells from the MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) line, a well-established breast cancer line isolated in 1970. It has been used in original research published in more than 23,000 scientific articles. Many cancer cell lines, including this one, are  immortalized meaning that they ve lost the natural stop of dividing over time, creating limitless numbers of cells of the same type. To perform identical experiments at the two different schools, researchers from the Bloomberg School and Brown purchased frozen vials of cells of the same lot from the same cell bank. As a standard precaution to make sure that the cells they d purchased weren t contaminated with others of a different type, the researchers at each school performed a test that sampled short segments of the genome, called short tandem repeats. The test suggested that the cells were genetically identical. However, when the researchers began comparing notes from their experiments, they found that cells at the two different schools looked and behaved in vastly different ways, says Hartung, who also directs the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the Bloomberg School. The MCF-7 cells at the Bloomberg School grew flat, with a cobblestone-like appearance, while those at Brown grew in large, heap-like aggregations. When the cells were exposed to estrogen, those at Brown proliferated wildly but those at the Bloomberg School remained static. Further tests at the two schools showed that the different batches of cells produced different amounts of metabolic byproducts and had different patterns of gene activation. As noted above, to rule out whether dissimilarities between the two labs  techniques were responsible for these variations, the schools swapped cells and tried the experiments again with identical results to the original experiments at the opposite school. When the researchers performed another, more thorough test   called comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)   to check for genomic differences, they found that the two batches of cells were riddled with variations, presumably the cause for their host of differences. Fortunately, both laboratories had an additional vial of the same lot as obtained from the cell bank in their freezers that they d never touched. The big surprise: They already showed the same genetic differences, before they d been exposed to anything. The findings shed light on a potentially huge problem for the reproducibility of scientific experiments that use tumor cell cultures, Hartung explains.  This might explain, why three years ago a big international study using this very cell line failed because of lacking reproducibility,  he says. The results are a call to action for cell banks to rethink quality assurance procedures, Hartung says. By using detailed genetic testing, such as CGH, cell banks and their scientist customers can be reassured that cells from the same lot are indeed genetically identical, helping to reassure that they ll behave the same in identical experiments. Hartung and colleagues have previously called for tighter quality controls. In 2005, he led a team that published recommendations for Good Cell Culture Practice aimed at quality standards for cell banks and researchers. These eventually led to the founding of the International Good Cell Culture Practice Collaboration, which has representatives from organizations and agencies from around the world and is formally launching at ESOF 2016.  It is our goal to develop internationally agreed-upon standards for quality assurance of cell cultures and how we report on our experiments,  Hartung says.","Published: July 27, 2016"

This was the largest-ever study of familial (inherited) ALS, involved contributions from over 80 researchers in 11 countries, and was led by John Landers, Ph.D., of University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass. and Jan Veldink, Ph.D., of University Medical Center Utrecht, in The Netherlands. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which leads to total paralysis and death, usually within two to five years of diagnosis. While 10 percent of ALS is familial, meaning it s genetic, the other 90 percent of ALS cases are considered sporadic, or without a family history. However, it s very likely that genetics contribute, directly or indirectly, to a much larger percentage of ALS cases.   The discovery of NEK1 highlights the value of  big data  in ALS research,  said Lucie Bruijn, Ph.D., M.B.A.  The sophisticated gene analysis that led to this finding was only possible because of the large number of ALS samples available,  she said.  The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge enabled The ALS Association to invest in Project MinE s work to create large biorepositories of ALS biosamples that are designed to allow exactly this kind of research and to produce exactly this kind of result.  The ALS Association announced funding for Project MinE, an international effort to sequence the genomes of at least 15,000 people with ALS, in October 2014, which established the U.S. arm of the initiative with Dr. Landers  research efforts. Project MinE was the brainchild of entrepreneur, and person living with ALS, Bernard Muller, who, along with another patient, Robbert Jan Stuit, saw an opportunity to expedite genetic understanding of the disease after a tour of a Research ALS Center in the Netherlands where thousands of DNA samples were stored and not being used because it was too expensive to do the research the Center wanted to do. According to Muller,  The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge enabled us to secure funding from new sources in new parts of the world. Thankfully, The ALS Association brought Project MinE to the United States. This transatlantic collaboration supports our global gene hunt to identify the genetic drivers of ALS. I m incredibly pleased with the discovery of the NEK1 gene adding another step towards our ultimate goal, eradicating this disease from the face of the earth. NEK1 was discovered through a genome-wide search for ALS risk genes in over 1,000 ALS families, and was independently found through different means in an isolated population in The Netherlands. Further analysis in over 13,000 sporadic ALS individuals compared to controls again revealed an overrepresentation of variants in the same gene. The variations discovered in the gene sequence are predicted to lead to gene loss of function. NEK1 is known to have multiple roles in neurons, including maintenance of the cytoskeleton that gives the neuron its shape and promotes transport within the neuron. In addition, NEK1 has roles in regulating the membrane of the mitochondrion, which supplies energy to neurons and in repairing DNA. Disruption of each of these cellular functions through other means has been linked to increased risk of ALS.  Global collaboration among scientists, which was really made possible by ALS Ice Bucket Challenge donations, led to this important discovery,  said Dr. Landers.  It is a prime example of the success that can come from the combined efforts of so many people, all dedicated to finding the causes of ALS. This kind of collaborative study is, more and more, where the field is headed.  Understanding NEK1 s role in disease will provide an important new target for therapy development. The ALS Associations is currently funding Drs. John Landers and Catherine Lutz, Jackson Laboratories, to develop novel mouse models to better understand the consequences of the loss of the protein s function for the ALS disease process. They will provide rapid access to these models for the broader ALS research community as soon as they are generated. These tools are important for ALS drug development. Funding for Project MinE also came through The ALS Association Georgia Chapter, The ALS Association Greater New York Chapter and New Amsterdam City Swim. This August, The ALS Association is seeking to raise awareness and funds to finish what the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge started in 2014: an end to ALS. The new campaign, called Every Drop Adds Up, pays homage to the Ice Bucket Challenge, visually emphasizes the now iconic  bucket,  and builds on the idea that when people come together they can make big, impossible things happen.

The crop is able to thrive in flooded paddy fields   where the soggy, anaerobic conditions favour the availability of ammonium   as well as in much drier, drained soil, where increased oxygen means more nitrate is available. Nitrogen fertilizer is a major cost in growing many cereal crops and its overuse has a negative environmental impact. The nitrogen that all plants need to grow is typically available in the form of nitrate or ammonium ions in the soil, which are taken up by the plant roots. For the plant, getting the right balance of nitrate and ammonium is very important: too much ammonium and plant cells become alkaline; too much nitrate and they become acidic. Either way, upsetting the pH balance means the plant s enzymes do not work as well, affecting plant health and crop yield. Together with the partners in Nanjing, China, Dr Miller s team has been working out how rice plants can maintain pH under these changing environments. Rice contains a gene called OsNRT2.3, which creates a protein involved in nitrate transport. This one gene makes two slightly different versions of the protein: OsNRT2.3a and OsNRT2.3b. Following tests to determine the role of both versions of the protein, Dr Miller s team found that OsNRT2.3b is able to switch nitrate transport on or off, depending on the internal pH of the plant cell. When this  b  protein was overexpressed in rice plants they were better able to buffer themselves against pH changes in their environment. This enabled them to take up much more nitrogen, as well as more iron and phosphorus. These rice plants gave a much higher yield of rice grain (up to 54% more yield), and their nitrogen use efficiency increased by up to 40%. Dr Miller said:  Now that we know this particular protein found in rice plants can greatly increase nitrogen efficiency and yields, we can begin to produce new varieties of rice and other crops. These findings bring us a significant step closer to being able to produce more of the world s food with a lower environmental impact. ","Published: July 27, 2016"

Inherited mutations in DNA-repair genes including BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 are associated with an increased risk of several other cancers, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.   This finding offers a new window into understanding how metastatic prostate cancers develop,  said Peter Nelson, M.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who co-led the study. Reporting their results in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 6, the researchers noted that, in the future, men who have prostate cancer with these inherited mutations may be candidates for particular treatments, such as drugs that target molecular changes associated with defects in DNA repair. Confirming an Unexpected Result The study was sparked by an unexpected result of an earlier study. As the researchers were profiling genomic changes in metastatic prostate cancers, they sequenced DNA from normal tissues in the same patients for comparison purposes. They found that 8% of men with metastatic prostate cancer in that study had inherited a mutation in a DNA-repair gene. The proportion of inherited, or germline, mutations was so unexpectedly high that the researchers conducted the current study in part to see whether the high frequency of mutations was  reproducible when we were looking at a large population of men,  explained coauthor Colin C. Pritchard, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Washington. The answer, he added,  was a resounding yes.  In fact, the frequency of germline mutations in 16 DNA-repair genes among 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer turned out to be even higher 11.8%. The researchers detected harmful germline mutations in a DNA repair gene among 82 of the 692 participants. The frequency of inherited DNA-repair gene mutations in men in the study was higher than the prevalence of 4.6% among 499 men with localized prostate cancer who participated in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, the researchers noted.  These findings raise the possibility that a high proportion of men with metastatic prostate cancer 1 in 8 may have germline mutations in DNA-repair genes,  said James Gulley, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Genitourinary Malignancy Branch in NCI s Center for Cancer Research, who was not involved in the research.  DNA-repair genes may play a role in the progression to metastatic prostate cancer, and more research should be done to look at mutations in these genes in men with prostate cancer,  Dr. Gulley added. Potential Treatment Options Given the high frequency of DNA-repair gene mutations in prostate cancer and the potential for information about these mutations to inform treatment decisions, Dr. Nelson recommends that all patients with metastatic prostate cancer discuss the possibility of germline testing for inherited mutations in DNA-repair genes with their physicians.  The potential for new treatments for these patients is really exciting,  said Dr. Pritchard.  For example, drugs known as PARP inhibitors, which block an enzyme that helps repair damaged DNA, have been approved for some patients with ovarian cancer and are being evaluated in men with prostate cancer. One of these agents, olaparib (Lynparza ), is approved for certain patients with ovarian cancer whose tumors have mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Although PARP inhibitors have not yet been approved for prostate cancer, the Food and Drug Administration in January granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for olaparib for treating certain patients with prostate cancer. The decision was based on results from an early-stage clinical trial that showed a high response rate to olaparib among men with metastatic prostate cancer whose tumors did not respond to standard treatments and had defects in DNA-repair genes. Another potential treatment is platinum-based chemotherapy, which has been tested in women with breast and ovarian cancers that have mutations in DNA-repair genes. A recent case report describes three patients with metastatic prostate cancer and BRCA2 mutations who had exceptional responses to platinum-based chemotherapy, the study authors noted. More research is needed to prospectively evaluate platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, noted Dr. Nelson, who presented the study results in June at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Nonetheless, he added, the findings have pointed  to potential treatments that we would not have thought of otherwise.  Additional Types of Cancer  Among all patients in the study (with and without germline DNA-repair gene mutations), 22% had a first-degree relative with prostate cancer. Some relatives had other types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and other gastrointestinal cancers. For instance, 51 of the 72 patients with an inherited DNA-repair gene mutation (71%) had a first-degree relative with a cancer other than prostate cancer, whereas 270 of the 537 patients without such a mutation (50%) did.  The types of cancer in some of the family members of men with DNA-repair gene mutations were striking,  said coauthor Michael Walsh, M.D., of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  We don t typically think of leukemia and lymphoma, for example, as being associated with mutations in DNA-repair genes.  The researchers have begun to investigate these cases to better understand the association between inherited DNA-repair gene mutations and various types of cancer.  Based on our results,  said Dr. Pritchard,  it looks as though asking men with metastatic prostate cancer about a family history of other cancers might be just as important as asking about their family history of prostate cancer.   Sentinels  for Family Members The findings may also have implications for family members who may have unknowingly inherited cancer-predisposing genetic mutations. Men with inherited DNA-repair gene mutations could serve as  sentinels  for family members who may carry the same genetic alterations, said Dr. Nelson. For example, close female relatives of a patient with metastatic prostate cancer who carries an inherited harmful BRCA1 mutation might want to be tested for the presence of the same mutation. If the relatives are found to have the mutation, they could consider taking steps to reduce their risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Dr. Nelson noted that the investigators were conservative in their assessments of potential cancer-related mutations in DNA-repair genes, so the frequency of these mutations could be even higher. The patients in the study were nearly all white, however, and future studies need to include men of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, he added. Guidelines on Genetic Screening? Tests for inherited mutations in DNA-repair genes are commercially available. But Dr. Walsh cautioned that, as with any type of genetic testing,  it is important for patients to go to centers that are familiar with the tests and how to interpret the results.  At the ASCO meeting, Judy Garber, M.D., M.P.H., of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute discussed Dr. Nelson s presentation. She supported his recommendation to test all patients with metastatic prostate cancer for inherited mutations in DNA-repair genes. A frequency of 11.8% is above the criteria for recommending genetic testing in nearly all European countries and  certainly for insurance coverage [of testing] in the United States,  Dr. Garber said. There has been more interest in testing women for mutations in genes such as BRCA2 than men, she continued, adding:  It s time we brought in the men.  By her calculation, only 4 of the 190 clinical trials involving PARP inhibitors include men with metastatic prostate cancer. Addressing the audience, she said,  You have a lot of opportunity, and now you have a real clue that you need to move forward.  In the meantime, some of the study authors have already begun to screen patients with metastatic prostate cancer for the mutations.  We are optimistic that this study and others will lead experts who create guidelines to takes a closer look at DNA-repair genes and metastatic prostate cancer,  said Dr. Pritchard.

AFM is being applied to many areas including smart wound healing, plant toxicology and novel methods of nanoparticle characterization.  Dr Gordon McPhee is head of production for NextCell Pty in Adelaide, Australia. Situated on the Mawson Lakes Campus, he is located next to the University of South Australia (UniSA), Australia's leading university for interdisciplinary research, where he has access to their instrumentation as part of the group of Professor Nico Voelcker at the Future Industries Institute. Here, he uses JPK's NanoWizard  AFM system in multiple programs. These include investigating advanced materials for smart wound healing alternatives; characterization of live cell behaviour as influenced by substrate properties for skin graft improvements; new methods of mass spectrometry (MS) sample characterization leading to refined MS data analysis; understanding plant resistance methods to toxins; and novel methods of nanoparticle visualization.  Describing the uses of the NanoWizard , Dr McPhee says  Often the AFM can contribute to more than one aspect of a project. For example, Quantitative Imaging or QI  mode can deliver data on cell elasticity/morphology complemented by force spectroscopy performed on the substrate of choice. The ability to easily work on temperature controlled liquid immersed samples is also very useful for polymer material investigations. The instrument has proven a versatile addition to a very multidisciplinary group.  Talking of the benefits of the design and operation of the NanoWizard , Dr McPhee says  The tip-scanning approach of JPK versus the stage scanning approach of some other commercial designs of AFM is essential for combined fluorescence/AFM imaging and other biological applications. Integration with the JPK TopViewOptics  allows accurate tip positioning on opaque samples such as porous silicon. The BioCell  makes temperature control in liquids simple and allows live cell work to be performed. The variety of operating modes such as QI , Force Mapping, conductive and traditional imaging, plus the ability to switch between them without changing any hardware is very convenient.

More than 130 million people globally are carriers of HCV, a blood-borne virus. The innovative hepatitis C vaccine project will combine Burnets  proprietary HepSeeVaxDelta3  technology, developed by Associate Professor Heidi Drummer and colleagues, with ARTES  proprietary METAVAX  technology for the development of chimeric virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines. The project aims to develop a VLP based vaccine that efficiently presents HCV antigens to prevent hepatitis C infection. The VLPs will present the novel, modified envelope protein (E2) on its surface, thereby targeting the vaccine to dendritic cells to prime and prepare the immune system to fight against hepatitis C infection. Deputy Head of Burnet s Centre for Biomedical Research and HCV vaccine team leader, Associate Professor Drummer said HepSeeVaxDelta3  technology overcomes a critical limitation to HCV vaccine development.  The virus that causes HCV has evolved to avoid the immune system so that in natural infection, key immune responses are delayed or distracted by irrelevant targets on the virus. The same is true for conventional vaccine platforms tested previously. The HepSeeVaxDelta3  component of the vaccine redirects the immune response to make antibodies on the most important targets that prevent infection against the seven circulating HCV genotypes.  Managing Director of ARTES, Dr Michael Piontek said his company was excited to join forces with Burnet Institute to develop a much-needed vaccine against hepatitis C, which is endemic in many countries where treatment costs are high and HCV poses a significant burden on healthcare systems.  Access to diagnosis and treatment is limited, especially in endemic countries in Africa and Asia, so there is a strong demand for a safe and low-cost vaccine to prevent hepatitis C infection. This is in-line with the aim of the WHO to realize their hepatitis C elimination targets. After out-licensing processes for hepatitis B vaccine production worldwide, ARTES is proud to take the next step together with Burnet Institute in fighting another life-threatening hepatitis infection.

They jump from one focus point to another and even when we seem to be focused on one point, the eyes continue to reflexively move. These types of eye movements are called saccades. During saccades, even if we are not actively thinking about moving our eyes, our brain is still quickly working to land our focus precisely on spots that hold important information, such as the eyes of a person that you are talking to. The saccade is an example of sensorimotor coordination how we coordinate our movement with what we sense and has a far-reaching impact on motor control. Therefore, it is important to understand what is happening in the brain during saccades. See Also: Brain FM: Purkinje cells sing different tunes Recently, a group of researchers from Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) Graduate University and collaborators explored how changes in the activity of large neurons called Purkinje cells found in the cerebellum (the brain region known for its role in sensorimotor coordination) were correlated with these saccadic eye movements. They published their results in eLife. In order to do this, the team looked at the data from the brains of three live monkeys in Germany that were monitored during saccadic movement. Specifically, they were interested in how neurons transmit information, which is seen in the form of electrical signals. Just like all other neurons, Purkinje cells emit spikes caused by electrical output. Purkinje cells fire spikes rapidly most of time, but occasionally there are pauses in the spikes. ""One of the many challenges in studying neurons is to figure out the underlying cause of the different electrical signals,"" Prof. Erik De Schutter, co-author and head of OIST's Computational Neuroscience Unit said. ""We want to know what these spikes are actually telling us."" Their approach to data analysis was unique because the researchers examined not only the information regarding the spikes and pauses in the Purkinje cells, but also looked into the activity in the local field potential. ""The local field potential or the neighbourhood around a specific Purkinje cell reflects the activity in many neurons at the same time,"" De Schutter said. This way, they could look at the relationship between what was happening in specific neurons and what was happening in the average activity around those neurons. Don't Miss: Researchers offer new theory: Autism has roots in early-life injury to the cerebellum ""We found that the spikes right before and after a pause showed a much larger correlation with the local field potential,"" said Sungho Hong, first author and group leader of OIST's Computational Neuroscience Unit. ""That means that these spikes and pauses are not random. They are related to events happening within the larger network."" The next step was looking at the relationship between these electrical signals in the neurons and the eye motion itself. ""There is a big change in the local field potential at the time of a saccade,"" De Schutter said. ""We can also see that there is a pause-beginning spike in the Purkinje cell at the time that the eye movement starts."" The rest of the spikes that were not directly before or after a pause did not seem to have much individual importance. However, when the team built a mathematical model on the average firing rate of these spikes, they found that a simple relationship could predict the smooth aspect of motion the part of the motion that follows after the very start of the saccade. ""This showed us that the spikes that begin the pauses control the start of a movement and that the ones that are not related to the pauses control the velocity of the movement,"" De Schutter said. ""This means that there is multiplexing in the Purkinje cells they can send out two signals at once."" Learn More: Muscle-controlling neurons know when they mess up, according to research This is important because this research suggests that both timings of individual spikes and the average firing rate of the spikes are crucial in understanding the complexities of the cerebellum and fine motor control. This insight into understanding the mechanism of the neurons in the cerebellum could be useful in current medical technology, such as, brain machine interfacing, which allows paralyzed patients to move by re-routing brain signals. Additionally, this information could be useful in robotics that require fine motor control. ""Details matter,"" De Schutter said.

""I feel anxious all the time, and since starting this job six months ago, I seem to be forgetting small things on a daily basis. Did I take my supplements this morning? Where did I put my car keys? I don't even remember what I had for breakfast yesterday,"" he continues. Work pressures, money issues, exams, perhaps an illness in the family - these are common strains in every person's life. But when such daily battles are fought over long periods of time, we become subject to chronic stress. See Also: Saliva test for stress hormone levels may identify healthy older people with thinking problems This chronic stress could be affecting a part of our brain known as the hippocampus, the seat of factual and declarative memory. The hippocampus is a pair of curved structures at the base of our brains and encodes memories of facts and events - names, phone numbers, dates and daily events that we need to run our lives. New research now shows that even a brief period of stress can cause the hippocampus to start shrinking.This shrinking of the hippocampus a change in the brain's structure actually precedes the onset of a change in behavior, namely, the loss of memory. ""Until now, no one actually knew the evolution of these changes. Does the hippocampus shrink before or after memory loss? Or do the two happen hand-in-hand?"" asks Sumantra Chattarji, one of the main investigators in this study. To address this, a collaborative projectinvolving Chattarji's group from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, India, and Shane O'Mara's lab at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland was begun using rats as a model system. Rats react to stress much as humans do - they develop anxiety-related behaviors and their ability to form memories are affected. Long years of research have established well studied ways to test rats' memories and responses to various forms of stress. This makes rats widely used models to study brain and behavior related questions. Learn More: Genes determine the traces that stress leaves behind on our brains In the current study, rats were subjected to stress for two hours every day over ten days. The rats' brains were examined with MRI scans on several days over the course of the study, and their ability to form memories were assessed repeatedly using two different tests. Striking results emerged in the first set of MRI scans taken after just three days of stress - the hippocampus of every stressed rat had shrunk. ""It was a totally unexpected result. Normally structural changes are seen in the brain after a long time, say 10 to 20 days. Three days doesn't even count as chronic stress,"" says Chattarji. Five days after stress exposure, the rats' hippocampus-based ability to make memories were tested. Here again, the researchers were in for a surprise. Stressed rats performed almost as well as unstressed rats. ""Volume loss and shrinkage has already happened, yet spatial memory is still holding up,"" says Chattarji. At the end of the chronic stress regime, the hippocampus of stressed rats had shrunk even more. Further, a second and different memory test performed after this scan, showed stark differences between stressed and unstressed rats. Stressed rats performed poorly in this test compared to unstressed rats. These findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, also detail other interesting aspects of how the brain changes in structure during stress. In the early days of stress, shrinkage in the left hippocampus is more pronounced, but at the end of ten days, the right hippocampus loses the most volume. ""Right now, we don't really know the functional significance of this. There is some evidence that in mice undergoing social stress, only the left hippocampus shrinks. If there is any inherent difference between the left and right hippocampus, that needs to be studied,"" says Mostafizur, a PhD student with Chattarji and the lead author of the study. Don't Miss: Study finds brain markers of numeric, verbal and spatial reasoning abilitiesAnother discovery is that there are individual differences amongst the rats in how much the chronic stress regime affected them. The amount of shrinkage in a rat's hippocampus on day 3 can predict the shrinkage seen at the end of the 10-day stress period. The higher the shrinkage, the worse the rats'performance in memory tests at the end of the stress. ""This makes it even stronger that volume loss is a pretty good predictor of what the behavioral consequences will be at a much later stage,"" says Chattarji. Many different groups, including Chattarji's have studied stress in rodent models for a long time. ""What comes out in our study is that there are individual differences between rats,"" says Mostafizur. ""In today's world, with so much talk about personalised medicine, these results could have huge implications for future studies on human disease,"" he adds.

Led by John Landers, PhD, professor of neurology at teh University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMass) Medical School and Jan Veldink, PhD, at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, the research was supported by The ALS Association through Project MinE, an international collaboration for gene discovery in ALS, and funded through ALS Ice Bucket donations. See Also: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects neurons in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which often leads to total paralysis and death within two to five years of diagnosis. While 10 percent of ALS is familial, meaning it's genetic, the other 90 percent of ALS cases are considered sporadic, or without a family history. However, it's very likely that genetics contribute, directly or indirectly, to a much larger percentage of ALS cases. The ALS Association announced funding for Project MinE, an international effort to sequence the genomes of at least 15,000 people with ALS, in October 2014, which established the U.S. arm of the initiative with Dr. Landers' research efforts. Project MinE was the brainchild of entrepreneur Bernard Muller, and Robbert Jan Stuit, both of whom have ALS. They saw an opportunity to expedite genetic understanding of the disease after a tour of the Research ALS Center in the Netherlands where thousands of DNA samples are not being used because it was too expensive to do the research the center wanted to do. ""This study was only possible because of the collaboration of all of the scientists involved,"" said Landers. ""It is a prime example of the success that can come from the combined efforts of so many people, all dedicated to finding the causes of ALS. This kind of collaborative study is, more and more, where the field is headed."" Don't Miss: ALS: Renewing brain's aging support cells may help neurons survive The study involved contributions from more than 80 researchers in 11 countries, and was the largest-ever study of familial ALS. Exome data from the familial ALS cases in the study have been added to the ALS Variant Server, a publicly available database funded by The ALS Association. ""The discovery of NEK1 highlights the value of big data in ALS research,"" said Lucie Bruijn, PhD, MBA, of The ALS Association. ""The sophisticated gene analysis that led to this finding was only possible because of the large number of ALS samples available. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge enabled The ALS Association to invest in Project MinE's work to create large biorepositories of ALS biosamples that are designed to allow exactly this kind of research and to produce exactly this kind of result."" The new gene, called NEK1, was discovered through a genome-wide search for ALS risk genes in more than 1,000 ALS families, and was independently found through different means in an isolated population in the Netherlands. Further analysis in more than 13,000 sporadic ALS individuals compared to controls again revealed the overrepresentation of variants in the same gene. The variations discovered in the gene sequence are predicted to lead to a loss of function of the gene. NEK1 is known to have multiple roles in neurons, including maintenance of the cytoskeleton that gives the neuron its shape and promotes transport within the neuron. In addition, NEK1 has roles in regulating the membrane of the mitochondrion, which supplies energy to neurons, and in repairing DNA. Disruption of each of these functions through other means has been linked to increased risk of ALS. Learn More: Study shows more patients with ALS have genetic origin than previously thought Understanding the role of NEK1 in disease will provide an important new target for therapy development. The ALS Association is currently funding Landers and Catherine Lutz, PhD, senior research scientist at the Jackson Laboratories in Bar Harbour, Maine, to develop novel mouse models to better understand the consequences of the loss of the protein's function for the ALS disease process. They will provide rapid access to these models for the broader ALS research community as soon as they are generated. These tools are important for ALS drug development.

The study, from scientists at Imperial College London, also found patients who received the influenza vaccination had a 24 per cent lower death rate in the flu season compared to patients who weren't vaccinated. The team, who published their findings in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) studied 124, 503 UK adults with type 2 diabetes between 2003 and 2010. Around 65 per cent of these patients received the flu vaccine. The scientists found that, compared to patients who had not been vaccinated, those who received the jab had a 30 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for stroke, 22 per cent reduction in heart failure admissions and 15 per cent reduction in admissions for pneumonia or influenza. Furthermore, people who were vaccinated had a 24 per cent lower death rate than patients who were not vaccinated. The team also found a 19 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for heart attack among vaccinated type 2 diabetes patients during the flu season; however this finding was not statistically significant. Dr Eszter Vamos, lead author of the study from the School of Public Health at Imperial, said: ""Most flu deaths every year occur in people with pre-existing health conditions such as type 2 diabetes. This study suggests the vaccine may have substantial benefits for patients with long-term conditions. Not only might it help reduce serious illness such as stroke - and possibly heart attack - in high-risk individuals, but it may also reduce the risk of death in the flu season. Currently more than one-third of people with diabetes do not receive their flu vaccine year-by-year in England. By increasing the number of people receiving influenza vaccine annually, we could further reduce the risk of severe illness not addressed by other measures."" Type 2 diabetes results in a person being unable to control their blood sugar properly and affects around 2.7 million people in UK. People with the condition are at high risk of cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and stroke, possibly due to high blood sugar levels damaging blood vessels. Furthermore, flu infection has been found to increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease, although scientists are unsure why. In the UK the NHS offers the annual flu vaccine to children and adults with underlying health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, as well as to all over-65s and pregnant women. Professor Azeem Majeed, co-senior author from the School of Public Health at Imperial added: ""There are few studies looking at the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in people with diabetes. Although there have been questions surrounding the effectiveness of the flu vaccine in recent years, this research demonstrates a clear advantage for people with diabetes. The findings of the study illustrate the importance of flu vaccine in reducing the risk of ill-health and death in people with long-term conditions.  The flu vaccine is available free to these patients from GPs and pharmacists, and patients with diabetes should ensure they receive the vaccine every year."" In the study, the team looked at a representative sample of 124, 503 patients with type 2 diabetes from a number of GP surgeries in England. They then tracked these patients over a seven year period, and monitored the number of hospital admissions in this patient group for heart attack, stroke, heart failure, pneumonia, influenza. They also looked at the number of deaths. The team then adjusted their figures for demographic and social factors, as well as existing health conditions.","Published: July 26, 2016"

The Phase 1/2 clinical program will explore the potential of combining Bristol-Myers Squibb s immuno-oncology agents, which are designed to alleviate immune suppression, in conjunction with AbbVie s investigational antibody drug conjugate, Rova-T, to drive improved and sustained efficacy and tolerability above the current standard of care. Rova-T is a novel antibody drug conjugate that targets and eliminates tumor initiating cells and other bulk tumor cells. This collaboration will determine if the targeted cell killing and antigen release caused by Rova-T may further enhance the effect of immunotherapy.   We are excited to explore the potential benefits of combining Bristol-Myers Squibb s immunotherapies with a targeted approach like Rova-T in small cell lung cancer where the need for new therapies is particularly acute for this aggressive form of lung cancer,  said Jean Viallet, M.D., Global Clinical Research Lead, Oncology, Bristol-Myers Squibb.  As the science around cancer research continues to rapidly evolve, we are building on our leadership in Immuno-Oncology with numerous collaborations that may help advance new therapies for cancers in need of better options.   We believe the combination of these cancer-fighting agents may offer patients a new treatment option in a disease with limited therapies,  said Scott J. Dylla, Ph.D., vice president, research and development, AbbVie.  By combining immune-checkpoint inhibitors that prime the body s immune system to fight cancer cells with Rova-T s approach to target cancer stem cells, we hope to build on our goal to develop differentiated treatments with therapeutic benefit that elevate the standard of care for small cell lung cancer patients.  Small cell lung cancer is a difficult-to-treat form of cancer that accounts for approximately 15 percent of all lung cancers. The five-year survival rate for extensive-stage SCLC is less than 5 percent and treatment options are limited for the more than 234,000 people diagnosed annually.  Rova-T is a novel biomarker-specific therapy that targets cancer stem cells and combines a targeted antibody that delivers a cytotoxic agent directly to cancer cells expressing a delta-like protein 3 (DLL3). DLL3 is expressed in more than 80 percent of SCLC patient tumors and is not present in healthy tissue. Rova-T is currently in investigational studies as a third-line treatment for SCLC. AbbVie will initiate a first-line clinical study for Rova-T in SCLC and several other types of tumors in the near term.  Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July 2014, and currently has regulatory approval in 54 countries including the United States, Japan, and in the European Union. Yervoy is a CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor approved in 50 countries globally for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. ","Published: July 26, 2016"

It is the first FDA-cleared diagnostic kit for use in CML management. The kit s unparalleled sensitivity, reproducibility and simplicity provide clinicians and laboratorians with a unique tool for the robust and accurate assessment of disease clearance in patients, with the potential to help significantly improve the cost and standard of care for patients. About 10% of all leukemia is CML.  Targeted treatments like imatinib (Gleevec) and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have significantly increased the CML 5-year survival rate. With improved therapies, highly sensitive disease monitoring at the molecular level is an important part of patient management.   Despite the long-established importance of BCR-ABL1 monitoring in successful CML therapy, until now there has been no FDA-cleared BCR-ABL1 monitoring assay available to patients and physicians. The highly sensitive QuantideX  qPCR BCR-ABL IS assay was subjected to extensive analytic and clinical review through the FDA s de novo 510(k) premarket review pathway and secured clearance with a limit of detection (LOD) of MR4.7 / 0.002% IS (4.7 log molecular reduction from 100% IS).  The LOD was determined using real human RNA, not human-derived cell lines, ensuring that even at this unprecedented analytical sensitivity, the assay reproducibly detects BCR-ABL1 RNA in  95% of patients at MR 4.7.  Additionally, the combination of multiplex assay design, result reporting software and the ability to directly report patient results in IS values significantly improves laboratory workflows relative to currently available testing solutions. The kit was cleared to run on the Applied Biosystems  7500 Fast DX Real-Time PCR Instrument.  In evaluating the QuantideX  qPCR BCR-ABL IS kit, we confirmed the high level of sensitivity achieved for human clinical samples measured in our laboratory at MR 4.7 (0.002% IS). The configuration of the assay   multiplexed, single-lot reagents, efficient workflow, and direct IS reporting   provided the robustness, sensitivity and data quality we believe to be unprecedented in the market today,  said Y. Lynn. Wang, MD, PhD, FACP, Professor and Founding Division Director, Genomic and Molecular Pathology, University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center.  The high level of sensitivity will contribute to the assessment of the depth and duration of clinical response to TKI and experimental therapies.   The FDA clearance of the QuantideX  qPCR BCR-ABL IS kit demonstrates Asuragen s focus on commercializing regulated molecular diagnostic products in oncology and genetic disease testing and monitoring  said Matthew McManus, MD, PhD, Asuragen s President and CEO.  We re committed to improving patient care, here in CML, by providing highly sensitive, reliable and easy to use products. ","Published: July 26, 2016"

The initiative is a public-private effort by Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. hosted by UC San Francisco (UCSF) in conjunction with UC Health, which comprises the University of California s five medical centers. The first two demonstration projects, funded a few months after the initiative was announced last year, were restricted to projects that were led by investigators at UC campuses. The new round of funding, made possible through the 2016-17 state budget, is open to any public, private academic or non-profit institution in California. Up to six proposals will be funded, for a total of $7.2 million. The state will also support an analysis of the ecosystem of precision medicine in California to spur more public-private collaborations through identifying pertinent data sets, research, private, academic and non-profit contributions across the spectrum of precision medicine in California. Atul Butte, MD, PhD, who is leading the state initiative and directs the UCSF Institute for Computational Health Sciences, said the new state contribution will help to connect the many disparate players needed to deliver precision medicine technologies to patients.  I am thrilled that the state has provided additional funding to this initiative to help advance precision medicine in California,  said Butte, a professor of pediatrics at UCSF and the director of clinical informatics at UC Health.  There is an incredible opportunity here to foster strong collaborations between innovators from all sectors, collaborations that will accelerate the achievement of our vision for improving health and healthcare by better understanding each person s unique circumstances. There is so much potential in this state, and I can t wait to see the proposals we expect to receive in response to the request we just released.  One of the two current projects, the California Kids Cancer Comparison, which is using big data bioinformatics to help kids who did not respond to standard therapies, or for whom no effective standard therapies are available at diagnosis, has already helped doctors identify treatment options for several children with intractable cancer. The other project, Precision Diagnosis of Acute Infectious Diseases, uses genetic sequencing to diagnose patients who are hospitalized with acute, life-threatening infections that doctors have been unable to diagnose, including encephalitis, meningitis and sepsis. The sequencing technology is able to sequence everything in a patient s cerebrospinal fluid or blood and can detect any pathogen, whether it is a virus, bacteria, fungus or parasite. The team has completed laboratory validation for diagnostic testing from cerebrospinal fluid and will use the test during the next year to clinically diagnose 300 patients at three UC hospitals: UCSF, UCLA, and UC Davis. The California initiative was established in the spring of 2015 to catalyze precision medicine discoveries and technologies by coordinating public, private, and non-profit partners. The two funded projects involve extensive collaborations within the UC system, as well as with other academic medical centers in California, patient advocates and companies in Silicon Valley and the biotech industry. The next six projects will be selected in a two-stage competitive peer review process later this summer and fall. Among the selection criteria are the project s ability to leverage the state s expansive and diverse patient data, research expertise and technological capabilities.","Published: July 26, 2016"

The results ruled out inferiority compared to trastuzumab but could not rule out superiority based on its primary efficacy endpoint of the difference of the percentage of patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR). The primary endpoint had a prespecified equivalence margin of +/- 13 percent and the observed upper end of the confidence interval was 13.4 percent.   Overall, adverse events were comparable between ABP 980 and trastuzumab. In the neoadjuvant phase of the study, which included chemotherapy, there were more serious adverse events reported in the ABP 980 group, the majority of which were reported by the investigators as unlikely related to investigational product. In the adjuvant phase of the study, which did not include chemotherapy, serious adverse events were comparable between treatment groups. The overall results also showed comparable immunogenicity. ""We believe this study confirms no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab, and we look forward to continued discussions with regulatory authorities,"" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Biosimilars are approved based on the analytical, nonclinical and clinical data, and we believe that the totality of the evidence we've generated supports ABP 980 as highly similar to the reference product.""  ""These results provide significant clinical evidence that ABP 980 could be an important biosimilar treatment option for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer,"" said David Nicholson, chief research and development officer, Allergan.

Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, which is present in spicy curry dishes, and silymarin is a component of milk thistle, which has been used to treat liver disease. The researchers and their students studied a line of colon cancer cells in a laboratory model. They found treating the cells initially with curcumin, then with silymarin was more effective in fighting cancer than treating the cells with either phytochemical alone, said Uthayashanker Ezekiel, Ph.D., corresponding author and associate professor of biomedical laboratory science. ""The combination of phytochemicals inhibited colon cancer cells from multiplying and spreading. In addition, when the colon cancer cells were pre-exposed to curcumin and then treated with silymarin, the cells underwent a high amount of cell death,"" Ezekiel said. ""Phytochemicals may offer alternate therapeutic approaches to cancer treatments and avoid toxicity problems and side effects that chemotherapy can cause."" Ezekiel noted the research is a preliminary cell study, with more research ahead before scientists know if the compounds are an effective treatment for people who have colon cancer. He saw promise in using the phytochemicals to help prevent colon cancer, which frequently is caused by lifestyle factors such as diet. Scientists next would need to study how the curcumin and silymarin impact the actions of molecules, such as genetic transcription and expression, that cause cells to change, Ezekiel said. Then the compounds would be studied in an animal model, then in humans. ""Concentrations of curcumin and silymarin that are too high could be harmful to people,"" he said. ""We still have much to learn, and for now, it's so much safer to add a little spice to your diet and get your curcumin from foods that contain turmeric, such as curry, rather than taking high doses of the compound."" A team of SLU students and another researcher from Doisy College of Health Sciences joined Ezekiel as authors of the paper. They are Amanda Montgomery, a former student in nutrition and dietetics; Temitope Adeyeni, a former graduate student in health science and information and biomedical laboratory science; KayKay San, a former student in biomedical laboratory science; and Rita Heuertz, Ph.D., professor of biomedical laboratory science. A DeNardo Education and Research Foundation grant supported the work of the students. The President's Research Fund at SLU provided financial support for Ezekiel. Long a leader in educating health professionals, Saint Louis University offered its first degree in an allied health profession in 1929. Today the Doisy College of Health Sciences offers degrees in physical therapy and athletic training, biomedical laboratory science, nutrition and dietetics, health informatics and information management, audiology, medical imaging and radiation therapeutics, occupational science and occupational therapy, and physician assistant education.

In the latest example, researchers from Penn Medicine and other institutions found that treating metastatic thyroid cancer patients harboring a BRAF mutation with the targeted therapy vemurafenib  originally approved for melanoma patients with the mutation showed promising anti-tumor activity in a third of patients.  The results were published in this week s Lancet Oncology. The phase II clinical study included results from 51 patients enrolled at 10 centers around the world with progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory (RAI) papillary thyroid cancer and a BRAF mutation who were no longer responding to prior therapies. After a 15-month follow up, 16 patients from two cohorts had partial responses, with an overall response rate of 38 and 27 percent in each of the cohorts.   For this group of patients, who have little to no options, that s a significant improvement,  said Marcia Brose, MD, PhD, an associate professor of Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery and Hematology/Oncology and director of the Center for Rare Cancers and Personalized Therapy and Penn s Abramson Cancer Center.  This promising clinical trial is the next step in a series of trials to identify new drugs that are fundamentally shifting the horizon   improving the outcome for patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer.  About 62,450 people were diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer in 2015. BRAF mutations, which occur in about 40 to 50 percent of these patients, have been associated with aggressive tumors and decreased ability of tumors to respond to radioactive iodine, typically the first line of treatment in these patients.  Patients are often cured by surgery, without or without RAI, but 50 percent of them with residual, recurrent or metastatic ultimately do not respond, and another avenue is needed.  Vemurafenib joins other multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (MKIs) (sorafenib, lenvatinib) shown to be effective in this patient population; in spite of responses to these drugs, the responses are temporary and additional treatment options are needed.  For the study, researchers enrolled a total of 51 patients between January 2011 and January 2013. Patients in cohort one (26 patients) had not been previously treated with MKIs, while patients in cohort (25) were treated with MKIs. Some in both groups had previously been treated with chemotherapy as well. In cohort one, 10 patients had a partial response to vemurafenib, and an additional nine achieved stable disease for at least six months, for a combined disease control rate of 73 percent. The median progression free survival was 18.2 months. In cohort two, which had patients that were heavily pretreated, six patients had a partial response, and six achieved stable disease for at least six months, for a combined disease control rate of 54.5 percent. The median progression free survival was 8.9 months and median overall survival was 14.4 months. Overall, the side effects experienced by the patients were consistent with that of melanoma patients, except for the higher rates of weight loss, dysgeusia (distortion of taste), anaemia (lack of iron), increased creatine levels, and hepatic laboratory abnormalities.    Due to our prior successes in treating these patients with sorafenib and lenvatinib, patients are doing better, but they still ultimately progress, and additional agents with different mechanisms of action are needed,  Brose said.  Vemurafenib is the first non-VEGFR inhibitor to show activity in this patient population and as such is an important addition to our treatment options for these patients.

About 1.5 percent of American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but most of them will not be diagnosed until late in the disease s progression, after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This is reflected in the grim outlook for most women: The five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is about 25 percent. Paul Campagnola, a professor of biomedical engineering and medical physics at UW Madison, leads a group of researchers aiming to improve that outlook by understanding how ovarian cancer cells interact with nearby body tissue, and by developing new tools for imaging and detecting the disease. With a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, they will use technology they ve developed on the UW Madison campus to develop images of tissues from surgical patients. The first target is collagen, a common protein that gives much of the body structure by holding bones, ligaments and muscles together.  In most cancers, including ovarian, there are large changes in the collagen structure that goes along with the disease,  Campagnola says.  It might happen first. It might be later. It s actually not known.  Campagnola and his colleagues, including Kevin Eliceiri, director of UW Madison s Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, and Manish Patankar, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology, hope to eliminate that unknown by printing tiny, 3-D models of the collagen samples. The models will be biomimetic   synthetic, but mimicking biological materials, as Velcro mimics the burs of a plant   and extremely small. Because, after seeding the models with ovarian cancer cells, the researchers will implant them into mice. Why not simply inject the mice with cancer cells and skip the painstaking imaging and 3-D printing process? Mice don t get ovarian cancer   a partial answer for why we still don t understand ovarian cancer as well as many other cancers. By implanting a 3-D tissue model seeded with ovarian cancer into mice, Campagnola hopes to mimic more closely the conditions of metastatic ovarian cancer in humans.  What s different is our tissues will already be 3-D structured,  Campagnola says.  One problem when people study cancer sometimes is that they put cells in a dish. Cells in a dish don t act like cells in tissue. So we re trying to give them the tissue structure that cancer cells would have in a native environment.  From there, they ll study how the implanted tumours grow inside the mice, and hopefully begin to learn more about the cues and processes involved in the disease s progression and spread. It s an approach that no one has ever attempted, one that will also help improve the way doctors make images of ovaries inside the body.  It s an integrated approach to improving our imaging capabilities, but then also using our imaging capabilities to make these models so we can study the biology,  Campagnola says. Ultimately, the team s long-term goal is to improve screening, diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. One of the most effective ways to improve the outlook for women with ovarian cancer is to develop a straightforward method for screening women at higher risk for the disease. Women with a mutation in a gene called BRCA, a mutation also implicated in a higher risk for breast cancer, have a 40 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime.  The current way that people study ovarian cancer in a mouse is very poor,  Campagnola explains.  They just take human cell lines and then inject them into a mouse. Then some of them will form into a tumour, but most do not.   Those are the women we really want to follow,  Campagnola says.  You could imagine   we re a long way off from this   screening those women every few years with a minimally invasive device through a laparoscope or through the fallopian tubes.  But to get to that point, Campagnola says, researchers need to know a lot more about how ovarian cancer works.  You have to know what you re looking for,  he says.

This is the oldest plant genome to be reconstructed to date. The 6,000-year-old seeds were retrieved from Yoram Cave in the southern cliff of Masada fortress in the Judean Desert, close to the Dead Sea. Genetically, the prehistoric barley is very similar to present-day barley grown in the Southern Levant, supporting the existing hypothesis of barley domestication having occurred in the Upper Jordan Valley. Members of the research team are from the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK) in Gatersleben, Germany; Bar-Ilan University; Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel; the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany; and the University of Haifa; The James Hutton Institute, UK; University of California, Santa Cruz, USA; University of Minnesota St. Paul, USA; University of T bingen, Germany. The analyzed grains, together with tens of thousands of other plant remains, were retrieved during a systematic archaeological excavation headed by Uri Davidovich, from the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Nimrod Marom, from Zinman Institute of Archaeology, University of Haifa. The archaeobotanical analysis was led by Ehud Weiss, of Bar-Ilan University. The cave is very difficult to access and was used only for a short time by humans, some 6,000 years ago, probably as ephemeral refuge. Oldest plant genome reconstructed to date Most examination of archaeobotanical findings has been limited to the comparison of ancient and present-day specimens based on their morphology. Up to now, only prehistoric corn has been genetically reconstructed. In this research, the team succeeded in sequencing the complete genome of the 6,000-year-old barley grains. The results are now published in the online version of the journal Nature Genetics.  These archaeological remains provided a unique opportunity for us to finally sequence a Chalcolithic plant genome. The genetic material has been well-preserved for several millennia due to the extreme dryness of the region,  explains Ehud Weiss, of Bar-Ilan University s Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology. In order to determine the age of the ancient seeds, the researchers split the grains and subjected half of them to radiocarbon dating while the other half was used to extract the ancient DNA.  For us, ancient DNA works like a time capsule that allows us to travel back in history and look into the domestication of crop plants at distinct time points in the past,  explains Johannes Krause, Director of the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena. The genome of Chalcolithic barley grains is the oldest plant genome to be reconstructed to date. Domestication of barley completed very early Wheat and barley were already grown 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, a sickle-shaped region stretching from present-day Iraq and Iran through Turkey and Syria into Lebanon, Jordan and Israel. Up to this day, the wild forms of these two crops persist in the region and are among the major model species studied at the Institute of Evolution in the University of Haifa.  It was from there that grain farming originated and later spread to Europe, Asia and North Africa,  explains Tzion Fahima, of the University of Haifa.  Our analyses show that the seeds cultivated 6,000 years ago greatly differ genetically from the wild forms we find today in the region. However, they show considerable genetic overlap with present-day domesticated lines from the region,  explains Nils Stein, who directed the comparison of the ancient genome with modern genomes at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK), Gatersleben, with the support of Robbie Waugh and colleagues at the James Hutton Institute, Dundee, Scotland, and Gary Muehlbauer, University of Minnesota, USA.  This demonstrates that the domestication of barley in the Fertile Crescent was already well advanced very early.  The comparison of the ancient seeds with wild forms from the region and with so-called  landraces  (i.e., local barley lines grown by farmers in the Near East) enabled to geographically suggest, according to Tzion Fahima and his colleagues at the University of Haifa and Tel-Hai College,  the origin of the domestication of barley within the Upper Jordan Valley   a hypothesis that is also supported by two archaeological sites in the surrounding area where the hitherto earliest remains of barley cultivation have been found. Immigrants  trust  in extant landraces Also the genetic overlap with present-day domesticated lines from the region is revealing to the researchers.  This similarity is an amazing finding considering to what extent the climate, but also the local flora and fauna, as well as the agricultural methods, have changed over this long period of time,  says Martin Mascher, from the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, the lead author of the study.  The researchers therefore assume that conquerors and immigrants coming to the region did not bring their own crop seeds from their former homelands, but continued cultivating the locally adapted extant landraces. New insights into the origins of our crop plants Combining archaeology, archaeobotany, genetics and computational genomics in an interdisciplinary study has produced novel insights into the origins of our crop plants.  This is just the beginning of a new and exciting line of research,  predicts Verena Schuenemann, from Tuebingen University, the second lead author of the study.  DNA-analysis of archaeological remains of prehistoric plants will provide us with novel insights into the origin, domestication and spread of crop plants. ","Published: July 26, 2016"

The findings could prolong the use of several anti-malarial drugs, including the former wonder drug chloroquine, to treat the mosquito-borne disease which kills 600,000 people around the world each year. Lead researchers Dr Rowena Martin and PhD student Sashika Richards, from the ANU Research School of Biology, said changes in the protein that enable the parasite to evade several anti-malarial drugs - including chloroquine - make the parasite super-sensitive to other therapies. ""Malaria is one of the biggest killers in the world, particularly for young children and pregnant women in Africa and the Pacific, and our research could help save countless lives in some of the world's poorest countries,"" Dr Martin said. Dr Martin said the interactions of the modified protein with certain drugs were so intense that it was unable to effectively perform its normal role, which was essential to the parasite's survival. ""We also found that the changes that allow the protein to move chloroquine away from its anti-malarial target simultaneously enable the protein to deliver other drugs to their anti-malarial targets,"" she said. ""The other important phenomenon we found is when the protein adapts itself to fend off one of these drugs, it is no longer able to deal with chloroquine and hence the parasite is re-sensitised to chloroquine. ""Essentially, the parasite can't have its cake and eat it too. So if chloroquine or a related drug is paired with a drug that is super-active against the modified protein, no matter what the parasite tries to do it's checkmate for malaria."" Dr Martin said the super-sensitivity phenomenon also occurred in other drug-resistant pathogens, such as bacteria, and in cancer cells. Ms Richards said the findings would improve the cure rates for people with malaria, and could help stop the emergence and spread of drug-resistant malaria. ""Health authorities could use our research to find ways to prolong the lifespan of anti-malarial drugs,"" Ms Richards said. She said prolonging the use of existing drugs was crucial, as it would give scientists time to find the next anti-malarial drug. ""The current frontline anti-malarial drug, artemisinin, is already failing in Asia and we don't have anything to replace it,"" she said. ""It will be at least five years before the next new drug makes it to market. The low-hanging fruit is gone, and it's now very costly and time consuming to develop new treatments for malaria.""","Published: July 26, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cdc-updates-zika-recommendations-189910,CDC Updates Zika Recommendations CDC has issued updated Zika recommendations and guidance for healthcare providers with a focus on sexual transmission  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. CDC has issued an updated guidance and information to prevent Zika virus transmission and health effects surrounding updated interim guidance for healthcare providers caring for pregnant women with possible exposure to Zika virus; and updated interim guidance for the prevention of sexually transmitted Zika virus. CDC updates its interim guidance related to Zika virus transmission and related health effects based on the accumulating evidence, expert opinion, and knowledge about the risk associated with other viral infections. CDC will continue to update this guidance as new information becomes available. Updated interim guidance for healthcare providers caring for pregnant women with possible exposure to Zika virus Because the diagnosis of Zika infection can be complicated, the updated guidance expands the timeframe, up to 14 days, that testing for Zika virus particles in the blood of pregnant women can be offered. This expansion will provide a definite diagnosis for more pregnant women infected with for Zika virus. Many people infected with Zika virus won t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms.  Up until now, scientists thought that if a person becomes sick after being infected with Zika, the virus stays in the person s blood for about a week after symptoms started. So the first week of illness was thought to be the best time to find evidence of the virus in blood using a Zika-specific test.  But not everyone will see a health care provider while they are sick with Zika and many will not have symptoms. For those who visited a health care provider more than a week after symptoms started, that is, after the virus has cleared from the blood, and those who were possibly exposed to Zika but never developed symptoms, healthcare providers could order a different test to look for evidence that the body is fighting a virus in the family of viruses that includes Zika. The results of the latter test are more difficult to interpret because the body s reaction to Zika virus can resemble the reaction to similar viruses; therefore, this test may not provide a definite diagnosis. New information has indicated that some infected pregnant women can have evidence of Zika virus in their blood for longer than the previously recommended seven-day window for testing after symptoms begin, and that even pregnant women without symptoms can have evidence of the virus in their blood and urine. Therefore, the updated guidance expands the Zika-specific blood testing for a longer period, up to 14 days, in pregnant women with symptoms and advises that pregnant women with possible Zika exposure but no symptoms receive this testing as well. In addition, if pregnant women visit their healthcare provider after the 14 day testing window and test positive with the less-specific test, the Zika-specific blood testing can now be offered potentially to provide a definite diagnosis for pregnant women with Zika virus infection. Expanding the use of the Zika-specific test could provide more women with Zika virus infection a definite diagnosis and help direct medical evaluation and care. In addition, the CDC s new guidance includes recommendations to help healthcare providers better care for their pregnant patients with confirmed or possible Zika infection. Updated recommendations for the prevention of sexually transmitted Zika virus to include the possibility of sexual transmission from an infected woman This expanded guidance is based on a recently reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City and limited human and non-human primate data indicating Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions. It expands CDC s definition of sexual exposure to Zika to include sex without a barrier method (including male or female condoms, among other methods) with any person-- male or female-- who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika. The updated recommendations for pregnant couples include pregnant women with female sex partners who are potentially infected with Zika. They also give advice for potentially infected women about how to reduce their risk of sexually transmitting the virus to partners. Although transmission of Zika from a woman to her sex partners is believed to be uncommon and (as with the majority of Zika infections) unlikely to result serious side effects, it could present a risk for pregnant women with female sex partners who may be infected with Zika. For this reason, CDC recommends that all pregnant women with sex partners (male or female) who live in or traveled to an area with Zika use condoms during sex or abstain from sex for the remainder of their pregnancy. All other couples in which a partner (male or female) has been in an area with Zika can also reduce the risk of sexual transmission by using condoms or abstaining from sex. Sex includes vaginal, anal and oral sex, and may also include the sharing of sex toys. Health care providers should test all pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika sexually. Health care providers should also test any patients for Zika if they develop symptoms of Zika and report potential sexual exposure to a partner who lives in or traveled to an area with Zika. CDC encourages local and state health department to report potential cases of sexually transmitted Zika virus infection. CDC will continue to update its guidance related to Zika virus transmission and related health effects based on the accumulating evidence, expert opinion, and knowledge about the risk associated with other viral infections.","Published: July 26, 2016"

The agreement gives Aelan world-wide rights to intellectual property describing a novel epigenetic biomarker with a granted United States patent. The Buck Institute filed the patent application on the discovery made in Dr. Victoria Lunyak's laboratory. Dr. Lunyak is currently the Founder, CEO and President of Aelan Cell Technologies. The patent on the discovery was granted in 2015. The agreement grants Aelan development and commercialization rights to this biomarker, which is linked to DNA damage pathway, cellular senescence and aging. Financial terms of the agreement are not disclosed. This agreement is further evidence of Aelan's commitment to developing novel innovative diagnostics and treatments for important medical conditions, especially age-related pathologies and disorders. Aelan Cell Technologies announced the discovery and potential clinical utility of this novel epigenetic biomarker. Together with other Aelan's proprietary components this biomarker is used in one of three blood-based tests aimed to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. An early human clinical feasibility study has indicated that serological tests developed by Aelan's researchers are very promising and could help physicians to pin-point Alzheimer's disease (AD) by directly measuring of the biomarker in patient's serum alongside with a measurement of a patient's immunological response to its presence. Aelan plans to initiate additional clinical studies for these novel diagnostic tests in the future. ""Together with other proprietary components developed by Aelan, the licensed biomarker is used in one of our novel and proprietary serological ELISA diagnostic tests intended for confirmatory diagnostics and potentially screening for early onset Alzheimer's disease in the elderly population,"" said Victoria Lunyak, Ph.D. ""We have presented our early results during the Third International European Neurodegenerative Disease, Brain mapping and Optogenetics Meeting at University of Cambridge in 2015.""

""Aelan's strategy is to maximize value for our diagnostic products with a commitment to demonstrate sound scientific evidence of clinical utility and health-economic benefit. This license from the Buck Institute is incremental to the strong IP landscape we have built over the past year by developing affordable and reliable diagnostics for the unmet medical needs in this sector,"" adds Dr. Lunyak. ""There is an opportunity for Aelan's products to address a large unmet need for early diagnosis of AD and companion diagnostics for AD therapeutics. A non-invasive diagnostic test for AD that could aid in stratifying patients that could benefit from targeted drug therapy has the potential to become a blockbuster product which could ignite the pharmaceutical and IVD markets,"" said Chester Aldridge, CEO of US Equity Holdings and Chair of Aelan's Board of Directors. Currently, there are no biological markers available that enable preclinical detection or definitive premorbid diagnosis of AD. Worldwide, nearly 44 million people have Alzheimer's or a related dementia and only 1-in-4 people with Alzheimer's disease have been diagnosed (Alzheimer's Disease International). According to the American Association of Alzheimer's Disease, every 66 seconds someone in the United States develops AD and more than 5 million Americans are living the disease. AD is one of the costliest chronic diseases to society. In 2015, AD and other forms of dementia cost the nation $236 billion. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and it's the only cause of death in the Top 10 in America that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed with currently available therapies. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths attributed to Alzheimer's Disease increased 71 percent. By 2050, the projected cost to the nation could rise as high as $1.1 trillion. This dramatic spike includes a five-fold increase in government spending under Medicare and Medicaid and a nearly five-fold increase in out-of-pocket spending.

Such combinations are expected to kill cancer cells, which have mutations, but not healthy cells, which do not. The study, published in Molecular Cell, uncovere d 172 new combinations that could form the basis for future cancer therapies.  Oncologists here at Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health and elsewhere can often personalize cancer therapy based on an individual patient s unique cancer mutations,  said senior author Trey Ideker, PhD, professor of genetics and bioengineering at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Jacobs School of Engineering.  But the vast majority of mutations are not actionable   that is, knowing a patient has a particular mutation doesn t mean there s an available therapy that targets it. The goal of this study was to expand the number of mutations we can pair with a precision therapy.  Most cancers have gene mutations that do one of two things   promote cell growth or prevent cell death. The first type is the target of many therapies, which inhibit cell growth. But it s much harder to develop therapies that restore malfunctioning genes that should be triggering cell death in abnormal cells, known as tumor-suppressor genes. Rather than target a tumor-suppressor gene directly, Ideker and team took the approach of identifying genetic interactions between a tumor suppressor gene and another gene, such that simultaneous disruption of both genes selectively kills cancer cells. The researchers first used yeast to quickly and cheaply screen 169,000 interactions between yeast versions of human tumor-suppressor genes and genes that can be inhibited with drugs, sometimes called  druggable  targets. To do this, they deleted each gene one at a time, in combination with another mutation. Those experiments whittled down the best combinations   those lethal to the yeast cells   to a few thousand. Next the team prioritized 21 drugs for which the yeast druggable targets were involved in the greatest number of cell-lethal interactions. They tested these drugs one at a time for lethal interaction with 112 different tumor-suppressor gene mutations in human cancer cells growing in the lab. The researchers ended up with 172 drug-gene mutation combinations that successfully killed both yeast and human cancer cells. Of these combinations, 158 had not been previously discovered.Here s one example of how this information might be useful for doctors and patients: Irinotecan is a drug only indicated by the FDA for use in colon cancer. But this study suggests that this class of drugs should be evaluated for efficacy in any tumor with a mutation that inhibits RAD17, a tumor-suppressor gene that normally helps cells fix damaged DNA. The next steps will be to test these combinations in more human cancer cell types and eventually in mouse models. But 172 combinations is a lot, more than a single lab can test, the researchers say. They hope other research teams will also take their list and further test each combination in a variety of conditions. To help spread this information to scientists around the world, all of the data from this study has been made freely available on NDEx, a new network data-sharing resource developed by Ideker and UC San Diego School of Medicine data scientist Dexter Pratt.  We ve created an important translational research resource for other scientists and oncologists,  said co-first author John Paul Shen, MD, clinical instructor and postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center.  And since many of the cancer-killing interactions we discovered involve already FDA-approved drugs, it may mean they could reach clinical translation rapidly. If these results are validated in subsequent testing, in the future an oncologist will have many more options for precision cancer therapy.

In a series of experiments at the University at Buffalo (UB), the gene kicked into action dormant cellular processes that are key to preventing weak bones, clogged arteries and other telltale signs of growing old. See Also: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells The findings, published in the journal Stem Cells, also show promise in counteracting premature aging disorders such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. ""Our research into Nanog is helping us to better understand the process of aging and ultimately how to reverse it,"" says Stelios T. Andreadis, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the UB School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the study's lead author. Additional authors come from UB's Department of Biomedical Engineering, a joint program between UB's engineering school and the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB, and the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo. To battle aging, the human body holds a reservoir of nonspecialized cells that can regenerate organs. These cells are called adult stem cells, and they are located in every tissue of the body and respond rapidly when there is a need. But as people age, fewer adult stem cells perform their job well, a scenario which leads to age-related disorders. Reversing the effects of aging on adult stem cells, essentially rebooting them, can help overcome this problem. Andreadis previously showed that the capacity of adult stem cells to form muscle and generate force declines with aging. Specifically, he examined a subcategory of muscle cells called smooth muscle cells which reside in arteries, intestines and other tissues. In the new study, Panagiotis Mistriotis, a graduate student in Andreadis' lab and first author of the study, introduced Nanog into aged stem cells. He found that Nanog opens two key cellular pathways: Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and Transforming growth factor beta (TGF- ). In turn, this jumpstarts dormant proteins (actin) into building cytoskeletons that adult stem cells need to form muscle cells that contract. Force generated by these cells ultimately helps restore the regenerative properties that adult stem cells lose due to aging. ""Not only does Nanog have the capacity to delay aging, it has the potential in some cases to reverse it,"" says Andreadis, noting that the embryonic stem cell gene worked in three different models of aging: cells isolated from aged donors, cells aged in culture, and cells isolated from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Learn More: Stem cells in the brain: Limited self-renewal Additionally, the researchers showed that Nanog activated the central regulator of muscle formation, serum response factor (SRF), suggesting that the same results may be applicable for skeletal, cardiac and other muscle types. The researchers are now focusing on identifying drugs that can replace or mimic the effects of NANOG. This will allow them to study whether aspects of aging inside the body can also be reversed.

One of the challenges to early detection of ASD is to find ways to identify children at risk for the disorder sooner and in children with speech delays. Some of the earliest and consistent signs of ASD involve auditory communication, however, most tests rely on speech, and are often ineffective in children who are very young or who have communication delays. Learn More: Brainwave test could improve autism diagnosis and classification In the new study, researchers used a technique that measures what are called otoacoustic emissions. The test is akin to the screening that many newborns must undergo before leaving the hospital to check for hearing problems. Using miniature speaker/microphone earplugs, the researchers were able to measure hearing deficiencies by listening for signs that the ear is having difficulty processing sounds. Specifically, the device's highly sensitive microphone can detect minute sound emission made by inner ear outer hair cells in response to certain tones or clicking sounds. If these cells are not functioning properly, the device fails to detect an emission which indicates that inner ear (or cochlear) function is impaired. The researchers tested the hearing of children between the ages of 6 and 17, roughly half of whom have been diagnosed with ASD. They found that the children with ASD had hearing difficultly in a specific frequency (1-2 kHz) that is important for processing speech. They also found a correlation between the degree of cochlear impairment and the severity of ASD symptoms.

See Also: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? Previous studies have shown that poor physical performance is linked to increased odds for dementia in people younger than 85. But until now, we didn't know whether a link between poor physical performance and dementia existed for people 90 and older. The researchers examined 578 people aged 90 and older who were participants in The 90+ Study, a community-based longitudinal study a research method that follows the same subjects repeatedly over a period of time of the oldest-old in Southern California. Examiners see the participants every six months to conduct physical and neurological examinations as well as cognitive tests, with the goal of looking critically at aging and dementia specifically. At the start of the study, about 50 percent of the participants were cognitively impaired (had trouble thinking or remembering), but did not have dementia. The rest were cognitively normal. Researchers followed the participants for 2.6 years and, during that time, almost 40 percent of participants developed dementia. The researchers observed a unique link between dementia risk and poor performance on two different physical performance tests: the standing balance test and the four-meter (about 13 feet) walking test.

In this study, EVK-001, the Company's patented nasal delivery formulation of metoclopramide for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adult women, did not achieve its primary endpoint of symptom improvement at Week 4. Preliminary review of topline data across all study sites revealed similar improvement in the EVK-001 and placebo groups at Week 4 as measured by the total symptom score as well as the individual scores for each of the signs and symptoms, but these results were not consistent across the study sites. Further evaluation of topline data revealed diary data from 28 of 41 of the enrolling sites showed a statistically-significant benefit at Week 4 for EVK 001 (p=0.006) in contrast to results from the other 13 sites that showed statistically significant benefit for placebo (p=0.002). Once the complete datasets and PK data are available, additional analyses will be conducted to further understand the discrepant results. Safety results were consistent with findings from previous EVK-001 studies that showed the nasal formulation of metoclopramide has a favorable safety profile and is well-tolerated by healthy volunteers and patients with diabetic gastroparesis. In this Phase 3 study, there were slightly more reports of nasal irritation in subjects receiving placebo than in subjects receiving EVK-001. The study was a U.S.-based, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and population pharmacokinetics (PK) of EVK-001 in 205 adult female subjects with diabetic gastroparesis who received EVK-001 or placebo four times daily for four weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in symptoms from the baseline period to Week 4 as measured using a proprietary Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument. The PRO was used to calculate a weekly score based on daily telephone diary entries by study subjects who reported the frequency and severity of their gastroparesis signs and symptoms. ""The topline results are unexpected and an anomaly, given that metoclopramide has been approved and used for treating diabetic gastroparesis for more than 35 years.

The grant supports the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative, which brings the power of genomics and big-data analytics to bear on the challenge of finding effective treatments for children with cancer. Genomic analysis of tumor cells can reveal the genetic errors driving an individual patient s cancer, and doctors can use that information to design targeted therapies. To realize the full potential of cancer genomics, however, the information from an individual patient must be compared against data from a large number of other cases. This is problematic for childhood cancers, which are relatively rare, making it difficult to assemble large cohorts to study. The Treehouse Initiative was established to enable the sharing of pediatric cancer data so that each patient s data can be analyzed in the context of large datasets of both pediatric and adult cancers.  Genomic medicine requires massive data sharing and analysis, and that is the emphasis of the Treehouse Initiative,  said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the Genomics Institute at UC Santa Cruz.  It is only by sharing data that we can deploy genomic insights to their full potential in pediatric cancer and other diseases.  Clinical partners With the new funding from St. Baldrick s, UC Santa Cruz will work with six clinical partners that have agreed to share and jointly analyze data from pediatric patients enrolled in genomic medicine clinical trials: Children s Hospital of Orange County; Stanford University; Pacific Pediatric NeuroOncology Consortium; the Pediatric Personalized Oncogenomics Program of British Columbia; Peds Mi-OncoSeq Program at the University of Michigan Cancer Center; and Molecular Guided Therapy in Neuroblastoma at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia. The Treehouse Initiative will perform a massive comparison of each child s cancer data and cross-reference it with more than 10,000 tumors from previous genomics projects. This huge comparison, known as pan-cancer analysis, uses big data to reveal how genomic aberrations drive cancer. The Treehouse Initiative s comparative approach enables researchers to find hidden causes of cancer in individual patients, including targetable drivers of the cancer that may be missed when analyzing each patient s data in isolation. This approach can suggest new precision treatments for patients whose cancer has not responded to standard therapies. Through this new effort over the next five years funded by St. Baldrick s, the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative will aim to at least double the number of pediatric patients whose cancers are treated based on insights derived from genomic sequencing. The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has long been a leader in open-source, big-data genomics, and the Treehouse Initiative is bringing a new level of real-time data sharing and analysis to pediatric cancer genomics. Pilot project A Treehouse pilot project, the California Kids Cancer Comparison Initiative, has already shown that this approach can benefit children with cancer.  Our analysis has revealed new therapeutic options for patients being treated in the clinic today. By looking at each child in the context of tens of thousands of other cases, we are demonstrating the clinical utility of data sharing and cross-tumor comparisons,  said Treehouse cofounder Olena Morozova, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute. By sharing data, the Treehouse Initiative allows each patient to immediately benefit from what is learned in other cases. Families are eager to participate, Haussler said. Pediatric cancer is a struggle for every family it touches, and the Treehouse Initiative will work to turn these struggles into meaningful clinical insights that will help everyone faced with childhood cancer.","Published: July 25, 2016"

The discovery will help guide development of a universal influenza vaccine, according to investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), which are both a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and collaborators who conducted the research. The findings appear in the July 21st online edition of Cell. The seasonal influenza vaccine must be updated each year because flu viruses mutate. However, the stem region of the virus typically remains unchanged, making it an ideal target for antibodies induced by a universal flu vaccine. Such a vaccine would be effective against multiple subtypes of influenza and therefore would eliminate the need to update the vaccine each year. Until now, scientists had only identified broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the flu virus stem in humans following natural infection. The new research provides clear evidence that these antibodies can be induced by a vaccine. The investigators examined blood samples from six people who had received a vaccine against H5N1 influenza, commonly known as the bird flu virus. In the blood samples they identified B cells (a type of white blood cell that responds to infection by secreting antibodies) that reacted to various subtypes of influenza virus, and then characterized and classified the cells  antibody genetic sequences. The scientists discovered the B cells encoded three classes of antibodies seen among multiple participants that can neutralize diverse influenza virus subtypes and, therefore, could form the basis of a universal flu vaccine. Researchers can now use the B cell sequencing information they identified to quickly and accurately measure immune responses among participants in future influenza vaccine trials, according to the authors.","Published: July 25, 2016"

The designed structures are made of two different engineered proteins, present in 60 copies each, which self-assemble into icosahedra. They have a wide variety of potential applications, from targeted drug delivery to the development of more effective vaccines, the researchers say.   The findings, reported in Science, follow a report in Nature last month by the same team describing the creation of the first designed icosahedron made of 60 copies of a single protein subunit. The current paper describes the design and construction of 10 icosahedra from two different protein subunits.  The remarkable thing is that the computational design model is really close to the actual structure,  said HHMI Investigator David Baker of the University of Washington Institute for Protein Design, who led the study.  These are definitely the largest structures that have been created using computational design methods   so it s a real milestone for protein design, because we can design these really complicated structures from scratch on the computer and they come out exactly right.    Graduate student Jacob Bale working with Baker and Neil King, an acting assistant professor at the Institute for Protein Design, used Rosetta, a protein-design computer program developed in Baker s lab over many years, to optimize amino acid residues that form the interface between proteins to make them fit with each other.  You want to design proteins so that when they come together, the interactions cause the proteins to form an icosahedron,  explained Baker. Because the work is so computationally intensive, the researchers relied on a crowd-sourcing platform called Rosetta@home, which allows members of the public to donate cycles of their idle computers to run jobs for computing protein structures. Once the researchers had created designs that the computer predicted would form icosahedra, the next step was to test out the designs. Bale engineered synthetic genes that encoded the designed proteins and introduced those genes into bacteria. He purified the proteins from the bacteria and developed new screening methods to determine which ones were forming icosahedra. Once the putative icosahedra were identified, the researchers needed to characterize the structures to verify whether they matched the predictions. Through the Visiting Scientist Program at HHMI s Janelia Research Campus, Shane Gonen, a graduate student in Baker s lab, came to his brother Tamir Gonen s lab at Janelia to use the cryo-electron microscope (cryo-EM), and they were able to confirm that the designs came out very close to predictions from the computational models.  Any scientist from anywhere in the world, if they have a collaboration with someone at Janelia, can apply for a visitor project, and the scientist will be able to come here for up to a year and live on campus and do research at Janelia,  said Gonen.  The vast majority of my collaborators actually come in through the visitor program. It just makes things a lot easier,  he added. The researchers envision that the icosahedra they designed could be used for many applications: to package a chemotherapy agent to deliver it to a specific organ, or to design more effective vaccines, which produce a stronger immune response if the immunogen is presented in a form that makes it look like a virus, Baker explained.  Although viral capsids have been used for targeted drug delivery and as a vaccine platform, they didn t evolve for that,  said Baker.  As we pursue applications, we can design protein structures specifically for that application, so you don t get a lot of evolutionary baggage, of things evolving for one reason and then trying to adapt them for a new purpose,  he explained. In addition to pursuing applications, future work will focus on designing  more dynamic structures that undergo structural transitions in response to environmental changes,  he said.","Published: July 25, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/disrupting-tumourpromotion-in-humans-192567,Disrupting Tumour Promotion in Humans  Researchers have modified an existing protein to represses a specific cancer promoting  message  within cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Over a century of research has shined light on the once-murky innards of our cells, from the genes that serve as our  blueprints  to the proteins and other molecules that are our cellular taskmasters. Building on this basic knowledge, the search is underway for cellular mechanisms that could serve as gateways for new therapies. These could lead to precise treatments for disease   targeting a specific cellular function or gene with fewer unintended side effects. Ideally, these effects would also be temporary, returning cells to normal operation once the underlying condition has been treated. A team of researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Trento in Italy announced findings that could pave the way for these therapies. In a paper published July 18 in Nature Chemical Biology, they unveiled an engineered protein that they designed to repress a specific cancer-promoting message within cells. And that approach to protein design could be modified to target other cellular messages and functions, said senior author and UW chemistry professor Gabriele Varani.  What we show here is a proving ground   a process to determine how to make the correct changes to proteins,  he said. For their approach, Varani and his team modified a human protein called Rbfox2, which occurs naturally in cells and binds to microRNAs. These aptly named small RNA molecules adjust gene expression levels in cells like a dimmer switch. Varani s group sought to engineer Rbfox2 to bind itself to a specific microRNA called miR-21, which is present in high levels in many tumours, increases the expression of cancer-promoting genes and decreases cancer suppressors. If a protein like Rbfox2 could bind to miR-21, the researchers hypothesized, it could repress miR-21 s tumour growth effects. But for this approach to be successful, the protein must bind to miR-21 and no other microRNA. Luckily, all RNA molecules, including microRNAs, have an inherent property that imbues them with specificity. They consist of a chain of chemical  letters,  each with a unique order or sequence. To date, no other research team had ever successfully altered a protein to bind to microRNAs.  That is because our knowledge of protein structure is much better than our knowledge of RNA structure,  said Varani.  We historically lacked key information about how RNA folds up and how proteins bind RNA at the atomic level.  UW researchers relied on high-quality data on Rbfox2 s structure to understand, down to single atoms, how it binds to the unique sequence of  letters  in its natural RNA targets. Then they predicted how Rbfox2 s sequence would have to change to make it bind to miR-21 instead. Elegantly, altering just four carefully selected amino acids made Rbfox2 shift its attachment preference to miR-21, preventing the microRNA from passing along its tumour-promoting message. The UW team spent several years proving this, since they had to test each change individually and in combination. They also had to make sure that the modified Rbfox2 protein would bind strongly to miR-21 but not other microRNAs. Since microRNAs have many functions in cells, it would be counterproductive to repress miR-21 while disrupting other normal microRNA-mediated functions. The researchers also engineered a second protein that should clear miR-21 from cells entirely. They did this by grafting the regions of Rbfox2 that bound to miR-21 onto a separate protein called Dicer. Dicer normally chops RNAs into small chunks and generates functional microRNAs. But the hybrid Rbfox2-Dicer protein displayed a specific affinity to slice miR-21 into oblivion.Varani and his team believe that Rbfox2 could be redesigned to bind to microRNA targets other than miR-21. There are thousands of microRNAs to choose from, and many have been implicated in diseases. The key to realizing this potential would be in streamlining and automating the painstaking methods the team used to model Rbfox2 s atomic-level interactions with RNA.  This method relies on knowledge of high-quality structures,  said Varani.  That allowed us to see which alterations would change binding to the microRNA target.  Not only would these be useful laboratory tools to study microRNA functions, but they could   in time   form the basis of new therapies to treat disease.","Published: July 25, 2016"

It is proteins that do the work in the body: Haemoglobin, for example, holds oxygen for transport in the blood stream, while insulin helps regulate sugar in the blood. Knowing which protein forms are present in what quantities, their subcellular location and their function is critical to understanding health and disease. The scientific technique of mass spectrometry, or mass spec, can already recognize proteins, but the researchers are eying a speed-up akin to that which revolutionized genetics research over the past 20 years. Genes are vital carriers of information and templates for proteins, says co-investigator David Pagliarini, a UW Madison professor of biochemistry. But genes alone don t explain everything.  There is lot of action between the gene, the protein it patterns, and the actual biological result,  he explains.  Mass spec technology allows you to measure the proteins, which are closer to action, and we plan to push the limits on pace, depth, throughput.  The centre, funded at $6 million by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), will develop and make available advanced protein measurement technologies; says Josh Coon, a UW Madison professor of biomolecular chemistry and an expert in mass spec.  These are complicated, high-end instruments that hundreds or thousands of biomedical researchers who are funded by the NIH need access to. There are many problems that are not solved with current technology, and that high-throughput mass spec can address.  Two among the many areas of interest concern lung cancer and diabetes, Coon says.  We have researchers who want to examine proteins related to the function   or failure   of the pancreatic cells that make insulin.  The centre will serve as a training ground in mass spec and a laboratory to invent new techniques and equipment. One tactic to be explored relies on parallel processing, an approach like the one that fed a revolution in gene sequencing. Co-investigator Lingjun Li, a UW Madison professor of pharmacy, will develop chemical markers to identify individual samples after they are mixed for mass spec analysis. In a similar vein, Coon will explore  metabolic tags  composed of amino acids that enter proteins after being eaten by lab animals.  We are not developing technology in a vacuum,  says Li,  but with specific biomedical needs in mind. Our methods will be broadly available to NIH researchers, and they will be the test bed that validates our methods.  Pagliarini says he will serve as  a bridge between technology development and biological applications. Our future collaborators have told us there are certain problems out there waiting for a solution in new technology.   The NIH wants the centre to invent and disseminate technologies,  says Coon.  We hope to do for proteins what high-throughput sequencing has done for genomic studies. ","Published: July 25, 2016"

Over one million men and women are living with colorectal cancer in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates 4.5% of all men and women will be diagnosed with the cancer during their lifetime, making it the third most common non-skin cancer. In the study published online in Nature Communications, researchers showed how certain colorectal cancer cells reprogram their metabolism using glutamine, a non-essential amino acid. Many cancer cells rely on glutamine to survive. How they become so dependent on the molecule is hotly debated in the field. Researchers studied a subset of colorectal cancer cells containing a genetic mutation called PIK3CA. This mutation is located in a gene critical for cell division and movement, and is found in approximately one third of all colorectal cancers. The mutation is also the most commonly identified genetic mutation across all cancers, making the results of the study universally appealing. Researchers were interested in determining whether or not the common PIK3CA mutation contributes to changes in cancer cell metabolism, such as how nutrients like glutamine are processed. Normally, glutamine is broken down by cancer cells into several other molecules with the help of specific enzymes. This complicated system helps produce adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of all cells, and other molecules critical for colorectal cancer cell growth. The researchers found that colorectal cells with the PIK3CA mutation broke down significantly more glutamine than cells without the mutation. The researchers identified several enzymes involved in the process that are more active in the mutant cancer cells than in other cell types, explaining the increased need for glutamine. These enzymes become overactive in the mutant cancer cells due to a cascade of signals led by the protein encoded by mutant PIK3CA gene. This finding represents a novel and important link between the common PIK3CA mutation and altered glutamine metabolism in cancer cells. Zhenghe John Wang, PhD, professor of genetics and genome sciences and co-leader of the Cancer Genetics Program at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine helped lead the study.  In layman's terms, we discovered that colon cancers with PIK3CA oncogenic mutations are addicted to glutamine, a particular nutrient for cancer cells. We also demonstrated that these cancers can be starved to death by depriving glutamine with drugs.  When the researchers lowered the amount of glutamine available to mutant cancer cells growing in laboratory dishes, the cancer cells died. This discovery led the team to investigate the effects of blocking glutamine availability in mice with colorectal cancer tumours containing the common PIK3CA mutation. Wang and colleagues found that exposing these mice to a compound that blocks glutamine metabolism consistently suppressed tumour growth. They did not observe the same effect on tumours without the mutation. Together, these results provide a promising new therapeutic avenue to suppress growth of colorectal tumours with the PIK3CA mutation. The researchers have filed a patent application based on the unique mechanism of tumour suppression they have identified and the work is available for licensing.  This study provides the basis for a colon cancer treatment clinical trial that will be started in the summer at the University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center,  according to Neal Meropol, MD, Dr. Lester E. Coleman, Jr. Professor of Cancer Research and Therapeutics, chief of the division of haematology and oncology, and principal investigator for the trial. The phase I/II study will test the effects of a glutamine metabolism inhibitor in patients with advanced colorectal tumours.","Published: July 25, 2016"

The drugs in this study are opioids, benzodiazepines, tryclyclic antidepressants and muscle relaxants. These include the two most highly prescribed pain drugs   hydrocodone and oxycodone. A genetic mutation in the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which reside in the liver, can lead to increased side effects or reduced therapeutic benefits for these drugs. The availability of information about a patient's genetic metabolic status can help physicians reduce adverse drug events and prescribe more effectively. Currently, the only way to identify patients with the mutation is through expensive pharmacogenomics testing, which is often not reimbursed. Many insurance providers, including Medicare, have been reluctant to support this pharmacogenetic testing as a screening technique, because only about 10 percent of the population has the mutation. The SPHERE Registry offers a cost-effective solution, using information from a routine urine drug test to screen for patients who would likely benefit from DNA tests. The study is currently enrolling 14,000 patients from 200 sites throughout the country. Physicians who prescribe medications on the list may enroll patients in the study and receive an honorarium of $50 for every patient who completes the 90-day trial. Qualifying patients will receive a free genetic test.  The SPHERE Registry uses biomarkers measured in a routine urine drug test (UDT) to identify patients who may have the genetic factors for abnormal drug metabolism and are therefore good candidates for genetic testing. Utilizing a routine UDT as a screening tool reduces the number of unnecessary genetic tests and saves the healthcare system money. UDT is already considered the standard of care for assessing compliance or potential abuse in patients who are prescribed controlled substances for more than 90. ""Participation in this clinical trial is a way for physicians to be a part of cutting-edge research and have an impact on how medications are prescribed,"" said Sky Countryman, CEO of InSource Diagnostics. ""This study will be of great interest to physicians in pain management, psychiatry, general and family practice, internal medicine, addiction and rheumatology.""","Published: July 25, 2016"

The ability to make pure populations of these cells within days rather than the weeks or months previously required is a key step toward clinically useful regenerative medicine   potentially allowing researchers to generate new beating heart cells to repair damage after a heart attack or to create cartilage or bone to reinvigorate creaky joints or heal from trauma. The study also highlights key, but short-lived, patterns of gene expression that occur during human embryo segmentation and confirms that human development appears to rely on processes that are evolutionarily conserved among many animals. These insights may also lead to a better understanding of how congenital defects occur.  Regenerative medicine relies on the ability to turn pluripotent human stem cells into specialized tissue stem cells that can engraft and function in patients,  said Irving Weissman, MD, the director of Stanford s Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and also of its Ludwig Cancer Center.  It took us years to be able to isolate blood-forming and brain-forming stem cells. Here we used our knowledge of the developmental biology of many other animal models to provide the positive and negative signaling factors to guide the developmental choices of these tissue and organ stem cells. Within five to nine days we can generate virtually all the pure cell populations that we need. Weissman and Lay Teng Ang, of the Genome Institute of Singapore, are the senior authors of the study, published July 7 in Cell. Graduate student Kyle Loh and research assistant Angela Chen, both at Stanford, share lead authorship of the study. Unraveling the mysteriesEmbryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they can become any type of cell in the body. They do so by responding to a variety of time- and location-specific cues within the developing embryo that direct them to become specific cell types. Researchers have learned a lot about how this process is controlled in animals, including fish, mice and frogs. In contrast to many other animals, human embryonic development is a mysterious process, particularly in the first weeks after conception. This is because cultivating a human embryo for longer than 14 days is banned by many countries and scientific societies. But we do know that, like other animals, the human embryo in its earliest stages consists of three main components known as germ layers: the ectoderm, the endoderm and the mesoderm. Each of these germ layers is responsible for generating certain cell types as the embryo develops. The mesoderm, for example, gives rise to key cell types, including cardiac and skeletal muscle, connective tissue, bone, blood vessels, blood cells, cartilage and portions of the kidneys and skin.  The ability to generate pure populations of these cell types is very important for any kind of clinically important regenerative medicine,  said Loh,  as well as to develop a basic road map of human embryonic development. Previously, making these cell types took weeks to months, primarily because it wasn t possible to accurately control cell fate. As a result, researchers would end up with a hodgepodge of cell types.  Loh and Chen wanted to know what signals drive the formation of each of the mesodermally derived cell types. To do so, they started with a human embryonic stem cell line, which they chemically nudged to become cells that form what s known as the primitive streak on the hollow ball of cells of the early embryo. They then experimented with varying combinations of well-known signaling molecules, including WNT, BMP and Hedgehog, as a way to coax these cells to become ever-more-specialized precursor cells. A yes-and-no strategyThey learned that often the cells progressed down the developmental path through a series of consecutive choices between two possible options. Think about the carnival game in which a disc is dropped down a slanted, peg-studded board to land in one of several cups at the bottom. The eventual destination is determined by whether the disc goes to the left or right of each consecutive peg. The quickest, most efficient way to micromanage the cells  developmental decisions was to apply a simultaneous combination of factors that both encouraged the differentiation into one lineage while also actively blocking the cells from a different fate   a kind of  yes  and  no  strategy. For example, cells in the primitive streak can become either endoderm or one of two types of mesoderm. Inhibiting the activity of a signaling molecule called TGF beta drives the cells to a mesodermal fate. Adding a signaling molecule called WNT, while also blocking the activity of another molecule known as BMP, promotes differentiation into one kind of mesoderm; conversely, adding BMP while blocking WNT drives the cells to instead become the other type of mesoderm.  We learned during this process that it is equally important to understand how unwanted cell types develop and find a way to block that process while encouraging the developmental path we do want,  said Loh. By carefully guiding the cells  choices at each fork in the road, Loh and Chen were able to generate bone cell precursors that formed human bone when transplanted into laboratory mice and beating heart muscle cells, as well as 10 other mesodermal-derived cell lineages. At each developmental stage, the researchers conducted single-cell RNA sequencing to identify unique gene expression patterns and assess the purity of individual cell populations. By looking at the gene expression profile in single cells, the researchers were able to identify previously unknown transient states that typified the progression from precursor to more-specialized cells. Segmentation in embryo developmentIn particular they observed for the first time a transient pulse of gene expression that precedes the segmentation of the human embryo into discrete parts that will become the head, trunk and limbs of the body. The process mirrors what is known to occur in other animals, and confirms that the segmentation process in human development has been evolutionarily conserved.  The segmentation of the embryo is a fundamental step in human development,  said Loh.  Now we can see that, evolutionarily, it s a very conserved process.  Understanding when and how segmentation and other key developmental steps occur could provide important clues as to how congenital birth defects arise when these steps go awry. The ability to quickly generate purified populations of specialized precursor cells has opened new doors to further study.  Next, we d like to show that these different human progenitor cells can regenerate their respective tissues and perhaps even ameliorate disease in animal models,  said Loh.

The findings, published in Cancer Immunology Research, could inform the development of future immunotherapies treatments that enhance the immune system s ability to kill tumors.  By analyzing a large public genomic database, we found 122 potential immune response drivers genetic regions in which mutations correlate with the presence or absence of immune cells infiltrating the tumors,  said lead author Eduard Porta-Pardo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at SBP.  While several of these correspond to proteins with known roles in immune response, many others offer new directions for cancer immunology research, which could point to new targets for immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy has been heralded as a turning point in cancer because it can treat even advanced cases that have spread to other organs. Several drugs in this class are now widely used and often lead to remarkable success, eradicating or dramatically shrinking tumors and preventing recurrence. Most current immunotherapies rely on a similar strategy releasing the brakes on the immune system. These treatments are powerful if the tumor is recognized by the immune system as a threat and allows immune cell infiltration, but some cancers remain undercover or block immune cell entry into the tumor in as yet unknown ways.  To develop immunotherapies that are relevant to a wide range of cancers, we need to know a lot more about how the immune system interacts with tumors,  said Adam Godzik, Ph.D., professor and director of the Bioinformatics and Structural Biology Program and senior author of the study.  Our study provides many new leads for this endeavor.   We are exploring cancer mutations at fine resolution by accounting for the fact that mutations can affect the encoded protein in different ways depending on where the resulting change is located,  commented Porta-Pardo.  Our algorithm, domainXplorer, identifies correlations between a phenotype, in this case the amount of immune cells in the tumor, and mutations in individual protein domains parts of a protein with distinct functions.  This work emphasizes the value of open data,  Godzik added.  Because we could access genomic data from over 5,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we could jump straight to analysis without having to set up a big collaborative network to gather and sequence so many samples.   Our plan for the next phase of this research is to use this algorithm to search for genetic regions correlating with the levels of specific immune cell types within the tumor, which will reveal further details of cancer immunology.

They have also developed software that automatically detects the  fingerprint  of each of these areas in an individual s brain scans. Funded by the National Institutes of Health through its Human Connectome Project (HCP), this software correctly mapped the areas by incorporating data from multiple non-invasive brain imaging measures that corroborated each other.  These new insights and tools should help to explain how our cortex evolved and the roles of its specialized areas in health and disease, and could eventually hold promise for unprecedented precision in brain surgery and clinical work-ups,  said Bruce Cuthbert, Ph.D., acting director of NIH s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which co-funded the research as part of the HCP. The new study identified   with a nearly 97 percent detection rate   97 new cortex areas per hemisphere, in addition to confirming 83 that were previously known. NIMH grantees David Van Essen, Ph.D., and Matthew Glasser, Ph.D., of Washington University in St. Louis, and colleagues at six other researcher centers, report on their discoveries July 20, 2016 in the journal Nature. Earlier studies of cortex organization often used just one measure, such as examining postmortem tissue with a microscope. Uncertain delineation of cortex areas has sometimes led to shaky comparability of brain imaging findings.  The situation is analogous to astronomy where ground-based telescopes produced relatively blurry images of the sky before the advent of adaptive optics and space telescopes,  noted Glasser, lead author of the study. The HCP team set out to banish this blurriness by using multiple, precisely aligned, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities to measure cortical architecture, activity, connectivity, and topography in a group of 210 healthy participants. These measures   including cortex thickness, cortex myelin content, task and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)   cross-validated each other. The findings were, in turn, confirmed in an additional independent sample of 210 healthy participants. Even though some cortex areas turned out to be atypically located in a small minority of subjects, the data-derived algorithms incorporated into the software were able to successfully map them. While the study included fMRI scans of subjects performing tasks, the researchers determined that resting-state MRI techniques should suffice to map the areas in future studies using the tools they developed. Some areas may turn out to have further subdivisions or be subunits of other areas, in light of new data, noted senior author Van Essen.  The ability to discriminate individual differences in the location, size, and topology of cortical areas from differences in their activity or connectivity should facilitate understanding of how each property is related to behavior and genetic underpinnings,  added Glasser. The automated  areal classifier  and related tools are being shared with the research community via HCP websites (link is external). In addition, the extensively analyzed data underlying each of the published figures can be accessed via an NIH-funded database developed in the Van Essen laboratory. The HCP is a project of the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. This collaborative framework includes the NIH Office of the Director and 15 NIH Institutes and Centers that support research on the nervous system. By pooling resources and expertise, Blueprint identifies cross-cutting areas of research, and confronts challenges too large for any single institute or center.","Published: July 23, 2016"

The findings, published online in Scientific Reports, were lead by Nicolas Bazan, MD, PhD, Boyd Professor and Director of Louisiana State University (LSU) Health New Orleans' Neuroscience Center of Excellence. In this study in an experimental model of epilepsy in mice, the compounds prevented seizures and their damaging effects on dendritic spines that allow brain cells to communicate. In epilepsy, these structures are damaged and rewire incorrectly, creating brain circuits that are hyper-connected and prone to seizures, an important example of pathological plasticity. See Also: MRI-guided laser procedure provides alternative to epilepsy surgery ""In the current study, preservation of dendritic spines and subsequent protection from seizures, were observed up to 100 days post-treatment, suggesting the process of epilepsy development has been arrested,"" notes Dr. Nicolas Bazan, Director of the LSU Health New Orleans Neuroscience Center of Excellence. Dr. Bazan and Professor Julio Alvarez-Builla Gomez, a medicinal chemist from the University of Alcala in Spain, discovered and patented the LAU compounds, named for the inventors in Louisiana and the Spanish university. A number of LAU compounds were studied in this research, which blocked a neuroinflammatory signaling receptor, protecting dendritic spines and lessening seizure susceptibility and onset, as well as hyper-excitability. According to the National Institutes of Health (U.S.), the epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can lead to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. There is currently no cure.

Pahan a researcher at Rush University and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago, has found that cinnamon turns poor learners into good ones among mice, that is. He hopes the same will hold true for people. See Also: How older people learnHis group published their latest findings in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology. ""The increase in learning in poor-learning mice after cinnamon treatment was significant,"" says Pahan. ""For example, poor-learning mice took about 150 seconds to find the right hole in the Barnes maze test. On the other hand, after one month of cinnamon treatment, poor-learning mice were finding the right hole within 60 seconds."" Pahan's research shows that the effect appears to be due mainly to sodium benzoate a chemical produced as cinnamon is broken down in the body. If that chemical sounds familiar, you may have noticed it on the ingredient labels of many processed foods. Food makers use a synthetic form of it as a preservative. It is also an FDA-approved drug used to treat hyperammonemia too much ammonia in the blood. Though some health concerns exist regarding sodium benzoate, most experts agree it's perfectly safe in the amounts generally consumed. One reassuring point is that it's water-soluble and easily excreted in the urine. Cinnamon acts as a slow-release form of sodium benzoate, says Pahan. His lab studies show that different compounds within cinnamon including cinnamaldehyde, which gives the spice is distinctive flavor and aroma are ""metabolized into sodium benzoate in the liver. Sodium benzoate then becomes the active compound, which readily enters the brain and stimulates hippocampal plasticity."" Those changes in the hippocampus the brain's main memory center appear to be the mechanism by which cinnamon and sodium benzoate exert their benefits. Learn More: Specific gene linked to adult growth of brain cells, learning and memory In their study, Pahan's group first tested mice in mazes to separate the good and poor learners. Good learners made fewer wrong turns and took less time to find food. In analyzing baseline disparities between the good and poor learners, Pahan's team found differences in two brain proteins. The gap was all but erased when cinnamon was given. ""Little is known about the changes that occur in the brains of poor learners,"" says Pahan. ""We saw increases in GABRA5 and a decrease in CREB in the hippocampus of poor learners. Interestingly, these particular changes were reversed by one month of cinnamon treatment."" The researchers also examined brain cells taken from the mice. They found that sodium benzoate enhanced the structural integrity of the cells namely in the dendrites, the tree-like extensions of neurons that enable them to communicate with other brain cells. Cinnamon, like many spices, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. So it could be expected to exert a range of health-boosting actions, and it does have a centuries-long history of medicinal use around the world. But the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says that ""high-quality clinical evidence to support the use of cinnamon for any medical condition is generally lacking."" Most of the clinical trials that have taken place have focused on the spice's possible effect on blood sugar for people with diabetes. Little if any clinical research has been done on the spice's possible brain-boosting properties. Don't Miss: Electric 'thinking cap' controls learning speed Pahan hopes to change that. Based on the promising results from his group's preclinical studies, he believes that ""besides general memory improvement, cinnamon may target Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment [a precursor to Alzheimer's], and Parkinson's disease as well."" He is now talking with neurologists about planning a clinical trial on Alzheimer's. Before you start heaping cinnamon on your oatmeal, keep a few caveats in mind. First, most cinnamon found in the store is the Chinese variety, which contains a compound called coumarin that may be toxic to the liver in high amounts. A person would likely have to eat tons of cinnamon to run into a problem, but just the same, Pahan recommends the Ceylon or Sri Lanka type, which is coumarin-free. Even then, don't overdo it. ""Anything in excess is toxic,"" says Pahan. What about simply inhaling the pleasant-smelling spice? Will that benefit the brain? ""Simply smelling the spice may not help because cinnamaldehyde should be metabolized into cinnamic acid and then sodium benzoate,"" explains Pahan. ""For metabolism [to occur], cinnamaldehyde should be within the cell."" As for himself, Pahan isn't waiting for clinical trials. He takes about a teaspoonful about 3.5 grams of cinnamon powder mixed with honey as a supplement every night. Should the research on cinnamon continue to move forward, he envisions a similar remedy being adopted by struggling students worldwide. See Also: Synchronized brain waves enable rapid learning ""Individual differences in learning and educational performance is a global issue, he says. ""In many cases, we find two students of the same background studying in the same class, and one turns out to be a poor learner and does worse than the other academically. Now we need to find a way to test this approach in poor learners. If these results are replicated in poor-learning students, it would be a remarkable advance.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/threedrug-combinations-counter-antibiotic-resistance-212031,Three Drug Combinations Counter Antibiotic Resistance Research shows that combinations of three different antibiotics can treat resistant bacteria  even if they are ineffective independently  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Each year, approximately 700,000 people die from drug-resistant bacterial infections. A study by UCLA life scientists could be a major step toward combating drug-resistant infections. The research, reported in the journal Royal Society Interface, found that combinations of three different antibiotics can often overcome bacteria s resistance to antibiotics, even when none of the three antibiotics on their own   or even two of the three together   is effective. The researchers grew E. coli bacteria in a laboratory and treated the samples with combinations of one, two and three antibiotics from a group of 14 drugs. The biologists studied how effectively every single possible combination of drugs worked to kill the bacteria. Some combinations killed 100 percent of the bacteria, including 94 of the 364 three-drug groupings the researchers tested. According to Pamela Yeh, the paper s senior author and a UCLA assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, the success rate might have been even greater if the researchers tested higher doses of the drugs. Elif Tekin, the paper s lead author and a UCLA graduate student, helped create a sophisticated framework that enabled the scientists to determine when adding a third antibiotic was producing new effects that combinations of just two drugs couldn t achieve.  Three antibiotics can change the dynamic,  she said.  Not many scientists realize that three-drug combinations can have really beneficial effects that they would not have predicted even by studying all pairs of the antibiotics together.  Different classes of antibiotics use different mechanisms to fight bacteria. One class, which includes amoxicillin, kill bacteria by preventing them from making cell walls. Another disrupts their tightly coiled DNA. A third inhibits their ability to make proteins. But there had been little previous research indicating that combinations of three antibiotics might be more potent together than any two of them.  People tend to think that you don t need to understand interactions beyond pairs,  said Van Savage, a co-author of the paper and a UCLA associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and of biomathematics.  We found that isn t always so.  The researchers combined techniques from biology and mathematics to determine which groups of antibiotics would be most effective.  The three antibiotics must be chosen systematically and rationally,  Yeh said. In addition to identifying certain combinations that were more potent than the researchers expected, the analysis revealed that adding a third antibiotic sometimes made the drug combination less potent   sometimes much less so, she said. Yeh said the findings could be one weapon to fight what has become a major public health risk, but overcoming drug resistance will require a full arsenal.  We need sound policy to stop the overuse of antibiotics, doctors to prescribe antibiotics wisely, agriculture to stop overusing antibiotics and researchers to develop new antibiotics,  she said.  We need to attack this problem from all sides. We think our contribution will buy time for researchers to better leverage existing drugs and for policymakers to develop better policy about the use of antibiotics.  Another benefit of three-drug combinations is that they could allow doctors to prescribe lower doses of each antibiotic, which could reduce side effects. The researchers plan to make available open-access software that would let other scientists and clinicians decide which combinations of antibiotics will be most effective. Yeh said the team s approach could also be used to study how four or more pharmaceuticals interact, and a similar mathematical framework could be used to better understand climate change (for example, to understand how temperature, rainfall, humidity and acidity of the oceans interact) and other scientific questions that have three or more key factors.","Published: July 22, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-mechanism-of-tuberculosis-infection-202749,New Mechanism of Tuberculosis Infection Researchers have identified a new infection mechanism of tuberculosis that could lead to a new therapeutic angle  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers from UT Southwestern Medical Center have identified a new way that tuberculosis bacteria get into the body, revealing a potential therapeutic angle to explore. One of the world s most deadly diseases, tuberculosis   primarily a lung disease   infects more than 8 million people and is responsible for 1.5 million deaths each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately one-third of the world s population is infected with tuberculosis. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mtb, previously was thought to infect the body only through inhalation and subsequent infection of cells in the lungs. The new study, published online by Cell Reports, identifies an alternative route of entry that could have significant implications for the development of new therapies to prevent tuberculosis infection. The research team, led by Dr. Michael Shiloh, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Microbiology at UT Southwestern, found that microfold cell (M-cell) translocation is a new and previously unknown mechanism by which Mtb enters the body. M-cells are specialized epithelial cells that transport particles from the airway or mucosal surface to the compartment below the cell.  The current model of disease is that when Mtb bacteria are inhaled, they reach the end of the lung   the alveolus   and then are ingested by a macrophage, a type of white blood cell that swallows and kills invading bacteria,  Dr. Shiloh said.  Our study shows that once Mtb bacteria are inhaled, they also can enter the body directly through M-cells that line the airway tissue, and then travel to the lymph nodes and beyond. This is a key finding that suggests disease onset outside of alveolar macrophages is not only possible, but also important in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis infection.  Dr. Shiloh said that this mechanism of M-cell mediated movement of Mtb may help explain an ancient disease called scrofula. In this disease, tuberculosis infection rarely appears in the lung but instead causes disease in the lymph nodes of the neck. Although further studies are necessary, potential clinical applications of the team s finding would involve developing methods or drugs that prevent Mtb from entering M-cells. For example, Dr. Shiloh said, preventing Mtb from attaching to receptors on the M-cell surface   such as by vaccinating against a bacterial protein   could block the bacteria s entry, infection, and spread to other organs. Dr. Shiloh and his team currently are working to discover the human cell-surface receptors for Mtb that are involved in the bacteria s M-cell translocation, as well as to determine the exact machinery used by the cell to move the bacteria from the surface to the bottom of the cell.  We are taking several experimental approaches to identify the Mtb genes and proteins that are involved in this process,  said Dr. Vidhya Nair, study lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Internal Medicine. In addition, because the investigators have data indicating that other important airway pathogens that cause acute bacterial pneumonia also may use M-cells to cause severe disease, they are extending their work beyond tuberculosis.  Understanding these mechanisms in vivo would allow for targeted blockade of bacterial transport via vaccinations or medications, which could ultimately lead to new ways to prevent or treat airway infectious diseases,  Dr. Shiloh explained.","Published: July 22, 2016"

These structures not only build themselves with atomic-level accuracy, but also can encapsulate other materials. The materials were designed to possess icosahedral symmetry, which affords efficient construction by repeating geometric arrangements, while maximizing packing room for carrying a payload.  An icosahedron is a 20-sided polygon, and is the basic modeling unit for geodesic domes. The successful design and experimental characterization of these new molecular architectures is reported in the cover article of this week s Science. The paper is titled,  Accurate design of megadalton-scale two-component icosahedral protein complexes.  The same edition of Science also contains a profile by Robert Service, ""Rules of the Game,""  of  computer-designed protein molecules pioneer  Dr. David Baker, UW professor of biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. The lead researcher on the 11-member team was Jacob B. Bale, a recent graduate from the University of Washington s Molecular and Cellular Biology Ph.D. program. He is now a research scientist at the Arzeda Corporation in Seattle.  The senior authors were David Baker and Neil P. King of the University of Washington s Institute for Protein Design.  Baker is a UW professor of biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute  investigator, and King is a translational investigator and acting assistant professor.  The work was carried out in close collaboration with researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Janelia Research Campus.  We set out to design two-component icosahedral protein structures capable of packaging macromolecular cargo through controlled, in vitro [test-tube] assembly,  the researchers wrote about their effort to create new nanomachines for practical applications. The protein structures were envisioned at the atomic level via molecular modeling software developed at the University of Washington and a growing number of other institutions around the world.  The proteins comprising the nanostructures were encoded in DNA sequences and produced inside of bacterial cells co-opted to serve as small protein manufacturing factories.  The proteins were then purified and characterized by a variety of techniques. Ten of the materials were found to match closely with the design models.  The protein nanostructures reported in this study are the largest designed protein complexes to date confirmed by X-ray crystallography.  With molecular weights between 1.8 to 2.8 megadaltons and diameters of 24 to 40 nanometers, the designs are comparable in size to the protein shells that contain the genetic material of a small virus. The inner cavities within these newly designed molecules, along with the various ways to mix the molecule s components, make them well-suited to encapsulate a broad range of materials. As an initial demonstration of cargo packaging capability, the researchers were able to get their protein nanocages to encapsulate a payload of supercharged green fluorescent protein. This compound fluoresces brightly in certain northern Pacific jellyfish.  The fluorescent protein is often employed in labs to study the inner workings of cells and in many other aspects of biology research and bioengineering. The atomic-level precision and the rapid, controllable assembly of the designed materials, their size and complexity, and their ability to be genetically modified with additional functionalities are  pushing the boundaries of biomolecular engineering into new territory,  the researchers said.  The ability to accurately design such large and complex protein structures unlocks the door to creating a new generation of biomolecular machines and materials. By attaching targeting agents and engineering payload release mechanisms, such designs could serve as the starting points for molecular vehicles that deliver drugs or genetic therapies to cells.  Also, stringing virus components on the structures could enable them to serve as safe, new vaccines.  And incorporating enzymes into the designed materials could convert them into miniature chemical reactors for bioenergy or other metabolic engineering applications. The work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and its Janelia Research Campus visitor program, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  Patents for the molecules have been filed. The researchers worked with X-ray beamline teams to verify the structure of the designed molecules at the Northeastern Collaborative Access Team beamlines, the Advanced Proton Source, and the Advanced Light Source SIBYLS beamline at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This study builds on previous work from the authors reported in June of this year in Nature. They successfully designed a single, highly stable, 60-subunit self-assembling icosahedral nanocage.  In that study they demonstrated its potential utility for a range of applications, including as a tool for light microscopy when genetically fused to green fluorescent protein.","Published: July 22, 2016"

New research from George Vasmatzis, Ph.D., of the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic, finds liquid biopsies from blood tests and DNA sequencing can detect a return of ovarian cancer long before a tumour reappears. That could lead to earlier intervention and more effective, individualized treatment. Dr. Vasmatzis  research on the  Quantification of Somatic Chromosomal Rearrangements in Circulating Cell-free DNA from Ovarian Cancers  is published in the July 20 edition of Scientific Reports.  With liquid biopsies, we don t have to wait for tumour growth to get a DNA sample,  says Dr. Vasmatzis.  This important discovery makes it possible for us to detect recurrence of the disease earlier than other diagnostic methods. We can repeat liquid biopsies to monitor the progression of the cancer. That gives hope of a better treatment plan over time.  The study was done on 10 patients in advanced stages of ovarian cancer. Blood was drawn before and after surgery. Investigators compared DNA from the liquid blood biopsies to DNA tissue samples from the tumour, using mate-pair sequencing   an inexpensive whole exome sequencing that can reveal genetic changes that contribute to tumour growth.  In this study, the blood drawn before and after surgery and the surgical tissue was used to identify DNA fragments with abnormal junctions that can only be seen in this patient s tumour DNA,  explains Dr. Vasmatzis.  Next-generation mate-pair sequencing was used to identify specific DNA changes of the tumour to create an individualized monitoring panel for liquid biopsy. This allows us to shape treatment to the individual patient rather than using a standard treatment that may not work for everyone.  When post-surgery DNA matched that of the tumour, patients were later found to have had a recurrence of ovarian cancer. However, when the post-surgery DNA did not match the DNA of the tumour, patients were found to be in remission. Ovarian cancer has one of the highest death rates of all gynecological cancers, because the tumour often cannot be detected until the late stages. Most patients go into remission after initial treatment, but the tumour returns 75 percent of the time. The next stage of ovarian cancer that develops typically does not respond to chemotherapy. More than 21,000 women in the U.S. were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and 14,000 women died of the disease in 2015.","Published: July 22, 2016"

It s a completely new platform that can be adapted to many kinds of uses,  says John Brennan, director of McMaster s Biointerfaces Institute and co-author of a paper in the journal Nature Communications that describes the technology.  These DNA nano-architectures are adaptable, so that any target should be detectable.  DNA is best known as a genetic material, but is also a very programmable molecule that lends itself to engineering for synthetic applications. The new method shapes separately programmed pieces of DNA material into pairs of interlocking circles. The first remains inactive until it is released by the second, like a bicycle wheel in a lock. When the second circle, acting as the lock, is exposed to even a trace of the target substance, it opens, freeing the first circle of DNA, which replicates quickly and creates a signal, such as a colour change.  The key is that it s selectively triggered by whatever we want to detect,  says Brennan, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Bioanalytical Chemistry and Biointerfaces.  We have essentially taken a piece of DNA and forced it to do something it was never designed to do. We can design the lock to be specific to a certain key. All the parts are made of DNA, and ultimately that key is defined by how we build it.  The idea for the  DNA nanomachine  comes from nature itself, explains co-author Yingfu Li, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Nucleic Acids Research.  Biology uses all kinds of nanoscale molecular machines to achieve important functions in cells,  Li says.  For the first time, we have designed a DNA-based nano-machine that is capable of achieving ultra-sensitive detection of a bacterial pathogen.  The DNA-based nanomachine is being further developed into a user-friendly detection kit that will enable rapid testing of a variety of substances, and could move to clinical testing within a year.","Published: July 22, 2016"

There are approximately 79,000 non-Hodgkin lymphomas per year in the European Union, and as many as 40% of those are diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The 2016 updates to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the classification of lymphoid neoplasms have been reported to require subtyping of DLBCL tumours as activated B cell (ABC) or germinal centre B-cell (GCB).

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/drug-candidates-reduce-abnormal-protein-production-192870,Drug Candidates Reduce Abnormal Protein Production New drug candidates improve cell ability to catch miss folded proteins that could cause deadly diseases  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a new study, scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have identified drug candidates that can boost a cell s ability to catch the  typos  in protein production that can cause a deadly disease called amyloidosis.  This study reveals a new approach to intervene in human disease,  said Luke Wiseman, assistant professor at TSRI and co-senior author of the new research with Jeffery Kelly, Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Chemistry at TSRI. The research was published today in the journal eLife. A New Approach Every human cell houses a little factory called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins are folded into their proper three-dimensional shape before exiting a cell. When the ER notices a typo in these proteins a misfolding event it recruits  chaperone  proteins to catch the misfolded proteins before they enter the bloodstream and form toxic clusters, or amyloid. Amyloid deposits in the heart, liver, retina or other organs in amyloidosis diseases lead to the degeneration of these tissues. Unfortunately, there sometimes aren t enough chaperones to catch all misfolded proteins. To fix this, scientists are looking at possible strategies to activate the ER s Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a signaling network that tells cells to produce more chaperone proteins to enhance editing or protein quality control.  We re trying to make these helpers more efficient,  said Kelly, who also serves as chairman of the Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine and is a member of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI. But there s a catch to this approach the cell will die if all three signaling  arms  of the UPR are activated for too long. However, an intriguing 2014 study from the Wiseman and Kelly labs indicated there may be a way to activate just one  arm  of the UPR, the ATF6 pathway, to catch misfolded proteins without triggering cell death. For the new study, the researchers teamed up with TSRI s Molecular Screening Center, on the institute s Florida campus, to pursue this potential approach to developing new therapies. Narrowing the Field From a library of hundreds of thousands of molecules, the researchers identified almost 14,000 molecules that could potentially interact with ATF6. The team then narrowed down this library using a technique called multiple gene expression profiling, eventually ending up with 79 potential molecules that activate the ATF6 arm of the UPR. Next, the researchers asked the key question:  Which molecules would preferentially activate ATF6 without launching the entire UPR network?  To figure this out, the researchers used an approach called transcriptional profiling, which allowed the scientists to see if the molecules were really targeting just the ATF6 arm of the UPR. The researchers then prioritized eight promising  structural families templates for compounds that appeared effective. TSRI Graduate Student Ryan J. Paxman led the effort to synthesize compounds from these families for confirmation and to understand how they activate ATF6. Fine-Tuning Future Therapies In experiments with human liver and plasma cells, the researchers found that several of the compounds could  phenocopy,  or mimic, a cell s normal activation of AFT6 leading to the generation of chaperone proteins that could help prevent misfolding events associated with disease. Interestingly, these compounds activated ATF6 to different extents even causing slight activation of the other UPR arms in some cases. The researchers compared these compounds to rheostat knobs, carefully tuning certain cellular pathways up and down. For example, one compound activated ATF6 at about 40 percent, yet that was enough to produce a beneficial response from the ER in two models of human amyloid disease.  Now we can fine-tune the ER quality-control process,  said TSRI Research Associate Lars Plate, who was co-first author of the study with Christina B. Cooley, a TSRI research associate at the time of the study, now an assistant professor at Trinity University. The next steps will be to test several other small molecules as potential drug candidates and develop models to study these compounds in different diseases where protein secretion plays a role.  This is a class of drugs that could also work for diabetes and additional neurodegenerative diseases linked to protein misfolding, like Alzheimer s disease,  said Kelly.","Published: July 22, 2016"

The study, directed by Fabian Docagne and published in Brain, paves the way for a new strategy to control the disease. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord. It is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. The disease is considered autoimmune since the immune system, which is there to protect the body from external assault, attacks its own constituents. The cells of the immune system, particularly the lymphocytes, bring about the destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds and protects the extensions (axons) of the neurons. This demyelination, which marks the beginning of axon degeneration, disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses. Lesions in the form of  plaques  are dispersed over the brain and spinal cord. They cause symptoms that vary greatly from one individual to another. Usually, the disease is characterised by exacerbations, with the appearance of motor, sensory and cognitive disorders, followed by remission a few weeks later. But with the passage of years, these symptoms can progress to irreversible disability. Current treatments reduce the exacerbations and improve the quality of life of patients, but do not control the progression of the disease. In order for the cells of the immune system circulating in the bloodstream to reach the central nervous system, they must penetrate the blood-brain barrier (haematoencephalic barrier) and blood-spinal cord barrier (haematomedullary barrier). During previous work on a mouse model of stroke, the team from Inserm Unit 919 studied a factor involved in opening the blood-brain barrier, the NMDA receptor. In particular, they observed that blocking the interaction of this receptor with tPA (a member of the serine protease family) has beneficial effects associated with maintaining the integrity of the barrier. In cellular models of the human blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers, the use of this antibody prevented opening of the barrier under inflammatory conditions, limiting the entry of lymphocytes. The team then tested the therapeutic effects of the antibody in an experimental mouse model of multiple sclerosis. After intravenous injection of Glunomab, the progression of motor disorders (partial or total paralysis of the limbs), as assessed by a clinical score, was blocked. In these treated mice, this effect was associated with reduced infiltration of lymphocytes into the nervous tissue, and reduced demyelination. By thus preventing myelin destruction by the cells of the immune system, this strategy might represent a promising therapy for the control of multiple sclerosis.","Published: July 22, 2016"

The findings are available in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. The findings will help scientists to better target efforts for controlling the population of mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus. In early 2015 the first Zika infections were described in Brazil, harbingers of an explosive hemispheric epidemic. As of July 2016, local Zika infections have been reported in 39 countries and territories in the Americas, with the epidemic spreading throughout most of northern South America and nearly all of Central America and the Caribbean. Many countries in North America and Europe have also reported hundreds of imported cases.  Because several experimental studies have suggested that A. aegypti is not highly susceptible to Zika virus infection and there has been a lack of direct evidence of A. aegypti infection during outbreaks, some scientists have speculated that other common tropical urban mosquitoes such as Culex quinquefasciatus could be involved,  said UTMB professor Scott Weaver, senior author of this paper.  We sought to more directly investigate which mosquito is responsible for spreading Zika virus so that we can selectively tailor our mosquito control efforts to a specific mosquito species  habits.  The signs and symptoms of Zika infection are similar to the mosquito-borne diseases chikungunya and dengue. However, near the beginning of the outbreak in November of 2015 physicians in communities on the Mexico-Guatemala border reported to the Centro Regional de Investigacion Salud Publica an increase in the number of patents showing signs and symptoms thought to be different from those of chikungunya or dengue. To investigate this outbreak further, during November and December last year, researchers from the Mexican National Institute of Public Health completed a house-to-house survey to identify patients who met the World Health Organization case definition of Zika virus infection in several locations in the state of Chiapas. The researchers collected 119 blood samples with permission from people suspected of Zika virus infection. Zika virus was confirmed in 21 percent of the blood samples using a PCR-based test. No pregnant females were studied. The researchers also gathered adult mosquitoes in and around 69 homes of suspected Zika patients using backpack aspirators, and identified Zika virus in several samples of A. aegypti but not in other mosquito species.  Our study indicates that A. aegypti was the principal carrier of Zika virus in the Tapachula area of Chiapas State, based on the detection of virus in several mosquito pools and the prior demonstrated transmission competence of this species of mosquito,  said Weaver.  It s important to note that Zika was not found in C. quinquefasciatus, another common urban tropical mosquito discussed as a potential Zika vector. ","Published: July 22, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/deciphering-inactive-x-chromosomes-192009,Deciphering Inactive X Chromosomes Untangling the Barr body of inactive X chromosomes valuable for understanding chromosome structure and gene expression  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at UMass Medical School and the Institut Curie in Paris have taken a detailed look inside the small, densely packed structure of the inactive X chromosome found in female mammals called the Barr body and developed a model system that may be an important tool for understanding chromosome structure and gene expression. The inactive X chromosome has long been thought to be a rather amorphous compacted structure, but the new study, published in Nature, reveals a highly organized chromosome consisting of two distinct lobes of condensed inactive DNA with smaller structured domains of active DNA embedded in them. These smaller domains, referred to as topologically associating domains, are highly defined genetic  neighborhoods  and are found on other chromosomes as well. These domains have a significant role in gene expression, and their presence within the otherwise inactive Barr body was surprising.  This is the most detailed molecular view we ve been able to obtain of the DNA inside the Barr body,  said Job Dekker, PhD, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, professor of biochemistry & molecular pharmacology and co-director of the Program in Systems Biology.  Under a microscope, the inactive X chromosome is very different than other chromosomes; it looks like a condensed, undefined, inactive  blob.  Our study, using a range of experimental approaches including imaging and genomic methods, describes something else entirely: a highly organized and elaborate structure, rich in features that may silence or activate genes all along the chromosome.  Although DNA is composed of a linear sequence of bases, it doesn t exist inside the cell nucleus in a simple, straight form. Instead, the genome folds and loops back on itself so it can fit inside the tight confines of the nucleus. The shape it takes has a profound influence on which genes in a cell are turned on or off. To properly understand how the genome works to coordinate gene expression, it s necessary to understand how the genome is organized in space inside cells. In the case of the inactive X chromosome, scientists know that female mammals contain two X chromosomes, one of which is  turned off  to avoid overexpression of genes. This inactive X chromosome can be clearly seen with a microscope as a dense, shapeless, dark stain, called a Barr body. It is thought that the Barr body s dense shape is a result of it being mostly inactive. But the precise structure of the Barr body, how it is condensed and why some pieces of the DNA remain active have been very difficult to explore using even the most advanced imaging technologies, and more recently with genomic approaches based on chromosome conformation capture. A pioneer in the study of the three-dimensional structure of the genome, Dr. Dekker has developed a suite of chromosome conformation capture technologies biochemical techniques for determining how DNA segments interact and are linked to one another, which are the heart of the  3C,   5C,  and  Hi-C  tools used by researchers worldwide to map the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes inside cells. Using the Hi-C technology, Dekker and colleagues were able to construct a detailed view of the shape and architecture of the inactive X chromosome. To unravel the structure of the inactive X chromosome, Dekker and colleagues first had to address some major obstacles. One problem, according to Bryan R. Lajoie, a bioinformatician in the Dekker lab, is that it s all but impossible to tell the inactive X chromosome apart from active X chromosome given that they have virtually the same sequence.  The mice models we use in the lab lack the diversity we need genetically to be able to make this sort of distinction,  he said.  In order to properly determine the three-dimensional structure of the chromosomes using the Hi-C sequencing technology, we crossed two different mouse strains and built a new computational approach using naturally occurring mutations in one of the X chromosomes as guideposts,  said Lajoie.  By filling in the gaps computationally, we were able to connect enough dots to begin building a three-dimensional model of the inactive X inside the Barr body.  What they found was that the Barr body wasn t a single dense mass of DNA but instead is composed of two separately packed lobes separated by a highly repetitive segment of DNA called a macrosatellite repeat, found only in a few places in the genome. Dekker speculates that these macrosatellite repeats are responsible for packing and organizing DNA inside the Barr body. When the team used CRISPR technology to surgically remove the macrosatellite repeat from the chromosome, they found that the bi-lobed structure disappeared.  It s remarkable, that a single element can have such a global impact on shape and function of a chromosome,  said Edith Heard, PhD, chair of epigenetics and cellular memory at the Institut Curie in Paris. Though mostly inactive, there are still clusters of genes inside the lobes that are being expressed. These genes reside inside topologically associating domains (TADs), which organize the genome into neighborhoods separated by boundaries rich in specific proteins that repress transcription. This finding suggests that TADs play a role in making organizing gene expression within the otherwise inactive lobes of the silent X chromosome.  In order for a gene to be expressed inside the inactive Barr body it had to be located inside a TAD. It s possible that TADs may be playing a kind of protective role, allowing genes to be accessible for expression even when they are located inside the condensed and inactive chromosome,  said Dekker. This breakthrough establishes the inactive X chromosome as a powerful and unique model system for studying the relationship between the spatial organization of the genome and gene expression and will help scientists learn more about how the genome works inside living cells.","Published: July 22, 2016"

The research, which included an international team of scientists, was led by Howard Ochman, a professor of integrative biology at The University of Texas at Austin, and Andrew Moeller, a former graduate student at UT Austin, currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's surprising that our gut microbes, which we could get from many sources in the environment, have actually been co-evolving inside us for such a long time,"" says Ochman, who noted that the microbes were passed down over hundreds of thousands of host generations. As humans and the African great apes evolved into distinct species from a common ancestor, bacteria present in their common ancestor also evolved into distinct strains associated with each host, the scientists found. Adding further weight to the analysis, the scientists found genetic evidence that the bacteria split into distinct strains at about the same times as their hosts were splitting into distinct species. One such bacterial split happened about 15.6 million years ago as the gorilla lineage diverged from the other hominids. The other bacterial split happened about 5.3 million years ago as the human lineage separated from the lineage leading to chimps and bonobos. ""We've known for a long time that humans and our closest relatives, the great apes, harbor these bacteria in our guts,"" says Moeller, ""and the biggest question we wanted to answer is, where did these bacteria come from? Did we get them from our environment or from our evolutionary history? And how long have they persisted in host lineages?"" Before this study, scientists disagreed about whether strains of gut microbes have continued within individual hominid lineages over timescales long enough to lead to cospeciation, a process by which two species evolve in parallel. The persistence of some microbes might have been threatened by changes in diet, geography or the use of antibiotics. The researchers studied fecal samples collected from wild African great apes chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas and also from people living in Connecticut. Fossil and genetic evidence have established that all four species, known as hominids, evolved from a common ancestor that lived more than 10 million years ago. Fecal samples contain microbes shed from a host animal's gut. The scientists used gene sequencing to analyze all the different versions of one specific bacterial gene present in each fecal sample. From these data, they reconstructed evolutionary trees for three groups of gut bacteria that make up over 20 percent of the human gut microbiome. For two of those groups, Bacteriodaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, the bacterial evolutionary trees closely resemble the hominid evolutionary tree. There are some subtle differences, however, such as an individual bacterial strain disappearing from one of the four host species over time. The third bacterial family tree, for a group known as Lachnospiraceae, was more complicated. There were apparently at least four times when these bacteria were transferred between different host species. The researchers speculate that because these bacteria form spores and can thus survive outside their hosts for long periods, they were easily passed between species. The researchers are not certain how these three ancient strains of microbes were passed down from one host generation to the next for millions of years. Prior research shows that we receive our first inoculation of gut microbes from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal. Throughout life, we also receive microbes from social interactions. The researchers suspect both modes of transmission are responsible for maintaining our multigenerational relationship with our bacterial friends. ""What's most exciting to me is the possibility that this codiversification between bacteria and hosts could extend much further back in time,"" says Moeller. ""Maybe we can trace our gut microbes back to our common ancestors with all mammals, all reptiles, all amphibians, maybe even all vertebrates. If that's true, it's amazing.""","Published: July 22, 2016"

Such combinations are expected to kill cancer cells, which have mutations, but not healthy cells, which do not. The study, published July 21 in Molecular Cell, uncovered 172 new combinations that could form the basis for future cancer therapies.  Oncologists here at Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health and elsewhere can often personalize cancer therapy based on an individual patient s unique cancer mutations,  said senior author Trey Ideker, PhD, professor of genetics and bioengineering at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Jacobs School of Engineering.  But the vast majority of mutations are not actionable   that is, knowing a patient has a particular mutation doesn t mean there s an available therapy that targets it. The goal of this study was to expand the number of mutations we can pair with a precision therapy.  Most cancers have gene mutations that do one of two things   promote cell growth or prevent cell death. The first type is the target of many therapies, which inhibit cell growth. But it s much harder to develop therapies that restore malfunctioning genes that should be triggering cell death in abnormal cells, known as tumor-suppressor genes. Rather than target a tumor-suppressor gene directly, Ideker and team took the approach of identifying genetic interactions between a tumor suppressor gene and another gene, such that simultaneous disruption of both genes selectively kills cancer cells. The researchers first used yeast to quickly and cheaply screen 169,000 interactions between yeast versions of human tumor-suppressor genes and genes that can be inhibited with drugs, sometimes called  druggable  targets. To do this, they deleted each gene one at a time, in combination with another mutation. Those experiments whittled down the best combinations   those lethal to the yeast cells   to a few thousand. Next the team prioritized 21 drugs for which the yeast druggable targets were involved in the greatest number of cell-lethal interactions. They tested these drugs one at a time for lethal interaction with 112 different tumor-suppressor gene mutations in human cancer cells growing in the lab. The researchers ended up with 172 drug-gene mutation combinations that successfully killed both yeast and human cancer cells. Of these combinations, 158 had not been previously discovered. Here s one example of how this information might be useful for doctors and patients: Irinotecan is a drug only indicated by the FDA for use in colon cancer. But this study suggests that this class of drugs should be evaluated for efficacy in any tumor with a mutation that inhibits RAD17, a tumor-suppressor gene that normally helps cells fix damaged DNA. The next steps will be to test these combinations in more human cancer cell types and eventually in mouse models. But 172 combinations is a lot, more than a single lab can test, the researchers say. They hope other research teams will also take their list and further test each combination in a variety of conditions. To help spread this information to scientists around the world, all of the data from this study has been made freely available on NDEx, a new network data-sharing resource developed by Ideker and UC San Diego School of Medicine data scientist Dexter Pratt.  We ve created an important translational research resource for other scientists and oncologists,  said co-first author John Paul Shen, MD, clinical instructor and postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center.  And since many of the cancer-killing interactions we discovered involve already FDA-approved drugs, it may mean they could reach clinical translation rapidly. If these results are validated in subsequent testing, in the future an oncologist will have many more options for precision cancer therapy. ","Published: July 22, 2016"

Moreover, the development of new forensic tools, for example new sampling appliances, by commercial companies requires ongoing validation and assessment by forensic scientists. A frequent challenge in these kinds of experiments and validations is the lack of a stable, reproducible and flexible biological reference material. As a possible solution, we present here a cell culture model based on skin-derived human dermal fibroblasts. Cultured cells were harvested, quantified and dried on glass slides. These slides were used in adhesive tape-lifting experiments and tests of DNA crossover confinement by UV irradiation. The use of this model enabled a simple and concise comparison between four adhesive tapes, as well as a straightforward demonstration of the effect of UV irradiation intensities on DNA quantity and degradation. In conclusion, we believe this model has great potential to serve as an efficient research tool in forensic biology.","Published: July 22, 2016"

Therefore, it is essential for the development of a simple and reliable method for the determination of these organic toxicants in biological fluids. Here, we report on an applicable method by the combination of optimized liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) procedure and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify and quantify dimethoate, omethoate, dichlorvos, carbofuran, fenpropathrin, diazepam, estazolam, alprazolam, triazolamm, chlorpromazine, phenergan, barbitone and phenobarbital in human blood. The method demonstrated a linear calibration curve in range of 20 - 500  g/L (r > 0.994). The accuracy evaluated by recovery spiked at three different concentrations (50, 100 and 200  g/L) was in the range of 58.8 - 83.1% with a relative standard deviations (RSD) of 3.7 - 7.4%. The limits of quantification ranged over 6.7 - 33.3  g/L. This method was proved to be simple and reliable, and was thus successfully applied to forensic toxicology.

When you hear that phrase on modern-day detective shows, you know the jig is up; the bad guy has been caught. In a fictional TV world where crimes are solved in 30 minutes, nobody ever questions the authority of DNA evidence. In real life, though, doubt can easily be cast on it because people get confused by scientific jargon, or because of uncertainties about how the evidence was obtained and handled   in one famous case, the O.J. Simpson murder investigation, both factors ultimately contributed to the outcome of the trial. But when justice hangs in the balance, there is no room for error or misunderstanding. That strongly held conviction is what prompted Hank Fradella to create the new Criminal Investigations Certificate being offered through Arizona State University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice for the first time this fall. As a professor and associate director of the school, Fradella saw a need to ensure students interested in both the public service and scientific sides of criminal investigation were getting the best possible understanding of each other s functions, techniques and limitations.  The purpose of the Criminal Investigations Certificate is to make sure that justice practitioners who are not scientists understand what s going on in the lab, and vice versa,  he said. Non-scientist justice practitioners include police officers, firemen, paramedics and other first responders to crime scenes.  They have to know how to secure that scene in a way that does not taint the evidence, and they have to be able to preserve the evidence for future forensic testing in a way that ensures a certain degree of reasonable scientific certainty of the accuracy of the testing results,  Fradella said. As for the scientists doing the forensic testing, they need to know what happens in the field before the evidence comes to them in the lab, as well as understand the limits justice responders are under   especially in relation to the Fourth Amendment s regulations on lawful search and seizure. The certificate is meant for both students obtaining degrees in forensics as well as students obtaining degrees in public service.  We hope with the addition of this certificate that undergraduate students on either side of the quest for justice will be able to effectively converse with each other using proper nomenclature and a better understanding of the entire criminal investigation process,  Fradella said. Courses required to obtain the certificate will include ones offered through New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences on ASU s West campus.  The School of Criminology and Criminal Justice is particularly indebted to the forensic science program at the West campus,  said Fradella.  The faculty and staff in the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences have been wonderful partners in this endeavor. ","Published: July 22, 2016"

In conjunction with the financing, Andrew Levin, M.D., Ph.D., managing director of RA Capital Management, will join Synthorx s board of directors. Leveraging a synthetic biology breakthrough, Synthorx has developed scalable platforms for producing proteins that cannot be made through traditional methods. The proceeds will finance the development and scale-up of novel protein therapeutics that incorporate at least one synthetic amino acid.  The ability to incorporate synthetic or non-natural amino acids into proteins is not new,  said Dr. Levin.  What we believe is new and truly groundbreaking about Synthorx s technology is the ability to efficiently produce a variety of proteins containing multiple synthetic amino acids at the necessary scale and cost of goods for drug discovery and development.  Dr. Levin continued,  With a small team and a small initial investment, Synthorx has made notable progress from the Nature paper and helped answer many of the questions about the technology to enable a focus on product development.  Synthorx s technology is based on research published in Nature that described the first single-cell organism capable of replicating and maintaining a novel synthetic DNA base pair, named d5SICSTP and dNaMTP (abbreviated X and Y). DNA from every known species uses its four bases   A, T, G and C   to assemble the 20 natural amino acids into proteins that carry out the functions of life. With X and Y, Synthorx s expanded genetic alphabet technology is designed to produce proteins with multiple, different synthetic amino acids in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  There are many peptide and protein therapeutic programs in biotech and pharmaceutical companies that stall because they can t be scaled in a manner amenable to drug development and commercialization,  said Court R. Turner, president and CEO of Synthorx.  The breakthrough of having a living cell replicate and maintain a third base pair is not just about creating something new. It s about being able to make better protein therapeutics at the right scale and for the right cost, so patients can access these improved medicines.  Recombinant protein therapeutics have had a dramatic impact on medicine and the treatment of numerous diseases, such as insulin for diabetes and monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy. While these advances have improved lives and changed how new therapeutics are developed, many protein therapeutics have biophysical and pharmacological limitations. In order to overcome these limitations, therapeutic proteins are frequently chemically modified to enhance their pharmacological properties.  Synthetic amino acids have a wide diversity of characteristics that can be leveraged to improve delivery, potency, efficacy, selectivity, and efficiency of protein therapeutics. They can also be leveraged to precisely modify the protein and deliver a homogeneous product,  explained Mr. Turner.  By genetically encoding for the site-specific incorporation of select synthetic amino acids, we can create entirely novel proteins with greatly enhanced properties and enable a new generation of tailored protein therapeutics.

The new findings identify ASCL1 as an important therapeutic target for small cell lung cancer, for which there have been few changes in treatment for the past 30 years.  We used a genetically engineered mouse model that develops human-like small cell lung cancer and identified two regulatory pathways that in turn revealed vulnerabilities in this cancer,  said senior author Dr. Jane E. Johnson, Professor of Neuroscience and Pharmacology and a member of UT Southwestern s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. The findings, published in the journal Cell Reports, are important because survival for patients with small cell lung cancer is poor and few therapies are available.  Small cell lung cancer is a devastating disease that is diagnosed in 30,000 people a year in the U.S. and accounts for roughly 15 percent of lung cancer cases. Most patients survive one year or less and therapy has not changed significantly in 30 years. Our work shows the possibility of developing entirely new types of targeted therapies for small cell lung cancer by focusing on ASCL1,  said Dr. John D. Minna, Professor and Director of the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, and Director of the W.A.  Tex  and Deborah Moncrief Jr. Center for Cancer Genetics. He is Professor of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, co-directs the Experimental Therapeutics of Cancer Program at the Simmons Cancer Center, and holds the Max L. Thomas Distinguished Chair in Molecular Pulmonary Oncology, and the Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research. Signs and symptoms of small cell lung cancer include coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain, and the rapid development of widely spread disease around the patient s body. Smoking is the major risk factor for small cell lung cancer according to the National Cancer Institute, which helped fund the study along with the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. The team of researchers, which included Dr. Melanie H. Cobb, Interim Director of the Simmons Cancer Center and Professor of Pharmacology, determined that the ASCL1 protein found in most small cell lung cancer tumors is required for formation of the disease. When researchers deleted ASCL1 in the lungs of mice genetically engineered to develop small cell lung cancer, this loss prevented development of the cancer. Additionally, researchers were able to differentiate between the tumor-promoting function of ASCL1 and a related protein, NEUROD1, in small cell lung cancer. Some small cell lung cancers expressed ASCL1 whereas others expressed NEUROD1, and although the two genes regulate different processes in the cells, both appear to control genes that are important in driving this cancer. Dr. Johnson, holder of the Shirley and William S. McIntyre Distinguished Chair in Neuroscience, has been studying the roles of ASCL1 in the developing nervous system for many years , and was able to identify new roles for the protein in small cell lung cancer using UT Southwestern s Genomics and Microarray Core facility, which provides cutting-edge molecular technologies and services to hundreds of investigators pursuing different research projects. The new study is a collaboration across multiple departments at UT Southwestern including Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Pathology, Internal Medicine, and the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research. Other UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study include Dr. Adi Gazdar, Professor in the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research and of Pathology, and holder of the W. Ray Wallace Distinguished Chair in Molecular Oncology Research; Dr. Luc Girard, Assistant Professor with the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research and of Pharmacology; as well as senior scientists Dr. Mark D.

One of the world s most deadly diseases, tuberculosis   primarily a lung disease   infects more than 8 million people and is responsible for 1.5 million deaths each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately one-third of the world s population is infected with tuberculosis. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mtb, previously was thought to infect the body only through inhalation and subsequent infection of cells in the lungs. The new study, published online by Cell Reports, identifies an alternative route of entry that could have significant implications for the development of new therapies to prevent tuberculosis infection. The research team, led by Dr. Michael Shiloh, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Microbiology at UT Southwestern, found that microfold cell (M-cell) translocation is a new and previously unknown mechanism by which Mtb enters the body. M-cells are specialized epithelial cells that transport particles from the airway or mucosal surface to the compartment below the cell.  The current model of disease is that when Mtb bacteria are inhaled, they reach the end of the lung   the alveolus   and then are ingested by a macrophage, a type of white blood cell that swallows and kills invading bacteria,  Dr. Shiloh said.  Our study shows that once Mtb bacteria are inhaled, they also can enter the body directly through M-cells that line the airway tissue, and then travel to the lymph nodes and beyond. This is a key finding that suggests disease onset outside of alveolar macrophages is not only possible, but also important in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis infection.  Dr. Shiloh said that this mechanism of M-cell mediated movement of Mtb may help explain an ancient disease called scrofula. In this disease, tuberculosis infection rarely appears in the lung but instead causes disease in the lymph nodes of the neck. Although further studies are necessary, potential clinical applications of the team s finding would involve developing methods or drugs that prevent Mtb from entering M-cells. For example, Dr. Shiloh said, preventing Mtb from attaching to receptors on the M-cell surface   such as by vaccinating against a bacterial protein   could block the bacteria s entry, infection, and spread to other organs. Dr. Shiloh and his team currently are working to discover the human cell-surface receptors for Mtb that are involved in the bacteria s M-cell translocation, as well as to determine the exact machinery used by the cell to move the bacteria from the surface to the bottom of the cell.  We are taking several experimental approaches to identify the Mtb genes and proteins that are involved in this process,  said Dr. Vidhya Nair, study lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Internal Medicine. In addition, because the investigators have data indicating that other important airway pathogens that cause acute bacterial pneumonia also may use M-cells to cause severe disease, they are extending their work beyond tuberculosis.  Understanding these mechanisms in vivo would allow for targeted blockade of bacterial transport via vaccinations or medications, which could ultimately lead to new ways to prevent or treat airway infectious diseases,  Dr. Shiloh explained. Additional authors who contributed to this study were graduate students Haaris Khan and Chelsea Stamm; Dr. Luis Franco, Assistant Instructor in Internal Medicine; Dr. Denise Marciano, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine; and Dr. Beth Levine, Director of the Center for Autophagy Research, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and holder of the Charles Cameron Sprague Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science. Researchers from Juntendo University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan, also contributed. This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.

Learn More: Motor cortex shown to play active role in learning movement patterns The researchers discovered that the premotor and primary motor cortices encoded visual error in reaching, stimulation to the motor cortices induced trial-by-trial increased in reach errors, the error increased opposite to the preferred direction of errors at each location, and the after-effect of stimulation subsided gradually as in ordinary adaptation. The neural mechanisms of motor learning and adaptation constitute a central issue in both basic and clinical neuroscience. However, it is surprising that very little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the motor learning and adaptation of voluntary arm movements. For example, the origin of cortical error signals that drive adaptation in reaching remains an unanswered question. A major theory in motor learning (feedback error learning) proposed by Kawato and Gomi (1992) hypothesized that error signals are provided by premotor circuits, including the motor cortical circuits. However, neuroimaging studies to date have not indicated whether motor cortices encode error signals. Preceding human imaging studies unanimously implicated parietal regions, such as areas 2, 5 and 7, in representing reaching errors. See Also: Stop and listen: Study shows how movement affects hearing In the current study, Masato Inoue and colleagues were successful for the first time in inducing trial-by-trial ""adaptation"" in voluntary arm movements by artificial electrical stimulation of the premotor cortex (PM) or the primary motor cortex (M1). When the stimulation was terminated, the error (after-effect) did not decrease at once but recovered with practice, as observed after typical adaptation. The direction of the increase in the error was opposite to the ""preferred"" error direction of the neuron recorded in the stimulation site. The results clearly show that the motor cortices submit error signals that drive adaptation in voluntary arm movements, as predicted by the feedback error learning scheme. The novel technique to artificially ""improve"" a motor skill by a small amount of stimulation would be applicable to performance enhancement in athletes as well as for restoring motor control in neurological patients.

See Also: Comprehensive map of primate brain development published The research, published in the journal Neuron, suggests that alterations in the functional connectivity of the brain in humans may be used to determine the sites of pathology in complex disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. The work, led by David Amaral, distinguished professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and spearheaded by graduate student David Grayson, targeted the small, almond-shaped amygdala deep within brain, a region known to be important for emotions, especially fear. Using a technology called ""designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs,"" or DREADDs, the team genetically modified the neurons of the amygdala to produce molecular on-off switches, or receptors, that are triggered by a drug administered to the animal. When the drug is injected, the receptors shut down activity in the amygdala effectively turning off this brain region. Related: A BRAIN Initiative first: new tool can switch behavior  on  and  off Amaral and his colleagues then evaluated the activity in the rest of the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, when the amygdala was either on or turned off, allowing the researchers to measure functional connectivity the extent to which different brain regions coordinate their activity and form networks. The team demonstrated that when the amygdala was turned off, patterns of brain activity in other brain regions either decreased or increased. Areas known to be well-connected to the amygdala were particularly affected, but so were brain regions that have no known connections to the amygdala. ""This type of study, where a brain region is turned on and off while carrying out functional imaging, has never been done previously in a monkey,"" said Amaral, who is also the director of research at the UC Davis MIND Institute.

For this reason, visual word recognition has been a puzzle for neuroscientists because the neural systems responsible for reading could not have evolved for this purpose. ""The existence of brain regions dedicated to reading has been fiercely debated for almost 200 years,"" said Avniel Ghuman, an assistant professor in the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Department of Neurological Surgery. ""Wernicke, Dejerine, and Charcot, among the most important and influential neurologists and neuroscientists of the 19th century, debated whether or not there was a visual center for words in the brain."" See Also: After learning new words, brain sees them as pictures In recent years, much of this debate has centered on the left mid-fusiform gyrus, which some call the visual word form area. A recent study by Pitt neuroscience researchers addresses this debate and sheds light on our understanding of the neurobiology of reading. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Ghuman, Elizabeth Hirshorn of Pitt's Learning Research and Development Center, and colleagues from the Department of Psychology and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition used direct neural recordings and brain stimulation to study the role of the visual word form area in reading in four epileptic patients. The patients chose surgical treatment for their drug-resistant epilepsy and volunteered to participate in the research study. As part of the surgical treatment, neurosurgeons implanted electrodes in the patients' visual word form area, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand how the brain recognizes printed words. First, painless electrical brain stimulation was used through the electrodes to disrupt the normal functioning of the visual word form area, which adversely affected the patients' ability to read words. One patient dramatically misperceived letters, and another felt that there were words and parts of words present that were not in what she was reading. Stimulation to this region did not disrupt their ability to name objects or faces. Don't Miss: The science of synesthesia: How some can hear colors or taste words In addition to stimulating through these electrodes, the activity from the area was recorded while the patients read words. Using techniques from machine learning to analyze the brain activity that evolved over a few hundred milliseconds from this region, the researchers could tell what word a patient was reading at a particular moment. This suggests that neural activity in the area codes knowledge about learned visual words that can be used to discriminate even words that are only one letter different from one another (for example, ""hint"" and ""lint""). ""This study shows that the visual word form area is exquisitely tuned to the fine details of written words and that this area plays a critical role in refining the brain's representation of what we are reading. The disrupted word and letter perception seen with stimulation provides direct evidence that the visual word form area plays a dedicated role in skilled reading,"" said Hirshorn. ""These results also have important implications for understanding and treating reading disorders. The activity in the visual word form area, along with its interactions with other brain areas involved in language processing, could be a marker for proficient reading. Having a better understanding of this neural system could be critical for diagnosing reading disorders and developing targeted therapies.""

To quantify synapses throughout the brain, professor of radiology and biomedical imaging Richard Carson and his coauthors combined PET scanning technology with biochemistry. They developed a radioactive tracer that, when injected into the body, binds with a key protein that is present in all synapses across the brain. They observed the tracer through PET imaging and then applied mathematical tools to quantify synaptic density. The researchers used the imaging technique in both baboons and humans. They confirmed that the new method did serve as a marker for synaptic density. It also revealed synaptic loss in three patients with epilepsy compared to healthy individuals.

Viracor-IBT will perform this assay under CLIA/CAP regulations for High Complexity Clinical Laboratories.  The assay has been approved by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). The proprietary molecular Zika virus test is a real-time RT-PCR assay intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from Zika virus in human serum, plasma, or urine (collected alongside a patient-matched serum or plasma specimen) collected from individuals meeting Zika virus clinical criteria (e.g., clinical signs and symptoms associated with Zika virus infection) and/or Zika virus epidemiological criteria (e.g., history of residence in or travel to a geographic region with active Zika transmission at the time of travel, or other epidemiologic criteria for which Zika virus testing may be indicated). Viracor-IBT s Zika Virus Real-time RT-PCR has excellent sensitivity and does not cross-react with other viruses in the Flaviviridae family (including dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus) or with other viruses known to cause similar clinical symptoms such as chikungunya virus.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the first week after onset of symptoms, Zika virus disease can often be diagnosed by performing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on serum.  Additionally, urine samples collected less than 14 days after onset of symptoms are recommended for RT-PCR testing, when collected alongside a patient-matched serum or plasma specimen.  Dr. Gilles Martin, Eurofins  CEO said,  As a leader and trusted laboratory partner specialized in and dedicated to improving patient care through innovative infectious disease testing, Viracor-IBT is thrilled to be one of the first commercial laboratories to offer the Zika RT-PCR test to hospitals and health systems, and we are pleased that the FDA recently authorized our assay.  Viracor-IBT s Zika test provides timely, accurate results and more testing options to doctors and patients.  Zika virus is primarily spread through mosquitos and can also be spread by some forms of sexual contact. Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly in newborns and is at the forefront of concern for emerging infectious diseases. The Zika virus outbreak in South America has potential to further reach North America with the onset of the mosquito season, and Viracor-IBT will be prepared to assist patients by providing a fast turnaround time (within 8-12 hours of specimen receipt) on test results.  Viracor-IBT has a proven history of developing and validating highly sensitive, accurate assays in response to emerging public health needs, like Zika virus.  In 2009, Viracor-IBT was one of the first laboratories to market with the H1N1 Influenza A RT-PCR assay.  We are committed to developing high quality infectious disease assays that help our clients help more patients,  said Steve Kleiboeker, PhD, HCLD/TS/CC (ABB), Vice President of Research and Development, Viracor-IBT. Viracor-IBT s PCR assay development goes above and beyond  traditional  real-time PCR and RT-PCR design in that redundancy is present in the assay to account for the full range of viral serotypes, genotypes or isolates that may be infecting patients. With this expert approach to assay design, a problematic viral genomic polymorphism on one target will not result in inaccurate quantification or false positive results.  Like all other EUA authorizations, the Zika Virus Real-time RT-PCR test has not been FDA cleared or approved and is only authorized for use for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection of Zika virus and/or diagnosis of Zika virus infection.","Published: July 21, 2016"

The report considers whether a recent trend of fewer men being screened may be contributing to the rise, or whether the disease has become more aggressive -- or both.  The largest increase in new cases was among men 55 to 69 years old, which rose 92 percent in the past decade. This rise is particularly troubling, the authors said, because men in this age group are believed to benefit most from prostate cancer screening and early treatment. In addition, the average PSA (prostate-specific antigen) of men who were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in 2013 was 49, nearly double that for men diagnosed in 2004 with an average PSA of 25, indicating a greater extent of disease at diagnosis.  The blood level of PSA, a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland, is often elevated in men with prostate cancer. ""One hypothesis is the disease has become more aggressive, regardless of the change in screening,"" said senior study author Dr. Edward Schaeffer, chair of urology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Medicine. ""The other idea is since screening guidelines have become more lax, when men do get diagnosed, it s at a more advanced stage of disease. Probably both are true. We don t know for sure but this is the focus of our current work."" Schaeffer also is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. The paper was published July 19 in Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases, a journal from Nature.  Schaeffer s research team analyzed information from the National Cancer Data Base. It included 767,550 men from 1,089 facilities nationwide who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2013. Over the past decade, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of men being screened for prostate cancer and an associated decline in the overall number of new cases of prostate cancer being reported.   The fact that men in 2013 who presented with metastatic disease had much higher PSAs than similar men in 2004 hints that more aggressive disease is on the rise,  Schaeffer said.  If I were a patient, I would want to be vigilant. I firmly believe that PSA screening and rectal exams save lives.  If a patient is diagnosed with localized prostate cancer that is aggressive, treatment can be curative. If men present with metastatic prostate cancer, treatments are not curative and only slow disease progression. Most patients with metastatic prostate cancer eventually die from the disease.  There could be a significant increase in prostate cancer death rates if more people are diagnosed with metastatic disease, because treatments can only slow progression, it s not curable,  Schaeffer said. The study measured the total number of cases of metastatic prostate cancer, not the incidence, for example, of cases per 100,000. In addition, metastatic disease began rising in 2008, before the change in screening recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Thus, investigators said, they can t definitively link the increased cases to reduced screening alone. Three percent of those included in the study had metastases, which means prostate cancer cells had spread to other parts of their bodies by the time the cancer was diagnosed. The number of cases of metastatic prostate cancer in 2013 (2,890) was 72 percent greater than that in 2004 (1,685). In middle-aged men 55 to 69 years old, the number rose 92 percent from 702 new cases in 2004 to 1,345 in 2013.   The results indicate that screening guidelines and treatment need to be refined based on individual patient risk factors and genetics,  said lead author Dr. Adam Weiner, a Feinberg urology resident.  This may help prevent the growing occurrence of metastatic prostate cancer and potential deaths associated with the disease. This also can help minimize overdiagnosing and overtreating men with low-risk prostate cancer who do not need treatment.   Prostate cancer is 100 percent treatable if detected early, but some men are more likely to develop aggressive disease that will recur, progress and metastasize,"" said Dr. Jonathan W. Simons, president and CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation. ""Not all men with prostate cancer need immediate surgery or radiation. But every case needs precision prostate cancer care. We urgently need smarter and more targeted cancer screening, so we don't leave men at highest cancer risk unprotected from early, curable disease being missed and turning into incurable disease.""  This will be particularly critical for population health economics in the U.S., considering the added cost of care for metastatic prostate cancer and an aging constituency whose population over the age of 65 will double to over a projected 80 million by the year 2050,  Schaeffer noted.","Published: July 21, 2016"

Part of the herpes family of viruses, HCMV is one of the most significant viral pathogens during pregnancy and in immunocompromised patients. HB-101 is a bivalent vaccine containing two recombinant, replication-deficient lymphocyticchoriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) vectors, one expressing the pp65 protein and one a truncated gBprotein of cytomegalovirus. HB-101 is based on Hookipa s viral vector platform, Vaxwave , which can be applied repeatedly to boost the immune system and stimulate both potent B-cell and CD8+ T-cell immune responses. The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I study will recruit a total of 54 healthy, male and female subjects, negative for HCMV, at the Center for Vaccinology, Ghent University Hospital (CEVAC). Enrolled as three successive cohorts of 18 volunteers, each cohort will receive either a low dose, a middle dose or a high dose of the vaccine (n=14 volunteers), or placebo (n=4). The vaccine will be administered intra-muscularly at day 0, month 1 and month 3. The trial will run for 15 months, with interim immunogenicity data expected in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017. The primary endpoint of the study is safety. Safety data from each cohort will be reviewed by an independent group of experts from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), before dosing of the next cohort begins. Secondary endpoints are humoral and cellular immune responses induced by the vaccine. The first cohort has already received the low dose. Enrolment of the second cohort will start shortly.

The findings, reported by Andre Nussenzweig, Ph.D., and Shyam Sharan, Ph.D., at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues, appeared July 21, 2016, in Nature. In normal cells, the proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 act as DNA damage sensors, surveyors, and responders. They help perform complex functions that facilitate the repair of damaged DNA. Individuals who inherit certain mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have defective DNA repair and an increased risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Specifically, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for 20 percent to 25 percent of hereditary breast cancers and 5 percent to 10 percent of all breast cancers. The reduced ability to repair breaks in DNA in cells with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation makes the cells sensitive to DNA damaging drugs. However, breast cancers eventually acquire resistance to these drugs. One documented mechanism for developing chemoresistance in such tumors is through the restoration of accurate DNA repair pathways that mend DNA breaks caused by chemotherapy. Nussenzweig s laboratory has spent the past decade trying to understand the cellular mechanisms that regulate DNA repair in normal and pathogenic states.  It is the intricate mechanisms that tumor cells evolve to bypass the need for accurate DNA repair that form the foundation of our study,  said Nussenzweig.  A deeper knowledge of the processes that drive drug resistance in BRCA1/2-mutant tumors will lead to novel therapeutic approaches that target tumor-specific vulnerabilities.  In this study, the researchers linked the protection and stabilization of DNA replication forks as a major contributory mechanism to drug resistance in BRCA1/2-mutant breast and ovarian cancers. Replication is a cellular process that produces two indistinguishable DNA copies from a single DNA molecule. This DNA-copying process is an essential step in cellular division and occurs at defined locations called replication forks. The movement of a replication fork as it migrates along a DNA molecule can be disrupted by the presence of a diverse group of DNA structures and proteins, collectively and loosely referred to as replication fork barriers. This interruption of replication fork migration results in what is called a stalled fork. Upon replication fork stalling, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are called upon to protect the newly synthesized strands of DNA. If these proteins are absent, the replication fork is destabilized and the newly synthesized DNA is degraded, which increases genomic instability and increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs. The investigators were able to identify other proteins, such as PTIP, CHD4 and PARP1, that actively promote replication fork destabilization through the recruitment of enzymes that degrade newly synthesized DNA. The absence of these proteins protected the DNA at replication forks and remarkably reversed the drug sensitivity of both BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutant cells, making them chemo resistant. These studies also highlighted the complex ways by which tumor cells can evade chemotherapeutic interventions and acquire drug resistance, since disrupting the activity of multiple proteins led to the same end point of replication fork protection. These results are of particular relevance in the clinical setting, where expression of these proteins appears to be an indicator of how patients with BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutant cancers will respond to chemotherapeutic treatment with DNA-damaging agents. All together, these results underscore the importance of replication fork barriers to genomic instability and drug sensitivity in the context of BRCA1/2 mutations.

They have also developed software that automatically detects the ""fingerprint"" of each of these areas in an individual's brain scans. Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH, US) through its Human Connectome Project (HCP), this software correctly mapped the areas by incorporating data from multiple non-invasive brain imaging measures that corroborated each other. See Also: Conscious Coupling: The early path to circuit formation in the neocortex ""These new insights and tools should help to explain how our cortex evolved and the roles of its specialized areas in health and disease, and could eventually hold promise for unprecedented precision in brain surgery and clinical work-ups,"" said Bruce Cuthbert, PhD, acting director of NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which co-funded the research as part of the HCP. The new study identified with a nearly 97 percent detection rate 97 new cortex areas per hemisphere, in addition to confirming 83 that were previously known. NIMH grantees David Van Essen, PhD, and Matthew Glasser, PhD, of Washington University in St. Louis, and colleagues at six other researcher centers, report on their discoveries in the journal Nature. Earlier studies of cortex organization often used just one measure, such as examining postmortem tissue with a microscope. Uncertain delineation of cortex areas has sometimes led to shaky comparability of brain imaging findings. ""The situation is analogous to astronomy where ground-based telescopes produced relatively blurry images of the sky before the advent of adaptive optics and space telescopes,"" noted Glasser, lead author of the study. The HCP team set out to banish this blurriness by using multiple, precisely aligned, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities to measure cortical architecture, activity, connectivity, and topography in a group of 210 healthy participants. These measures including cortex thickness, cortex myelin content, task and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) cross-validated each other. The findings were, in turn, confirmed in an additional independent sample of 210 healthy participants. See Also: Culturing the connectome Even though some cortex areas turned out to be atypically located in a small minority of subjects, the data-derived algorithms incorporated into the software were able to successfully map them. While the study included fMRI scans of subjects performing tasks, the researchers determined that resting-state MRI techniques should suffice to map the areas in future studies using the tools they developed. Some areas may turn out to have further subdivisions or be subunits of other areas, in light of new data, noted senior author Van Essen. ""The ability to discriminate individual differences in the location, size, and topology of cortical areas from differences in their activity or connectivity should facilitate understanding of how each property is related to behavior and genetic underpinnings,"" added Glasser.

Countless lines carrying information about the environment, for example from the sensory organs, converge in the cerebral cortex. In order to direct the flow of data into meaningful pathways, the individual pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex act like miniature switchboard operators. Each cell receives information from several thousand lines. If the signals make sense, the line is opened, and the information is relayed onward. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried have now shown for the first time that contact points between specific neuron types are clustered in groups on the target neuron. It is probable that signals are coordinated with each other in this way to make them more ""convincing"". See Also: Synapses: stability in transformation The cells of the cerebral cortex have a lot to do. They process various types of information depending on the area in which they are located. For example, signals from the retina arrive in the visual cortex, where, among other things, the motion of objects is detected. The pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex receive information from other cells through thousands of synapses, and depending on where, how many and how often synapses are activated, the cell relays the signal onward - or not. The information, passed on in the form of electrical signals, can be measured various contact points of the neuron. ""The exciting thing is that the signals that a cell receives from, say, ten simultaneously active synapses can be greater than the sum of the signals from the ten individual synapses,"" says Volker Scheuss, summarizing the basis of his recently published study. ""However, until now it was unclear whether this phenomenon can be explained by a specific arrangement of synapses on pyramidal cells."" By combining modern methods, the neurobiologists in Tobias Bonhoeffer's Department have analyzed the arrangement of synapses. They were able to selectively activate a specific type of pyramid cell in brain slices from mice using optogenetics. Thanks to simultaneous ""calcium imaging"", they were then able to observe and record the activity of individual synapses under a two-photon microscope. In this way, they succeeded in showing for the first time how synapses are arranged with respect to each other. Learn More: Only a small portion of synapses may be active during neurotransmission The result of such synapse mapping analyzed with a newly developed algorithm was clear: The synapses of pyramidal cells form clusters consisting of 4 to 14 synapses arranged within an area of less than 30 micrometres along the dendrite. ""The existence of these clusters suggests that the synapses interact with each other to control the strength of the combined signal,"" explains Onur G k e, author of the study. This is the first anatomical explanation for the disproportionate strength of clustered synapse signals in comparison to the individual signals - a finding known from activity measurements. The observation in layer 5 pyramidal cells was of particular interest, as the activity of these cells oscillates synchronously. ""This rhythmic activity, which probably influences the processing of visual information, could synchronously activate synapse clusters, thus boosting the overall signal received,"" says Scheuss.

Even small deviations in brain temperature are capable of producing profound effects including behavioral changes, cell toxicity, and neuronal cell death. The problem faced by researchers and clinicians is how to measure and understand these changes in the brain and how they are influenced by complex biochemical and physiological pathways that may be altered by disease, brain injury or drug abuse. See Also: New research helps to explain how temperature shifts the circadian clock In a new paper published in Biomedical Optics Express, from The Optical Society, Stefan Musolino of the University of Adelaide and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Australia, and his colleagues describe a new optical fiber-based probe capable of making pinpoint brain temperature measurements in moving lab animals. ""Within our center we house physicists, chemists, and medical researchers and one of the interests of our center's 'Origin of Sensation' theme is temperature change in the central nervous system,"" Musolino said. ""It is only recently that more studies in my area of research drug-induced hyperthermia have started looking at changes in brain temperature in addition to changes in core body temperature within drug-treated animals. We wanted to further investigate these drug-induced brain temperature changes using center developed probes in order to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms driving them."" Don't Miss: We are getting closer to controlling body temperature in response to 'fight or flight' The probe developed by Musolino and his colleagues consists of an optical fiber, sheathed within a protective sleeve and encased within a 4-millimeter-long 25-gauge needle. The end-face of the approximately 2-mm-long probe tip is dipped into molten glass made of tellurite, doped with a small amount of the rare-earth oxide erbium. When inserted into the brain, the color of the light emitted from the erbium ions will vary depending on the temperature of the surrounding tissue; the temperature of that tissue can thus be determined by monitoring the light of these color changes. This method allows for measurements to be performed with a precision of a fraction of a degree (0.1 C). ""The area that can measure temperature is less than 125 micrometers in size,"" said study co-author Erik Schartner ""making it highly spatially precise and able to isolate temperature readings from very small brain areas."" The researchers say it is possible to make the temperature-sensing area of the probe tip smaller still as small as a few microns across by modifying the probe's design. The probe's immediate application will be to investigate changes in brain temperature within moving lab animals exposed to certain drugs of abuse, such MDMA (or 'ecstasy'). ""We will also look at the possible therapeutic properties of the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline and its ability to attenuate the changes in temperature caused by the administration of MDMA,"" said Musolino. ""In the future we will also be looking into combining this probe with other optical sensors in the hopes of developing new optical fiber-based sensing techniques for use in medical science labs that are examining real-word medical problems.""

Although the researchers caution that their study does not suggest cause and effect, they note that it does suggest that an infection, use of antibiotics or other factors that change the body s natural collection of gut and other bacteria may individually or collectively contribute to behavioral changes in some people with mental disorders. See Also: Microbes, mood, and mental health Their findings, published in Bipolar Disorders, add to evidence that the body s immune system, the so-called gut brain axis, and the particular bacterial microbiome each person has play an integral part in the ebb and flow of psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.  More research is needed, but ours suggests that if we can prevent infections and minimize antibiotic treatment in people with mental illness, then we might be able to prevent the occurrence of manic episodes,  says Robert Yolken, MD, the Theodore and Vada Stanley Distinguished Professor of Neurovirology in Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  This means we should focus on good-quality health care and infection prevention methods for this susceptible population and pay extra attention to such things as flu shots, safe sex practices and urinary tract infections in female patients.  Yolken says his team s study grew out of an interest in long-observed connections among infections, the microbiome and symptoms of mental illness. For example, numerous studies have shown that experimental alterations in the microbiome of animals can alter their behavior. Because antibiotics kill bacteria and can disrupt the makeup of the microbiome, Yolken and his  research colleagues looked at records of antibiotic use in patients treated at the Sheppard Pratt a psychiatric hospital  in Baltimore either as an inpatient or day hospital patient. Just over 64 percent of the patients were female, and all were 18 to 65. Two hundred and thirty-four people were hospitalized for mania, 101 for bipolar disorder, 70 for major depression and 197 for schizophrenia. Patients taking antibiotics were receiving a wide range of medications, including tetracycline, penicillin, sulfonamide, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone and macrolides for skin, respiratory, urinary tract and mouth infections. For comparison, they surveyed 555 healthy controls ruled not to have a mental disorder, including 347 women and 208 men between the ages of 20 and 60, about their current antibiotic use. Don't Miss: How cannabis use affects people with bipolar disorder The researchers examined antibiotic usage as an indirect way to measure for the presence of infection. Antibiotic usages were assessed through medical records with the patients and through an interview with participants in the comparison group. Of those hospitalized for mania, episodes of heightened energy and overactivity often associated with bipolar disorder 18 participants, or 7.7 percent, were taking antibiotics, compared to only 1.3 percent of the controls. This represents a more than fivefold increase in the odds of being in the mania group if taking antibiotics. On the other hand, just over 3 percent of people hospitalized for schizophrenia, 4 percent of people hospitalized for bipolar depression and 2.9 percent of people hospitalized for major depression were taking antibiotics. The researchers investigated whether the site of infection, such as mouth, skin or respiratory system, correlated with hospitalization, and they found that location of the infection didn t seem to matter, although 15 women had urinary tract infections, which didn t occur in any men. Learn More: Researchers identify signature of microbiomes associated with schizophrenia Yolken says there are several ways that infection and antibiotic use could directly or indirectly impact psychiatric symptoms. Among the possibilities are that systemic inflammation caused by the infection itself may lead to psychiatric symptoms or, alternatively, that antibiotics disrupt the gut s microbiome by killing off  good bacteria,  which may also affect the mind by increasing inflammation if more  bad bacteria  are present. Yolken says that the research team is currently looking for how these connections might actually work. One study is investigating, for example, whether suppressing inflammation in the gut with probiotics in people with mental illness will reduce the recurrence of manic episodes.

The results, published online by the journal Nature Medicine, show that a particular type of protein called integrin is present on the stem cell surface and used by stem cells to interact with, or ""sense,"" their surroundings. How stem cells sense their surroundings, also known as the stem cell ""niche,"" affects how they live and last for regeneration. The presence of the protein  1-integrin was shown to help promote the transformation of those undifferentiated stem cells into muscle after the tissue has degraded and improve regenerated muscle fiber growth as much as 50 percent. While the presence of  1-integrin in adult stem cells is apparent, ""its role in these cells has not been examined,"" especially its influence on the biochemical signals promoting stem cell growth, wrote the three authors Chen-Ming Fan, an adjunct biology professor at Johns Hopkins; Michelle Rozo, who completed her doctorate in biology at Hopkins this year; and doctoral student Liangji Li. The experiment shows that  1-integrin one of 28 types of integrin maintains a link between the stem cell and its environment, and interacts biochemically with a growth factor called fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to promote stem cell growth and restoration after muscle tissue injury. Aged stem cells do not respond to FGF, and the results also show that  1-integrin restores aged stem cell's ability to respond to FGF to grow and improve muscle regeneration. By tracking an array of proteins inside the stem cells, the researchers tested the effects of removing  1-integrin from the stem cell. This is based on the understanding that the activities of stem cells undifferentiated cells that can become specialized are dependent on their environment and supported by the proteins found there. ""If we take out  1-integrin, all these other [proteins] are gone,"" Fan, the study's senior author and a staff member at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington and Baltimore, said in an interview. Why that is the case is not clear, but the experiment showed that without  1-integrin, stem cells could not sustain growth after muscle tissue injury. By examining  1-integrin molecules and the array of proteins that they used to track stem cell activity in aged muscles, the authors found that all of these proteins looked like they had been removed from aged stem cells. They injected an antibody to boost  1-integrin function into aged muscles to test whether this treatment would enhance muscle regeneration. Measurements of muscle fiber growth with and without boosting the function of  1-integrin showed that the protein led to as much as 50-percent more regeneration in cases of injury in aged mice. When the same  1-integrin function-boosting strategy was applied to mice with muscular dystrophy, the muscle was able to increase strength by about 35 percent. Fan said the team's research will next try to determine what is happening inside the stem cells as they react with their immediate environment, as a step to understanding more about the interaction of the two. That, in turn, could help refine the application of integrin as a therapy for muscular dystrophy and other diseases, and for age-related muscle degeneration. ""We provide here a proof-of-principle study that may be broadly applicable to muscle diseases that involve [stem cell] niche dysfunction,"" the authors wrote. ""But further refinement is needed for this method to become a viable treatment.""","Published: July 20, 2016"

Fulcrum will discover and develop small molecules that modulate the on/off control mechanisms that regulate genes .  Fulcrum was established with $55 million in Series A financing to further develop a cross - disciplinary product engine to identify and modulate gene regulatory targets core to disease . Through its product engine, Fulcrum will develop a robust pipeline across therapeutic areas, spearheaded by two initial programs in genetic diseases . The company is led by President and Chief Executive Officer Robert J. Gould, Ph.D., former President and CEO of Epizyme, and a long - time leader in drug discovery and development .   One of the single most important biologic breakthroughs of the last decade has been the unravelling of gene regulation at a molecular level . For more than a decade we have understood the genetic code   the genome. Now that we are unravelling the way these genes are regulated and put to work in biology, there is an unprecedented opportunity for drug development,  Dr. Gould said.  The richness of the human genome comes from the way genes are turned on and off . Through the modulation of these on and off switches we have the potential to transform the treatment of hundreds of serious human diseases. We are excited to build Fulcrum Therapeutics   a company that is capable of translating these discoveries into groundbreaking new therapies that restore balance in patients who currently have no other therapeutic options.  Fulcrum  s product engine was created to integrate and accelerate the rapid advances that have reshaped a wide range of biological disciplines, including transcription biology, stem cell biology and computational biology . The integration of these diverse advanced technologies throughout the drug discovery and development process creates the opportunity to deliver on the promise of genomic medicine; namely, to not only discover genetic disease drivers, but also to regulate gene expression to restore health .  Fulcrum models gene regulation in disease tissue using patient cells that are either donated through tissue biopsy or derived from skin cells using the technology of induced pluripotent stem cells . It uses screening tools such as CRISPR/CAS9 and chemical probe libraries to dissect gene regulatory 2 mechanisms in cellular models of diseases . These discoveries are brought together with publicly available gene regulatory data to create genome - wide maps of gene regulation that enable rapid identification of drug targets for the activation or repression of disease genes. The combination of patient derived cells, screening tools and genome - wide databases enables Fulcrum s product engine.  The company believes there is long - term potential to address complex genetic disease s through its approach. The early focus of Fulcrum  s product engine is on two severe genetic diseases : Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and a form of muscular dystrophy called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) . Each disease arises from a single gene mutation that creates an error in gene regulation . In the case of Fragile X, the silencing of the FMR1 gene eliminates the cell s ability to make a protein needed for brain function . In FSHD, the precipitating event is the activation of a gen e called DUX4 that should be silent in adulthood. This activation leads to muscle wasting as cells die . Other genetic diseases that can be explored with Fulcrum s robust product engine include other neurologic disorders, skeletal muscular disorders and cardiac muscular disease .

In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers show that an unusual DNA repeat element on an inactive X chromosome is actually essential to the overall three-dimensional structure of this female-specific genetic phenomenon. It s what FSU Associate Professor of Biological Science Brian Chadwick describes as the  black box of genome biology.   These repeat elements are one of the unknowns in our genome,  Chadwick said.  Nobody knows where they originated from or why we have retained them, but typically this points to them performing some as of yet unknown important function. The repeats on the X chromosome are particularly intriguing, because they don t behave the way other DNA sequences do.  In nearly all female mammals, there are two X chromosomes. However, one of the chromosomes is almost entirely inactivated, meaning that most genes on the chromosome aren t necessarily dictating a biological function. Since silencing this chromosome is essential for female development, scientists have long been trying to understand how this is achieved and maintained.  While most of the chromosome is packaged into a silent state, there are parts that don t play along. What is unique about most of these parts is that they feature unusual repeat sequences including at one location the extensive tandem repeat called DXZ4.  Similar large repeats exist elsewhere on other chromosomes, and at least one is directly involved in the onset of a common form of muscular dystrophy, while another has been linked to schizophrenia. But why the X chromosome contains these repeats and what they are doing has been a mystery. Earlier independent work from both groups showed that these repeat elements make frequent contact with one another exclusively on the inactive chromosome, generating what Baylor Assistant Professor and Director of The Center for Genome Architecture Erez Lieberman Aiden coined  superloops.  When Chadwick saw how complementary Aiden s research was, he suggested they team up to tackle the question of function together. In their latest work, the researchers also report that DXZ4 is involved in forming superloops at the inactive X chromosome in rhesus macaque monkeys and mice.   In principle, the presence of DXZ4 at one end of the human superloops could have been a coincidence,  said Aiden, who is also a faculty member at Rice University in Computer Science and at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics.  But the fact the DXZ4 lies at the site of superloops in all three species was a critical clue.  Chadwick and Aiden employed cutting-edge genome engineering techniques to remove DXZ4 from the inactive X, generating one of the largest engineered deletion in human cells to date, and then applied innovative approaches and microscopic techniques in order to see what exactly would happen if that didn t exist.  The deletion caused a major formation change in the chromosome   it caused the three-dimensional structure of the inactive X DNA to collapse.   In the absence of this repeat, it significantly alters the folding and organization of the X chromosome,  Chadwick said.  It showed for the first time that it was essential for the correct three-dimensional structure of the human chromosome.   We re entering an exciting new era of genomics,  Chadwick said.  We know a lot about basic gene expression and gene structure.  But what we don t know is how everything works three dimensionally in the nucleus. Armed with these new genome engineering resources and the state-of-the-art high-throughput genomic analysis tools pioneered by labs such as Dr. Aiden s, we re just starting to pick away at that.

Scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have shown for the first time that ensembles of genes within the striatum a part of the brain that coordinates many primary aspects of our behavior, such as motor and action planning, motivation and reward perception could be deeply involved in the disorder. Most modern studies of bipolar disorder have concentrated on the brain s cortex, the largest part of the brain in humans, associated with higher-level thought and action.  This is the first real study of gene expression in the striatum for bipolar disorder,  said Ron Davis, chair of the Department of Neuroscience at TSRI, who directed the study.  We now have a snapshot of the genes and proteins expressed in that region.  The study, published recently online ahead of print in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, also points to several pathways as potential targets for treatment. Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that affects about 2.6 percent of the U.S. adult population some 5.7 million Americans with a sizable majority of these cases classified as severe. The disease runs in families, and more than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close relative with the illness or with unipolar major depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. In the new research, tissue samples from 35 bipolar and non-bipolar control subjects were analyzed. The number of genes differentially expressed in tissue samples from the two groups turned out to be surprisingly small just 14 in all. However, co-expression network analysis also revealed two modules of interconnected genes that were particularly rich in genetic variations associated with bipolar disorder, suggestive of a causal role in the disorder. One of these two modules was particularly striking, as it seemed to be highly specific to the striatum.  Our finding of a link between bipolar disorder and the striatum at the molecular level complements studies that implicate the same brain region in bipolar disorder at the anatomical level, including functional imaging studies that show altered activity in the striatum of bipolar subjects during tasks that involve balancing reward and risk,  said Research Associate Rodrigo Pacifico, who was first author of the new study. Bipolar patients may act impulsively and engage in high-risk activities during periods of mania. Pathway analysis also found changes in genes linked to the immune system, the body s inflammatory response, and cells  energy metabolism. Davis noted,  We don t know if these changes are a cause of the disease or the result of it. But they provide additional gene markers in bipolar disorder that could potentially lead to the future development of diagnostics or treatments. ","Published: July 20, 2016"

Immunotherapy using the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab (brand name Keytruda) has revolutionized the treatment of advanced melanoma. But a minority of patients who respond to treatment still experience reappearance and progression of their tumours, said Dr. Antoni Ribas, a professor of hematology and oncology, and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program.  The tremendous promise of immunotherapy is to engage our body s immune defenses to fight cancer, but the results must be long-lasting,  Ribas said.  We have now identified for the first time mechanisms that cancer cells can use to avoid recognition by the immune system s T cells and decrease sensitivity to their attack.  The study was published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. Led by Ribas and Jesse Zaretsky, the study s first author and a doctoral student in Ribas  lab, the researchers analyzed biopsies of melanoma tumours from patients that received pembrolizumab. The team compared pairs of tumours, both before the patients started treatment and after relapse, which occurred several months to years later.  Among the four pairs of biopsies studied, the team found one tumour lost a gene called B2M; resulting in a change in how the cancer is recognized by the immune system. Two additional tumors developed defects that disrupted the function of genes JAK1 or JAK2, which limited the effectiveness of the immune system to kill cancer cells.  We discovered that while the immune system s T cells remained active, new alterations in JAK1 and JAK2 caused the tumour to become selectively deaf to the signals they were sending that normally tell the cancer cells to stop growing, while genetic changes in B2M decreased the ability of the immune system to recognize the cancer in the first place,  Zaretsky said.  These findings can help open up a whole new potential area of research and allow us to better understand acquired resistance to these promising treatments.  The team also found a fourth pair of biopsies that did not have either of these genetic variations, which indicates that other mechanisms to escape immunotherapies may be discovered in the future, said Zaretsky, who is currently enrolled in the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program. Ribas  team next plans to develop pre-clinical models to further examine these genetic alterations. As scientists learn what these mechanisms of tumour resistance are, they can combine inhibitor drugs that block multiple resistance routes and eventually make the tumours shrink for much longer, or go away completely, Ribas said.

Akirav, PhD, a Research Scientist at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, NY, has found a biomarker for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), allowing the team to develop a new, minimally invasive test for the disease. MS is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that affects more than 400,000 people in the United States. The research was funded by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation s Marilyn Hilton Award for Innovation in MS Research, and the results are published online in the journal EBioMedicine. The biomarker s applications would include a more accurate diagnosis of MS, a better assessment of disease prognosis, how well the patient is responding to therapy and the possibility of measuring cell loss in the blood to test how well new drugs and therapies work.  We have tremendous hope that this will improve the quality of care that is available to patients with MS and allow us to diagnose the disease much sooner, so that they are able to receive the right therapy as soon as possible, and not be in limbo, waiting for another occurrence,  said Dr. Akirav. When Relapsing-remitting MS   the most common form of the disease which affects 80 85 percent of MS patients, and is characterized by symptoms that appear and then disappear before returning   is suspected, the patient must wait for a second episode to occur before a diagnosis can be made. Then the patient must undergo a spinal cord tap   a painful and somewhat risky procedure. This new research would allow for diagnosis by a simple blood test, allowing for earlier diagnosis and intervention. Moreover, it can be repeated and allows for a much simpler and quicker way to determine if particular medical therapies are working for a specific patient, and enables their physicians to tailor their treatments more closely to each individual patient.  When cells die in one area of the body, the DNA is dumped into the blood,  explained Dr. Akirav.  There is a specific cell in the brain known to be affected by MS. By studying the DNA in someone s blood, if we find DNA that came from the brain, it indicates the person is losing cells in the brain and can be a strong indicator of MS. We can see this by a blood sample, without an invasive procedure. Studying the blood is a direct route to studying the brain, providing more access to what can be a  black box  for researchers and drug companies.  The research was conducted by comparing the blood from patients with active Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to those from patients with inactive disease, and individuals without MS. The assay s characteristics are minimally invasive and low cost, making it an affordable alternative to current approaches. The researchers will soon be expanding their research to other forms of MS, including primary progressive and secondary progressive MS   consistent, progressive forms of the disease that are less understood than RRMS, as well as other neurological diseases.  For more than a century, Winthrop s culture has been shaped by a commitment to integrating the highest quality patient care services with rigorous research initiatives,  said Alan Jacobson, MD, Winthrop s Chief Research Officer.  This groundbreaking research addresses an important issue that can have a significant impact on public health and change people s lives. ","Published: July 20, 2016"

DuPont, M.D., director of the Center for Infectious Diseases at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) School of Public Health. In a literature review published today in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, DuPont advised medical practitioners to be alert when diagnosing persistent versus acute diarrhea in patients. It is common for doctors not to focus on how many days their patients have had diarrhea, he added. Persistent diarrhea from some causes can result in serious nutritional disorders and malnutrition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  I d like to educate doctors about the importance of taking the history and assessing duration of illness. For acute diarrhea, the lab has a minimal role, restricted to patients passing bloody stools. If a patient has had diarrhea for two weeks or more, the doctor should focus on the cause of the disease through laboratory testing, with an emphasis on parasites,  DuPont said. Acute diarrhea lasts less than two weeks and is typically caused by viruses or toxins. Persistent diarrhea is most commonly caused by bacteria or parasites, including Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora. Less common parasites are Entamoeba Cystoisospora belli, Dientamoeba fragilis, Strongloides stercoralis and microsporidia. These parasites, which can be detected in laboratory testing, can be contracted through food, water or from other people and are commonly picked up while traveling. A new testing method called multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed within the past year. This simultaneous, single test identifies unique DNA sequences to detect a panel of causes of diarrhea. Two platforms have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use and UTHealth School of Public Health researchers, led by Zhi-Dong Jiang, M.D., Dr.P.H., were involved in the testing process for these platforms.. Previously, researchers would culture bacteria from a stool sample and examine it for isolated bacteria. For parasites, they would either look under a microscope or, for three of the parasites, use commercial enzyme immunoassays. Both methods were only able to identify a small number of parasites.  These new tests are easy to use, are capable of detecting a broad range of pathogens and represent a significant improvement over culture-based diagnostic approaches. The technology needs to be more widely available. Diagnosis is critical when treating persistent diarrhea,  DuPont said. Antimicrobial therapy can be useful for many patients with persistent diarrhea, but a lab-established diagnosis is necessary for treatment, according to DuPont. Nitazoxanide is a drug that treats a broad spectrum of parasites and can be used as treatment for patients with persistent diarrhea who test negative for a pathogen in the lab.","Published: July 20, 2016"

Their findings demonstrate that current models can be enhanced by the aging of motor neurons to show how ALS damages cells later in life. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig s disease, affects more than 12,000 people in the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health. It typically strikes between the ages of 40 and 70, according to the ALS Association. There are no effective treatments, and most patients suffer paralysis and die within five years of diagnosis. To understand ALS, researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute are creating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients  skin cells. By altering several genes in patients  cells, the investigators can return these cells to their embryonic, or stem-cell, state. These specially engineered stem cells reproduce indefinitely in laboratory dishes, where their abnormalities and processes can be examined in detail. In the case of ALS, these cells are used to grow spinal motor neurons and study them. A multi-center team led by Clive Svendsen, PhD, and Ritchie Ho, PhD, has found that iPSC versions of spinal motor neurons typically used to model ALS resemble immature or fetal neurons more than mature adult neurons in adults affected by the disease. In a detailed analysis of large sets of genes, the investigators also showed how ALS may impact neurons as they mature and exacerbate age-related changes. Taken together, the findings suggest that investigators need to devise ways to alter iPSC versions of spinal motor neurons to more closely resemble older versions found in adult ALS patients, the scientists said.  Using motor neurons to model neurological disease may require their aging in a dish,  said Ho, the first author of an article on the study, published online July 18 in the journal Nature Neuroscience. To help researchers tackle the task of aging the stem cells, the group identified a series of genetic markers to assess cell maturity and age.  By knowing the gene expression patterns that define adult motor neurons in the spinal cord, we can push the iPSC-derived motor neurons in the right direction in the petri dish,  said Svendsen, director of the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and professor of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.","Published: July 20, 2016"

People encounter stressful situations and stimuli everywhere, every day, and studies have shown that long-term stress can contribute to a broad array of health problems. However, some people cope with stress better than others, and scientists have long wondered why. The new study, by a team of researchers at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, is now online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  This important finding points to specific brain adaptations that predict resilient responses to stress,  said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of NIH and a supporter of the study.  The findings also indicate that we might be able to predict maladaptive stress responses that contribute to excessive drinking, anger, and other unhealthy reactions to stress.  In a study of human volunteers, scientists led by Rajita Sinha, Ph.D., and Dongju Seo, Ph.D., used a brain scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure localized changes in brain activation during stress. Study participants were given fMRI scans while exposed to highly threatening, violent and stressful images followed by neutral, non-stressful images for six minutes each. While conducting the scans, researchers also measured non-brain indicators of stress among study participants, such as heart rate, and levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in blood. The brain scans revealed a sequence of three distinct patterns of response to stress, compared to non-stress exposure. The first pattern was characterized by sustained activation of brain regions known to signal, monitor and process potential threats. The second response pattern involved increased activation, and then decreased activation, of a circuit connecting brain areas involved in stress reaction and adaptation, perhaps as a means of reducing the initial distress to a perceived threat.  The third pattern helped predict those who would regain emotional and behavioral control to stress,  said Dr. Sinha, professor of psychiatry and director of the Yale Stress Center. This pattern involved what Dr. Sinha and colleagues described as  neuroflexibility,  in a circuit between the brain s medial prefrontal cortex and forebrain regions including the ventral striatum, extended amygdala, and hippocampus during sustained stress exposure. Dr. Sinha and her colleagues explain that this neuroflexibility was characterized by initially decreased activation of this circuit in response to stress, followed by its increased activation with sustained stress exposure.  This seems to be the area of the brain which mobilizes to regain control over our response to stress,  said Dr. Sinha. The authors note that previous research has consistently shown that repeated and chronic stress damages the structure, connections, and functions of the brain s prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is the seat of higher order functions such as language, social behavior, mood, and attention, and which also helps regulate emotions, and more primitive areas of the brain. In the current study, the researchers reported that participants who did not show the neuroflexibility response in the prefrontal cortex during stress had higher levels of self-reported binge drinking, anger outbursts, and other maladaptive coping behaviors. They hypothesize that such individuals might be at increased risk for alcohol use disorder or emotional dysfunction problems, which are hallmarks of chronic exposure to high levels of stress. In addition to NIAAA, the study was supported by the NIH Common Fund, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the primary U.S. agency for conducting and supporting research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and alcohol problems.","Published: July 20, 2016"

The Parkinson's disease model developed by Volpicelli-Daley applies very low concentrations of pre-formed fibrils of alpha-synuclein to in vitro or in vivo neurons. This causes formation of modified alpha-synuclein inclusions that share morphology with those found in the Parkinson's disease brain after death. They used this model to test the effects of neuron expression of the mutant LRRK2 (""lark two"") kinase, G2019S-LRRK2, on the formation of the inclusion pathology. They found that: As a control, they used anti-sense oligonucleotides to knock down the expression endogenous alpha-synuclein in neurons that expressed G2019S-LRRK2, and this prevented formation of inclusions.

Recent work by others has shown that mobile alpha-synuclein is prone to misfolding and aggregation, so the researchers hypothesize that the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation may contribute to Parkinson's susceptibility by boosting the amounts of mobile alpha-synuclein in neurons.

In a study of structural brain connectivity led by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), those participants with anorexia nervosa who scored lowest on a test measuring their ability to form insight had more connective abnormalities than other patients in brain regions linked to error detection and conflict monitoring as well as self-reflection. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder shared some of these connective abnormalities. The research was published in the journal Psychological Medicine. See Also: Early poverty disrupts link between hunger and eating Anorexia nervosa, a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss, and body dysmorphic disorder, in which individuals are preoccupied with misperceived flaws related to their physical appearance, are related psychiatric disorders that involve distorted body image, obsessive thoughts, and poor insight. The two often occur together, with symptoms usually first appearing during adolescence. Anorexia nervosa patients who have poor insight may not respond well to treatment because they fail to realize that their behavior and dangerously low weight are damaging to their health, and may even lead to death. ""The brains of people with anorexia nervosa who have poor insight may not generate an 'error message' when told, for example, that they are putting themselves at serious risk for death by severe restricting,"" said Dr. Alex Leow, associate professor of psychiatry and bioengineering in the UIC College of Medicine and corresponding author on the paper. ""Thus, it is plausible that their brains literally don't believe that they are severely underweight and their behavior is dangerous even when objective evidence suggests otherwise."" The abnormal brain network in people with anorexia nervosa comprises several brain regions, including the caudal anterior cingulate and the posterior cingulate, which have been shown in other studies to be crucial for error detection, conflict monitoring, and self-reflection. For example, the caudal anterior cingulate is hyperactive in people with obsessive compulsive disorder, who may perceive problems where none exist, such as thinking the door may be unlocked even after checking it numerous times.

""For example, in people with anorexia nervosa, that conflict might be, 'I may actually be way too thin, even if I think I am still fat.' Next, they need to be able to reflect on that conflict and what it means. If they can, this insight can lead to adaptive decisions, such as 'Hey, I need to get help to change my behavior and get healthy,' and then that person has a better chance of recovering. ""But without that insight, they are stuck."" Leow and her colleagues explored differences and similarities in brain connectivity patterns in 24 weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa (participants met all criteria for anorexia except for amenorrhea and all had body mass indices (BMI) of 18.5 or higher), 29 participants with body dysmorphic disorder, and 31 healthy control participants. None were receiving psychiatric medication at the time of the study. Insight and delusionality were measured using specialized questionnaires. Leow said the selection criteria for participants were carefully chosen, because long-term starvation itself has a profound impact on the brain and could contribute to abnormal connectivity in brain networks. ""We didn't study individuals who were currently very underweight, because we didn't want active starvation to impact our results,"" she said. ""In that case, we wouldn't really be sure if network abnormalities were caused by the disease itself, or if they simply reflected current effects of starvation on the central nervous system."" The researchers imaged each participant's brain using structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. Next, they constructed maps for each participant that showed which areas of the brain exhibited high levels of connectivity. They found that connectivity in the caudal anterior cingulate and the posterior cingulate were poorly connected with the rest of the brain in those with anorexia nervosa compared to healthy participants. Participants with worse insight scores had worse integration of these areas in the brain. The researchers also found that individuals with anorexia nervosa had abnormal, overlapping brain networks involved in reward and compulsive behaviors. ""This could relate to the observation that many anorexics experience a rewarding feeling from 'successfully' carrying out compulsive exercising, restricting, achieving specific weight goals,"" said Leow. Participants with body dysmorphic disorder showed similar but weaker abnormalities in the same regions. Don't Miss: Obese or anorexic individuals react differently to taste, study finds Improving anorexics' ability to detect the mismatch between their perceptions of self and reality may be the key to helping some recover, said Leow. ""We may be able to teach insight to these patients using different tools or techniques including virtual or augmented reality technologies,"" Leow said. A candidate approach is to 'amplify' the error signals, she said. ""Many anorexic patients with poor insight are able to understand someone else's severe restricting is very dangerous for that person, but they can't see it for themselves even when they are doing exactly the same thing,"" Leow said. Providing better visual feedback signals could be a way to get the error message across. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The study, published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, found that healthy adults who participated in cognitive training demonstrated positive changes in executive brain function as well as a 7.9 percent increase in global brain flow compared to study counterparts who participated in an aerobic exercise program. The aerobic exercise group showed increases in immediate and delayed memory performance that were not seen in the cognitive training group. The randomized trial is the first to compare cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity data obtained via MRI. See Also: This is your brain on exercise""Many adults without dementia experience slow, continuous and significant age-related changes in the brain, specifically in the areas of memory and executive function, such as planning and problem-solving,"" said Dr. Sandra Bond Chapman, study lead author, founder and chief director of the Center for BrainHealth, and Dee Wyly Distinguished University Professor. ""We can lose 1-2 percent in global brain blood flow every decade, starting in our 20s. To see almost an 8 percent increase in brain blood flow in the cognitive training group may be seen as regaining decades of brain health since blood flow is linked to neural health."" For the study, 36 sedentary adults ages 56-75 years were randomized into either a cognitive training or a physical training group. Each group took part in training three hours per week over 12 weeks. Neurocognitive, physiological, and MRI data were taken before, during and after training. The cognitive group received Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training (SMART), a manualized brain training developed at the Center for BrainHealth. The strategy-based training focuses on three executive functions: strategic attention (prioritizing brain resources); integrative reasoning (synthesizing information at a deeper level); and innovation (encouraging fluid thinking, diverse perspective-taking, and problem solving). The physical training group completed three, 60-minute sessions per week that included five minutes of warmup and cool down with 50 minutes of either walking on a treadmill or cycling on a stationary bike while maintaining 50-75 percent of maximum heart rate. ""Most people tell me that they want a better memory and notice memory changes as they get older,"" said Dr. Mark D'Esposito, study co-author and professor of neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Henry H. Wheeler Jr. Brain Imaging Center at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. ""While memory is important, executive functions such as decision-making and the ability to synthesize information are equally, if not more so, but we often take them for granted. The takeaway: Aerobic activity and reasoning training are both valuable tools that give your brain a boost in different ways."" See Also: Can physical exercise enhance long-term memory? The research team attributes the global cerebral blood flow gains to concerted mental effort during the reasoning training. ""We believe the reasoning training triggered neural plasticity by engaging the brain networks involved in staying focused on a goal, such as writing a brief business proposal, while continuously adapting to new information, such as feedback from a collaborator,"" Chapman said. The aerobic exercise group did not show significant global blood flow gains, however the exercisers with improved memory performance showed higher cerebral blood flow in the bilateral hippocampi, an area underlying memory function and particularly vulnerable to aging and dementia. ""Our research has shown that all brain training protocols do not return equal benefits. When targeting the brain functions that give us a mental edge in daily life, strategy-based programs prevail,"" Chapman said. ""This study highlights the potential to accelerate brain health in healthy adults by adopting lifestyle habits that exercise the mind and body. Future trials are needed to further develop and test neuroprotective programs that unite physical and cognitive training protocols for the highest health returns starting early and continuing into late life."" Dr. Laura DeFina, chief executive officer of The Cooper Institute in Dallas and collaborator on the study, says the findings are encouraging. Don't Miss: Study shows benefits of multi-tasking on exercise ""We know that physical activity can lead to improved fitness levels. In our Cooper Center Longitudinal Study population, higher fitness has been shown to result in less all-cause dementia with aging,"" DeFina said. ""The current study highlights the benefit of training both the body and the brain, as both produce observable benefits. The initial findings are encouraging and underscore the need for a multifaceted approach when it comes to brain health."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The research group of Professors Michael Blades and Robin Turner recently published this work in the Analyst.  For this work the group collaborated with the Canadian Blood Services, using Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) to investigate the chemical changes that occur in red blood cells (RBC's), during storage in bags, which could eventually be used as a quality check prior to transfusion. The group illustrated how the inVia could be used to analyse bulk properties of a sample, both in a conventional microscopy mode, and with a laser offset by using the inVia's software controlled beam steering capabilities. The laser and collection optics were purposely aligned to implement a spatially-offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) measurement at a set position, enabling analysis of the blood with minimal interference from the bag material.  In addition, the group study bio-analytical applications with RMS, in particular spatially resolved analyses using the Renishaw inVia. To date, it has used RMS to characterise single cells and populations of cells in vitro as they respond to a variety of chemical and environmental stimuli, including those triggering differentiation, autophagy, necrosis and apoptosis. It also uses RMS for the sub-cellular analyses of glycogen and nucleoli.  The group has worked with Renishaw since the late 1990s when it used an RM-1000 system which  performed flawlessly and served as a workhorse for many years.  Describing the more recent instrumental developments, Professor Turner said,  In 2009 we traded that system for a refurbished inVia platform in order to take advantage of the StreamLine  mapping technology and, in 2015, purchased a new inVia system. We now have two inVia systems operating in our lab and both are heavily used  mainly by us  but also by a growing number of external users on a fee-for-use basis. The robustness and ease of use of the inVia make it feasible to quickly train some of the more frequent external users so they can do their measurements without our personnel standing by.   Our dealings with Renishaw have been a very positive experience. The StreamLine feature is very useful to us and the WiRE software is powerful and easy to use. We have also been very happy with the service and support that we have received from Renishaw and ProSpect Scientific (Renishaw's Canadian representative). The platform is flexible and we have exploited that to, for example, implement a fluorescence imaging microscopy system that uses the same microscope and hence can be used to image the same sample by fluorescence and Raman, and to implement SORS.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/improving-wheat-crops-in-the-field-198073,Improving Wheat Crops in the Field  Agrii  RAGT and the University of Nottingham are developing better disease management and yield production in wheat crops using ASD FieldSpec Handheld   portable spectroradiometers  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Controlling diseases in wheat such as Septoria leaf blotch is vital for the cost-effective optimisation of yield. If it were possible to analyse the health of wheat crops at different stages of development and then adjust fungicide usage, farmers would be able to optimise fungicide input and improve their yields.  Being able to identify the early characteristics of disease during crop development is the subject of a three and a half year study of test field sites in Nottinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and South Wales. Co-funded by Innovate UK and BBSRC, a consortium comprising Agrii (provider of agronomy services), RAGT (plant breeders) and the University of Nottingham (crop and image analysis scientists) are running a project into this important challenge.  The ASD FieldSpec4 portable spectroradiometer from Analytik was chosen by the team to make on-site spectral reflectance measurements on wheat crops at each of the field sites. The reflectance data will be correlated with hyperspectral image data to aid final analysis. The ASD instruments were attractive due to their rugged and robust construction backed with no compromise in reliable spectrographic performance. Dr Rumiana Ray is an Associate Professor in Crop Pathology at the School of Biosciences at the University of Nottingham. Her research focus is on the development of integrative strategies for the control of root, stem-base, foliar and ear diseases in cereals.  We aim to identify novel hyperspectral and/or fluorescence signatures to probe crop health. If we are able to also differentiate responses in our varieties to disease and treatment then we can improve crop management decisions  said Dr Ray.  Leading the project on the ground is Agrii Head of R&D, David Langton. His beliefs demand integrated management of disease:  Thoroughly integrated management, employing an extended armoury of agronomic tools alongside the best available chemistry and varietal resistance has become every bit as essential in cost-effective wheat Septoria control as it is in tackling the scourge of black-grass. Just like black-grass, wheat growers can no longer afford to rely solely on chemical crop protection to counter the country's biggest cereal disease threat.  The project sets out to explore and develop a number of innovative approaches to improving fungicide choice and spray timing decision-making at the three sites. Now in its second year, different wheat varieties are being tested biweekly. It is still early to define precise rules to maximize yield. The goal is to develop a diagnostic tool for the disease to aid decision making. This means a library of spectra is being collected. It is also important to get a good yield prediction as early as possible because that will influence the choice and application rate of fungicides to be used as well as total rate of nitrogen to apply. For example, if a good yield is forecasted for specific varieties, it would pay the grower to invest in a more robust fungicide application whereas a low yield forecast might help the choice not to invest as much. This is important for the environment too as the goal is to minimize nutrient and fungicide loss and potential pollution of soil and rivers. In total, the final decisions are based on a combination of an integrated crop and disease management which takes into account ROI and the environment. ","Published: July 19, 2016"
