Companies have agreed to increase the potential milestones to Galapagos for Phase 1 and 2 achievements, bringing the remaining total milestones in the CF alliance up to approximately $600 million, from $350 million. Other key collaboration terms remain in place: tiered royalty payments on net sales, ranging from mid-teens to twenty percent. Galapagos retains commercial rights to China and South Korea, and has an option to co-promote in Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Galapagos and AbbVie aim to develop a triple CFTR combination therapy to address 90% of patients with CF. In order to bring a more effective therapy to patients, the companies have developed multiple candidates and backups for each of the three components of a potential triple combination. Triple combinations of CF compounds in the portfolio have consistently shown restoration of healthy activity levels in in vitro assays with human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells of patients with the F508del mutation. These combinations result in a statistically significant increase in chloride transport over Orkambi1 in HBE cells with the homozygous F508del mutation. It is expected that a triple combination therapy from this collaboration will be tested in patients having the F508del mutation in 2017.  Galapagos and AbbVie are committed to accelerate the development of a potential triple combination therapy,  said Onno van de Stolpe, CEO of Galapagos.  The compounds in our CF franchise show exciting results in vitro, and our strong partnership with AbbVie is focused on getting these combinations into patient trials as soon as possible.   Within a short time, AbbVie and Galapagos have been able to create an expanded portfolio of candidate CF drugs which, in combination, may offer patients new therapy options. We look forward to working rapidly with Galapagos to bring these candidate drugs through the clinic in the coming years,  said Jim Sullivan, Vice President, Discovery, AbbVie.","Published: April 29, 2016"

As part of this collaboration, twoXAR will help fund some of the collection and analysis of disease-specific gene expression data, which will be made available to the global research community and used to power disease-to-candidate predictions using the company s discovery platform. Dr. Teng, Director of Pediatric Dermatology, is leading vital research aimed at improving treatment options and care outcomes for rare diseases. A significant challenge faced by the rare disease community is access to sufficient data to power meaningful investigations into disease mechanisms and new therapies. Through their study of diseases like lymphatic malformation and EBS, Dr. Teng s team will compile the most comprehensive compendiums of biomedical data available for these disorders.  As is the case with many rare diseases, EBS and lymphatic malformation have no FDA approved medications and our best current treatment options consist of supportive care or surgeries to improve symptoms,  said Dr. Teng.  We are pleased to be working with twoXAR in this preclinical study collaboration as we strive to change the outcome for people living with rare and often incredibly painful and disabling diseases like lymphatic malformation and EBS.  twoXAR has developed patent-pending algorithms that enable it to find unanticipated associations between disease and drug candidates orders of magnitudes faster than wet lab-based approaches. The company s integrative biomedical software platform rapidly evaluates massive public and proprietary datasets to identify and rank high probability disease-to-candidate matches. These matches can then be used to prioritize existing candidates, perform targeted searches and identify novel drug candidates for further preclinical and clinical testing. The platform is disease agnostic and has been tested on more than 40 conditions to date in therapeutic areas including autoimmune, oncologic, and neurologic disorders.  This is an exciting opportunity to support patients and demonstrate how our technology can be used to identify potential new treatments faster and more cost-effectively than previous approaches,  said Andrew A. Radin, co-founder and CEO of twoXAR.  Through our work with Dr. Teng, we hope to develop additional expertise that will pave the way for investigating treatments using novel bioinformatics approaches for orphan diseases with unmet needs.

Providing a platform for future studies into biomedicine, evolution and the domestication of important animals including dogs, cows, horses and pigs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in animals and plants. Using the latest dog genome assembly and small RNA sequences of nine different dog tissues including skin, blood, ovaries and testes, scientists from TGAC have identified 91 novel miRNAs. This discovery provides a significant opportunity not only to enhance our understanding of how miRNAs regulate a variety of biological processes in an important model species for studying human diseases but can lead to further, similar research into the role that miRNAs play in animal domestication. Lead researcher, Dr Luca Penso Dolfin from TGAC s Vertebrate & Health Genomics Group, said:  As miRNAs are so important in orchestrating a variety of cellular processes, the discovery of these 91 novel miRNAs provides a vital starting point to explore their potentially major effects on gene regulation.  Overall, 811 miRNAs were analysed by Dr Penso-Dolfin: 91 novel microRNA sequences and 720 conserved (that is, common to other organisms). Among these conserved loci, 207 had not previously been identified as canine microRNAs. Dr Penso-Dolfin, added:  Our results represent a clear improvement in our knowledge of the dog genome, paving the way for further research on the evolution of gene regulation, and the contribution of microRNAs to pathological conditions. We are now looking at additional data for dog and a variety of farm animals, combining microRNA discovery to the investigation of their possible role in domestication.  The domestic dog, Canis familiaris, is the result of wolf (Canis lupus) domestication, which started around 10,000 years ago. Since then, hundreds of dog breeds have been artificially selected, leading to very high levels of morphological and behavioural variation. Having shared the environment with humans ever since its appearance, the dog has been exposed to similar pathogens and therefore represents an important model system for the study of human diseases. The publication of the latest Canine genome build and annotation, CanFam3.1 provides an opportunity to enhance our understanding of gene regulation across tissues in the dog model system. This study was led by TGAC in collaboration with the Broad Institute, US, and Uppsala University, Sweden. The paper titled:  An improved microRNA annotation of the canine genome  is published in PLOS ONE. Professor Federica Di Palma, Director of Science at TGAC and Dr Simon Moxon, Group Leader in the Regulatory Genomics Group at TGAC are joint corresponding authors.

Nitrogen runoff from farms along the Mississippi River winds up in the Gulf, feeding algae but depriving other marine life of oxygen when the algae decomposes. The 12 states that border the Mississippi have been mandated to develop nutrient reduction strategies, but one especially effective strategy has not been adopted widely: bioreactors. Bioreactors are passive filtration systems that capitalize on a bacterial process known as denitrification to remove from 25 to 45 percent of the nitrate in water draining from farm fields. Research on and installation of bioreactors has accelerated in the past decade, but University of Illinois assistant professor of water quality Laura Christianson and her colleagues are urging a move past proof-of-concept toward large-scale deployment.  Bioreactors are one of the most effective edge-of-field practices, but until now, they haven t been rolled out on a large scale,  Christianson says. Designs vary, but the typical arrangement for a 40- to 80-acre field is a large (100 x 20 foot) pit situated just ahead of where drainage pipes flow into ditches or streams. The pit is filled with carbon-rich organic material: usually wood chips, but sometimes corn cobs, biochar, or other matter. Denitrifying bacteria make their homes in the organic material and utilize its carbon as an energy source to convert nitrate in the water to the harmless nitrogen gas that makes up 78 percent of our atmosphere.  A benefit of bioreactors as a nitrogen management strategy is their cost-benefit ratio. Bioreactors can cost approximately $10,000 to install, but cost-sharing is available through the USDA s Natural Resources Conservation Service for approximately half of that. Importantly, bioreactors typically operate for 10 years before wood chips need to be replaced.  It s a big up-front cost compared to a cover crop, but then you re  one and done  for 10 years,  Christianson notes. Christianson put together a special issue of the Journal of Environmental Quality focusing on bioreactors. Fifteen articles in the issue summarize the state-of-the-art of bioreactor technology, confirming that bioreactors could be an effective part of an integrated approach to nitrate management. A large component to bioreactor efficiency is design. According to Christianson and other experts contributing to the special issue, flow rates can significantly affect the efficiency of bioreactors. During low-flow periods, water can be held in bioreactors for too long, setting up conditions for different bacteria that create noxious hydrogen sulfide gas. Likewise, in high-flow periods, water may move through too quickly for efficient nitrogen removal.  Tile drainage systems never flow at a consistent rate,  Christianson explains.  Bioreactors have to be designed strategically to optimize retention time and maximize nitrate removal without undesirable byproducts.    Temperature and seasonal changes also affect how well bioreactors work.  The critical period for nitrate loss is early spring, before plants are growing and taking up nitrogen,  Christianson says.  Snowmelt puts a significant amount of water through a bioreactor, depending on where you are. And because snowmelt and early spring drainage water is cooler, the bacteria aren t as efficient.    Christianson and her colleagues are calling for more field-scale research to optimize design for the set of conditions unique to each field.  That s where my interest is for research: coming up with better designs. But on the other side of that coin, we don t want to become so advanced in the design that it becomes really complicated. There s a beauty in the simplicity of a trench full of woodchips,  Christianson says.","Published: April 28, 2016"

These blasts normally develop into white blood cells. However, in AML, these cells do not develop and are unable to ward off infections. Jianjun Chen, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Cancer Biology at the UC College of Medicine, member of the UC Cancer Institute and lead author on the study, says that microRNAs are sophistically controlled and play key roles in the development of cancer. ""MicroRNAs make up a class of small, non-coding internal RNAs that control a gene s job, or expression, by directing their target messaging RNAs, or mRNAs, to inhibit or stop. Cellular organisms use mRNA to convey genetic information,  he says. ""Previous research has shown that microRNA miR-22 is linked to breast cancer and other blood disorders which sometimes turn into AML, but we found in this study that it could be an essential anti-tumor gate keeper in AML when it is down-regulated, meaning its function is minimized. ""When we forced miR-22 expression, we saw difficulty in leukemia cells developing, growing and thriving. miR-22 targets multiple cancer causing genes (CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP) and blocks certain pathways (CREB and MYC). The down-regulation, or decreased output, of miR-22 in AML is caused by the loss of the number of DNA being copied and/or stopping their expression through a pathway called TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A. Also, nanoparticles carrying miR-22 DNA oligonucleotides (short nucleic acid molecules) prevented leukemia advancement.  Chen, who conducted the study using bone marrow transplant samples and animal models, says that the ten-eleven translocation proteins (TET1/2/3) in mammals help to control genetic expression in normal developmental processes in contrast to mutations that cause function loss and tumor-slowing with TET2, which is observed in blood and stem cell cancers.  ""We recently reported that TET1 plays an essential cancer generating role in certain AML where it activates expression of homeobox genes, which are a large family of similar genes that direct the formation of many body structures during early embryonic development,  he says. ""However, it is unknown whether TET1 can also function as a repressor for cellular function in cancer, and its role in microRNA expression has rarely been studied.  Chen says these findings are important in targeting a cancer that is both common and fatal.  ""The majority of patients with ALM usually don t survive longer than five years, even with chemotherapy, which is why the development of new effective therapies based on the underlying mechanisms of the disease is so important,  he says, adding that this pathogenesis as well as drug response to AML is unclear.

ACT is a research and development medical device company with a portfolio of innovative catheter technologies addressing vascular disease and targeted endovascular drug delivery. The company began manufacturing the OPC approximately one year ago to support clinical trials and a targeted test market release.  Our first-in-human clinical trials have been very encouraging, and we have successfully met our milestones for safety and efficacy,  said Paul J. Fitzpatrick, CEO of ACT.  We look forward to working closely with Toray to address a worldwide market for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and targeted drug delivery estimated at about $3 billion by 2020.   At Toray, we are continually seeking new and innovative ways to treat the most pressing medical needs, such as arterial stenosis and restenosis,  said Shigeo Fujimori, Director of TAM Ventures, Limited (TAMV), a subsidiary and a corporate venturing arm of Toray.  We believe the OPC is truly  generation skipping  and offers innovative features that overcome the limitations of current technologies to offer a substantial patient benefit.  The OPC is a multi lumen balloon catheter designed to temporarily occlude a specific region from blood flow to allow the targeted delivery of various therapeutic and diagnostic agents to the peripheral vasculature. The OPC, which is disease and agent agnostic, has the ability to create a localized treatment chamber and place the agent circumferentially into the vasculature of the treatment chamber. Inflow and outflow ports allow for chamber filling, evacuation and flushing. The OPC is unique in being able to measure pressure applied inside the treatment chamber. It affords clinicians substantial procedural control along with the ability to select the agent and volume, as well as limiting systemic release of the agent. Terms of the licensing agreement were not disclosed. The OPC remains available for licensing within other fields such as coronary stenosis and restenosis, oncology, dialysis, venous insufficiency and lytic therapy.","Published: April 28, 2016"

Fragile X affects one boy in 4,000 and one girl in 7,000. It is caused by a mutation in a gene that fails to make the protein FMRP. In 2011, Xinyu Zhao, a professor of neuroscience, showed that deleting the gene that makes FMRP in a region of the brain that is essential to memory formation caused memory deficits in mice that mirror human fragile X. The deletions specifically affected neural stem cells and the new neurons that they form in the hippocampus. Tantalizingly, Zhao s 2011 study showed that reactivating production of FMRP in new neurons could restore the formation of new memories in the mice. But what remained unclear was exactly how the absence of FMRP was blocking neuron formation, and whether there was any practical way to avert the resulting disability. Now, in a study published on April 27 in Science Translational Medicine, Zhao and her colleagues at the Waisman Center at UW Madison have detailed new steps in the complex chain reaction that starts with the loss of FMRP and ends up with mice that cannot remember what they had recently been sniffing. This study s newfound understanding of the biochemical chain of events became the basis for identifying an experimental cancer drug called Nutlin-3, which blocks the reaction. In the new study, mice with the FMRP deletion took Nutlin-3 for two weeks. When tested four weeks later, they regained the ability to remember what they had seen   and smelled   in their first visit to a test chamber. Statistically, the memory capacities of normal mice and fragile X models that were treated with Nutlin-3 were identical. Still, many hurdles remain before the advance can be tested on human patients, Zhao says.  We are a long way from declaring a cure for fragile X, but these results are promising.  Fragile X appears after birth, says Zhao.  Parents start to notice something is wrong, but even if they get an accurate diagnosis, there is no treatment at present. I m encouraged because affecting this gene s pathway does seem to reverse the memory impairment.  The mouse memory test relied on curiosity.  We placed two objects in an enclosure and let the mice run around,  Zhao says.  Mice are naturally curious, so they explore and sniff each one. We take them out after 10 minutes, replace one object with a different one, wait 24 hours and put the mouse back in. If the mouse has normal learning ability, it will recognize the new object and spend more time with it. Mice without the FMRP gene don t remember the old object, so they spend a similar amount of time on each one.  The behavioral assessment was done by different people, says Zhao.  First author Yue Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Waisman, ran the test and sent the video to Michael Stockton, an undergraduate working on the project.  Stockton timed how and where each mouse was exploring,  but he had no idea which mouse was which,  Zhao says.  It was fantastic to see such clear data.  Two other undergraduates, Jessica Miller and Ismat Bhuiyan (who is now in graduate school) and postdoctoral fellows Brian Eisinger and Yu Gao also worked on the study. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation has applied for a patent on the discovery. Nutlin-3, which can block the last stage of the chain reaction set off by a mutation in the FMRP gene, is in phase 1 trial for the treatment of the eye cancer retinoblastoma. Finding a new use for a drug that is approved, or that like Nutlin-3 and several derivatives, has entered the approval process, may shorten the lengthy FDA process, says Zhao. The dose used in the trial   only 10 percent of the dose proposed for cancer chemotherapy   caused no apparent harm, she says.  We measured body weight and activity. So far, the mice look healthy and happy.  Because more than one-third of fragile X patients are also diagnosed with autism, the study may shed light on that condition. In any case, it s far too soon to declare victory over fragile X, Zhao stresses.  There are many hurdles. Among the many questions that need to be answered is how often the treatment would be needed. Still, we ve drawn back the curtain on fragile X a bit, and that makes me optimistic. ","Published: April 28, 2016"

This next generation of elite waxy corn hybrids is expected to be available to U.S. growers within five years, pending field trials and regulatory reviews. ""We re applying our 90 years of knowledge of corn biology to develop the next generation of high-quality waxy corn hybrids for the benefit of the entire value chain from growers to processors and end users,"" said Neal Gutterson, vice president, research and development for DuPont Pioneer. ""Starting with an identity-preserved product as our initial CRISPR-Cas offering allows us to lay a solid foundation for success of future larger volume products from this plant breeding innovation."" Pioneer is the leading supplier of waxy corn hybrids globally. In the United States, about a half-million acres of waxy corn are grown each year; however, they traditionally yield less than non-waxy corn hybrids. Waxy corn produces a high amylopectin starch content, which is milled for a number of everyday consumer food and non-food uses including processed foods, adhesives and high-gloss paper. Waxy corn is typically grown on contract through a closed-loop production system commonly referred to as ""identity-preserved."" ""The next generation of waxy hybrids developed with CRISPR-Cas will represent a step-change in how efficiently we bring elite genetic platforms of high-yielding waxy corn to our customers,"" Gutterson said. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently (USDA) recently published its response to Pioneer s ""Regulated Article Letter of Inquiry"" stating that it does not consider next-generation waxy corn developed with CRISPR-Cas enabled advanced breeding technology as regulated by USDA Biotechnology Regulatory Services. ""DuPont Pioneer believes that CRISPR-Cas as an advanced plant breeding tool holds great promise for maintaining the world s ability to produce an abundant and healthy food supply. The USDA s confirmation is an important first step toward clarifying the U.S. regulatory landscape and the development of seed products with CRISPR-Cas technology,"" said Gutterson. ""We continue to consult with global regulatory bodies and government agencies in order to understand the potential regulations around the world."" Pioneer is establishing a CRISPR-Cas enabled advanced breeding platform to develop seed products for greater environmental resiliency with characteristics like disease resistance and drought tolerance, in addition to advancing the development of improved hybrid systems. The technology has applicability for all Pioneer crops of interest. ""This is just the beginning: We believe the true value of this important innovation in plant breeding will be achieved through active engagement with customers, academia, governments, NGOs and public research institutes to develop new solutions to the toughest agricultural challenges,"" added Gutterson. ""Pioneer has a long history of collaboration and broadly advancing science and is open to entering further collaborations which would contribute to developing CRISPR-Cas technology across all crops and geographies for the greater good."" Pioneer previously announced strategic agreements for research collaborations and intellectual property (IP) licenses with Vilnius University and with Caribou Biosciences.

The findings, published online in npj Schizophrenia, a Nature Publishing Group journal, could lead to greater understanding of the biological underpinnings of this mental illness, as well as point the way to treatments. There have been many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have identified gene variants associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia, but in most cases there is little known about the proteins that these genes make, what they do and how they interact, said senior investigator Madhavi Ganapathiraju, Ph.D., assistant professor of biomedical informatics, Pitt School of Medicine. GWAS studies and other research efforts have shown us what genes might be relevant in schizophrenia,  she said.  What we have done is the next step. We are trying to understand how these genes relate to each other, which could show us the biological pathways that are important in the disease. Each gene makes proteins and proteins typically interact with each other in a biological process. Information about interacting partners can shed light on the role of a gene that has not been studied, revealing pathways and biological processes associated with the disease and also its relation to other complex diseases. Dr. Ganapathiraju s team developed a computational model called High-Precision Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) and applied it to discover PPIs of schizophrenia-linked genes identified through GWAS, as well as historically known risk genes. They found 504 never-before known PPIs, and noted also that while schizophrenia-linked genes identified historically and through GWAS had little overlap, the model showed they shared more than 100 common interactors. We can infer what the protein might do by checking out the company it keeps,  Dr. Ganapathiraju explained.  For example, if I know you have many friends who play hockey, it could mean that you are involved in hockey, too. Similarly, if we see that an unknown protein interacts with multiple proteins involved in neural signaling, for example, there is a high likelihood that the unknown entity also is involved in the same. Dr. Ganapathiraju and colleagues have drawn such inferences on protein function based on the PPIs of proteins, and made their findings available on a website Schizo-Pi. This information can be used by biologists to explore the schizophrenia interactome with the aim of understanding more about the disease or developing new treatment drugs.

In fact, she is so smart that scientists at the Long Marine Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz designed a series of tests that prove she is the first animal besides humans that can use basic logic (If A=B and B=C then A=C). Rio's display of intelligence is less surprising when you consider the fact that she is a member of one of only four groups of animals that have evolved extremely large brains (weighing more than 1.5 pounds). Along with seals and walruses, she is part of a group of fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals called pinnipeds. The other large-brained groups are humans, elephants and cetaceans (whales and dolphins). See Also: Brain size matters when it comes to animal self-control Despite considerable evidence of their cerebral skills, very little is known about pinniped brains. However, a team of neuroscientists at Vanderbilt University has taken an important step toward rectifying this lack of knowledge by conducting the first comprehensive study of the California sea lion's central nervous system, concentrating on the somatosensory system, which is concerned with conscious perception of touch, pressure, pain, temperature, position and vibration. Last year, the dramatic upsurge of juvenile California sea lion deaths due to strandings throughout central and southern California made it possible for Sawyer to obtain two juvenile sea lion brains for study. (Sea lions, like all marine mammals, are protected by the federal government under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.) The results of their study are described online in the early view of the Journal of Comparative Neurology. ""It was amazing to see the sea lion brain for the first time because, after spending years studying brains, it was shocking to see something so large and so different from any other brain I had ever worked with,"" said first author Eva Sawyer, a doctoral student in neuroscience at Vanderbilt. Fellow doctoral student Emily Turner collaborated in the study under the supervision of Jon Kaas, Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor in Social and Natural Sciences. Learn More: Animal study finds males may contribute to offspring's mental development before pregnancy ""We know a lot about how some brains are organized and function, mice and primate brains for example, but mammals are highly varied, and we know almost nothing about the brains of most mammals, including pinnipeds,"" said Kaas. Doctoral students Emily Turner, left, and Eva Sawyer examining a replica of a sea lion skull. Credit: Susan Urmy, Vanderbilt University  Humans, elephants, cetaceans and pinnipeds each evolved large brains independently, so the way that their brains are organized is quite different, particularly the cortex. Due to our inherent interest in our own evolution and the importance of the large human brain to our identity, it is worthwhile looking at these independent examples of how brains become large, Sawyer pointed out. Sea lion brains are about the same size as chimpanzee brains. Although they have some features in common with the brains of their closest relatives dogs, cats, bears and weasels their brains are also intensely folded in a fashion similar to that of whales and dolphins. ""It is striking that both cetaceans and pinnipeds tend to have large and convoluted brains, but there is no single accepted explanation for this observation,"" said Sawyer. ""It is at least partially explained by their large body size. Animals with larger bodies are expected to have larger brains. But it may also be related to other factors, such as the weightlessness of the marine environment or coping with cold water temperatures. Or it could just be a random outcome of evolution."" The researchers focused on the sea lion's somatosensory system because they were particularly curious about the animal's sense of touch. ""We have long wondered about how the somatosensory systems of sea lions and seals are organized, as they have such remarkable abilities to use touch and their whiskers to explore and feed in deep water,"" Kaas said. Using modern histochemical methods, Sawyer and Turner were able to identify and characterize the major parts of the sea lion brain that are used in processing touch information from the whiskers and the skin. These include areas in the brainstem, thalamus and cortex. Don't Miss: Origins of  rage  identified in brain in male animal model They discovered that the marine mammal's brain has specific areas for processing information from its whiskers that are strikingly similar to those found in mice and rats, who are considered the whisker specialists in the animal kingdom. Specifically, they found that each whisker on the sea lion's nose has a specific, corresponding area in the brainstem devoted to it. These are comparable to specific areas on the human brain that correspond to individual fingers. Their existence confirms that these ""mystacial "" whiskers play an important role in sea lion sensation and behavior. In addition, the researchers identified the brain areas devoted to processing touch sensations from the sea lion's flippers and tail. One of the surprises was discovery of a well-developed region, called Bischoff's nucleus, which is found in animals with prominent tails ranging from raccoons to kangaroos to whales. It is surprising because the sea lion's tail is not prominent at all: It is small and tucked between its hind flippers. Once mapping of the sea lion's somatosensory region is complete, the researchers plan on mapping the parts of its brain devoted to other functions. ""It will be interesting to compare its overall structure to that of primate brains,"" Sawyer said. The researchers would also like to map the brains of other pinnipeds, like walrus and elephant seals, which have much larger brains.

But a new meta-analysis from U of T s Institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering (IBBME) indicates that progress so far has been limited and new strategies are needed if the promise is to become reality.  The amount of research into using engineered nanoparticles to deliver cancer drugs directly to tumours has been growing steadily over the last decade, but there are very few formulations used in patients. The question is why?  says Professor Warren Chan (IBBME, ChemE, MSE), senior author on the review paper published today in Nature Reviews Materials.  We felt it was time to look at the field more closely.  Chan and his co-authors analysed 117 published papers that recorded the delivery efficiency of various nanoparticles to tumours   that is, the percentage of injected nanoparticles that actually reach their intended target. To their surprise, they found that the median value was about 0.7 per cent of injected nanoparticles reaching their targets, and that this number has not changed for the last ten years.  If the nanoparticles do not get delivered to the tumour, they cannot work as designed for many nanomedicines,  says Chan. Even more surprising was that altering nanoparticles themselves made little difference in the net delivery efficiency.  Researchers have tried different materials and nanoparticle sizes, different surface coatings, different shapes, but all these variations lead to no difference, or only small differences,  says Stefan Wilhelm, a post-doctoral researcher in Chan s lab and lead author of the paper.  These results suggest that we have to think more about the biology and the mechanisms that are involved in the delivery process rather than just changing characteristics of nanoparticles themselves.  Wilhelm points out that nanoparticles do have some advantages. Unlike chemotherapy drugs which go everywhere in the body, drugs delivered by nanoparticles accumulate more in some organs and less in others. This can be beneficial: for example, one current treatment uses nanoparticles called liposomes to encapsulate the cancer drug doxorubicin. This encapsulation reduces the accumulation of doxorubicin in the heart, thereby reducing cardiotoxicity compared with administering the drug on its own. Unfortunately, the majority of injected nanoparticles, including liposomes, end up in the liver, spleen and kidneys, which is logical since the job of these organs is to clear foreign substances and poisons from the blood. This suggests that in order to prevent nanoparticles from being filtered out of the blood before they reach the target tumour, researchers may have to control the interactions of those organs with nanoparticles. It may be that there is an optimal particle surface chemistry, size, or shape required to access each type of organ or tissue.  One strategy the authors are pursuing involves engineering nanoparticles that can dynamically respond to conditions in the body by altering their surfaces or other properties, much like proteins do in nature. This may help them to avoid being filtered out by organs such as the liver, but at the same time to have the optimal properties needed to enter tumors. More generally, the authors argue that, in order to increase nanoparticle delivery efficiency, a systematic and coordinated long-term strategy is necessary. To build a strong foundation for the field of cancer nanomedicine, researchers will need to understand a lot more about the interactions between nanoparticles and the body s various organs than they do today. To this end, Chan s lab has developed techniques to visualize these interactions across whole organs using 3D optical microscopy, a study published in ACS Nano. In addition to this, the team has set up an open online database, called the Cancer Nanomedicine Repository that will enable the collection and analysis of data on nanoparticle delivery efficiency from any study, no matter where it is published. The team has already uploaded the data gathered for the latest paper, but when the database goes live in June, researchers from all over the world will be able to add their data and conduct real-time analysis for their particular area of interest.  It is a big challenge to collect and find ways to summarize data from a decade of research but this article will be immensely useful to researchers in the field,  says Professor Julie Audet (IBBME), a collaborator on the study. Wilhelm says there is a long way to go in order to improve the clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines, but he s optimistic about the results.  From the first publication on liposomes in 1965 to when they were first approved for use in treating cancer, it took 30 years,  he says.  In 2016, we already have a lot of data, so there s a chance that the translation of new cancer nanomedicines for clinical use could go much faster this time. Our meta-analysis provides a  reality  check of the current state of cancer nanomedicine and identifies the specific areas of research that need to be investigated to ensure that there will be a rapid clinical translation of nanomedicine developments.

Specifically, the platform will utilize sequence-informed studies and HTS/HCS focused compound library screens to test the efficacy of different standard of care and pathway-specific inhibitors in 3D tumor micro-spheroid culture models derived either directly from patient primary tumors or patient-derived models (PDX). The collaboration combines PerkinElmer s capabilities in cell-based research imaging technologies with the GIS  expertise in cancer therapeutics and stratified oncology, cancer stem cell biology and adult/embryonic stem cell biology, and regenerative medicine. The resulting research will include high throughput screening to help provide insights related to molecular mutation and aid in the development of biomarkers for patient stratification.  Our collaboration with GIS brings together cutting-edge equipment and services along with insights from some of the world s leading cancer researchers,  said Brian Kim, President, Life Sciences & Technology, PerkinElmer.  PerkinElmer s integrated solutions empower researchers to reach greater insights for greater outcomes. Combined with GIS s knowledge and experience, this partnership has the potential to unlock new doors in the future of applying precision medicine to cancer treatment.  In the PerkinElmer-GIS Centre for Precision Oncology, GIS provides patient-derived primary tumor cultures in 3D organoids and tumor micro spheroids that mimic tumor architecture and maintain patient-specific genomic, epigenomic, and gene expression signatures. These models can be used for developing next-generation single or combinatorial drug screens and synthetic lethal screens. PerkinElmer complements this effort by providing advanced research technology solutions including: the Operetta  High Content Imaging System, Opera Phenix  High Content Screening System, the FMT 4000 In Vivo Screening System, the Mantra  Quantitative Pathology workstation, and the EnSpire  Multimode Plate Reader, in addition to providing technical expertise for advanced high-throughput quantitative imaging and analysis. Under this collaboration, PerkinElmer and GIS will jointly develop solutions that would integrate genomic sequencing and mutation data, with that of phenotypic data obtained in patient-derived models, as well as patient data in the clinic. These integrated solutions may help further enable translational research in oncology. ""This collaboration represents another milestone for GIS which has, over the recent few years, strategically collaborated with industry and clinical partners to spearhead and innovate research techniques in order to prioritize patient care. We are pleased to jointly open a laboratory with PerkinElmer focused on expanding GIS leadership in clinical cancer research and translational medicine,"" said Professor Ng Huck Hui, Executive Director, GIS.  On our part, GIS is committed to provide staff, equipment and reagents. We look forward to working closely with PerkinElmer, leveraging our respective strengths, in order to advance precision oncology and bring our research findings directly to patients.

The use of soy isoflavones and peptides to reduce microbial contamination could benefit the food industry, which currently uses synthetic additives to protect foods, says engineering professor Suresh Neethirajan, director of the BioNano Laboratory. U of G researchers used microfluidics and high-throughput screening to run millions of tests in a short period. They found that soy can be a more effective antimicrobial agent than the current roster of synthetic chemicals. The study is set to be published in the journal Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports this summer and is available online now.  Heavy use of chemical antimicrobial agents has caused some strains of bacteria to become very resistant to them, rendering them ineffective for the most part,  said Neethirajan.  Soy peptides and isoflavones are biodegradable, environmentally friendly and non-toxic. The demand for new ways to combat microbes is huge, and our study suggests soy-based isoflavones and peptides could be part of the solution.  Neethirajan and his team found soy peptides and isoflavones limited growth of some bacteria, including Listeria and Pseudomonas pathogens.  The really exciting thing about this study is that it shows promise in overcoming the issue of current antibiotics killing bacteria indiscriminately, whether they are pathogenic or beneficial. You need beneficial bacteria in your intestines to be able to properly process food,  he said. Peptides are part of proteins, and can act as hormones, hormone producers or neurotransmitters. Isoflavones act as hormones and control much of the biological activity on the cellular level. North America has one of the safest food sources in the world, said Neethirajan, but the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 48 million people in the U.S. suffer from some sort of food-borne illness every year.  In addition, some people are worried about the potential for long-term illnesses resulting from the use of synthetic chemicals,  Neethirajan said.  The use of soy peptides and isoflavones could combat bacteria and reduce these concerns.  The next step is for researchers to conduct large-scale tests, Neethirajan said.  We ve created a recipe for this to go ahead. This could be very beneficial to food processors, as well as the farmers who grow soybeans. ","Published: April 27, 2016"

The new structure gives scientists the first view of the glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a virus present on every continent except Antarctica. Not only does the research reveal important traits in LCMV, it also points to possible drug targets on LCMV s close relative: Lassa virus.  LCMV has been a beacon that has illuminated immunology and virology for decades,  said TSRI Professor Erica Ollmann Saphire.  This structure provides the missing roadmap to understand how to defend against its extremely lethal cousin, Lassa virus.  A Missing Puzzle Piece LCMV is a rodent-borne virus that rarely causes noticeable symptoms in people, although it can progress to cause dangerous swelling in the brain and spinal cord of immunocompromised patients and birth defects when contracted during pregnancy. Over the years, the virus has served as a tool for understanding how the body responds to viral infections.  LCMV was the experimental virus that has illuminated much of what we understand about immunology and virology,  said Saphire. These studies included work in Frank Dixon s lab at the fledgling Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. Saphire describes LCMV as a  beacon  for virology. TSRI Professor Michael Oldstone, co-author of the new study, did much of that foundational work on LCMV and has long recognized LCMV s similarity to Lassa virus, which looks identical under an electron microscope and shares 65 percent identity in the glycoprotein gene. Lassa is a much more deadly disease, however, causing thousands of deaths every year. While LCMV is a critical research tool, in the past 80 years scientists have been missing an important piece of the puzzle: a structural understanding of the proteins LCMV uses to initiate infection. A Melting Ice Cream Cone Solving that structure took 10 years and has led to interesting insights into members of the arenavirus family and how to stop them. For the study, researchers in Saphire s lab used a method called X-ray crystallography to build three-dimensional models of the viral machinery, called the surface glycoprotein, which LCMV uses to fuse with host cells. Building the models required the scientists to screen hundreds of crystals until they found one that was stable enough to yield the necessary data. When the team finally solved the structure, it showed that the surface glycoprotein is made up of a two-part  dimer.  The dimer is made of two identical complexes that point opposite directions It s like a yin and yang,  said Saphire. Two protein subunits make up each complex. One subunit, termed GP1, attaches onto the cell to be infected. The other subunit, called GP2, serves as the infection machinery, launching the process by which the virus fuses into the cell and hijacks it for its own purposes. The researchers compared each complex to an ice cream cone: GP1 forms the scoop of ice cream and GP2 forms a cone that cradles the scoop. Then there s a long drip (the N-terminal strand of GP1) running down the side of the cone.  This structure is extremely important scientifically because it s the first pre-fusion structure for any arenavirus glycoprotein,  said TSRI Senior Research Associate Kathryn Hastie, who was co-first author of the study with S bastien Igonet, formerly of TSRI, now at CALIXAR. A Missing Link The new view of the virus came with some big surprises. For one thing, the dimer suggested that LCMV s structure is a sort of  missing link  between two classes of viruses. Class I viruses, such as HIV, have a three-part  trimer  structure forming their fusion machinery while class II viruses, such as dengue, have a more rounded protein coat covering the whole virus. LCMV s dimer lies flat, like class II proteins, but it likely brings in a third subunit later, creating a class I-like trimer.  It has moving parts,  explained Saphire. She added that LCMV now looks like it sits between class I and class II viruses, making this structure a possible  fossil  of an intermediate evolutionary process. In work spearheaded by TSRI biologist Brian Sullivan, the researchers studied how LCMV assembles and interacts with cells. By adding individual mutations to the genes for LCMV s surface glycoprotein, the researchers identified five protein  residues  necessary for the virus to bind to host cells. These experiments also showed that, although the dimer is just a stage in the LCMV life cycle, it is a particularly critical stage. Disruption of the dimeric structure prevents viral growth. What This Means for Lassa Virus The researchers said these findings shed light on how this viral machine moves and rotates during infection, an action that could be blocked by drugs and antibodies. The new study also raises questions as to the degree of similarity between Lassa and LCMV. Could the dimer structure be particular to LCMV or is it a shared feature?  That information, and the fold of the GP1-GP2 complex, will be critical in the design of antibody cocktails for the treatment of Lassa fever,  said Hastie.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The software has revealed new information about the shape of the tracks and has found hints of a previously undiscovered fourth track-maker at the site.  The software was developed as part of a Natural Environments Research Council (NERC) Innovation Project awarded to Professor Matthew Bennett and Dr Marcin Budka in 2015 for forensic footprint analysis.  They have been developing techniques to enable modern footwear evidence to be captured in three-dimensions and analysed digitally to improve crime scene practice. Footprints reveal much about the individuals who made them; their body mass, height and their walking speed.  Footprints contain information about the way our ancestors moved,  explains Professor Bennett.  The tracks at Laetoli are the oldest in the world and show a line of footprints from our early ancestors, preserved in volcanic ash.  They provide a fascinating insight into how early humans walked.  The techniques we have been developing for use at modern crime scenes can also reveal something new about these ancient track sites.  The Laetoli tracks were discovered by Mary Leakey in 1976 and are thought to be around 3.6 million years old.  There are two parallel trackways on the site, where two ancient hominins walked across the surface.  One of these trackways was obscured when a third person followed the same path.  The merged trackway has largely been ignored by scientists over the last 40 years and the fierce debate about the walking style of the track-makers has predominately focused on the undisturbed trackway. By using the software developed through the NERC Innovation Project Professor Bennett and his colleagues have been able to decouple the tracks of this merged trail and reveal for the first time the shape of the tracks left by this mysterious third track-maker.  There is also an intriguing hint of a fourth track-maker at the site.  Bournemouth University is at the forefront of developing digital methods for the analysis of modern footprint evidence.  We re really pleased that we can use our techniques to capture new data from these extremely old footprints,  says Dr Marcin Budka who developed the software used in the study.   It means that we have effectively doubled the information that the palaeo-anthropological community has available for study of these hominin track-makers,  continues Dr Reynolds one of the co-authors of the study.   As well as making new discoveries about our early ancestors, we can apply this science to help modern society combat crime.  By digitising tracks at a crime scene we can preserve, share and study this evidence more easily,  says Sarita Morse who helped conceive the original analysis.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The findings, published in the journal Vaccine, suggest administering vaccinations in the morning, rather than the afternoon, could induce greater, and thus more protective, antibody responses. 24 general practices in the West Midlands, UK, were analysed between 2011 and 2013 in a cluster-randomised trial during the annual UK influenza vaccination programme. 276 adults aged over 65 were vaccinated against three strains of influenza, either in morning surgeries (09:00 - 11:00) or afternoon surgeries (15:00 - 17:00). In two of the three given influenza virus strains, those in the morning cohort saw a significantly larger increase in antibody concentration one month following vaccination, when compared with those in the afternoon cohort. In the third strain, there was no significant difference between morning and afternoon. Dr Anna Phillips, the Principal Investigator of the study from the School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Birmingham explained,  We know that there are fluctuations in immune responses throughout the day and wanted to examine whether this would extend to the antibody response to vaccination. Being able to see that morning vaccinations yield a more efficient response will not only help in strategies for flu vaccination, but might provide clues to improve vaccination strategies more generally.  The influenza vaccination is part of the seasonal vaccination programme carried out by general practices across the UK, and in many other countries, with a particular focus on patients over 65 years old. Despite this, the influenza virus is responsible for between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths each year worldwide. The age-related decline in immunity reduces the ability of older adults to produce adequate antibody responses following vaccination, compromising the given protection. Other interventions to improve outcomes of vaccination have been attempted with limited success, including exercise routines and additives to the vaccine itself. Professor Janet Lord, a co-investigator on the study from the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, said,  A significant amount of resource is used to try and prevent  flu infection each year, particularly in older adults, but less than half make enough antibody to be fully protected. Our results suggest that by shifting the time of those vaccinations to the morning we can improve their efficiency with no extra cost to the health service.  The team will now look to investigate further in a large scale study. This is important to see if the morning vaccination strategy benefits a wide range of over 65s including those with conditions like diabetes, liver and kidney disease that impair immunity. They will also look to see if the morning vaccination strategy is effective for the pneumococcal vaccine that protects against pneumonia; a vaccine recommended to all individuals aged 65 years old in the UK.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The study, published online today in JAMA Oncology, refutes concerns raised by research published in 2015 in the same journal. The earlier study, which focused on a small group of women, suggested that a class of drugs called anthracyclines might increase the risk for attention, perception and mood deficits, and other neuropsychological issues, as well as cognitive difficulties, such as memory loss. Anthracyclines   well-known examples are doxorubicin and epirubicin   are used to treat many types of breast cancer. But the 2015 research caused widespread uncertainty among physicians and their patients. In the new paper, UCLA researchers led by Dr. Patricia Ganz and Kathleen Van Dyk analyzed data from a study involving women with breast cancer. The women, who were tracked for an extended time beginning immediately after their treatment for cancer, received neuropsychological evaluations conducted up to four times, from three months to just under seven years later. To assess the effects of their treatment, the UCLA team categorized the patients into three groups: those who received anthracycline chemotherapy, those who received chemotherapy with drugs other than anthracyclines and those who received no chemotherapy at all. They then compared the women s scores on the neuropsychological tests across all four time points. The scientists found not only that all three groups of women had comparable scores in the areas of memory, processing speed and executive function (such as multitasking and thinking quickly under stress), but also that there were no differences in the women s cognitive functioning over time, for up to seven years following treatment.  These results are very exciting because we found no strong evidence linking anthracycline treatment to cognitive decline,  said Ganz, director of cancer prevention and control research at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.  If a physician is recommending anthracycline-based chemotherapy, we do not believe women should be excessively fearful that it is any more likely to cause cognitive difficulties than other types of chemotherapies.  The scientists plan to continue research focused on understanding the risks and mechanisms for cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer survivors and to investigate promising treatments for women who do experience cognitive decline.  Experiencing cognitive dysfunction after cancer and its treatment can be extremely disruptive to the lives of breast cancer survivors, and it is critical to better understand what factors, including treatment, might put someone at greater risk for these types of problems,  Van Dyk said.  These results bring us an important step further toward uncovering the influence of treatment on cognitive problems in these women.  The data analyzed by the UCLA researchers was from a longitudinal study that examined the effects of endocrine therapy on cognition in breast cancer survivors.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The new strategy is based on human RNA-binding proteins that normally help guide embryonic development. The research team adapted the proteins so that they can be easily targeted to desired RNA sequences.  You could use these proteins to do measurements of RNA generation, for example, or of the translation of RNA to proteins,  says Edward Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at the MIT Media Lab.  This could have broad utility throughout biology and bioengineering.  Unlike previous efforts to control RNA with proteins, the new MIT system consists of modular components, which the researchers believe will make it easier to perform a wide variety of RNA manipulations.  Modularity is one of the core design principles of engineering. If you can make things out of repeatable parts, you don t have to agonize over the design. You simply build things out of predictable, linkable units,  says Boyden, who is also a member of MIT s McGovern Institute for Brain Research. Boyden is the senior author of a paper describing the new system in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper s lead authors are postdoc Katarzyna Adamala and grad student Daniel Martin-Alarcon. Modular code Living cells contain many types of RNA that perform different roles. One of the best known varieties is messenger RNA (mRNA), which is copied from DNA and carries protein-coding information to cell structures called ribosomes, where mRNA directs protein assembly in a process called translation. Monitoring mRNA could tell scientists a great deal about which genes are being expressed in a cell, and tweaking the translation of mRNA would allow them to alter gene expression without having to modify the cell s DNA. To achieve this, the MIT team set out to adapt naturally occurring proteins called Pumilio homology domains. These RNA-binding proteins include sequences of amino acids that bind to one of the ribonucleotide bases or  letters  that make up RNA sequences   adenine (A), thymine (T), uracil (U), and guanine (G). In recent years, scientists have been working on developing these proteins for experimental use, but until now it was more of a trial-and-error process to create proteins that would bind to a particular RNA sequence.  It was not a truly modular code,  Boyden says, referring to the protein s amino acid sequences.  You still had to tweak it on a case-by-case basis. Whereas now, given an RNA sequence, you can specify on paper a protein to target it.  To create their code, the researchers tested out many amino acid combinations and found a particular set of amino acids that will bind each of the four bases at any position in the target sequence. Using this system, which they call Pumby (for Pumilio-based assembly), the researchers effectively targeted RNA sequences varying in length from six to 18 bases.  I think it s a breakthrough technology that they ve developed here,  says Robert Singer, a professor of anatomy and structural biology, cell biology, and neuroscience at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.  Everything that s been done to target RNA so far requires modifying the RNA you want to target by attaching a sequence that binds to a specific protein. With this technique you just design the protein alone, so there s no need to modify the RNA, which means you could target any RNA in any cell.  RNA manipulation In experiments in human cells grown in a lab dish, the researchers showed that they could accurately label mRNA molecules and determine how frequently they are being translated. First, they designed two Pumby proteins that would bind to adjacent RNA sequences. Each protein is also attached to half of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecule. When both proteins find their target sequence, the GFP molecules join and become fluorescent   a signal to the researchers that the target RNA is present. Furthermore, the team discovered that each time an mRNA molecule is translated, the GFP gets knocked off, and when translation is finished, another GFP binds to it, enhancing the overall fluorescent signal. This allows the researchers to calculate how often the mRNA is being read. This system can also be used to stimulate translation of a target mRNA. To achieve that, the researchers attached a protein called a translation initiator to the Pumby protein. This allowed them to dramatically increase translation of an mRNA molecule that normally wouldn t be read frequently.  We can turn up the translation of arbitrary genes in the cell without having to modify the genome at all,  Martin-Alarcon says. The researchers are now working toward using this system to label different mRNA molecules inside neurons, allowing them to test the idea that mRNAs for different genes are stored in different parts of the neuron, helping the cell to remain poised to perform functions such as storing new memories.  Until now it s been very difficult to watch what s happening with those mRNAs, or to control them,  Boyden says. These RNA-binding proteins could also be used to build molecular assembly lines that would bring together enzymes needed to perform a series of reactions that produce a drug or another molecule of interest.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The study, led by John Schwabe, Professor of Structural Biology and Head of Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and published in the journal eLIFE, focuses on three protein components which make up the core of the NuRD complex: MTA1, RBBP4 and HDAC1. The function of the NuRD complex is to control the amount of protein made by the cell   a process called gene regulation. Unregulated protein expression disrupts the equilibrium within a healthy cell and can lead to abnormal cell division and tumour growth. The NuRD complex components HDAC1 and MTA1 have both been shown to be present in high levels in certain cancers. A clearer picture of how these proteins interact may help to develop strategies to reduce the activity of the complex and bring the cell back into equilibrium. By examining the relationship between the three proteins, the team was able to show unprecedented detail about the 3D structure of the NuRD complex as well as to characterise the molecular nature of the  extensive interface  between MTA1 and RBBP4. The findings paint a clearer picture about how the complex is assembled and the way in which it interacts with the proteins that package the human genome in the cell. A deeper knowledge of how these complexes are recruited to genes will help to design treatments to combat aberrant gene activity.","Published: April 27, 2016"

Seasonal flu vaccines are currently developed and evaluated in part based on the ability to induce production of antibodies against HA. This standard, however, is based on research dating back to the 1970s. A research team led by Dr. Matthew J. Memoli at NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) set out to revisit this standard by carefully examining the body s response to influenza virus. The scientists tested 65 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 50, in a human challenge study a trial in which people are exposed to disease-causing pathogens under carefully controlled conditions. The team first measured levels of existing anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies to the virus in the participants  blood. The volunteers were then placed into 2 groups: those with high levels of anti-HA antibodies (25 participants) and those with low levels of anti-HA antibodies (40 participants). The volunteers received an intranasal dose of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in the clinical studies unit at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. This unit has stringent isolation and infection control features. The volunteers stayed in the study unit for a minimum of 9 days, where they were monitored by medical staff 24 hours a day. Participants were discharged after 2 days of negative flu tests. They then had 4 follow-up visits over 8 weeks. The results appeared in mBio on April 19, 2016. As expected, participants who had high levels of anti-HA antibodies when enrolled had a significantly lower incidence of influenza disease than those with low HA antibody levels (24% vs. 72%). Those with high levels of anti-HA antibodies were much less likely to shed virus, which enables the spread of virus to others. However, there was no significant difference in either the number or severity of symptoms between groups. In fact, most participants in both groups experienced symptoms (80% high vs. 88% low). These results suggest that anti-HA antibody levels may be useful for predicting protection against and spread of the disease, but may not predict who will experience flu symptoms. Participants with a high baseline level of anti-NA antibodies were similarly less likely to develop disease than those with a low level (44% vs. 100%). However, those with high levels of anti-NA antibodies also had less severe disease, a shorter duration of viral shedding and symptoms, and fewer, milder symptoms than those with low levels.  The idea behind this study was to re-evaluate the bar that was previously established for evaluating a person s immune response to influenza vaccines,  Memoli says. If these findings reflect naturally occurring flu infections, NA antibodies are the stronger factor for determining disease severity. HA and NA antibody levels together could provide better predictions than either factor alone. The team will continue to analyze the study samples to gain further insights.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The lab-grown mini-brains, which researchers say are truer to life and more cost-effective than similar research models, came about thanks to the son of two Johns Hopkins scientists and two other high school students who were doing summer research internships. They had the idea to make the equipment for growing the mini-brains with a 3-D printer. These so-called bioreactors, and the mini-brains they foster, should open other new and valuable windows into human brain development, brain disorders and drug testing   and perhaps even produce neurons for treatment of Parkinson s disease and other disorders, the investigators say.  We have been working for three years to develop a better research model of brain development, and it s fortunate we can now use this one to shed light on the major public health crisis posed by Zika infections,  says Hongjun Song, Ph.D. , professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine s Institute for Cell Engineering.  This more realistic, 3-D model confirms what we suspected based on what we saw in a two-dimensional cell culture: that Zika causes microcephaly   abnormally small brains and heads   mainly by attacking the neural progenitor cells that build the brain and turning them into virus factories.  In recent years, researchers in various fields have begun to grow tiny organs from human stem cells to get a better view of development and disease, and speed the search for new drugs. But existing techniques for creating and working with mini-brains were limiting because of the organ s complexity, Song says. Though the mini-brains themselves are about the size of a pinhead, the bioreactors where they grew were comparatively large, about the size of a soda can. That made working with the mini-brains expensive, given the high cost of the nutrients needed to cultivate human stem cells in the lab, he says, as well as the expense of chemical growth factors that guide the tissue to organize itself like a real brain. Few labs could afford to grow enough mini-brains to be useful for research, Song says, and those that did produced tissues with cells specialized for different parts of the brain mixed together at random. Song and his wife and research partner, Guo-li Ming, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology, neuroscience, and psychiatry and behavioral sciences, found a way to improve the bioreactors from an unexpected source: their son and two other high school students, from New York and Texas, who spent a summer working in the lab. The students had worked with 3-D printers and thought they could be the key to producing a better bioreactor, one that would fit over commonly used 12-well laboratory plates and spin the liquid and cells inside at just the right speed to allow the cells to form brains.  Of course, it wasn t that simple, Song says. Graduate student Xuyu Qian and postdoctoral fellow Ha Nam Nguyen, Ph.D., spent years determining factors such as what that optimum speed was, as well as which chemicals and growth factors should be added at what times to yield the desired result.  The group has so far used the new bioreactor, dubbed Spin?, to make three types of mini-brains mimicking the front, middle and back of a human brain. They used the forebrain, the first mini-brain with the six layers of brain cell types found in the human cortex, for the current study on Zika.   One thing the mini-brains allowed us to do was to model the effects of Zika virus exposure during different stages of pregnancy,  says Ming.  If infection occurred very early in development, the virus mostly infected the mini-brains  neural progenitor cells, and the effects were very severe. After a while, the mini-brains would stop growing and disintegrate. At a later stage, mimicking the second trimester, Zika still preferentially infected neural progenitor cells, but it also affected some neurons. Growth was slower, and the cortex was thinner than in noninfected brains.  These different effects correspond to what clinicians have seen in infants born to women who contracted Zika during pregnancy, as well as miscarriages, she notes, namely that the earlier in pregnancy Zika infection occurs, the more severe its effects. The research group s next step will be to test drugs already FDA-approved for other conditions on the mini-brains to see whether one might provide some protection against Zika. And they included 3-D printing files for Spin? in the new paper so that researchers anywhere can print their own bioreactors with just a few hundred dollars in materials. Song says one possible future use could be to grow so-called dopaminergic neurons for transplant, to replace those that die off in Parkinson s disease.  This is the next frontier of stem cell biology,  he says.","Published: April 27, 2016"

The finding could help researchers better understand dopamine's role in movement-related disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The researchers used a new, more precise technique to record the activity of dopamine neurons at two regions within the brain's striatum, which oversees action planning, motivation and reward perception. The researchers found that while all of the neurons carried signals needed to learn and plan movement, one of the nerve bundles, the one that went to the region called the dorsomedial striatum, also carried a signal that could be used to control movements. See Also: Rare neurons enable mental flexibility The work is published online in the journal Nature Neuroscience. ""What we learned from this study is that dopamine neurons that go to one part of the brain act differently than dopamine neurons that go to another part of the brain,"" said Ilana Witten, assistant professor of psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. ""This is contrary to what has been the mainstream view of dopamine neurons."" The research may shed light on how Parkinson's disease, which involves the destruction of dopamine neurons in the dorsomedial striatum, deprives patients of the ability to move. Previous studies have failed to find a direct link between dopamine neuron activity and the control of movement or actions. Instead, the mainstream view suggested an indirect role for dopamine: the neurons make it possible for us to learn which actions are likely to lead to a rewarding experience, which in turn enables us to plan to take that action. When dopamine neurons are destroyed due to Parkinson's disease, the individual cannot learn to plan actions and thus cannot move. The new study affirmed the role of dopamine in reward-based learning, but also found that in the dorsomedial striatum, dopamine neurons can play a direct role in movement. The researchers used a method for measuring neuron activity at very precise locations in the brain. They measured the activity at the ends of neurons (where dopamine is released into the synapse between two cells) in two locations in the striatum: the nucleus accumbens, known to be involved in processing reward, and the dorsomedial striatum, known for evaluating and generating actions. Until recently, it has been difficult to measure dopamine neuron activity in these regions due to the small size of the regions and the fact that there are many other neurons present that are delivering other neurotransmitters to the same areas of the brain. Learn More: Synchronized brain waves enable rapid learning To restrict their measurements to only dopamine-carrying neurons, the researchers used mice whose brains carry genetically altered cells that glow green when active. The mice also contain a second gene that ensured that the glowing could only occur when dopamine was present. The researchers then recorded neuron activity from either the nucleus accumbens or the dorsomedial striatum by inserting a very thin optical fiber into each region to record the fluorescing dopamine cells in only the desired regions. Once the ability to measure neuron activity was in place, the researchers gave the mice a task that involved both reward-based learning as well as movement. The task involved presenting the mice with two levers, one of which, when pressed, gave a drink of sweetened water. Through trial and error, the mice learned which lever would give the reward. During the task, the researchers recorded their brain activity. The task is analogous to playing slot machines at a casino. Picture yourself at a casino with two slot machines in front of you. You pull the lever on the machine to your left and it spits out some coins. Your brain learns that the left lever leads to a reward, so you plan and execute an action: you pull the left lever again. After a few more pulls on the left lever without a reward, you switch to the machine on the right. When an action is rewarding, you are likely to remember it, an important step in learning. The difference between how much reward you expect, and how much you get, is also important, because it tells you whether or not something is new and how much you should pay attention to it. Researchers call this gap between your predicted reward and the reward you actually get the ""reward-prediction error"" and consider it an important teaching signal. Don't Miss: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity By matching the mice's actions to the dopamine activity in their brains during these tasks, the researchers could determine which parts of the brain were active during reward-based learning, and which parts were active when choosing to press a lever. Assistance with computational modeling of the mice's behaviors was provided by Nathaniel Daw, a professor of the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Psychology. The researchers found that the dopamine neurons that innervate the nucleus accumbens and the dorsomedial striatum did indeed encode reward-prediction cues, which is consistent with previous findings. But they also found that in the dorsomedial striatum, the dopamine neurons carried information about what actions the animal is going to take. ""This idea was that dopamine neurons carry this reward-prediction error signal, and that could indirectly affect movement or actions, because if you don't have this, you won't correctly learn which actions to perform,"" Witten said. ""We show that while this is true, it is certainly not the whole story. There is also a layer where dopamine is directly coding movement or actions."" Nathan Parker, a graduate student in the Witten lab who designed and conducted the experiments and is first author on the paper, added that new findings were made possible both by the improvements in recording of neurons and by the experimental design, which gave researchers a detailed evaluation of neuron activity during a relatively complex task. Additional research assistance was provided by Princeton postdoctoral research associates Courtney Cameron and Junuk Lee, and graduate student Jung Yoon Choi. Research Specialist Joshua Taliaferro, Class of 2015, begin working on the project as part of his senior thesis. The study also involved contributions from Thomas Davidson, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. In addition to possibly explaining the clinical observations in Parkinson's disease, the study addresses the more general question of how dopamine can be involved in so many functions in the brain, Witten said. ""We think that some of the way that dopaminergic neurons achieve such diverse functions in the brain is by having specific roles based on their anatomical target."" Related: Stem cell study reveals how Parkinson's spreads Naoshige Uchida, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, said the results challenge long-held views and open up new directions of research. ""This study by the Witten lab elegantly shows that the activity of some dopamine neurons is modulated by the direction of motion,"" Uchida said. ""More importantly, they found some of the clearest evidence indicating the heterogeneity of dopamine neurons: A specific population of dopamine neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum encodes movement direction more so compared to another population projecting to the ventral striatum."" Uchida continued, ""A similar phenomenon has also been reported in an independent study in non-human primates (Kim, et al., Cell, 2015), suggesting that the Witten lab finding is more universal and not specific to mice. This is particularly important because dopamine has been implicated in Parkinson's disease but how dopamine regulates movement remains a large mystery.""

This study suggests there s a sensitive period when the brain responds more to maternal support,  said first author Joan Luby, MD, a Washington University child psychiatrist at St. Louis Children s Hospital. Learn More: Prenatal exposure to common household chemicals linked with substantial drop in child IQ The study is published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers studied a series of brain scans of children from preschool through early adolescence, finding a sharper rise in the volume of the hippocampus in the kids whose mothers supported and nurtured them during the preschool years. That region of the brain is critical to learning, memory and regulating emotions. In contrast, the hippocampus appeared smaller in adolescents whose mothers were less supportive during the preschool period, even if their mothers became more supportive in elementary or middle school. The new research builds on previous findings by the same investigators that showed a link between maternal nurturing and a larger hippocampus observed in brain scans conducted at the time the children reached school age. In the new study, the researchers were able to observe steady growth in the hippocampus of children with supportive mothers across multiple brain scans taken at different time periods, with 127 children receiving three MRI scans each from the time they first started school through early adolescence.  The parent-child relationship during the preschool period is vital, even more important than when the child gets older,  Luby said.  We think that s due to greater plasticity in the brain when kids are younger, meaning that the brain is affected more by experiences very early in life. That suggests it s vital that kids receive support and nurturing during those early years.  The researchers also found that the growth trajectory in the hippocampus was associated with healthier emotional functioning when the children entered their teen years. When parental nurturing didn t begin until later in childhood, such support didn t provide the same benefits in brain growth, the researchers noted. See Also:  Delayed remembering : kids can remember tomorrow what they forgot today  This finding highlights the critical importance of caregiving in sculpting aspects of brain development that are important to how children function as they mature,  said co-author Deanna M. Barch, PhD, a Washington University psychologist and chair of the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. The researchers measured nurturing in mothers by closely observing and scoring videotaped interactions between mothers and their children. The investigators observed mothers and children under moderately stressful conditions, explained Luby, the Samuel and Mae S. Ludwig Professor of Child Psychiatry and director of Washington University s Early Emotional Development Program.  The mother is asked to complete a task while we give the child an attractive gift to open, but we don t allow it to be opened right away,  she said.  It s a stressful condition like those that happen multiple times each day in any given family, like when you re cooking dinner and a child wants attention. The child needs something, but you have something else to do, so it challenges your parenting skills.  Parents who are able to maintain their composure and complete assigned tasks while still offering emotional support to their children are rated as more nurturing and supportive. Parents who dismiss their children, or behave in punitive ways during the test, receive lower marks for support. Don't Miss: Can drinking alcohol harm the child before the mother knows she is pregnant? Small changes in support indicated big differences in outcomes, Luby said. In examining the brain scans, the researchers found that children whose mothers were more supportive than average had increases in growth of the hippocampus that were more than two times greater than in those whose mothers were slightly below average on the nurturing scale. Luby believes the findings suggest it may be possible to help children do better in school, cope better in life and develop emotionally by helping parents learn to provide more support and nurturing early in the lives of their children.  Early maternal support affects the child s brain development,  she said.  We also know that providing support to parents can have a positive impact on other behavioral and adaptive outcomes in children. So we have a very logical reason to encourage policies that help parents become more supportive.  Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

These are the findings of a large-scale international study in over 298,000 people, conducted by VU Amsterdam professors Meike Bartels (Genetics and Wellbeing) and Philipp Koellinger (Genoeconomics). The researchers found three genetic variants for happiness, two variants that can account for differences in symptoms of depression, and eleven locations on the human genome that could account for varying degrees of neuroticism. The genetic variants for happiness are mainly expressed in the central nervous system and the adrenal glands and pancreatic system. The results were published in the journal Nature Genetics. Genetic influences on happiness Prior twin and family research using information from the Netherlands Twin Register and other sources has shown that individual differences in happiness and well-being can be partially ascribed to genetic differences between people. Happiness and wellbeing are the topics of an increasing number of scientific studies in a variety of academic disciplines. Policy makers are increasingly focusing on wellbeing, drawing primarily on the growing body of evidence suggesting that wellbeing is a factor in mental and physical health. VU Amsterdam professor Meike Bartels explains:  This study is both a milestone and a new beginning: A milestone because we are now certain that there is a genetic aspect to happiness and a new beginning because the three variants that we know are involved account for only a small fraction of the differences between human beings. We expect that many variants will play a part.  Locating these variants will also allow us to better study the interplay between nature and nurture, as the environment is certainly responsible   to some extent   for differences in the way people experience happiness.  Further research is now possible These findings, which resulted from a collaborative project with the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, are available for follow-up research. This will create an increasingly clearer picture of what causes differences in happiness. Professor Bartels points out that  The genetic overlap with depressive symptoms that we have found is also a breakthrough. This shows that research into happiness can also offer new insights into the causes of one of the greatest medical challenges of our time: depression . The research effort headed by professors Bartels and Koellinger is the largest ever study into the genetic variants for happiness. It was successfully completed thanks to the assistance of 181 researchers from 145 scientific institutes, including medical centres in Rotterdam, Groningen, Leiden and Utrecht, and the universities of Rotterdam and Groningen.","Published: April 26, 2016"

The cell death regulatory protein FLIP is believed to be a key regulator of tumour cell survival that promotes tumour growth and resistance to standard therapies. The award will allow the partners to accelerate the optimisation and early development of first-in-class small molecule inhibitors that block FLIP s pro-survival functions. The inhibitors invented by the team have already shown efficacy in pre-clinical models of NSCLC, a disease that represents around 90% of all lung cancers diagnosed and accounts for the highest rate of cancer death worldwide, with over one million deaths annually. This next phase of the collaboration will allow the completion of pre-clinical studies and progression of the inhibitors to first in human phase 1 clinical evaluation following regulatory approval. Trevor Perrior, Research Director at Domainex, commented:  We are delighted to continue our successful partnership with Dr. Daniel Longley, Prof. Timothy Harrison and their team at Queen s University Belfast. The additional funding secured from the Wellcome Trust is a clear endorsement of the strength of the integrated drug discovery platform of Domainex to deliver compounds with the potential to provide life-changing treatments for serious diseases. Domainex will continue to provide its expertise in medicinal chemistry, ADME and physicochemical profiling. We remain deeply committed to supporting academic translational research. We look forward to working further with Dan, Tim and their colleagues to take our jointly-discovered compounds into patients.  Dr Daniel Longley added:  Resistance to current treatments for non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers is a major clinical problem. Our work at Queen s has demonstrated that FLIP is frequently overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers and that this promotes resistance to chemotherapy. More recently, we have found that FLIP also promotes resistance to radiotherapy.

Soybean derivatives are already a mainstay in food products, such as cooking oils, cheeses, ice cream, margarine, food spreads, canned foods and baked goods. The use of soy isoflavones and peptides to reduce microbial contamination could benefit the food industry, which currently uses synthetic additives to protect foods, says engineering professor Suresh Neethirajan, director of the BioNano Laboratory. U of G researchers used microfluidics and high-throughput screening to run millions of tests in a short period. They found that soy can be a more effective antimicrobial agent than the current roster of synthetic chemicals. The study is set to be published in the journal Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports this summer and is available online now.  Heavy use of chemical antimicrobial agents has caused some strains of bacteria to become very resistant to them, rendering them ineffective for the most part,  said Neethirajan.  Soy peptides and isoflavones are biodegradable, environmentally friendly and non-toxic. The demand for new ways to combat microbes is huge, and our study suggests soy-based isoflavones and peptides could be part of the solution.  Neethirajan and his team found soy peptides and isoflavones limited growth of some bacteria, including Listeria and Pseudomonas pathogens.  The really exciting thing about this study is that it shows promise in overcoming the issue of current antibiotics killing bacteria indiscriminately, whether they are pathogenic or beneficial. You need beneficial bacteria in your intestines to be able to properly process food,  he said. Peptides are part of proteins, and can act as hormones, hormone producers or neurotransmitters. Isoflavones act as hormones and control much of the biological activity on the cellular level. North America has one of the safest food sources in the world, said Neethirajan, but the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 48 million people in the U.S. suffer from some sort of food-borne illness every year.  In addition, some people are worried about the potential for long-term illnesses resulting from the use of synthetic chemicals,  Neethirajan said.  The use of soy peptides and isoflavones could combat bacteria and reduce these concerns.  The next step is for researchers to conduct large-scale tests, Neethirajan said.  We ve created a recipe for this to go ahead. This could be very beneficial to food processors, as well as the farmers who grow soy beans. ","Published: April 26, 2016"

Vitaliy Borisov, Senior Researcher, Doctor of Biological Sciences, Professor of Russian Academy of Sciences, Research Institute Fellow Physico-Chemical Biology named after AN Belozersky State University and one of the authors, explains that breathing E. coli uses special enzymes, which are absent in the human body. This means that the opening of the scientists can contribute to the creation of new drugs, which will be detrimental to act on the bacteria without harming the person. The energy for the life of any organism comes from food, and is generated by means of redox processes in the body. The food is converted into energy immediately, not directly but through intermediaries. First, the complex molecules are decomposed into simpler: proteins are decomposed into amino acids, fats - fatty acids to carbohydrates - to monosaccharides. Oxidation of simpler molecules releases energy, and all of it is contained in the electrons. The electron is passed to the respiratory chain in the so-called reducing equivalents (compound carrying electrons). They are NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and ubiquinol, also known as coenzyme Q. These two basic recovery equivalent fully cope with the processing of food: NADH is a water soluble compound and ubiquinol - fat soluble. Membranous enzymes of reducing equivalents and accept electrons is transferred to molecular oxygen. The terminal cytochrome oxidase - the main membrane enzyme responsible for the human mitochondrial respiration and was thought before, for the breath of E. coli, too. The scheme is simple oxidases action: transferring electrons to molecular oxygen, reducing equivalents are oxidized again, with the result that is generated ""energy currency"" of the cell - the proton-motive force. ""If you stop breathing, we'll die just because oxygen will not flow to the oxidase, and it will not produce energy"", - says Vitaly Borisov.  The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) live in the gastrointestinal tract, where a lot of hydrogen sulfide produced by attenuating mitochondrial respiration. Free hydrogen sulfide inhibits cytochrome oxidase work. Its concentration in the hundreds of times greater than the minimum concentration required for blocking this essential enzyme. This would seem to mean that ""breathing"" bacteria E. soline can, but in spite of all the bacteria somehow survive in the intestine. The researchers hypothesized that the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the breath is still possible, but due to other oxidase. The fact that the breath in people and bacteria occur in different ways. Every cell in our body ""breathes"" through the work of only the cytochrome-c oxidase, others we have not. And E. coli bacteria oxidase has two types of cytochrome bo type (analog of ""human"" cytochrome c oxidase) and cytochromes completely different-bd.  ""Our hypothesis was that the type oxidase bd (bd-I and bd-II) are more resistant to inhibition by hydrogen sulfide than type cytochrome bo , - Vitali Borisov commented. To test this hypothesis required to learn how sulfide present in the environment affects the growth of the bacteria cells E. coli, in which the respiratory chain has only one terminal oxidase (bd-I, bd-II or bo). We used a variety of biochemical, biophysical and microbiological methods and approaches, as well as the method of obtaining directed mutations. The hypothesis was fully confirmed. ""Bo oxidase activity is completely inhibited by the hydrogen sulfide, while at work oxidases bd H 2 S is not valid. Thus, in order to successfully produce the main types of ""energy currency"" in a high content of hydrogen sulfide, the representatives of the intestinal microflora should use a unique type of terminal oxidases, which is missing in the cells of humans and animals, ""- says Vitaly Borisov. The discovery could be used in the future to develop medicines that regulate the intestinal microflora and relieving it from harmful bacteria. Because human cells do not contain oxidase type bd, it becomes relevant the question of the ability to combat disease-causing bacteria, without causing harm to the human body. For example, the bacterium causing tuberculosis, primarily membrane enzyme, which is also a type oxidase bd, quickly gaining resistance to classical antibiotics. Through this study there was the prospect of a new type of antibiotics ""overlying oxygen"" only harmful bacteria cells, not human cells. ","Published: April 26, 2016"

Telomere score is calculated according to telomere length of white blood cells (T-lymphocytes). This result is based on the average T-lymphocyte telomere length compared to the American population at the same age range. The higher the telomere score, the  younger  the cells. In September 2015, then 44 year-old CEO of BioViva USA Inc. Elizabeth Parrish received two of her own company s experimental gene therapies: one to protect against loss of muscle mass with age, another to battle stem cell depletion responsible for diverse age-related diseases and infirmities. The treatment was originally intended to demonstrate the safety of the latest generation of the therapies. But if early data is accurate, it is already the world s first successful example of telomere lengthening via gene therapy in a human individual. Gene therapy has been used to lengthen telomeres before in cultured cells and in mice, but never in a human patient. Telomeres are short segments of DNA which cap the ends of every chromosome, acting as  buffers  against wear and tear.  They shorten with every cell division, eventually getting too short to protect the chromosome, causing the cell to malfunction and the body to age. In September 2015, telomere data taken from Parrish s white blood cells by SpectraCell s specialised clinical testing laboratory in Houston, Texas, immediately before therapies were administered, revealed that Parrish s telomeres were unusually short for her age, leaving her vulnerable to age-associated diseases earlier in life. In March 2016, the same tests were taken again by SpectraCell revealed that her telomeres had lengthened by approximately 20 years, from 6.71kb to 7.33kb. This implies that Parrish s white blood cells (leukocytes) have become biologically younger. These findings were independently verified by the Brussels-based non-profit HEALES (HEalthy Life Extension Company), and the Biogerontology Research Foundation, a UK-based charity committed to combating age-related diseases. Parrish s reaction:  Current therapeutics offer only marginal benefits for people suffering from diseases of aging. Additionally, lifestyle modification has limited impact for treating these diseases. Advances in biotechnology is the best solution, and if these results are anywhere near accurate, we ve made history , Parrish said. Bioviva will continue to monitor Parrish s blood for months and years to come. Meanwhile, BioViva will be testing new gene therapies and combination gene therapies to restore age related damage. It remains to be seen whether the success in leukocytes can expanded to other tissues and organs, and repeated in future patients. For now all the answers lie in the cells of Elizabeth Parrish,  patient zero  of restorative gene therapy. Since her first gene therapy injections BioViva has received global interest from both the scientific and investment communities. Earlier this month BioViva became a portfolio company of Deep Knowledge Life Sciences (DKLS), a London-based investment fund which aims to accelerate the development of biotechnologies for healthy longevity. Dmitry Kaminskiy, founding partner of DKLS, said  BioViva has the potential to create breakthroughs in human gene therapy research, while leapfrogging companies in the biotech market.

MSOAC is striving to develop an outcomes measure that addresses the critical need for a more sensitive way to detect the benefit of potential treatments that slow or reverse progressive disability in people with MS.  Key to the success of every C-Path consortium is the sharing of expertise and data,  stated Lynn Hudson, PhD, C-Path s Chief Science Officer and Executive Director of MSOAC.  The sharing of both treatment and placebo arm data by MSOAC member companies is unparalleled.  Nearly 15,000 records from active treatment and inactive placebo arms, a rich source of performance measures and related clinical information, are currently being analyzed for regulatory qualification of a new instrument to measure disability and progression in MS. The measurement tool, which will also incorporate the viewpoint of people living with MS, will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for regulatory qualification, a step toward validating its acceptance for use as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials.  We re pleased to enable investigators around the world to access previously unavailable data through the new placebo data platform, which should increase our understanding of MS,  notes Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society.  MSOAC is the latest in a long line of special initiatives undertaken by the Society to enhance the conduct of MS clinical trials and thereby speed the development of new therapies for all forms of MS. By bringing multiple stakeholders to the table, including people with MS, we have been able to achieve broad support for our goal of better and faster trials.  Prior to pooling data, standardization is essential. The consortium began by developing another tool a data standard for MS in collaboration with the leading global standards organization the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Released in 2014, this therapeutic area standard allows data from multiple MS trials to be grouped for reporting, analysis, and regulatory submissions. As another advantage for the MS community, the MS data standard will help drug sponsors meet next year s FDA requirement for implementation of CDISC data standards in individual submissions. The MS data is housed at C-Path s Data Collaboration Center (DCC), which was founded to provide large-scale data solutions for scientific research in a neutral, non-competitive environment. Currently, DCC s data platform securely hosts data from 83 clinical trials, representing over 49,000 subjects, over 100 million data points, and six different therapeutic areas. The DCC s policies around individual patient-level data meet or exceed data privacy and human subject research protection requirements. A review board will screen requests for access to the MS placebo arm database, using the process established for another successful C-Path effort in sharing placebo data, namely, the Alzheimer s disease database. Investigators may apply by supplying a brief description of the research plan and agreeing to the terms and conditions; details and forms are available on the MSOAC website.","Published: April 26, 2016"

A new study by UCLA life scientists has found that hundreds of those genes can be damaged by fructose, a sugar that s common in the Western diet, in a way that could lead to those diseases. However, the researchers discovered good news as well: An omega-3 fatty acid known as docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, seems to reverse the harmful changes produced by fructose.  DHA changes not just one or two genes; it seems to push the entire gene pattern back to normal, which is remarkable,  said Xia Yang, a senior author of the study and a UCLA assistant professor of integrative biology and physiology.  And we can see why it has such a powerful effect.  DHA occurs naturally in the membranes of our brain cells, but not in a large enough quantity to help fight diseases.  The brain and the body are deficient in the machinery to make DHA; it has to come through our diet,  said Fernando Gomez-Pinilla, a UCLA professor of neurosurgery and of integrative biology and physiology, and co-senior author of the paper. DHA strengthens synapses in the brain and enhances learning and memory. It is abundant in wild salmon (but not in farmed salmon) and, to a lesser extent, in other fish and fish oil, as well as walnuts, flaxseed, and fruits and vegetables, said Gomez-Pinilla, who also is a member of UCLA s Brain Injury Research Center. Americans get most of their fructose in foods that are sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, an inexpensive liquid sweetener made from corn starch, and from sweetened drinks, syrups, honey and desserts. The Department of Agriculture estimates that Americans consumed an average of about 27 pounds of high-fructose corn syrup in 2014. Fructose is also found is in most baby food and in fruit, although the fiber in fruit substantially slows the body s absorption of the sugar   and fruit contains other healthy components that protect the brain and body, Yang said. To test the effects of fructose and DHA, the researchers trained rats to escape from a maze, and then randomly divided the animals into three groups. For the next six weeks, one group of rats drank water with an amount of fructose that would be roughly equivalent to a person drinking a liter of soda per day. The second group was given fructose water and a diet rich in DHA. The third received water without fructose and no DHA. After the six weeks, the rats were put through the maze again. The animals that had been given only the fructose navigated the maze about half as fast than the rats that drank only water   indicating that the fructose diet had impaired their memory. The rats that had been given fructose and DHA, however, showed very similar results to those that only drank water   which strongly suggests that the DHA eliminated fructose s harmful effects. Other tests on the rats revealed more major differences: The rats receiving a high-fructose diet had much higher blood glucose, triglycerides and insulin levels than the other two groups. Those results are significant because in humans, elevated glucose, triglycerides and insulin are linked to obesity, diabetes and many other diseases. The research team sequenced more than 20,000 genes in the rats  brains, and identified more than 700 genes in the hypothalamus (the brain s major metabolic control center) and more than 200 genes in the hippocampus (which helps regulate learning and memory) that were altered by the fructose. The altered genes they identified, the vast majority of which are comparable to genes in humans, are among those that interact to regulate metabolism, cell communication and inflammation. Among the conditions that can be caused by alterations to those genes are Parkinson s disease, depression, bipolar disorder, and other brain diseases, said Yang, who also is a member of UCLA s Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences. Of the 900 genes they identified, the researchers found that two in particular, called Bgn and Fmod, appear to be among the first genes in the brain that are affected by fructose. Once those genes are altered, they can set off a cascade effect that eventually alters hundreds of others, Yang said. That could mean that Bgn and Fmod would be potential targets for new drugs to treat diseases that are caused by altered genes in the brain, she added. The research also uncovered new details about the mechanism fructose uses to disrupt genes. The scientists found that fructose removes or adds a biochemical group to cytosine, one of the four nucleotides that make up DNA. (The others are adenine, thymine and guanine.) This type of modification plays a critical role in turning genes  on  or  off. ","Published: April 26, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/super-wheat-brought-closer-to-reality-210807,Super Wheat Brought Closer to Reality Scientists at the John Innes Centre  JIC  and The Sainsbury Laboratory  TSL  have pioneered a new gene detecting technology which  if deployed correctly could lead to the creation of a new elite variety of wheat with durable resistance to disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Working with fellow scientists at TSL, Dr Brande Wulff from the JIC developed the new technology called  MutRenSeq  which accurately pinpoints the location of disease resistance genes in large plant genomes and which has reduced the time it takes to clone these genes in wheat from 5 to 10 years down to just two. Effective use of these resistance genes in wheat could increase global yields and vastly reduce the need for agro-chemical applications. A resistance gene acts like a simple lock keeping the pathogen from infecting the plant. Over time, as many breeders and growers have found, pathogens can adapt to overcome an individual resistance gene and infect the plant. A stack of multiple genes acts like a multi-lever lock, making it much harder for new pathogens to evade the crop s defences. Dr Brande Wulff said:  The challenge has always been finding enough resistance genes to create an effective multi-gene  stack  against virulent pathogens like wheat stem rust and wheat yellow rust which, if left unchallenged, can decimate crops across the world. With the advent of this new technology, the development of a new variety of wheat with strong resistance to one or more of these pathogens is now within reach.  Using this technology, scientists can very quickly locate resistance genes from crops, clone them and stack multiple resistance genes into one elite variety. MutRenSeq is a three step method for quickly isolating resistance genes based on (i) creating mutants from resistant wild type wheat plants and identifying those with loss of disease resistance, (ii) sequencing genomes of both wild type resistant plants and those which have lost resistance, and finally (iii) comparing these genes in mutants and wild types to identify the exact mutations responsible for the loss of disease resistance. Dr Wulff collaborated with Drs Evans Lagudah and Sam Periyannan at CSIRO Agriculture in Australia, who had used a chemical (EMS) to cause mutations in the genomes of a sample of resistant wild type wheat plants. They then screened the mutant population by infecting it with the pathogen, to identify mutants that were no longer resistant. The hypothesis was that these mutants would all share mutations in a common gene, which must be the resistance gene. They compared the sequences of the mutants to one another and looked for the overlap. Sequencing one mutant will identify several hundred mutations - each mutation indicating a candidate gene. However, by comparing two mutants to each other, and looking for the overlap, the list is reduced from a few hundred, to just a handful. Comparing three or more mutants, enabled the team to identify an overlap of only a single gene in the susceptible wheat plants. Dr Wulff said:  With MutRenSeq we can find the needle in the haystack: we can reduce the complexity of finding resistance genes by zeroing in from 124,000 genes, to just a single candidate gene.  In the first test run of MutRenSeq, Dr Wulff s team successfully isolated a well-known resistance gene, Sr33, in a fraction of the time it had previously taken to do this by conventional breeding techniques. Following this success, the team then cloned two important stem rust resistance genes,Sr22 and Sr45, which scientists have until now, been unable to isolate successfully.  According to the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO) wheat is grown on more land area than any other commercial crop (approximately 240m hectares) and continues to be the most important food grain source for humans. Farmers in the west rely on pesticides to control pathogens in wheat but fewer and fewer agrochemicals are available for use due to concerns over their environmental impact. Farmers in poorer countries have little or no access to these chemicals and are highly vulnerable to disease-related losses, which can lead to hunger and malnutrition. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 31 countries in East and North Africa, the Near East, Central and South Asia, which account for more than 37 percent of global wheat production area and 30% of global production, are at risk of wheat rust diseases including the Ug99 race of stem rust and Yr27 strain of yellow rust. An alternative to pesticide-use is to build resistance into the crop by introducing resistant genes from other varieties of wheat into elite varieties. Dr Wulff said:  Finding and cloning these crucial genes has up until now been like looking for a needle in a haystack. The wheat genome is huge and contains many repeats.  This new technology will transform this part of the scientific process.  Though the next stage of stacking large numbers of genes correctly in the complex wheat genome is not easy and may take time, the advent of this new gene-detecting technology has brought the creation of one or more new elite varieties of wheat with long-awaited durable disease resistance much closer.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/doubling-down-on-dengue-192769,Doubling Down on Dengue HMS researchers have discovered two ways a compound blocks dengue virus   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Harvard Medical School scientists have found a compound that in laboratory dishes blocks the dengue virus in two ways, raising hopes for a future drug whose dual activity could suppress the otherwise likely emergence of drug resistance. Spread by mosquitoes, dengue belongs to the same family of viruses as Zika, whose emerging strain has just been linked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to severe birth defects. Like Zika, dengue virus has no antiviral drugs to prevent illness or stop its spread. Dengue virus infects more than 300 million people a year worldwide, causing no symptoms in some people but flu-like misery or dangerous hemorrhagic fevers in others. The compound found by Yang s team, GNF-2, keeps the dengue virus from infiltrating and overwhelming cells in the body. It does this by blocking its known kinase target inside the cell and by also inhibiting a viral target found on the surface of the virus. Yang considers the discovery of GNF-2 to be serendipitous.  We had screened a library of known kinase inhibitors and had a  problem compound  where we could not explain all the antiviral activity that we were seeing based on just the effect it had on the host kinase it normally targets,  Yang said. That instance of serendipity was followed by years of experiments in collaboration with scientists across HMS, in particular, Stephen Harrison and Nathanael Gray, both professors in the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology. The dengue work was carried out through one of three Centers for Excellence in Translational Research at HMS, a National Institutes of Health effort designed to move discoveries about emerging infections closer to clinical applications in diagnosis, treatment and prevention.  The compound was inhibiting the virus by targeting the host kinase, but then somehow it also was binding to the surface of the virion, and then preventing entry of the virus,  Yang said.  That s not at all what we thought we would find when we did the original kinase inhibitor screen.  GNF-2 had surfaced in a chemical screen Yang s lab performed in 2007, one compound among many showing some activity against dengue virus. Viruses invade host cells and replicate there, so jamming one or both processes could mean relieving the symptoms of infection and preventing transmission of the virus. Yang said they zeroed in on host factors as antiviral targets because it seemed likely that related viruses would rely on the same or similar host factors to replicate. If they found a compound that worked against one virus, they surmised, it might work against others in the same family. Cellular kinases seemed likely to be required by the virus because they regulate most cellular processes. Yang also hoped that finding a way to help the host cell repel the virus would overcome the virus  ability to thwart antiviral drugs. Viruses evolve so frequently that their elements are moving targets for antiviral drugs. Tamiflu, for example, has lost much of its efficacy in the years since it was aimed against influenza, Yang said. By comparison, combination therapies, such as those used against HIV, can be successful because they fight the virus on more than one front. In the case of dengue and other understudied and emerging viruses, resources to develop the kinds of drug combinations that have proven effective against HIV and hepatitis C virus may not be available. In these cases, a single drug that acts by targeting multiple viral processes simultaneously may provide an alternate way to suppress resistance.  Dengue s been an understudied virus,  Yang said.  Everything changed when the NIH made it a priority pathogen because the number of severe infections where people get very sick has been increasing. Like Zika right now or Ebola a few years back, it s hard to predict when that will happen and where that will happen and the scale of how many people will be affected. ","Published: April 26, 2016"

We are excited about the potential to target identified genes to treat disorders such as reflux and incontinence,  said Ronghua ZhuGe, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and physiological systems and a senior author of the study.  Knowing how these muscles stay contracted for such long periods of time will allow us to develop potential new treatments for these diseases. The next step is to see whether this molecular mechanism in mice also operates in humans.  The human body, and those of other mammals, contains a number of ring-shaped structures made of smooth muscle encircling openings in hollow organs such as the intestines and bladder called sphincters. Smooth muscle is involuntarily controlled, unlike the muscles we use to walk, for example, so that we don t need to consciously move digested food from stomach to small intestine. Dysfunction in the sphincters, either structurally or functionally, can have severe consequences leading to diseases that impair the ability of the muscle to contract or relax. This can lead to achalasia, which makes it difficult to swallow; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which allows stomach acid to enter the esophagus or incontinence of the bowels.   A healthy sphincter opens transiently but remains closed most of the time, maintaining a basal tone. This basal tone requires constant generation of force produced by the contraction of smooth muscle cells that make up the sphincters,  said Dr. ZhuGe.  However, the genetics governing how the sphincter smooth muscle stays contracted for such long periods of time remains unknown.  Smooth muscle operates by generating force as the muscle motor protein myosin and actin filaments move past each other. This happens after a molecule called the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) is turned on through a common molecular transformation called phosphorylation. How much phosphorylation takes place is controlled by the relative amounts of two enzymes; calcium dependent MLC kinase (MLCK), which promotes phosphorylation, and calcium independent MLC phosphatase (MLCP), which reverses phosphorylation. Through this process, contraction and relaxation of the muscle is achieved.  To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the involuntary and continuous contraction of the sphincter muscle, Dr. ZhuGe and colleagues examined the internal anal sphincter that controls bowel continence in mice. They showed that genetic deletion of the MLCP enzyme in the smooth muscle had no effect on the basal tone of the mouse sphincter, but deletion of MLCK essentially abolishes the basal tone and mice become incontinent as a result.   Although previous biochemical studies suggested that lower MLCP activity may be related to the basal tone of this sphincter, our genetic study indicates this doesn t seem to be the case. It turns out MLCK is essential for the tone formation,  said ZhuGe.  This prompted us to look for specific calcium signals that regulate MLCK.  Co-author Lawrence Lifshitz, PhD, associate professor of molecular medicine, said,  Calcium signaling is our favorite subject. We originally hypothesized that localized releases of calcium inside the cell, near target ion channels, might do the trick, as we knew that such releases can regulate the contraction of smooth muscle in blood vessels and airways.  But experiments showed that these local calcium releases have no direct role in muscle tone. Instead, three types of ion channels act in concert to generate a rise in cytosolic calcium which eventually results in MLCK activation and muscle tone.  To test this hypothesis, ZhuGe s group teamed up with Minsheng Zhu, PhD, at Nanjing University in China, to generate a line of mice in which one of these channels could be turned off in smooth muscle only.  These mice were a powerful tool for establishing our hypothesis,  said ZhuGe.  They helped us identify the Tmem16a (also called Ano1) gene as a critical component for basal tone formation and fecal continence. When we were able to turn off the TMEM16A channels in these mice, they lost the majority of the basal tone and became incontinent.   Identifying the genes underlying sphincter basal tone is an important step towards understanding sphincter disorders and developing new treatments for them.  The treatment options for fecal incontinence are very limited,  said Jennifer S. Davids, MD, assistant professor of surgery at UMass Medical School.  One reason for this is our lack of understanding of the molecular basis of sphincter tone and fecal continence. If we can target specific genes, it s possible we can improve treatment options.

Excessive IL-1 is known to correlate with increased production by the bone marrow of aggressive immune cells, which can damage other tissues, at the expense of cells that maintain healthy blood and immune system. But whether IL-1 itself was causing these changes, or merely acting as a bystander was not clearly understood. Now stem cell biologists at UC San Francisco have demonstrated that IL-1 itself directly transforms the blood system by driving blood stem cells (termed  hematopoietic stem cells  or HSCs) in the bone marrow to switch away from their restorative, rejuvenating role in blood renewal and toward emergency production of immune cells.  IL-1 is a double-edged sword,  said study senior author Emmanuelle Passegu , PhD, a professor of medicine at the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF.  It s a magnificent system for responding to acute injury or infection: When you need an immune response, you need it now, and IL-1 is critical for communicating this information and stimulating the production of immune cells by the bone marrow. But leaving on this signal is not good for the health of the organism. It damages the blood system and leads to an overproduction of immune cells that contribute to chronic inflammatory disease.  Fortunately, the researchers also demonstrate that the negative consequences of chronic IL-1 exposure on blood stem cells are rapidly reversed when the immune molecule is removed, supporting ongoing clinical attempts to use IL-1-blocking drugs to treat diseases of chronic inflammation such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arthritis and even as a way to slow aging. IL-1 Can Switch Blood Stem Cells to 'Red Alert' In their new paper   published online April 25, 2016, in the journal Nature Cell Biology   Passegu  and her team performed experiments in cell culture as well as in live mice showing that IL-1 exposure directly drives HSCs toward emergency production of myeloid cells of the acute immune system   such as monocytes, neutrophils and macrophages   by activating a molecular network driven by the myeloid commitment gene Pu.1. Additional mouse experiments showed that while brief IL-1 exposure produces a wave of myeloid cells capable of responding to tissue damage or fighting off an acute infection without significant negative consequences, chronic exposure to IL-1 for up to 70 days drastically impaired the ability of HSCs in the bone marrow to perform their normal, non-emergency role of maintaining and regenerating the blood and immune systems.  IL-1 reshapes the blood system at its most primitive level,  Passegu  said.  It biases the bone marrow to respond to emergencies, but at the expense of blood renewal, which directly impacts the functionality of the blood system in chronic inflammatory conditions.  Fortunately, the researchers discovered that the negative effects of IL-1 on HSCs are short lived. When the researchers took blood stem cells from mice that had been chronically exposed to IL-1, deprived them of IL-1 for a few weeks, then transplanted them into mice whose blood marrow had been fatally damaged, the transplanted cells flourished, regenerating a normal blood system with virtually no sign of their long previous exposure to IL-1. These results support the notion that blocking IL-1 s effects on the stem cells of the bone marrow may be a potent treatment for chronic inflammation.  IL-1 had been implicated in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes before, but its exact role had not been established,  said Matthias Hebrok, PhD, director of the Diabetes Center at UCSF.  This elegant study pointing to IL-1 as a critical regulator of cellular inflammation should open up new avenues of research into the early triggers of diabetes.  Blocking IL-1 May Reverse Effects of Chronic Inflammation The results uncover a new regulatory circuit that clarifies how IL-1 shifts the blood-generating cells of the bone marrow from self-renewal toward acute needs, with important consequences for the functionality of the blood system in chronic inflammatory conditions. In addition, the results suggest that bone marrow transplant failures may in some cases be due to high levels of IL-1, which is produced in response to bone marrow injury and could cause HSCs to fail the massive regeneration challenge required for successful transplantation. Importantly, Passegu  says, the discovery that the damaging effects of IL-1 on HSC function are reversible has important translational implications for the use of existing FDA-approved IL-1 blockade therapies to restore HSC function and blood homeostasis for millions of patients suffering from chronic inflammation worldwide.  Understanding this mechanism helps us understand why these drugs are such promising treatments for patients with chronic inflammation,  she said. Passegu  suspects that IL-1 could play a similarly double-edged role in a variety of tissues via direct reprogramming of their stem cell populations. If so, she says, reducing chronic IL-1 exposure, may be an important approach for improving stem cell health and tissue function in the context of both inflammatory disease and normal aging.","Published: April 26, 2016"

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Children with autism spectrum disorder are four times more likely to suffer from gastrointestinal problems than other children. These GI troubles are often blamed on the tendency of kids with autism to limit their diets to a few favored food items.  Gastrointestinal issues have been recognized as a common occurrence in people with autism since the condition was first described in the 1940s, but there was no indication that they were directly related,  says the study s lead author, Kara Gross Margolis, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at Columbia. Recent research by Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele, MD, the Mortimer D. Sackler, MD Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia, and Randy Blakely, PhD, professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, had linked some cases of autism to genetic mutations that inhibit serotonin activity. Serotonin is a chemical that transmits signals from one neuron to another in the brain. The brain, however, contains only 5 percent of the body s serotonin; most of the rest is at work in the GI system. Genetic mutations that affect serotonin s activity will thus have ramifications in the gut as well as in the brain.  Because serotonin plays an important role in the gastrointestinal system as well as the brain, we wanted to see if there was a direct relationship between these genes and GI development and function,  says Dr. Margolis, who conducted the study with Michael Gershon, MD, professor of pathology & cell biology at Columbia and a leader in the field of neurogastroenterology. The researchers investigated gastrointestinal development in a mouse model, created by collaborators at Vanderbilt, that carries a mutation found in some patients with autism. The mutation decreases serotonin activity by increasing the activity of the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), which pulls serotonin back into the neuron after it is released for neurotransmission. Previously, the Vanderbilt researchers had shown that mice with the SERT mutation displayed behaviors that are strikingly similar to those seen in children with autism. In particular, the mice vocalized less, engaged in repetitive behaviors, and avoided contact with other mice. In the new study, Drs. Margolis and Gershon discovered that these mice have fewer neurons than normally found in the gut, a poorly maintained gut lining, and slower movement of gut contents. The changes were present in young mice and persisted through adulthood.  Basically, the gut goes slower and the mice were constipated, which is a common complaint in kids with autism,  Dr. Gershon says.  Our study is one of the first to suggest that GI and neurological aspects of autism, in some cases, may stem from a shared underlying abnormality,  says Dr. Margolis.  This provides scientific credibility to the idea that gastrointestinal problems may be an innate feature of autism, at least for some patients.  The study also found that the gastrointestinal changes in mice caused by the SERT mutation could be prevented if during pregnancy their mothers were given prucalopride, a drug that mimics the ability of serotonin to stimulate nerve cell development.  We see that we can prevent gastrointestinal changes in mice with the SERT mutation, but we still need to learn if we can reverse these changes once they appear,  Dr. Margolis says. Regardless of the root of the GI distress in patients, Dr. Margolis says families and physicians should recognize that gastrointestinal problems are common in children with autism.  The difficulty is that these kids present in a different way. Often, they re not verbal or they have sensory issues so they can t pinpoint where the pain is coming from,  she says.  So it s important that when these patients present with distress or behavioral problems, a gastrointestinal source is considered.  Since low serotonin activity caused deficient development of gastrointestinal neurons, slow motility, and inadequate maintenance of the gastrointestinal mucosa, the researchers wanted to determine if high serotonin activity during development would increase generation of nerve cells, speed motility, and enhance mucosal maintenance. The researchers increased serotonin activity in developing mouse pups by giving their mothers SSRI antidepressants (e.g., Prozac), which raise serotonin levels by inhibiting SERT, or by knocking out the SERT gene (SERTKO). As expected, the pups had changes to their gastrointestinal systems that were the opposite of those found in the autism model mice. Whereas the autism model mice had too few gastrointestinal neurons and a slow-moving gut, the SSRI and SERTKO pups had too many neurons and a fast-moving gut. And while the intestinal lining of the autism model mice was too thin, the lining in the SSRI and SERTKO mice was too thick. Only one study has looked at gastrointestinal disorders among children of women who take SSRIs during pregnancy. This study found that such children are 10 times more likely to have a gastrointestinal disorder than children from the general population.  We re not advising anyone to stop taking SSRIs. Depression is not trivial in pregnancy and there are a lot of things to consider,  Dr. Margolis says.  As physicians, we want to make people aware of all the side effects of the drugs they take, so they can make better-informed decisions. ","Published: April 26, 2016"

Gypsy moths are especially concentrated in the northeastern United States. A new paper appearing this month in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reports on this useful system for studying disease dynamics. New invasive pathogens have affected many other organisms, most notably a fungus that causes white nose disease in bats and the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) fungus that has wiped out amphibian populations globally.  Because gypsy moths are a pest, this invasive pathogen is actually having some beneficial impacts,  said Ann Hajek, professor of entomology and lead author of the study.  It s a good model system for research since it s killing a pest instead of bats or frogs.  In years past, gypsy moth caterpillars commonly fell victim to four types of parasitoids, two wasp species and two fly species, each of which lays eggs in the caterpillars. When the eggs hatch, the parasitoid larvae kill their hosts. Gypsy moths   especially those living in large, dense populations   were also often killed by a virus specific to them. The new fungal pathogen (Entomophaga mamaiga) first showed up in New England in 1989 and has been spreading.  In the study, the researchers examined two sets of data: a 17-year dataset of gypsy moths and the diseases and parasites that infect them, which Hajek has tracked in a state forest in Dryden, New York; and another dataset where samples were collected in 2009 from 66 sites in mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland. Though the Dryden forest site had gypsy moth infestations in low densities, the mid-Atlantic sites had a wide range of densities, including about a quarter with very high densities of moths.  In all of the sites, the new fungal pathogen was dominating the scene,  said Hajek.  In the past, you would have seen a lot of the virus and the parasitoids but now we basically saw few of those. They were still there, but in the background at low levels.  The fungus and the parasitoids could rarely both infect a host caterpillar together, because each needs to kill the host on its own time, according to the paper. The virus, on the other hand, could successfully co-infect caterpillars along with the fungus or parasitoids.  We think this emergent pathogen is killing as many gypsy moths, if not more, than the virus plus parasitoids,  Hajek said. Hajek hopes this study will raise awareness about emergent pathogens, their detection and what some of the outcomes could be, she said.

10,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/designing-better-drugs-192202,Designing Better Drugs A rational drug engineering approach could breathe new life into drug development   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new strategy for engineering protein fusions   to make specific cell-targeted drugs without side effects   could enable a safer, more potent class of protein drugs. A team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering designed a better variant of the widely-used drug erythropoietin (EPO), showing how rational design can improve in vivo efficacy and safety of protein therapeutics, reduce potential side effects, and also accelerate new drug development. The findings were published online April 25 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal. ""Our concept is completely general,"" said Pamela Silver, Ph.D., the study s corresponding author, who is a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member, the Eliot T. and Onie H. Adams Professorship of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and a founder of the HMS Department of Systems Biology. ""We can reduce the toxicity of approved protein drugs, and may also be able to rehabilitate protein fusion drugs that have so far failed in clinical trials due to unacceptable side effects.""However, EPO not only activates red blood cell production but can also cause dangerous complications, such as blood clotting and boosted blood vessel growth. As a result, patients treated with EPO often suffer from higher rates of heart attack, stroke, and accelerated tumor growth. Therefore, the FDA has issued its strictest warning   a black box label advising of serious hazards associated with the drug   for the use of EPO drugs. To combat this problem, the Wyss team rationally designed a more effective, multi-part drug molecule. ""Compared to currently available EPO drugs, our molecule is engineered to prevent EPO from binding to and activating cells that promote side effects such as blood clotting or tumor growth,"" said Jeffrey Way, Ph.D., Wyss Institute Senior Staff Scientist and the senior author on the study. ""This cell-targeted EPO approach demonstrates a new theoretical basis for the rational design of engineered protein fusion drugs."" First, the team genetically mutated EPO protein, reducing its ability to bind to cell receptors. Then, using a chain of amino acids as a flexible linker, they attached mutated EPO to a specific antibody fragment. The antibody fragment was selected because it uniquely binds to the cell membranes of red blood cell precursors while avoiding other types of blood cells that control clotting and vessel growth. When the team s fusion protein molecules were delivered to mice, the antibody fragments piloted toward and bound to the membranes of red blood cell precursors, towing along EPO molecules on the other end of their linkers. In such close proximity to the surface of the cells, a high concentration of tethered EPO bounced around until they ultimately toggled into place on the cell s receptors. In this way, side effects were avoided and only red blood cell production was increased. ""Our rational design strategy is unique compared to current industry approaches,"" said the study s first author Devin Burrill, Ph.D., who is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Research Service Award (NRSA) Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute. ""Our goal is to use our method to advance predictive drug design and minimize the time between drug concept and commercialization."" ""The principles of synthetic biology influenced our efforts,"" said Wyss Core Faculty member James Collins, Ph.D., co-author on the study, who is Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) s Department of Biological Engineering. ""In drug development, the focus is typically on increasing the strength of interaction with a drug target, but here we found that weakening an interaction was useful. This illustrates how we need to adopt alternative, non-traditional approaches if we want to build complex, multi-part therapeutics."" The specific, cell-targeted approach could be applied quite broadly. The Wyss team has unveiled not only a novel design of their ""targeted EPO"", but also ""targeted interferon alfa"", a cancer drug that can otherwise cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, mood fluctuations, and depression. ""This is another great example of how using a synthetic 'bottom-up' engineering approach and leveraging the power of biological design   this time at the scale of individual molecules interacting on cell membranes   can lead to breakthrough technologies for medicine that overcome limitations that hold back more conventional approaches,  said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard s John A.

The test in development makes use of a new technology known as  Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) . The technology was developed jointly by the laboratory of Rossitza Lazova, MD, Associate Professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale School of Medicine and the laboratory of Erin Seeley, PhD., Clinical Imaging Principal Investigator at Protea Biosciences. In October 2015 scientists at Yale and Protea presented the results of their first clinical study at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP), held in San Francisco, CA. The sensitivity and specificity of the new method were shown to be 99%, and the test correctly classified all cases of malignant melanoma and benign melanocytic nevi.  We are pleased to be working with Dr. Lazova at Yale, to develop this test that employs unique protein expression profiles that discriminate between benign melanocytic nevi and malignant melanomas,  stated Steve Turner, Protea s CEO. He added,  We believe our technology will lead to the discovery of other clinically useful protein biomarker panels that can aid in the differential diagnosis of other cancer types.   Mass Spectrometry Imaging is an objective and reliable method that may be helpful in difficult cases, in which rendering a definitive diagnosis of either benign nevus or malignant melanoma may be very difficult. The identification of protein expression profiles, which discriminate between benign melanocytic nevi and malignant melanomas, has led to the discovery of a set of clinically useful tumor biomarkers that can be incorporated into standard diagnostic and treatment strategies,  commented Dr. Rossitza Lazova, from the Yale School of Medicine. Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Imaging enables the direct molecular profiling of cells and tissues; specific proteins can be identified, localized in tissue, then displayed, both as 2D or 3D molecular images. Hundreds of molecules can be identified in a single analysis, and results are rapidly available. Protea is a primary commercial provider of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) services. Melanoma is the leading cause of death from skin disease. One American dies every hour of melanoma. The National Cancer Institute estimates 73,870 Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma in 2015. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the sixth most common cancer in women in the United States. Definitive diagnosis of melanoma requires biopsy and experienced pathological review of the specimen. An established diagnosis of malignant melanoma can be made only after histopathological review. There are globally approximately three million skin biopsies annually to rule out the presence of melanoma; of these approximately 25% are  indeterminate  or  unknown . Complicating the diagnosis of melanoma is the understanding that many of the same histologic features can be seen in benign melanocytic nevi, or common moles.","Published: April 26, 2016"

Results published in the British Journal of Cancer showed that the test distinguished between patients with secondary breast cancer and those who remained disease free for years after a breast cancer diagnosis. Researchers analysed the blood of 112 breast cancer patients using samples collected as part of the charity s DietCompLyf study. They detected higher levels of a protein called  cadherin-5  that had unusual sugars decorating its surface in women who went on to be diagnosed with secondary breast cancer over a year later. This indicates that the sensitivity of current blood tests could be improved upon for earlier diagnosis of secondary disease. Further research with more patient samples will be needed before the usefulness of the test will be fully realised. More sensitive, non-invasive tests are required for secondary breast cancer - which occurs when new tumours grow in the bone, liver, lung or brain - to make diagnosis easier and for treatment to begin as early as possible. Dr Miriam Dwek, Reader and Group Leader of the Cancer Research Group at the University of Westminster who led the research, says:  This research verified the results of our previous work in a larger group of patients, defining cadherin-5 proteins that display abnormal sugar arrangements as a new biomarker for metastatic, or secondary breast cancer. The blood test worked particularly well at identifying metastasis in a sub-group of patients with oestrogen responsive breast cancers, which make up 70% of all breast cancers diagnosed. We are excited and hope to develop this test further so in the future there will be improved methods for better monitoring of patients. At the moment the test is not  patient ready  but the initial results are encouraging.  Secondary breast cancer is difficult to diagnose before symptoms are experienced and occurs in up to a third of breast cancer patients, sometimes many years after seemingly successful treatment for localised, primary cancer that remained in the breast. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide and secondary spread claims the lives of around 1000 people a month in the UK. The University of Westminster s Cancer Research Group undertakes pioneering research into the detection, treatment and prevention of solid and blood borne cancers. Dr Miriam Dwek PhD, Leader of the University of Westminster s Breast Cancer Research Group, and Registered Nutritionist (AfN) Dr Claire E Robertson, co-authored  The Breast Cancer Cookbook  with renowned breast cancer surgeon Professor Mohammed Keshtgar.

The development part of the collaboration will focus on the non-clinical development of Chimeric-Antigen-Receptor engineered regulatory T (CAR-Treg) cells for the treatment of Lupus Nephritis. Lupus Nephritis is one of the most serious complications of Lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease affecting over 5 million people worldwide. TxCell scientists identified a first relevant antigenic target for its CAR-Treg cellular therapy product. They successfully created a CAR-Treg product candidate by engineering FoxP3+ Treg cells with a CAR. This CAR integrates the binding domain of a pathogenic antibody from patients suffering from Lupus Nephritis. As per the terms of the agreement announced, TxCell and OSR will conduct the non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies with CAR-Treg cells to prepare for a first-in-man study in Lupus Nephritis patients.  The R&D partnership between TxCell and the world-leading Ospedale San Raffaele is an important development for TxCell. We have already achieved very quick progress with ENTrIA, our new CAR-Treg platform. TxCell will use both the collaboration with OSR as well as guidance from our newly appointed Scientific Advisory Board to accelerate further development,  said Dr. Arnaud Foussat, CSO of TxCell.  TxCell looks forward to leveraging its unparalleled technology to contribute to treatments for Lupus Nephritis, one of the world's most devastating yet underserved diseases. In addition to our first program in Lupus Nephritis, TxCell expects to start two additional CAR-Treg programs later this year on the back of additional in vitro and in vivo data.  In parallel, the collaboration will also include a research arm, where OSR will perform research for TxCell on the design and biology of other chimeric antigen receptors for use in Treg cell products addressing other autoimmune indications. Dr. Attilio Bondanza, Head of the Innovative Immunotherapies Unit at Ospedale San Raffaele, will lead the OSR team both in the development of CAR-Tregs in Lupus Nephritis and in the research program on CAR-Treg biology. Prof. Fabio Ciceri, Head of the Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit and Deputy Director of the Division of Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cells and Gene Therapy of OSR, will also join the collaboration members. As a result of his pioneering experience in the field of clinical T-cell gene therapy, he will steer the collaboration towards a first-in-man study.  We are very excited about this collaboration with TxCell, which certainly constitutes a major and unparalleled step forward towards the validation of the CAR technology outside the oncology field,  said Dr. Attilio Bondanza.  We enthusiastically accept the challenges of adapting the design of CARs to the distinctive biology of Tregs and we are really looking forward to developing robust protocols for the production of safe and effective cellular products that may benefit patients suffering from severe autoimmune diseases such as Lupus Nephritis.

This is the finding of a study in rats and humans led by researchers at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center and published in Nature Medicine. ""Our study sheds the first light on the mechanisms by which epilepsy hijacks a normal brain process, disrupting the signals needed to form memories,"" says study lead author and NYU Langone pediatric neurologist Jennifer Gelinas, MD, PhD. ""Many of my patients feel that cognitive problems have at least as much impact on their lives as seizures, but we have nothing to offer them beyond seizure control treatments. We hope to change that."" See Also: Working memory: underlying processes are more complex than we thought The study results revolve around two brain regions, the hippocampus and cortex, shown by past studies to exchange precise signals as each day's experiences are converted into permanent memories during sleep. The study authors found that epileptic signals come from the hippocampus, not as the part of normal memory consolidation, but instead as meaningless commands that the cortex must process like memories. Study rats experiencing such abnormal signals had significant difficulties navigating to places where they had previously found water. Furthermore, the degree of abnormal hippocampal-cortical signaling in study animals tracked closely with the level of memory impairment. The study also looked at data from epilepsy patients that had their brain signals monitored as part of surgery preparation. Researchers found that rats and humans with epilepsy experienced similar, abnormal hippocampal discharges between seizures that resembled but out-competed normal memory-forming communication between brain regions. Given the tens of milliseconds delay observed between hippocampus signals and the response from the cortex, researchers see a time window during which an implanted device might interrupt disease-related signals, and have launched a related design effort. Senior author of the study and NYU Langone neuroscientist Gyorgy Buzsaki, PhD, had established, starting in 1989, the theory that memories form in two stages: one while awake and another where we replay the day's events during sleep. As the latest step in that work, Buzsaki also led a study published in the journal Science last month that explained key mechanisms behind hippocampal-cortical memory consolidation. Countering the idea most neurons contribute equally as memories form, his team found that a few strongly active ""rigid"" neurons perform the same way before and after experiences; while a second set of rarely contributing ""plastic"" neurons behave differently before and after opportunities for memory consolidation. Learn More: When memories age: Neuroscientists follow the trace of memory ""We seem to have evolved with both a stable template of neurons that process what is the same about the things we encounter, and a second group that can learn with new experiences,"" says Buzsaki. ""This new understanding of memory consolidation made possible our insights into epilepsy."" Buzsaki has shown that the hippocampus processes information in rhythmic cycles, with thousands of nerve signals sent regularly and within milliseconds of each other. By firing in synchrony, brain cells cooperate to achieve complex signals, but only if this wave is sculpted, with signals afforded proper strengths and placed in order. Unfortunately, the synchronous nature of hippocampal signaling creates risk, says Buzsaki, because without proper control it can convey powerful nonsense messages to the rest of the brain.

These are the findings of a large-scale international study in over 298,000 people, conducted by Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam professors Meike Bartels and Philipp Koellinger. See Also: Yin and yang of serotonin neurons in mood regulation The researchers found three genetic variants for happiness, two variants that can account for differences in symptoms of depression, and eleven locations on the human genome that could account for varying degrees of neuroticism. The genetic variants for happiness are mainly expressed in the central nervous system and the adrenal glands and pancreatic system. The results are published in the journal Nature Genetics. Prior twin and family research using information from the Netherlands Twin Register and other sources has shown that individual differences in happiness and well-being can be partially ascribed to genetic differences between people. Happiness and wellbeing are the topics of an increasing number of scientific studies in a variety of academic disciplines. Policy makers are increasingly focusing on wellbeing, drawing primarily on the growing body of evidence suggesting that wellbeing is a factor in mental and physical health. VU Amsterdam professor Meike Bartels explains:  This study is both a milestone and a new beginning: A milestone because we are now certain that there is a genetic aspect to happiness and a new beginning because the three variants that we know are involved account for only a small fraction of the differences between human beings. We expect that many variants will play a part.  Locating these variants will also allow us to better study the interplay between nature and nurture, as the environment is certainly responsible to some extent for differences in the way people experience happiness.  Don't Miss: Microbes, mood, and mental health These findings, which resulted from a collaborative project with the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, are available for follow-up research. This will create an increasingly clearer picture of what causes differences in happiness. Professor Bartels points out that  The genetic overlap with depressive symptoms that we have found is also a breakthrough. This shows that research into happiness can also offer new insights into the causes of one of the greatest medical challenges of our time: depression.  The research effort headed by professors Bartels and Koellinger is the largest ever study into the genetic variants for happiness. It was successfully completed thanks to the assistance of 181 researchers from 145 scientific institutes, including medical centres in Rotterdam, Groningen, Leiden and Utrecht, and the universities of Rotterdam and Groningen.

Two researchers sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) think that's a strong possibility. Dr. John Bienenstock and Dr. Paul Forsythe who work in The Brain-Body Institute at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada are investigating intestinal bacteria and their effect on the human brain and mood. See Also: Study establishes connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease ""This is extremely important work for U.S. warfighters because it suggests that gut microbes play a strong role in the body's response to stressful situations, as well as in who might be susceptible to conditions like PTSD,"" said Dr. Linda Chrisey, a program officer in ONR's Warfighter Performance Department, which sponsors the research. The trillions of microbes in the intestinal tract, collectively known as the gut microbiome, profoundly impact human biology digesting food, regulating the immune system and even transmitting signals to the brain that alter mood and behavior. ONR is supporting research that's anticipated to increase warfighters' mental and physical resilience in situations involving dietary changes, sleep loss or disrupted circadian rhythms from shifting time zones or living in submarines. Through research on laboratory mice, Bienenstock and Forsythe have shown that gut bacteria seriously affect mood and demeanor. They also were able to control the moods of anxious mice by feeding them healthy microbes from fecal material collected from calm mice. Don't Miss: Common anesthetic procedure dramatically improves well being of veterans with PTSD Bienenstock and Forsythe used a ""social defeat"" scenario in which smaller mice were exposed to larger, more aggressive ones for a couple of minutes daily for 10 consecutive days. The smaller mice showed signs of heightened anxiety and stress nervous shaking, diminished appetite and less social interaction with other mice. The researchers then collected fecal samples from the stressed mice and compared them to those from calm mice. ""What we found was an imbalance in the gut microbiota of the stressed mice,"" said Forsythe. ""There was less diversity in the types of bacteria present. The gut and bowels are a very complex ecology. The less diversity, the greater disruption to the body."" Bienenstock and Forsythe then fed the stressed mice the same probiotics (live bacteria) found in the calm mice and examined the new fecal samples. Through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive analytical technique using powerful MRI technology, they also studied changes in brain chemistry. ""Not only did the behavior of the mice improve dramatically with the probiotic treatment,"" said Bienenstock, ""but it continued to get better for several weeks afterward. Also, the MRS technology enabled us to see certain chemical biomarkers in the brain when the mice were stressed and when they were taking the probiotics."" Learn More: Scientists show a link between intestinal bacteria and depression Both researchers said stress biomarkers could potentially indicate if someone is suffering from PTSD or risks developing it, allowing for treatment or prevention with probiotics and antibiotics. Later this year, Bienenstock and Forsythe will perform experiments involving fecal transplants from calm mice to stressed mice. They also hope to secure funding to conduct clinical trials to administer probiotics to human volunteers and use MRS to monitor brain reactions to different stress levels. Gut microbiology is part of ONR's program in warfighter performance. ONR also is looking at the use of synthetic biology to enhance the gut microbiome. Synthetic biology creates or re-engineers microbes or other organisms to perform specific tasks like improving health and physical performance. The field was identified as a top ONR priority because of its potential far-ranging impact on warfighter performance and fleet capabilities.

The published biomarker profile can group patients into  high  and  low  risk groups of which patients in the  low  risk group are expected to have a non-aggressive disease. More than half of the patients were categorized as being  low  risk with an accuracy of 80-89%.   The published biomarker profile works independently of current clinicopathological parameters and is therefore likely to add value to current clinical practice.   At Exiqon, we share the vison of validating biomarkers together with the medical community to facilitate the implementation of personalized medicine. With the increasing cost of treating complex diseases such as prostate cancer there is a significant market need for tests that enable the medical community to focus the sparse resources on the relevant patients only  said Peter Mouritzen, VP Product Development, Exiqon A/S. For several years, Exiqon and Aarhus University Hospital have been working together on identifying and validating novel prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer. The study published in Oncotarget describes the prognostic biomarker profile validated in three independent cohorts.  As many as 90% of the patients who today undergo operation for prostate cancer may avoid operation if biomarkers could provide information on the aggressiveness of the disease  said Torben  rntoft, Professor Aarhus University Hospital.  Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer among men, reflective of approximately 14% lifetime risk of getting prostate cancer. Fortunately, most prostate cancers are not aggressive. However, the lack of effective prognostic biomarkers results in significant overtreatment. Treatment of prostate cancer results in decreased life quality and comes at significant costs. Prostate cancer treatment costs between 20,000 USD and 140,000 USD per patient. With 1 million patients diagnosed with prostate cancer every year the market opportunity for a prognostic test amounts to approximately USD 750 million. Exiqon is currently conducting analytic validation to document the robustness of the test. In parallel, additional patient cohorts are being recruited from Europe and the US to further strengthen the clinical validation. A commercial test may become available in 2017.","Published: April 25, 2016"

A new study published in the April 20 issue of the journal Cell by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai led by E. Premkumar Reddy, PhD, has identified a new mechanism for targeting this important cancer gene. Mutations in RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) are frequently observed in many of the most common and lethal tumors, including cancers of the pancreas, lung and colon.  Although molecular oncologists have made significant headway in understanding these mutations and their impact on cellular signaling, little progress has been made towards developing drugs that systematically target the RAS oncogenes.  This lack of progress has led many in the field to label RAS an  undruggable  cancer gene.   Dr. Reddy and a team of scientists from the Icahn School of Medicine, The Scripps Cancer Research Institute, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the New York Structural Biology Center have identified the first small molecule able to simultaneously inhibit the different signaling pathways activated by RAS oncogenes.  This small molecule, also called rigosertib or ON01910.Na, acts as a protein-protein interaction inhibitor that prevents binding between RAS and signaling proteins  (including RAF, PI3K and others) that turn a cell into a cancer cell. The multi-disciplinary team performed structural experiments to confirm the mode of action for rigosertib and also demonstrated the potential for this targeted mechanism in the treatment of several RAS-driven cancers.    This discovery is a significant breakthrough for the cancer field,  said Dr. Reddy, a Professor of Oncological Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  Rigosertib s mechanism of action represents a new paradigm for attacking the intractable RAS oncogenes.  Our current focus is to use the information from our studies with rigosertib to design the next generation of small molecule RAS-targeting therapies, and we are excited to have recently identified several compounds which we think improve on the qualities of rigosertib.  This drug is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at multiple sites including Mount Sinai.  ","Published: April 25, 2016"

The new mouse model is significant because it closely replicates the symptoms and gene expression patterns found in people who have the most common genetic cause of ALS and frontotemporal dementia. The findings were published today (April 21) in the journal Neuron. Having a mouse model that replicates how these two conditions affect nerve cells and pathways in the brain and spinal cord is crucial to understanding what triggers disease in people and for developing treatments, said Laura P.W. Ranum, Ph.D., director of the UF Center for NeuroGenetics, a faculty member of the UF Genetics Institute and a professor in the UF College of Medicine department of molecular genetics and microbiology. The study s lead author, Yuanjing Liu, Ph.D., a recent graduate of the UF interdisciplinary program in biomedical sciences, worked closely with graduate student Amrutha Pattamatta and other UF researchers to generate and characterize the mice. The team spent nearly four years developing the mouse model, which has an expansion mutation in the C9orf72 gene. This mutation is the most common genetic cause of ALS and accounts for up to 40 percent of all familial cases of the disease, according to The ALS Association. ALS kills nerve cells that stretch from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to muscles, causing muscle wasting, paralysis and death. An estimated 30,000 people in the United States have the disease at any given time and life expectancy is usually two to five years. This mutation is also a common cause of inherited dementia. While other scientists have developed mouse models focusing on different ALS-related genes, the UF Health researchers are the first to cultivate one that focuses on the C9orf72 gene that closely mimics features of both ALS and frontotemporal dementia, including paralysis and dementia. The new mouse model will allow researchers to understand how the same genetic mutation causes paralysis in some patients and cognitive and behavioral problems in others, and how some people escape disease altogether. These mice showed the accumulation of problematic RNA and protein clumps suspected of helping the diseases to progress. Because ALS and frontotemporal dementia belong to a genetically complex disease spectrum that isn t easily studied in humans, the mouse models will enable researchers to tease apart exactly how the gene mutation causes disease. The C9orf72 gene produces at least eight different mutant products. Having the mouse model will help researchers understand which ones are the most important in terms of causing disease. It should also allow them to learn more about what takes place in a particular region of the brain where healthy cells exist next to ones that have died.  I am excited because one of the two mutant RNAs produced by the mutation accumulates in neurons that are vulnerable to the disease and die. This gives us an important clue for future studies aimed at developing therapies for people,  Liu said. Likewise, Ranum is intrigued by the 20 percent of the mice that have the mutated gene but do not develop ALS or frontotemporal dementia. Similarly, a subset of people who carry the C9orf72 mutation do not develop the disease. This suggests there is some protective element at work that, if understood, could be exploited to prevent disease onset, she said. Ranum said her group is already making use of the new mouse model. That includes collaborations with private industry on research aimed at reversing or preventing the disease.","Published: April 25, 2016"

This discovery could help to ensure stable food supplies by cultivating plants that can withstand environmental stresses such as global warming.  The majority of plants depend on photosynthesis as an essential energy source. However, when the light energy necessary for photosynthesis is absorbed in excess, harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. In most cases plants use enzymes to deal with these reactive oxygen species. If plants are exposed to environmental stresses such as lack of water or excess minerals, their ability to photosynthesize is reduced, the ROS removal mechanism cannot keep up with the ROS produced from excess light energy, and plants wither and die. Researchers already knew that ROS are produced within chloroplasts in plant cells, but the exact location and the mechanism behind this were unclear. Professor Miyake s research group extracted chloroplasts and thylakoid membranes from leaves, and exposed them to excess light using repetitive short-pulse illumination. As a result of this treatment, a particle known as  P700  which absorbs light energy within photosystem I  stopped functioning, and three types of reactive oxygen species were produced: superoxide radicals (O2 -), hydroxyl radicals (OH ) and singlet oxygen (1O2). They further confirmed that by limiting the flow of electrons to photosystem I the production of reactive oxygen species was suppressed. Due to factors such as global warming, Earth s natural environment is becoming increasingly inhospitable for plant life.  By revealing the mechanism for the production of ROS and part of its regulatory mechanism, there are future possibilities for ensuring a stable food supply despite global warming,  said Professor Miyake.  The next step is to reveal the regulatory mechanism for ROS on a molecular level. ","Published: April 25, 2016"

The causes are both genetic and environmental. The Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM) has now made important progress towards understanding the mechanisms behind the development of the condition. This international group of researchers includes scientists involved in the Gutenberg Health Study of the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU). The team has uncovered nine new genetic risk factors which work together with education-related behavior as the most important environmental factor causing myopia to generate the disorder. The results of the study ""Genome-wide joint meta-analyses of genetic main effects and interaction with education level identify additional loci for refractive error: The CREAM Consortium"" have recently been published in the scientific journal Nature Communications. There has been a massive rise in the prevalence of short-sightedness across the globe in recent decades and this upwards trend is continuing. It is known from previous studies of twins and families that the risk of acquiring short-sightedness is determined to a large extent by heredity. However, the myopia-causing genes that had been previously identified do not alone sufficiently explain the extent to which the condition is inherited. In addition to the genetic causes of myopia there are also environmental factors, the most significant of which are education-related behavior patterns.  We know from the Gutenberg Health Study conducted at Mainz that the number of years of education increases the risk of developing myopia,"" said Professor Norbert Pfeiffer, Director of the Department of Ophthalmology at the Mainz University Medical Center. Meta-analysis of multi-national datasets With the aim of identifying genetic mutations relating to myopia and acquiring better insight into the development of the condition, the international research group CREAM carried out a meta-analysis of data collected from around the world. The data compiled for this analysis originated from more than 50,000 participants who were analyzed in 34 studies. The second largest group of participants was formed by the more than 4,500 subjects of the Gutenberg Health Study of the Mainz University Medical Center. ""In the field of genetic research, international cooperation is of particular importance. This is also borne out by this study, to which we were able to make a valuable contribution in the form of data from our Gutenberg Health Study,"" continued Professor Norbert Pfeiffer. ""And in view of the fact that a survey undertaken by the European Eye Epidemiology Consortium with the help of the Gutenberg Health Study shows that about one third of the adult population of Europe is short-sighted, it is essential that we learn more about its causes in order to come up with possible approaches for future treatments."" Aware that environmental effects and hereditary factors reinforce one another in the development of myopia, the scientists devised a novel research concept for their investigations. They used a statistical analysis technique that takes into account both the effects of the environmental and hereditary factors and does so in equal measure and simultaneously. Their efforts were crowned with success as they were able to classify nine previously unknown genetic risk factors. Risk-associated gene involved in the development of short-sightedness These newly discovered genetic variants are associated with proteins which perform important functions when it comes to the transmission of signals in the eye. One of these genes is of particular interest because it plays a major role in the transmission of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the eye. Previous studies have shown that there is greater activation of the gene in question in eyes that are myopic. The results of current research substantiate this conclusion. The CREAM researchers interpret this as evidence that this newly discovered risk-related gene is actually involved in the development of short-sightedness. This represents significant initial headway towards understanding how genetic causes interact with the level of education as an environmental factor to produce the heterogeneity of myopia. Further research will be needed to clarify the details of how the mechanisms actually work and interact with one another. The spread of short-sightedness is a worldwide phenomenon. Particularly in South East Asia the incidence of myopia in school children has increased notably over the last decades. This is likely due to an improvement in educational attainment. People who read a great deal also perform a lot of close-up work, usually in poor levels of daylight. The eye adjusts to these visual habits and the eyeball becomes more elongated than normal as a result. But if it becomes too elongated, the cornea and lens focus the image just in front of the retina instead of on it so that distant objects appear blurry. The individual in question is then short-sighted.","Published: April 25, 2016"

This has been further enabled by next-generation DNA sequencing which can efficiently count barcodes and  read out  the results.  However, the number of experiments that can be combined in the same tube has been limited to the number of barcoded cell types.  Allowing barcodes to fuse together inside cells means scientists can now break that barrier. The new technology results in a 10-fold increased rate of discovery for the same price.  Using DNA barcodes for multiplex experiments has been an extremely powerful technology,  said Frederick (Fritz) Roth, senior author on the study who is cross-appointed at Donnelly Centre and Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, and is also a Canada Excellence Research Chair and Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.  However it has been one-dimensional, in the sense that we only got to read one experiment per barcode. By combining barcodes inside cells, we can dramatically increase the number of experiments we can combine together in a single test tube.  In a widely-used method called Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H), yeast cells carrying a  bait  protein are mated with yeast cells carrying a  prey  protein.  The Y2H system is rigged so that only cells in which bait and prey proteins stick together can survive and this allows scientists to see which proteins associate with which other proteins.  Dr. Roth s team named their new technology Barcode Fusion Genetics-Yeast Two Hybrid (BFG-Y2H).  In BFG-Y2H, cells carrying thousands of  bait  and  prey  proteins are mated together in the same culture.  Says Roth,  To ensure that every protein pair is tested for interaction, the process ensures that every cell type mates with every other cell type.  It s like Spring Break in Miami.  The authors say that the BFG-Y2H method s novelty is that the cells are programmed to connect DNA barcodes from bait and prey cells together into a single  fused barcode.    Next-generation DNA sequencing methods can then be applied to detect fused barcodes that correspond to the combinations of bait and prey proteins that stuck together and enabled their cell to survive.   Proteins, working alone or in larger assemblies, are the machinery that carries out many of the operations of a cell.  The authors say that more efficient technologies for mapping protein interactions could expand researchers  understanding of how our cells work, and reveal protein interactions that only occur under certain environmental conditions.   Nozomu Yachie of the University of Tokyo, one of the paper s lead authors, notes that  millions of protein pairs can be tested for interaction in a single flask, so that dozens of conditions could be tested in parallel by one researcher in as little as two weeks in the lab.    Evangelia Petsalaki of the LTRI, also a lead author, notes that  the ultimate goal is to generate a  3D video  of the protein interaction network map rather than a static picture.  Our BFG-Y2H method will accelerate our understanding of gene functions and human disease by efficiently generating more information-rich protein interaction maps. ","Published: April 25, 2016"

Patients recruited were either anti-TNF na ve or anti-TNF failures. The study comprised two parts each of 10 weeks duration: the first part   reported in December 2015 - investigated the safety and efficacy of filgotinib 200 mg once daily versus placebo. The FITZROY study achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission at 10 weeks: the percentage of patients achieving a Crohn s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score lower than 150 was significantly higher in patients treated with filgotinib versus patients receiving placebo. Improvement in histopathology and endoscopy assessments were observed at Week 10. Further evaluation is ongoing. The second part of the study investigated continued treatment through 20 weeks in an exploratory analysis that was not powered for statistical significance. Clinical responses continued from week 10 to week 20. Non-responders in the placebo arm from the first ten weeks received filgotinib 100 mg in the second ten weeks and showed improvement in clinical remission during the second part of the study. There were no new safety signals during the second part of the FITZROY study, consistent with the profile of filgotinib previously described. Most common adverse events observed during this study were infections, gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders. There were no gastrointestinal perforations, no cancers and no deaths reported during the study. Galapagos and Gilead Sciences intend to submit the FITZROY 20-week results to future medical conferences.

SPD is a serious infectious disease which causes damage to the heart, pancreas and skeletal muscle and can lead to the death of salmon. The disease has become established in some Member States and outbreaks of SPD cause significant losses in salmon farms in the EU. Clynav is the first DNA vaccine to be recommended for marketing authorisation in the EU. A DNA vaccine consists of a genetic sequence that triggers the production of proteins directly in the cells of the vaccinated animal. These proteins stimulate a protective immune response, in the case of Clynav against salmon alphavirus subtype 3, thereby preventing or reducing the impact of the disease should the fish subsequently be exposed to this virus. The vaccine has been tested in fresh water and sea water trials that showed that an intramuscular injection reduces mortality and the damage to the heart, pancreas and muscle tissue that is associated with the disease. EMA s Committee for Veterinary Medical Products (CVMP) considered that the protection provided by the vaccination is clinically relevant and provides direct benefit to the salmon in terms of improved health and welfare. On the basis of a detailed environmental risk assessment, the committee was satisfied that any potential risk to the environment from use of the product in salmon was negligible. Likewise, as any vaccine residues are rapidly degraded in the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion, the committee concluded that vaccinated salmon are safe to eat. Clynav was classified as a medicine for minor use minor species (MUMS) / limited market because it is intended for a disease affecting a major species (Atlantic salmon) that has a limited geographical distribution. EMA s MUMS policy aims to stimulate the development of new veterinary medicines for minor species and for diseases in major species for which the market is limited and that would otherwise not be developed under current market conditions.","Published: April 23, 2016"

See Also: Vaccination on the horizon for severe viral infection of the brain The lab-grown mini-brains, which researchers say are truer to life and more cost-effective than similar research models, came about thanks to the son of two Johns Hopkins scientists and two other high school students who were doing summer research internships. They had the idea to make the equipment for growing the mini-brains with a 3-D printer. These so-called bioreactors, and the mini-brains they foster, should open other new and valuable windows into human brain development, brain disorders and drug testing and perhaps even produce neurons for treatment of Parkinson's disease and other disorders, the investigators say. A report on the research appears in the journal Cell. ""We have been working for three years to develop a better research model of brain development, and it's fortunate we can now use this one to shed light on the major public health crisis posed by Zika infections,"" says Hongjun Song, PhD, professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine's Institute for Cell Engineering. ""This more realistic, 3-D model confirms what we suspected based on what we saw in a two-dimensional cell culture: that Zika causes microcephaly abnormally small brains and heads mainly by attacking the neural progenitor cells that build the brain and turning them into virus factories."" Learn More: Zika virus tested in brain precursor cells In recent years, researchers in various fields have begun to grow tiny organs from human stem cells to get a better view of development and disease, and speed the search for new drugs. But existing techniques for creating and working with mini-brains were limiting because of the organ's complexity, Song says. Though the mini-brains themselves are about the size of a pinhead, the bioreactors where they grew were comparatively large, about the size of a soda can. That made working with the mini-brains expensive, given the high cost of the nutrients needed to cultivate human stem cells in the lab, he says, as well as the expense of chemical growth factors that guide the tissue to organize itself like a real brain. Few labs could afford to grow enough mini-brains to be useful for research, Song says, and those that did produced tissues with cells specialized for different parts of the brain mixed together at random. Song and his wife and research partner, Guo-li Ming, MD, PhD, professor of neurology, neuroscience, and psychiatry and behavioral sciences, found a way to improve the bioreactors from an unexpected source: their son and two other high school students, from New York and Texas, who spent a summer working in the lab. The students had worked with 3-D printers and thought they could be the key to producing a better bioreactor, one that would fit over commonly used 12-well laboratory plates and spin the liquid and cells inside at just the right speed to allow the cells to form brains. Related: Why neural stem cells may be vulnerable to Zika infection Of course, it wasn't that simple, Song says. Graduate student Xuyu Qian and postdoctoral fellow Ha Nam Nguyen, PhD, spent years determining factors such as what that optimum speed was, as well as which chemicals and growth factors should be added at what times to yield the desired result. This is the Spin  bio-reactor (top) used to create the conditions for mini-brains to grow. At bottom is a commercially available 12-well lab dish. Credit: Johns Hopkins Medicine  The group has so far used the new bioreactor, dubbed Spin , to make three types of mini-brains mimicking the front, middle and back of a human brain. They used the forebrain, the first mini-brain with the six layers of brain cell types found in the human cortex, for the current study on Zika. ""One thing the mini-brains allowed us to do was to model the effects of Zika virus exposure during different stages of pregnancy,"" says Ming. ""If infection occurred very early in development, the virus mostly infected the mini-brains' neural progenitor cells, and the effects were very severe. After a while, the mini-brains would stop growing and disintegrate. At a later stage, mimicking the second trimester, Zika still preferentially infected neural progenitor cells, but it also affected some neurons. Growth was slower, and the cortex was thinner than in noninfected brains."" Don't Miss: Viral infection during pregnancy causes autism-like behaviors in mice These different effects correspond to what clinicians have seen in infants born to women who contracted Zika during pregnancy, as well as miscarriages, she notes, namely that the earlier in pregnancy Zika infection occurs, the more severe its effects. The research group's next step will be to test drugs already FDA-approved for other conditions on the mini-brains to see whether one might provide some protection against Zika. And they included 3-D printing files for Spin  in the new paper so that researchers anywhere can print their own bioreactors with just a few hundred dollars in materials.

In future, this could help treat neurological disorders such as glioblastoma. See Also: New knowledge about the BBB, the brain's effective bouncer Currently, there are limitations to drug delivery to the brain as it is tightly protected by the blood-brain barrier that separates the circulating blood from the central nervous system which can prevent the entry of certain toxins and drugs to the brain. This restricts the treatment of many brain diseases. However, as a transporter at the blood-brain barrier, Mfsd2a is a potential conduit for drug delivery directly to the brain, thus bypassing the barrier. In this study, recently published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, first author Duke-NUS MD/PhD student Debra Quek and senior author Professor David Silver used molecular modeling and biochemical analyses of altered Mfsd2a transporters to derive a structural model of human Mfsd2a. Importantly, the work identifies new binding features of the transporter, providing insight into the transport mechanism of Mfsd2a. ""Our study provides the first glimpse into what Mfsd2a looks like and how it might transport essential lipids across the blood-brain barrier,"" said Ms Quek.

A new study by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) life scientists has found that hundreds of those genes can be damaged by fructose, a sugar that's common in the Western diet, in a way that could lead to those diseases. However, the researchers discovered good news as well: An omega-3 fatty acid known as docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, seems to reverse the harmful changes produced by fructose. See Also: Why fish intake by pregnant women improves the growth of a child's brain ""DHA changes not just one or two genes; it seems to push the entire gene pattern back to normal, which is remarkable,"" said Xia Yang, a senior author of the study and a UCLA assistant professor of integrative biology and physiology. ""And we can see why it has such a powerful effect."" DHA occurs naturally in the membranes of our brain cells, but not in a large enough quantity to help fight diseases. ""The brain and the body are deficient in the machinery to make DHA; it has to come through our diet,"" said Fernando Gomez-Pinilla, a UCLA professor of neurosurgery and of integrative biology and physiology, and co-senior author of the paper. DHA strengthens synapses in the brain and enhances learning and memory. It is abundant in wild salmon (but not in farmed salmon) and, to a lesser extent, in other fish and fish oil, as well as walnuts, flaxseed, and fruits and vegetables, said Gomez-Pinilla, who also is a member of UCLA's Brain Injury Research Center. Don't Miss: Inside the adult ADHD brain Americans get most of their fructose in foods that are sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, an inexpensive liquid sweetener made from corn starch, and from sweetened drinks, syrups, honey and desserts. The Department of Agriculture estimates that Americans consumed an average of about 27 pounds of high-fructose corn syrup in 2014. Fructose is also found is in most baby food and in fruit, although the fiber in fruit substantially slows the body's absorption of the sugar and fruit contains other healthy components that protect the brain and body, Yang said. Xia Yang and Fernando Gomez-Pinilla observed the remarkable finding that after genes are altered by fructose, DHA seems to push the entire gene pattern back to normal. Credit: Reed Hutchinson/UCLA  To test the effects of fructose and DHA, the researchers trained rats to escape from a maze, and then randomly divided the animals into three groups. For the next six weeks, one group of rats drank water with an amount of fructose that would be roughly equivalent to a person drinking a liter of soda per day. The second group was given fructose water and a diet rich in DHA. The third received water without fructose and no DHA. After the six weeks, the rats were put through the maze again. The animals that had been given only the fructose navigated the maze about half as fast than the rats that drank only water indicating that the fructose diet had impaired their memory. The rats that had been given fructose and DHA, however, showed very similar results to those that only drank water which strongly suggests that the DHA eliminated fructose's harmful effects. Other tests on the rats revealed more major differences: The rats receiving a high-fructose diet had much higher blood glucose, triglycerides and insulin levels than the other two groups. Those results are significant because in humans, elevated glucose, triglycerides and insulin are linked to obesity, diabetes and many other diseases. Learn More: A global surge in ADHD diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine The research team sequenced more than 20,000 genes in the rats' brains, and identified more than 700 genes in the hypothalamus (the brain's major metabolic control center) and more than 200 genes in the hippocampus (which helps regulate learning and memory) that were altered by the fructose. The altered genes they identified, the vast majority of which are comparable to genes in humans, are among those that interact to regulate metabolism, cell communication and inflammation. Among the conditions that can be caused by alterations to those genes are Parkinson's disease, depression, bipolar disorder, and other brain diseases, said Yang, who also is a member of UCLA's Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences. Of the 900 genes they identified, the researchers found that two in particular, called Bgn and Fmod, appear to be among the first genes in the brain that are affected by fructose. Once those genes are altered, they can set off a cascade effect that eventually alters hundreds of others, Yang said.

Elizabeth Parrish received two of her own company's experimental gene therapies: one to protect against loss of muscle mass with age, another to battle stem cell depletion responsible for diverse age-related diseases and infirmities. See Also: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? The treatment was originally intended to demonstrate the safety of the latest generation of the therapies. But if early data is accurate, it is already the world's first successful example of telomere lengthening via gene therapy in a human individual. Gene therapy has been used to lengthen telomeres before in cultured cells and in mice, but never in a human patient. Telomeres are short segments of DNA which cap the ends of every chromosome, acting as 'buffers' against wear and tear. They shorten with every cell division, eventually getting too short to protect the chromosome, causing the cell to malfunction and the body to age. In September 2015, telomere data taken from Parrish's white blood cells by SpectraCell's specialized clinical testing laboratory in Houston, Texas, immediately before therapies were administered, revealed that Parrish's telomeres were unusually short for her age, leaving her vulnerable to age-associated diseases earlier in life. In March 2016, the same tests taken again by SpectraCell revealed that her telomeres had lengthened by approximately 20 years, from 6.71kb to 7.33kb, implying that Parrish's white blood cells (leukocytes) have become biologically younger. These findings were independently verified by the Brussels-based non-profit HEALES (Healthy Life Extension Company), and the Biogerontology Research Foundation, a UK-based charity committed to combating age-related diseases. Parrish's reaction: ""Current therapeutics offer only marginal benefits for people suffering from diseases of aging. Additionally, lifestyle modification has limited impact for treating these diseases. Advances in biotechnology is the best solution, and if these results are anywhere near accurate, we've made history"", Parrish said. Don't Miss: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice Bioviva will continue to monitor Parrish's blood for months and years to come.

The neuropsychological tested picked for the analyses measured memory, processing speed and executive function. The authors report that cognitive function after cancer treatment in memory, processing speeds and executive function was comparable among those women who received chemotherapy with or without anthracycline and those who did not receive chemotherapy. Over time, cognitive function also was comparable between the groups up to seven years after treatment, according to the study. The authors also note that they did not find an association between anthracycline exposure and neuropsychological performance on any measure they examined. Learn More:  Chemo brain  is real, say researchers The authors acknowledge their study results are in contrast to other findings.

Gene expression analysis examines the types and amounts of molecules produced by genes in living cells, telling us which genes are active and which are inactive at a given point in time. This reveals valuable information about the highly dynamic internal states of cells in living systems. NASA s WetLab-2 hardware system is bringing to the International Space Station the technology to measure gene expression of biological specimens in space, and to transmit the results to researchers on Earth at the speed of light.  WetLab-2 is truly a first,  said Macarena Parra, WetLab-2 project scientist at NASA s Ames Research Center in California s Silicon Valley.  Investigators using WetLab-2 will be able to analyze the first run of a spaceflight experiment and immediately apply what they learn to subsequent runs of the experiment during the same flight mission.  It will allow us to accelerate the pace of research on the station while saving time and cost.  Currently, life science research aboard the space station must follow pre-set plans: A rocket carries the experiment into space, an astronaut follows the plan and then sends samples to Earth for analysis. If the post-flight analysis shows that something unusual or unpredicted occurred in space, the researcher will want to further study those phenomena, but this requires planning an entirely new experiment and waiting for an opportunity to fly it to the station. WetLab-2 employs a standard method of measuring gene expression called Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction, or qPCR, which involves extracting certain types of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules from biological samples and then measuring the amounts extracted. RNA molecules are found inside cells, and they play key roles in the basic functions of living cells, such as making cellular proteins. Today, qPCR analysis is performed in many biology labs around in the world. The WetLab-2 system uses a commercially available instrument to perform the qPCR analysis on the space station. Microgravity complicates even the simplest laboratory procedures, such as adding liquid to a test tube. Additionally, on the station, a complete pantry of chemicals is not available, and astronauts maintain a packed schedule. To address these constraints, the WetLab-2 team developed a new method to allow station crew members to extract RNA from multiple types of biological specimens in less than 30 minutes.  This innovative RNA extraction technology, currently in the patenting process, was a multidisciplinary effort of cell biologists, chemical engineers and mechanical engineers who designed the sample manipulation and processing chemistry,  said Julie Schonfeld, WetLab-2 project manager at Ames. WetLab-2 will enable a broad range of life science investigations in space, such as analysis of genes that indicate infectious disease, cell stress, changes in cell cycle growth and development, and genetic abnormality. Researchers also can use the system for real-time analyses of air, surface and water samples to monitor environmental conditions and crew health on the station.  The ultimate goal of the WetLab-2 system is to help humans live and work in space,  said Schonfeld.  This system will help researchers identify changes in gene expression. This can help us determine how to mitigate negative effects of spaceflight and add to our knowledge about how genes work.  The WetLab-2 system was developed at Ames and funded by the International Space Station Program at NASA s Johnson Space Center in Houston. WetLab-2 launched April 8 aboard the eighth SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the space station. The goal of the first flight is to validate system performance. After successful completion of the validation study, WetLab-2 will be available to speed delivery of gene expression data to principal investigators on Earth for academic, commercial and NASA research. The space station serves as the world's leading laboratory where researchers conduct cutting-edge research and technology development that will enable human and robotic exploration of destinations beyond low-Earth orbit, including asteroids and Mars.","Published: April 22, 2016"

The tissue can be used to model disease and test drugs, and it opens the door for a precision medicine approach to treating heart disease. Although there are existing techniques to make three-dimensional tissues from heart cells, the new method dramatically reduces the number of cells needed, making it an easier, cheaper, and more efficient system.  ""We have bioengineered micro-scale heart tissues with a method that can easily be reproduced, which will enable scientists in stem cell biology and the drug industry to study heart cells in their proper context,  said first author Nathaniel Huebsch, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Conklin lab at Gladstone.  In turn, this will enhance our ability to discover treatments for heart disease."" Creating heart cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are derived from a patient s skin cells enables scientists to study and test drugs on that patient s specific disease. However, cells made from iPSCs are relatively immature, resembling heart cells in an embryo more than cells in an adult. As such, these cells are inadequate for drug testing because they do not properly predict how a drug will affect adult heart cells. Additionally, heart cells created from iPSCs are challenging to make and work with, so creating large quantities can be difficult. Therefore, the fewer cells needed, the better.  The micro heart muscle addresses both of these concerns. Forcing the cells to organize and stretch into three-dimensional tissue helps spur development and coaxes them into resembling more mature cells that can better predict how a drug will affect adult heart cells. Also, the new method published in the journal Scientific Reports requires a thousand-fold fewer cells to grow the tissue than other tissue engineering techniques. Using fewer cells allows the scientists to do many more experiments with the same amount of resources.  Working in collaboration with Kevin Healy, PhD, at the University of California, Berkeley, the researchers first generated heart muscle cells and connective tissue cells from iPSCs. They then combined these cells in a special dish shaped like a tiny dog bone. This unique shape encouraged the cells to self-organize into elongated muscle fibers. Within a couple of days, the micro tissues resembled heart muscle both structurally and functionally. For example, when the researchers tested how the tissue responded to certain drugs that impair fetal heart cells but not adult heart cells, the micro heart muscle performed more like adult heart tissue.  The beauty of this technique is that it is very easy and robust, but it still allows you to create three-dimensional miniature tissues that function like normal tissues,  said senior author Bruce Conklin, MD, a senior investigator at Gladstone.  Our research shows that you can create these complex tissues with a simple template that exploits the inherent properties of these cells to self-organize. We think that the micro heart muscle will provide a superior resource for conducting research and developing therapies for heart disease. ","Published: April 22, 2016"

New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis points to the near-sterile surroundings of laboratory mice as a key reason. Infecting laboratory mice with the mouse equivalent of common human infections makes their immune systems behave more like those of adult humans. Vaccines and therapeutics developed using mice often don t work as expected in humans. New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis points to the near-sterile surroundings of laboratory mice as a key reason. When the researchers infected laboratory mice with the mouse equivalent of microbes that cause common infections in humans, the infections changed the animals  immune systems. The immune systems of uninfected mice resembled those of newborn humans, but the immune systems of the infected mice behaved like those of adult humans.  If mice aren t perfect models, maybe part of the reason is that we ve cleaned them up so much,  said senior author Herbert  Skip  Virgin, IV, MD, PhD, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Pathology and Immunology and professor of microbiology and medicine.  Maybe we could make them better models for human diseases by giving them back some of the infections that would be normal to us as humans and every other mammal on the planet.  Animal studies do not always accurately predict how a vaccine or treatment will fare in humans. This is partially due to genetic differences   obviously mice are not just tiny, furry humans   but it also may be due to environmental differences between lab mice, which live in almost-sterile, well-controlled environments, and people, who are exposed to countless microbes starting at birth. As part of the study, researchers infected mice raised in a clean research facility with two kinds of herpes viruses and an intestinal parasite that cause chronic infections, as well as the influenza virus, which causes a short-lived infection. Worldwide, all are related to common infections in humans, although in the United States intestinal worms are uncommon. Once the mice had recovered from the acute infections and the chronic infections had been established, the researchers extracted immune cells from their blood and studied which genes were active.  There is almost no overlap between the genes that were active in the immune cells of the uninfected mice and in the infected mice,  said Virgin.  These differences in which genes were turned on means that the activity of the whole immune system really fundamentally changed.  The same pattern of gene activity changes was found when the researchers and their collaborators compared immune cells from human umbilical cords with those from adult humans. Like research mice, newborn humans have experienced few, if any, infections.  By giving the mice infections, we altered their gene expression in a way that made them more like adult humans and less like newborns,  said Virgin.  This really suggests that lack of infection may be part of the reason that research mice are different than humans.  To test what effect these changes in the immune system had on the ability of the mice to respond to vaccination, the infected and control mice were given the yellow fever vaccine. Both groups produced effective, but somewhat different, responses.  Something about the history of infections changed the quality of the antibody response,  said Virgin. People nearly always produce a strong immune response to the yellow fever vaccine, but that is not true of all vaccines. Some are more effective in one population than another. The vaccine for tuberculosis, for example, has been reported to work better in European than African populations, and the reasons may have as much to do with the environment as with genetics.  We all are chronically infected with multiple things, and that s normal,  said Virgin.  It doesn t make us sick, but it may make us different from one part of the world to another, because of changes to those chronic infections or the commensal organisms that live on us.  To make a mouse model that accurately predicts how vaccines will work in people, scientists need to understand both the variation in human immune responses around the world, and the effect of different infections on the mouse immune system.  We ve established the principle that you can substantially change the nature of the immune response, but what we can t yet do is make the mouse make a human response,  said first author Tiffany Reese, PhD, who led the project while a postdoctoral researcher in Virgin s lab and who is now an assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  We don t know which organisms change the immune system in which way. That s what we re working on now. ","Published: April 22, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/fox-species-shows-absence-of-genetic-variation-194911,Fox Species Shows Absence of Genetic Variation Foxes on one of California s Channel Islands have least genetic variation of all wild animals ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.UCLA biologists report in a new study that a species of foxes living on six of California s Channel Islands have a surprising absence of genetic variation. The research, published in the Cell Press journal Current Biology, provides a complete genome sequence for a small population of the endangered animals, which have been confined to the islands for thousands of years. The researchers write that their work could help guide future long-term conservation efforts for small, endangered populations. The Channel Island foxes are dwarves, two-thirds the size of their mainland relatives. They most likely evolved from gray foxes that were brought to the northern islands by humans more than 7,000 years ago.  The island fox populations suffer from both a lack of genetic diversity and the accumulation of damaging genetic variants, which are likely to worsen over time,  said Robert Wayne, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in the UCLA College.  Our findings emphasize the importance of large population size in order to allow natural selection to operate effectively. It is imperative that we do not let species come to the very brink of extinction, when there are only a handful of individuals remaining, before we intervene to increase their numbers.  Specifically, government agencies should extend endangered species protection before a species  population reaches critically low numbers, when negative genetic consequences become highly likely. A group of foxes living on one of the islands in particular, San Nicolas Island, has much nearly an order of magnitude less genetic variation than any other low-diversity species, including the severely endangered African cheetah, Mountain gorilla, and Tasmanian devil. That finding, which was established by earlier research, does not bode well for the foxes, said Jacqueline Robinson, the study s lead author, a UCLA graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology. A lack of genetic diversity means that individuals within a population are all equally susceptible to disease, and that the species might not be able to respond to a changing environment, she said. The research also raised a question that the researchers haven t yet been able to answer: How have the foxes managed to survive as well as they have?  The degree to which the San Nicolas foxes have lost genetic variation is remarkable,  Wayne said.  It suggests that under some conditions, genetic variation is not absolutely essential for the persistence of endangered populations.  For example, Robinson said, unlike other species with low diversity, island foxes have not yet been found to suffer from severe signs of inbreeding depression. The researchers compared DNA samples collected in 1988 from each of the Channel Island fox populations with one from a gray fox from mainland Southern California. Biological theory holds that small populations of animals will lose their genetic variation, and will accumulate harmful mutations as the normal process of natural selection fails. The UCLA study found that both were true of the island foxes  genomes. The researchers write that their new findings should be considered in plans for the foxes  future, including the possible delisting from endangered species protection for some of their subspecies   a proposal that is currently being considered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.","Published: April 22, 2016"

This is really the first time we ve gone from risk variants highlighted by GWAS to a mechanistic and molecular understanding right down to the nucleotide of how a mutation can contribute to the risk of developing disease,  says Whitehead Founding Member Rudolf Jaenisch, who is also a professor of biology at MIT. About 90% of PD cases are sporadic; that is, caused by complex interactions between environmental and common genetic risk factors. Because scientists have had difficulty analyzing these interactions, most research has focused on rare familial forms of the disease. GWAS, which identify common mutations that increase the risk to develop a particular condition, have been used to study sporadic PD, and other complex conditions, with limited success. GWAS are akin to genomic treasure maps bearing hundreds or thousands of X s marking the general locations of mutations that could be risk factors for a given condition. However, GWAS do not reveal the specific locations of potentially pathogenic mutations, nor do they indicate how an X on a genomic map contributes, if at all, to a disease. For example, in sporadic PD, multiple GWAS point to the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) as one of the strongest risk loci in patients  genomes, yet GWAS contain little information regarding the mechanism of how this gene is dysregulated in sporadic PD patients. To see if distant gene regulatory elements on the same chromosome carrying SNCA could affect cellular levels of alpha-synuclein, a team of researchers led by Frank Soldner, a senior researcher in the Jaenisch lab, investigated two GWAS-flagged risk variants located in a putative SNCA enhancer. Their results are described online this week in the journal Nature. The team used clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to edit the mutations into isogenic human pluripotent stem cells. By altering the genetic variant on only one chromosome, the other chromosome remains unchanged and acts as an internal control. This method allows the scientists to measure very subtle effects with very high confidence, while eliminating the effect of any genetic or epigenetic modifications and cell culture related variations that could occur during the experiment.  Our method addresses an essential shortcoming of GWAS using the correlations produced by GWAS, you cannot distinguish the effect between two variants that are very close together in the genome,  says Soldner, who is the lead author of the Nature paper.  Such physical proximity means that they will always co-segregate during inheritance, which is why we had to do what we did modify and analyze each variant independently while keeping the rest of the genome completely constant.  After differentiating the cells into neurons, the scientists noted the changes in SNCA expression. Although one of the mutations has no effect, the other, which switches one nucleotide from an A to a G, slightly but significantly boosts alpha-synuclein production. When compared to the enhanced alpha-synuclein production in the familial form of the disease, the modest effect created by the A to G mutation would be sufficient over a lifetime to increase the risk of PD, according to Soldner. To see how the mutation affects alpha-synuclein production, the researchers identified two transcription factors that bind to the enhancer that carries this mutation. When the enhancer is not mutated, the transcription factors bind to it, which suppresses SNCA. If the enhancer has the G mutation, the transcription factors are unable to bind to the enhancer, and SNCA is activated. Most genetic conditions are sporadic and caused by a combination of mutations. Jaenisch says that the method that identified the single point mutation in SNCA s enhancer could be used to pinpoint additional pathogenic genes for sporadic PD and sift through the GWAS hits for other diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.","Published: April 22, 2016"

If a parasite s DNA jumps to its host s genome, it could leave evidence of that parasitic interaction that could be found millions of years later   a DNA  fossil  of sorts. An international research team led from Uppsala University has discovered a new type of so-called transposable element that occurred in the genomes of certain birds and nematodes. Dr. Alexander Suh, researcher at the Department of Ecology and Genetics at Uppsala University, is an expert on the small stretches of DNA that tend to jump from one place to another, called transposable elements. Working with a team from eleven institutions in five countries, the researchers discovered a new type of transposable element that occurred in certain bird genomes but not others. By searching DNA databases, the team discovered that the only other animals that shared the new transposable element were nematode worms that are parasites of humans and other mammals.  This finding was so unexpected that we were literally speechless at first,  says Alexander Suh. By comparing the DNA sequences of each instance of the transposable element, Suh and his team were able to figure out that the transfer of DNA between nematodes and birds occurred in two waves across the entire tropics, including remote places like Madagascar. They involved charismatic groups of birds such as parrots, hummingbirds, manakins. Certain human diseases, such as avian flu and HIV/AIDS, are known to have jumped onto our species from animal hosts. Epidemiologists have only recently realized the importance of these so-called  zoonoses . However, there are many more human diseases whose host-origins are unknown. These include lymphatic filariasis and loiasis, two serious human tropical diseases that are caused by nematode worms and spread by mosquitoes. The present study reveals that these modern human parasite species were parasites of birds from at least 25-17 million years ago. They probably did not infect mammals at the time that the transposable element was actively jumping between species, because there is no trace of it in mammal genomes. The genomes show that the bird parasites were widespread because they infected different bird groups that occurred in each of the world s major tropical regions and would have been isolated from each other at the time. Genome sequences continue to reveal evolutionary history in surprising ways. Not only can comparisons of genomes assess relatedness, but interactions between specific host and parasite species can also be permanently recorded in the genome via jumping of transposable element DNA from one to the other. In this first example of that phenomenon in birds and nematodes, we learned that a class of parasites that is a present-day scourge once switched hosts from birds to mammals   a process that is all too familiar to modern epidemiologists. The results are published in Nature Communications.","Published: April 22, 2016"

The insight could lead to novel strategies for combating flu in the most vulnerable patients, said the researchers. The study, published online in Science, demonstrates that replication of the flu virus alone is not enough to drive the deaths caused by seasonal flu, the researchers noted. Ninety percent of the deaths attributed to flu each year worldwide occur in people aged 65 and older. To understand why older adults are more susceptible, the research team first observed the effect of flu infection on immune cells derived from young and older people. They found that the secretion of key antiviral proteins, known as interferons, was significantly reduced in older adults.  It shows that older people may be more susceptible to influenza because they cannot mount an antiviral response,  said Akiko Iwasaki, the study s senior author. Iwasaki is the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiology and of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. To prove that theory, the research team created mice models that mimicked the reduced immune response in older adults. Specifically, they blocked genes that enable the immune system to detect flu, allowing the virus to replicate unchecked. They determined that inflammation was behind the damage that leads to flu deaths.  We found that the virus replication itself wasn t enough to kill the mice, but needed the host response,  said Iwasaki. That response includes neutrophils, or white blood cells responsible for inflammation that fights infection. Neutrophils are activated by the inflammasomes, a heavy-duty inflammatory response reserved for virulent infections. While battling the virus, those cells also destroy tissue in the lungs. The finding highlights potential new strategies for combating flu.  It has a lot of promise in terms of how we might treat older people who are infected with flu,  said Iwasaki.  If what we see in the mouse is true for humans, instead of trying to block virus replication, we should go after the immune cells that are destroying the lungs.  A drug that targets inflammation   either by blocking neutrophils or pro-inflammatory enzymes known as inflammasome caspases   could prolong survival in older people with flu, she said.","Published: April 22, 2016"

This labeling system, details of which were published in Nature Biotechnology, will be an invaluable tool for studying the structure of the genome in real time.   Most people are using CRISPR for editing genomes. We are using it to label DNA and track the movement of DNA in live cells,  said research specialist Hanhui Ma, PhD, who coauthored the study with Thoru Pederson, PhD, the Vitold Arnett professor of cell biology and professor of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology.  Knowing the precise location of genomic elements in live cells is critical to understanding chromosome dynamics because the genes that control our biology and health do so according to their location in 3-dimensional space, said Drs. Pederson and Ma. For a gene to be transcribed and expressed, it must be accessible on the chromosome. Where DNA is positioned in the crowded nucleus plays an important role in everything from embryonic development to cancer. Current technologies, however, are only capable of following, at most, three genomic locations at a time in live cells. Labeling more sites requires that cells be fixed by bathing them in formaldehyde, thus killing them and making it impossible to observe how the chromosome s structure changes over time or in response to stimuli. To overcome this technological hurdle, Pederson and Ma turned to CRISPR/Cas9. To tag specific locations along the genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 complex, they created a Cas9 mutation that makes the nuclease inactive so it only binds to the DNA and doesn t cut the genome. Once deactivated, the CRISPR/Cas9 element is ferried to a specific location on the genome by a guide RNA that can be programmed by the researchers. In order to see and track the CRISPR/Cas9 complex once it is bound to the genome, Ma engineered the guide RNA to include one of three primary fluorescent proteins: red, green or blue. These proteins can then be observed and tracked in real time under a microscope. By attaching a second fluorescent protein to the guide RNA, Ma was able to combine the three primary colors to generate three additional labels: cyan, magenta and yellow. A seventh label, white, is achieved by combining all three primary colors.  Computers cooperating with spectral filters in the microscope read out combinations of colors and display them as a color that you request,  explained Pederson.  For example, red and green can be yellow. Using the three primary colors and this approach called computational coloring we can generate an additional three colors.  CRISPRainbow can simultaneously locate as many as seven different DNA sites, each in a distinctive color. Deploying it in living cells adds to the power of the technology, as it can track dynamic, topological movements of the genome that may have important biological consequences.  With this technology, we can visualize different chromosome loci at different points in time,  said study co-author Li-Chun Tu, PhD, postdoctoral associate in the lab of David Grunwald, PhD, assistant professor of biochemistry and pharmacology at UMMS.  And we can monitor them to see how far and fast these loci move. With this, we can see how these structural changes affect the genes being expressed and their relation to health and disease.  A pioneer in the study of the three-dimensional structure of the genome at UMMS, Job Dekker, PhD, is enthusiastic about CRISPRainbow.  Typically, when we look at the structure of a genome we have this snapshot and we wish we could see what it would look like five minutes later when the cell is responding to something,  said Dr. Dekker, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, professor of biochemistry & molecular pharmacology and co-director of the Program in Systems Biology.  This system allows one to follow this over real time. I think it s a really important new technology. ","Published: April 22, 2016"

The new study led by Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) investigators has identified gene alterations that may explain why TNBC is resistant to most existing treatments, and suggests that a targeted therapy currently in clinical development may prove beneficial. The research, led by first authors Justin Balko, Ph.D., Pharm.D., and Luis Schwarz, M.D., was published online last week in Science Translational Medicine. While chemotherapy prior to surgery can eradicate TNBC in approximately 30 percent of patients, in other patients the cancer behaves in a manner resistant to chemotherapy and often spreads or metastasizes to distant sites in the body, at which point there is no proven cure. The JAK-STAT gene-signaling pathway, which is critical to cell growth and survival, drives the growth of many tumors, including breast cancer. Scientists have not been able to identify clearcut drivers for TNBC but there has been some evidence that the JAK2 gene may play a role. For this study the authors studied tumor samples from 111 patients treated at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl sicas (INEN), in Lima, Per . After sequencing the tumor samples, the authors found that the JAK2 gene was more frequently amplified in chemotherapy-treated TNBC than in tumors before treatment. These patients with JAK2 gene-amplified tumors also had a recurrence of their cancer sooner and were more likely to die within 20 months following surgery. These findings suggested a potential causal role for JAK2 in drug resistance. The investigators also found that JAK2 increased in a limited number of patients where biopsies were collected at different times during treatment. The rate of JAK2 amplification in these tissues was similar to samples obtained after chemotherapy, suggesting that JAK2 plays a supporting role in drug resistance and cancer stem cell-like features. In cell lines, the researchers first tested ruxolitinib, a general JAK inhibitor, but it did not block tumor formation in the JAK2-amplified cells. The researchers then turned to a JAK2-specific inhibitor now known as BSK805 which markedly reduced TNBC tumor growth in mice when paired with chemotherapy. The findings suggest a role for JAK-2 inhibitors for these triple-negative breast cancers.","Published: April 22, 2016"

However, the cells must be activated and taught by the immune system to recognize cancer cells in order to seek out and destroy them. Unfortunately, many types of cancer manage to thwart this process. In the 1990s scientists found a way to genetically engineer T cells to recognize a specific cancer. These engineered T cells, called chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cells, have been recently used as treatment for cancer, said Philip S. Low, Purdue's Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and director of the Purdue Center for Drug Discovery who led the work. ""The problem is that the traditional engineered T-cell treatment can be too effective, sometimes killing tumor cells too fast and triggering a toxic reaction in a patient, and sometimes not stopping once the tumor has been destroyed and continuing to seek out and destroy healthy cells important to bodily functions,"" Low said. ""We have found a potential way to control the engineered immune cells to overcome the limitations posed by CAR T-cell therapy."" Low and Purdue graduate student Yong Gu Lee collaborated with Endocyte Inc. scientist Haiyan Chu to design genetically engineered CAR T cells that must be activated and targeted by a small molecule adaptor before they can kill cancer cells. The technology has been tested in animal models but no human trials have been performed. A poster presentation describing the work was presented Tuesday (April 19) at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in New Orleans. ""While the traditional CAR T cells could remain and replicate in the human body for many years, the adaptors we have created are expected to be excreted fairly quickly,"" Lee said. ""By controlling the level of adaptors in the system, we can control the numbers and potencies of active CAR T cells. Those that aren't stimulated by an adaptor molecule are blind and do not recognize or target any cells. Eventually, if they remain inactive for a while, they should die and be eliminated from the body."" A study in mice showed the anti-tumor activity was induced only when both the engineered CAR T cell and the correct adaptor molecules were present. The system also offers the potential to treat multiple cancer subtypes at once, Low said. ""Most tumors are heterogeneous and contain cancer cells that express different characteristics, including having different tumor-specific proteins on their surface,"" he said. ""The cancer-targeting molecule on the adaptor we designed can be swapped out to target different molecules on other unrelated cancer cell surfaces. The idea is that a mixture of these adaptors can be given to a patient so that a single CAR T cell clone can be targeted to all of the relevant cancer subtypes in a patient."" The adaptor molecule serves as a bridge between the CAR T-cell and the cancer cell. It is made with a yellow dye called fluorescein isothiocyanate on one end, to which the engineered CAR T cells have been designed to bind, and a cancer-targeting molecule on the other. Low's research has focused on the design and synthesis of technologies for targeted delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents to treat cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. He has developed molecules that target folate-receptors and prostate-specific membrane antigen on the surfaces of cancer cells. Approximately 85 percent of ovarian cancers; 80 percent of endometrial and lung cancers; and 50 percent of breast, kidney and colon cancers express folate receptors on their cellular surfaces. Prostate-specific membrane antigen receptors are found on nearly 90 percent of all prostate cancers. Other tumor-specific ligands developed by Low's lab can target each of the other major human cancers, he said. Each CAR T cell has thousands of receptors on its surface to which an adaptor molecule can bind. One CAR T cell could have a variety of adaptor molecules bound to its surface and the cancer cell it targets will depend on which of those adaptors first encounters a targeted cancer cell. Once the CAR T cell binds to a cancer cell, it begins the process of destroying it. When that process is complete, the CAR T cell is released and can bind to a new cancer cell, he said. ""In the past a new CAR T cell had to be designed for each desired cancer target,"" Low said. ""This system uses the same blind CAR T cell for all treatments. The adaptor molecule is what needs to be changed, and it is far easier to manipulate and swap pieces in and out of it than the T cells."" In addition to Low, Chu and Lee, members of the research group include Purdue postdoctoral research associates at the time of the study Srinivasarao Tenneti and Ananda Kumar Kanduluru. Drug discovery is one of the priorities within Purdue Moves, an initiative designed to broaden the university's global impact and enhance educational opportunities for its students. All of the moves fall into four broad categories: science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) leadership; world-changing research; transformative education; and affordability and accessibility.

The US-based Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) and its local funding partner, the Shake It Up Australia Foundation, have granted La Trobe more than $640,000 to further develop the diagnostic blood test. The test could be available to the public in as little as five years if sufficient additional funds can be raised for its rapid development. An estimated 80,000 Australians and more than 6.3 million people worldwide are affected by Parkinson's, which can severely impair mobility and quality of life. La Trobe Professor of Microbiology Paul Fisher said so far, the blood test has been trialled on a small test group of 38 people (29 with Parkinson's and a control group of nine) with great reliability. 'This is a really exciting discovery. Parkinson's is a debilitating disorder and currently there is no cure. However, early diagnosis and treatment could enable better outcomes and a greater quality of life for people with the condition, which will be of great benefit to sufferers and their families,' Professor Fisher said. 'The MJFF grant will allow us to extend our study so we can discover new ways to help diagnose and monitor progression of the disease. It is even possible that the blood test could be developed to detect all types of neuro-degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's.' When the next stage of testing is complete, the sample will total about 100 people: 70 with Parkinson's and a control group of 30. Shake It Up CEO Ben Young said his organisation was delighted to be co-funding the research. 'We hope this is the start of a long and productive relationship with La Trobe University that will improve the lives of people with Parkinson's,' Mr Young said. 'We would also like to thank our friends at Parkinson's Victoria who have committed over $160,000 to Shake it Up to support the project.' This research was thanks to a collaboration between La Trobe's Microbiology and Psychology departments. Background Diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's have long been believed to involve malfunction of cell mitochondria   which are the cells' energy factories. About a decade ago, Professor Fisher's lab discovered that a permanently switched on 'alarm' at the cellular level could be responsible for symptoms in many incurable conditions involving defective mitochondria. This led to an important new understanding of how mitochondrial defects damage cells   namely that it is a signalling disorder, rather than a fundamental energy insufficiency as previously thought. 'We realised this had important implications for understanding many different forms of mitochondrial disease, as well as most major neurodegenerative disorders,' he said. Professor Fisher said he and his team demonstrated for the first time (using a laboratory organism called Dictyostelium, or Dicty) that an energy- and stress-sensing protein, known as AMPK, was permanently activated in mitochondrially diseased cells. When energy production was compromised, this protein began signalling and interfering with other signalling pathways, causing cell functions to shut down. Professor Fisher's team then joined forces with Dr Danuta Loesch-Mdzewska, Dr Sarah Annesley and other collaborators to extend their studies in Dicty to cells from Parkinson's disease patients. The results were both dramatic and surprising. Professor Fisher said in people with Parkinson's, something causes their cells to become 'hyperactive', which in turn increases the production of toxic oxygen by-products and over time damages vital cells in the brain. Apart from developing a definitive blood test, Professor Fisher said further work on differences in blood cells from Parkinson's patients and healthy control groups might also open a window to the underlying mechanisms of the disease.","Published: April 22, 2016"

The discovery is an important step toward creating targeted therapies for individuals with this syndrome, which causes severe developmental delays, abnormal muscle tone, seizures, and eye complications. The study was published online in the American Journal of Human Genetics.  Now that we ve determined that a small subset of patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities share the same mutations, we can begin to learn about the prognosis of these individuals, how these mutations lead to this syndrome, and how to develop targeted therapies,  said study leader David B. Goldstein, PhD, the John E. Borne Professor of Medical and Surgical Research (in Genetics and Development) and director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at CUMC. The discovery was made by performing whole-exome sequencing of patients with an undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder to identify excess spontaneous, or non-inherited, mutations. (The exome is the portion of the genome that encodes for the production of proteins.)  Of the hundreds of patients we sequenced at CUMC, three were found to have mutations in a gene called GNB1,  said Slave Petrovski, PhD, former research scientist with the Institute for Genomic Medicine at CUMC and the first author of the report.  We then reached out to our colleagues at other medical centers to see if they found similar mutations in any of the patients whose DNA they had sequenced. In all, we reviewed sequencing data on 5,855 individuals and found a total of 13 individuals with GNB1 mutations.  GNB1 mutations have been detected in some cancers, but this is the first time the mutations have been linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder. GNB1 encodes a protein that functions in the transmission of many different kinds of signals within cells.  As of yet, we don t know which aspect of that signaling is affected by these mutations,  said Dr. Goldstein.  Moving forward, we hope to determine exactly how these mutations cause disease and then use that information to identify druggable targets completing the entire precision medicine circle for this condition, from gene discovery to functional biology to the development of targeted therapeutics.  Whole-exome sequencing is currently not a standard part of the evaluation of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.  With more discoveries like this one, this genetic approach to disease diagnosis will become standard practice for all patients with these disabilities,  said Dr. Goldstein.","Published: April 22, 2016"

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC   James).  The study shows that in glioblastoma (GBM), the essential amino acids methionine and tryptophan are abnormally metabolized due to the loss of key enzymes in GBM cells. The altered methionine metabolism leads to activation of oncogenes, while the changes in tryptophan metabolism shield GBM cells from detection by immune cells. Together, the changes promote tumor progress and cancer-cell survival.  Our findings suggest that restricting dietary intake of methionine and tryptophan might help slow tumor progression and improve treatment outcomes,  says first author and OSUCCC   James researcher Kamalakannan Palanichamy, PhD, research assistant professor in Radiation Oncology.  While we need to better understand how these abnormally regulated metabolites activate oncogenic proteins, our intriguing discovery suggests novel therapeutic targets for this disease,  says principal investigator and study leader Arnab Chakravarti, MD, chair and professor of Radiation Oncology and co-director of the Brain Tumor Program.  For example, restoring the lost enzymes in the two metabolic pathways might slow tumor progression and reduce aggressiveness by inactivating oncogenic kinases and activating immune responses,  says Chakravarti, who holds the Max Morehouse Chair in Cancer Research. Chakravarti further notes that because GBM cells take up methionine much faster than normal glioma cells, positron emission tomography that uses methionine as a tracer (MET-PET) might help map GBM tumors more accurately, allowing more precise surgical removal and radiation therapy planning. (MET-PET is currently an experimental imaging method.) More than 11,880 new cases of GBM were estimated to occur in 2015, with overall survival averaging 12 to 15 months, so there is an urgent need for more effective therapies. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Tryptophan and methionine are essential amino acids   the diet must provide them because cells cannot make them. Normally, the lack of an essential amino acid in the diet can lead to serious diseases and even death. Foods rich in tryptophan and methionine include cheese, lamb, beef, pork, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts and soybeans. Palanichamy, Chakravarti and their colleagues conducted this study using 13 primary GBM cell lines derived from patient tumors, four commercially available GBM cell lines and normal human astrocyte cells. Metabolite analyses were done using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.","Published: April 22, 2016"

From  proteomics  to  foodomics  Many things that we encounter in daily life have an immensely complex chemical composition. The food we consume is a good example. It is likely to contain many thousands of different types of small and (relatively) large molecules. Human blood is another example. The number of different proteins alone is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000. Scientists understand more and more about the roles of all these different proteins and the more we understand, the more we want to know. This has led to the emergence of the science of proteomics, the goal of which is to qualitatively and quantitatively address the presence   and ideally the function   of all these different proteins. Likewise, some people have started to speak of foodomics, which aims to understand the nutritious, health-promoting or toxic effects of all the different molecules in our food. Towards the separation of 1 million compounds The science that is making these developments possible is analytical chemistry. One technique that has especially spurred the unravelling of very complex mixtures is mass spectrometry. This technique has developed dramatically. However, the possibilities of mass spectrometry are limited by the extent to which a mixture can be separated beforehand. Conventional (liquid) chromatographic separations allow slow separations (more than ten hours) of no more than 1,000 compounds. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography, a technique that has been developed at the UvA and in other groups, has the ability to separate up to 10,000 compounds. In his STAMP project, Schoenmakers explores a different (three-dimensional) approach of liquid chromatography. He will develop a system to separate up to a million compounds from complex mixtures, hence the name  Separation Technology for a Million Peaks . This different spatial approach yields a series of prints ('stamps') of separated compounds, which can then be further analysed with the help of, for example, mass spectrometry. The results of the STAMP project will help advance many fields of science, including (molecular) biology, chemistry, health, food, renewable energy and high-tech materials.","Published: April 22, 2016"

Their findings, published in the journal Cell Reports, show that one of these molecules, a miRNA known as miR-9, is a risk factor that controls the activity of hundreds of genes. The researchers, led by Kristen Brennand, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Gang Fang, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, found that miR-9 was significantly under-expressed in cells from four schizophrenic patients, compared to six control participants. The findings were replicated in a larger sample, from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, of ten childhood-onset schizophrenic patients and ten controls. See Also: Retinal changes may serve as measures of brain pathology in schizophrenia ""Schizophrenia is a very complex disorder that is believed to be strongly genetically influenced there are probably more than 1,000 genes contributing to its development, some or many of which will affect individual patients,"" says Kristen Brennand, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and one of the study's lead authors. ""The better we are able to fill in the pieces to this very difficult puzzle, the more we can think about treatment, and, better yet, prevention."" The genes controlled by miR-9 appear to play a role in the fetal development of neurons, and in where these neurons eventually settle in the brain. If these genes are not as active as they should be, the brain will likely be miswired, the authors suggest. miR-9 is only the second such powerful miRNA linked to the devastating psychiatric disorder, but researchers believe others may be involved. Dr. Brennand also says that based on their findings, as well as those of other researchers in the field, many genes recently found to be linked to schizophrenia tend to be genes that are expressed during fetal development even though schizophrenia usually becomes symptomatic in adulthood. ""The idea that children are born with schizophrenia should take the pressure off of parents,"" she says. ""This is a heritable disease that runs in families, and it's no one's fault that someone was born with this genetic risk."" Learn More: Schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk deconstructed Because the slow progress in decoding schizophrenia comes from the lack of live brain tissue to study, the research team combined expertise in stem cell biology, neurobiology, genomics, and systems biology to pioneer a new approach. They obtained skin samples from patients, reprogrammed them into induced pluripotent stem cells, and then differentiated these cells into precise subtypes of human neurons. ""This has allowed us to begin to ask how and why neurons derived from schizophrenia patients differ from those derived from people who are unaffected by the disorder,"" Dr. Brennand says. ""The goal of our research is to not just understand the genetic mechanisms contributing to schizophrenia, but ultimately to develop a screening platform that we can use to identify new therapeutics for the treatment of this debilitating disorder."" The team faced some challenges at the beginning of the project. ""miR-9 was not the only miRNA that is differentially expressed in cells from schizophrenia patients compared to control participants,"" said Gang Fang PhD, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and the other lead author of the study. ""In fact, tens of miRNAs reached statistical significance and we wanted to identify a smaller number of key players. We took a systems biology approach, where we integrated miRNA expression, gene expression, global gene regulatory networks, and proteomic data"". Don't Miss: Protein findings open new avenues to understanding and treatment of schizophrenia ""This approach found evidence suggesting miR-9 has the most significant change of regulatory activity in addition to the expression change of itself,"" added Dr. Fang. ""We hope this general approach will also help the discovery of additional genetic regulators of schizophrenia and other diseases."" Brennand and Fang highlight that their team's findings validate results of an earlier study published March 9 in JAMA Psychiatry, in which a genetic screen, taken from the blood of 35,000 schizophrenia patients, found either low expression or mutations in the hundreds of genes that miR-9 controls.

The new mouse model is significant because it closely replicates the symptoms and gene expression patterns found in people who have the most common genetic cause of ALS and frontotemporal dementia. The findings are published online in the journal Neuron. Learn More: Study shows more patients with ALS have genetic origin than previously thought Having a mouse model that replicates how these two conditions affect nerve cells and pathways in the brain and spinal cord is crucial to understanding what triggers disease in people and for developing treatments, said Laura Ranum, PhD, director of the UF Center for NeuroGenetics, a faculty member of the UF Genetics Institute and a professor in the UF College of Medicine department of molecular genetics and microbiology. The study's lead author, Yuanjing Liu, PhD, a recent graduate of the UF interdisciplinary program in biomedical sciences, worked closely with graduate student Amrutha Pattamatta and other UF researchers to generate and characterize the mice. The team spent nearly four years developing the mouse model, which has an expansion mutation in the C9orf72 gene. This mutation is the most common genetic cause of ALS and accounts for up to 40 percent of all familial cases of the disease, according to The ALS Association. ALS kills nerve cells that stretch from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to muscles, causing muscle wasting, paralysis and death. An estimated 30,000 people in the United States have the disease at any given time and life expectancy is usually two to five years. This mutation is also a common cause of inherited dementia. See Also: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs While other scientists have developed mouse models focusing on different ALS-related genes, the UF Health researchers are the first to cultivate one that focuses on the C9orf72 gene that closely mimics features of both ALS and frontotemporal dementia, including paralysis and dementia. The new mouse model will allow researchers to understand how the same genetic mutation causes paralysis in some patients and cognitive and behavioral problems in others, and how some people escape disease altogether. These mice showed the accumulation of problematic RNA and protein clumps suspected of helping the diseases to progress. Because ALS and frontotemporal dementia belong to a genetically complex disease spectrum that isn't easily studied in humans, the mouse models will enable researchers to tease apart exactly how the gene mutation causes disease. The C9orf72 gene produces at least eight different mutant products. Having the mouse model will help researchers understand which ones are the most important in terms of causing disease. It should also allow them to learn more about what takes place in a particular region of the brain where healthy cells exist next to ones that have died. ""I am excited because one of the two mutant RNAs produced by the mutation accumulates in neurons that are vulnerable to the disease and die. This gives us an important clue for future studies aimed at developing therapies for people,"" Liu said. Don't Miss: Study uncovers key differences among ALS patients Likewise, Ranum is intrigued by the 20 percent of the mice that have the mutated gene but do not develop ALS or frontotemporal dementia. Similarly, a subset of people who carry the C9orf72 mutation do not develop the disease. This suggests there is some protective element at work that, if understood, could be exploited to prevent disease onset, she said. Ranum said her group is already making use of the new mouse model. That includes collaborations with private industry on research aimed at reversing or preventing the disease. University of Florida  Original reporting by: Doug Bennett Liu Y et al.

""These findings suggest that navigational tasks designed to assess a cognitive mapping strategy could represent a powerful new tool for detecting the very earliest Alzheimer's disease-related changes in cognition,"" said senior author Denise Head, associate professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts & Sciences. See Also: Brain navigation can occur without external cues ""The spatial navigation task used in this study to assess cognitive map skills was more sensitive at detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease than the standard psychometric task of episodic memory,"" she said. Preclinical Alzheimer's disease denotes the presence of Alzheimer-related changes in the brain that occur prior to the development of symptoms that lead to the diagnosis. The cognitive findings from this study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, are consistent with where in the brain the ill effects of Alzheimer's disease first surface, as well as with the progression of the disease to other brain regions. Previous research has shown that navigation problems crop up early in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. These deficits may be associated with the build up of amyloid plaques and tau tangles and other signs of deterioration and shrinkage in the brain's prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and caudate. The hippocampus, which is associated with long-term memory storage, the recognition of new surroundings and the creation of cognitive maps, is well-established as an early target for Alzheimer's-related damage. Similar damage also turns up in the caudate, which is associated with learning as well as voluntary movement. ""Our observations suggest a progression such that preclinical Alzheimer's disease is characterized by hippocampal atrophy and associated cognitive mapping difficulties, particularly during the learning phase,"" said first author Samantha Allison, a psychology doctoral student at Washington University. ""As the disease progresses, cognitive mapping deficits worsen, the caudate becomes involved, and route learning deficits emerge."" Learn More: Mazes and brains: When preconception trumps logic While these deficits are well documented in patients with early stage Alzheimer's disease, they have not been well studied in seemingly normal patients who may be progressing toward identifiable early stages of the disease, a status known as preclinical Alzheimer's disease. In this study, researchers used a virtual maze navigation experiment to examine whether specific problems with route learning and cognitive map building, which involve the caudate and the hippocampus, respectively, could be detected in preclinical Alzheimer's. The experiment's design plays on the fact that humans generally find their way in life using two distinct forms of spatial representation and navigation. This is a bird's-eye view of a virtual maze layout used in a study of how cognitive mapping and wayfinding skills are compromised in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Courtesy: Denise Head With egocentric navigation, people rely on past knowledge to follow well-worn routes, moving sequentially from one landmark to another until they reach their target destination. In allocentric navigation, people become familiar with their big picture surroundings and create a mental map of existing landmarks, allowing them to plot best available routes and find shortcuts to new destinations. Participants in this study were separated into three groups based on a test of brain and spinal fluids that can detect biomarkers shown to predict the future development of Alzheimer's-related plaques and tangles in the brain. People who are clinically normal with these markers are considered to have preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This study included 42 clinically normal individuals who lacked the cerebrospinal fluid markers for Alzheimer's, 13 clinically normal individuals who were positive for these markers and thus had preclinical Alzheimer's, and 16 individuals with documented behavioral symptoms of early stage Alzheimer's. All 71 study participants spent about two hours on a desktop computer being tested on their ability to navigate a virtual maze consisting of a series of interconnected hallways with four wallpaper patterns and 20 landmarks. Participants were tested on two navigation skills: how well they could learn and follow a pre-set route, and how well they could form and use a cognitive map of the environment. Participants were given 20 minutes to either learn a specified route, or to study and explore the maze with a navigation joystick. They were then tested on their ability to recreate the route or find their way to specific landmarks in the environment. ""People with cerebrospinal markers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease demonstrated significant difficulties only when they had to form a cognitive map of the environment an allocentric, place-learning navigation process associated with hippocampal function,"" Head said. ""This same preclinical Alzheimer's disease group showed little or no impairment on route learning tasks an egocentric navigation process more closely associated with caudate function."" When compared with cognitively normal study participants who lacked the cerebrospinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's, those with preclinical Alzheimer's disease scored lower on their ability to learn the locations of objects in the environment in relation to each other during the initial study phase. While these results suggest deficits in the ability to form a cognitive map, preclinical Alzheimer's disease participants eventually managed to overcome these map-learning deficits, performing almost as well as cognitively normal participants during a subsequent wayfinding navigation task. Don't Miss: Humans  built-in GPS is our 3-D sense of smell ""These findings suggest that the wayfinding difficulties experienced by people with preclinical Alzheimer's disease are in part related to trouble acquiring the environmental information,"" Head said. ""While they may require additional training to learn new environments, the good news here is that they seem to retain sufficient information to use a cognitive map almost as well as their cognitively normal counterparts."" Head cautions that the current study has several limitations, including a relatively small sample size and a lack of direct information about brain regions and networks that have a role in spatial navigation and wayfinding. However, Allison notes, ""We are currently investigating how brain regions impacted early during the course of the disease are related to cognitive mapping deficits in a larger sample of individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease."" Within the context of these limitations, the current investigation demonstrates significant preclinical Alzheimer's disease-related deficits in aspects of cognitive mapping with relative preservation in route learning. In contrast, people experiencing memory lapses and other behavioral problems associated with early stage Alzheimer's disease had clear difficulties both in learning an established route and in finding their own way to new landmarks. ""This pattern is consistent with decrements in hippocampal integrity prior to changes in the caudate,"" Head said. ""These findings suggest that navigational tasks designed to assess a cognitive mapping strategy could represent a powerful tool for detecting the very earliest Alzheimer's disease-related changes in cognition."" Participants in the study came from an ongoing study at Washington University's Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Scientists have been following participants with and without a family history of the disease, with the aim of identifying Alzheimer's disease biomarkers most closely associated with the development of full-blown disease years later. The research team notes that the presence of cerebrospinal fluid markers for preclinical Alzheimer's does not guarantee that a person will go on to develop full blown Alzheimer's. ""Future research should examine whether cognitive mapping deficits in individuals in preclinical Alzheimer's are associated with an increased risk of developing symptomatic Alzheimer's,"" they said.

The receptor transmits electrical signals in neurons and is involved in various disorders, meaning that the discovery opens the way for new treatments. See Also: Unprecedented detail of intact neuronal receptor offers blueprint for drug developers The major neurotransmitter serotonin regulates mood, appetite, sleep, memory, learning, and other functions by binding to dedicated receptor proteins. Serotonin receptors have been researched for decades, but details about their structure and function are hard to come by. EPFL scientists have now made the first ever computer simulation of a notoriously elusive serotonin receptor that is involved in fast signal transmission in neurons and plays a central role in disorders such as schizophrenia, chemotherapy nausea, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and seizures. The work is published in the journal Structure. The 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT standing for 5-hydroxytryptamine, the technical name of serotonin) is the third member of a family of serotonin receptors. It is made up of five proteins that form a tube-like channel through the cell membrane. When serotonin binds to the receptor, a gate opens up and allows positively charged ions of sodium, potassium or calcium to flow through the channel. This changes the electrical balance between the inside and outside of the neuron, and an electrical signal is transmitted across the cell membrane. Don't Miss: First serotonin neurons made from human stem cells In our central and peripheral nervous system such ""neurotransmitter-gated"" receptors with ion channels like 5-HT3 are critical for signaling between neurons. However they have been notoriously difficult to study with traditional tools of structural biology. But in a 2014 Nature paper, the lab of Horst Vogel at EPFL published the first ever, high-resolution and complete 3D structure of the 5-HT3 receptor. Now, Vogel's lab has followed up with a complete computer simulation of 5-HT3 that reveals the motions of each atom across microseconds and at atomic, sub-nanometer resolution. This so-called ""molecular dynamics simulation"" uses the structure of 5-HT3 receptor that Vogel's lab uncovered in 2014 to accurately depict the structural changes that 5-HT3 undergoes inside a cell membrane after serotonin binds and activates it to open its ion channel. To make sure that they were not looking at random structural changes of the receptor itself, the researchers also ran simulations of the receptor without the ligand. ""Our 2014 paper delivered the architecture of the 5-HT3 neuroreceptor with atomic detail,"" says Horst Vogel. ""But that was a static structure that did not explain how the receptor functions as a gated transmembrane ion channel to transmit electrical signals across the cell membrane."" Learn More: Serotonin's early role in the assembly of brain circuits Specifically, Vogel's team wanted to know how a ligand, e.g. serotonin, that binds to the part of 5-HT3 outside of the cell, can open the ion channel's gate, which is buried inside the cell's membrane six nanometers away a considerable distance in the world of molecules. With this degree of accuracy, the researchers feel confident that the simulation delivers a realistic description of how the 5-HT3 receptor works. Beyond that, it also acts as a blueprint for the function of neurotransmitter-gated, ion-channel receptors in general. ""The data can help us understand how neuronal signals are transmitted at an atomic scale,"" says Vogel. ""This would hold enormous potential for future drug development and treatment of disorders linked to these receptors, including schizophrenia, anxiety, nausea, and others.""

New research conducted by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, found that higher levels of antibody against a different flu surface protein   neuraminidase (NA)   were the better predictor of protection against flu infection and its unpleasant side effects. Neuraminidase, which is not currently the main target antigen in traditional flu vaccines, enables newly formed flu viruses to exit the host cell and cause further viral replication in the body.  Each year between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the United States die as the result of seasonal influenza and its complications,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci., M.D.  Annual vaccination against seasonal flu continues to be the most effective way to protect against infection, and this new study provides some interesting clues about how we might improve the level of protection that flu vaccines provide.  Higher levels of HA antibodies in a person s body have long been associated with greater protection against influenza infection. As a result, HA antibody levels have traditionally been used to guide vaccine strain selection and to infer how effective that vaccine might be against circulating viruses until field studies are available. However, variations in seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness over the past decade have raised questions about their protective ability and whether other factors, such as antibodies to the NA protein on the flu virus, should be considered in designing the annual flu vaccine to improve its performance.  The idea behind this study was to re-evaluate the bar that was previously established for evaluating a person s immune response to influenza vaccines,  said the study's principal investigator Matthew J. Memoli, M.D., director of the Clinical Studies Unit in NIAID s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases.  We wanted to test the conventional wisdom and see if people with high levels of HA antibodies were less likely to develop mild-to-moderate influenza compared with those with lower HA antibody levels.  To do this, the research team enrolled 65 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 years in the human challenge study   a type of research study in which individuals are exposed to disease-causing pathogens under carefully controlled conditions. The flu challenge study, which began in September 2013, was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in the specially designed Clinical Studies Unit, which has distinct isolation and infection control features. Dr. Memoli and his colleagues measured levels of existing anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies in the participants  blood. Based on those results, the volunteers were placed into two groups: those with high levels of anti-HA antibodies (25 participants) and those with low levels of anti-HA antibodies (40 participants). Each of the volunteers was then administered an intranasal dose (1 milliliter) of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus; the volunteers were required to stay in the study unit for nine days where they were monitored by medical staff 24 hours daily. After the nine-day testing period, participants were discharged after completing two days of negative flu tests. After that time, they had four follow-up visits with the study team over eight weeks. As expected, the researchers found that the group of participants who had high levels of anti-HA antibodies when enrolled in the trial experienced a significantly lower incidence of mild-to-moderate influenza disease and some reduction in its duration compared with participants with low HA antibody levels. However, the NIAID researchers also found that these participants were just as likely to experience some flu symptoms as those with low levels of HA antibodies. If these results are consistent with naturally occurring flu infection, it suggests that while high HA antibody levels may limit viral shedding, and thus the spread of virus from person to person, these levels may not prevent the development of flu symptoms. This would help to explain why some people who receive the seasonal flu vaccine might still report flu symptoms. Surprisingly, the researchers found that participants with high levels of NA antibodies experienced a more robust protective effect from the vaccine than did those in the high HA group. Specifically, the NIAID team found that the individuals with high NA antibody levels experienced less severe disease, a shorter duration of viral shedding and symptoms, and fewer and less severe  symptoms compared with those with high HA levels when challenged with the 2009 H1N1 virus. HA and NA antibody levels considered together may be a better predictor of whether someone develops mild-to-moderate influenza disease   and the severity of their symptoms   than either factor alone, but this study suggests that NA antibodies are the stronger factor for determining disease severity, the authors conclude. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that the role of NA immunity should be considered when studying influenza susceptibility and that NA antigens should be considered in the design of future flu vaccine platforms.","Published: April 21, 2016"

The new Center, located on the SBP campus in La Jolla, will bring together experts from SBP and GSK to investigate factors that influence brain function and potentially reverse or slow down neurodegeneration, with the aim of identifying and validating new therapeutic targets. Under the three year agreement, GSK will provide funding to create and support a research laboratory. Staffed by SBP scientists, postdoctoral candidates and technicians working alongside neuroscientists from GSK, the Center will be designed to bolster research dedicated to translational neuroscience. The number of people living with dementia worldwide is set to triple by 2050 to 135 million, yet there are currently no medicines that can prevent or cure this common disorder, and the same can be said of other neurodegenerative conditions. Development of new medicines to treat these conditions is particularly challenging only eight percent of experimental treatments for neurological conditions that reach the testing stage in humans ever become an approved medicine. The new SBP-GSK Center for Translational Neuroscience aims to increase this success rate by improving the translation of disease biology to drug discovery through a successful collaboration that drives synergistic innovation.  Neurodegeneration is one of the most important and challenging areas for science and medicine,"" said SBP CEO Perry Nisen, M.D., Ph.D.  This unique alliance provides an opportunity to combine the complementary expertise of our institutions to address one of the greatest unmet needs of our society today.  Min Li, Ph.D., SVP, Global Head of Neurosciences, GSK said,  Rapid advances in science are characterized by both a deeper understanding of a specific topic and an awareness of the convergence across different, but related areas. Neurodegenerative diseases cross many fields of science, and this partnership takes full advantage of the depth and breadth in expertise both organizations bring to the table. Joining with a top-tier academic institution like SBP located in a high-density area of talent and elite research will also enhance our agility, enable us to move projects forward rapidly, and further support the discovery of new medicines for neurodegenerative diseases.   This collaboration also provides a unique opportunity for scientists to be fully funded to pursue pioneering research in neuroscience with the goal of bringing validated targets that could lead to therapies in an area of great patient need,  Nisen said.  GSK has a long history of research and development in neuroscience dating to the 1950s through heritage companies. Today, GSK s global footprint for neurosciences includes Shanghai, London, and Philadelphia. In 2015, GSK opened a R&D Satellite in La Jolla with the intent to find, fund and fuel scientific research that will lead to new and innovative medicines for patients. The Satellite focuses on creating and nurturing collaborative relationships in San Diego and all along the West coast s vibrant academic, biotech and venture communities. The addition of the SBP-GSK Center in La Jolla is in line with GSK s strategy to look for academic-industry collaborations that complement internal expertise in the search for solutions to the tough questions. SBP takes a multidisciplinary approach to neuroscience, combining expertise in biology, genomics, chemistry, imaging and drug screening to reveal the underlying causes of neurodegeneration and novel strategies to treat nervous system disorders.

Initially, both organizations will work together to advance research in several areas of oncology, which could include, among others, breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and hematological cancer. Research projects are chosen by a joint steering committee, composed of representatives from each organization. AbbVie also gains an option for an exclusive license to certain UChicago discoveries made under the agreement.  University of Chicago researchers and clinicians have worked closely with AbbVie scientists in areas such as immunology and oncology for some time,  said Kenneth S. Polonsky, executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Chicago and dean of the Biological Sciences Division and Pritzker School of Medicine.  This agreement adds depth to that established and productive collaboration. The increased level of interaction should speed progress in medical care, beginning with cancer patients.  As part of the agreement, AbbVie will provide funding for the collaboration that may be used for purposes including preclinical research, clinical trials and possible future programs at the University resulting from this partnership. The overall collaborative efforts will provide UChicago physicians and scientists with the opportunity to participate in AbbVie-sponsored clinical trials, access to new therapies developed by AbbVie for use in preclinical research funded under the collaboration, as well as opportunities to work closely with AbbVie s research and development teams to promote scientific knowledge exchange.  Advancements in oncology, both at the basic science and clinical levels, are happening faster and more broadly every day,  said Gary Gordon, vice president of oncology clinical development at AbbVie.  Collaborating closely with the scientists and clinicians at the University of Chicago allows us to expand our own research efforts even further to benefit patients.  As part of the collaborative agreement, researchers from the University of Chicago and AbbVie will participate in an annual symposium that brings together scientists from both institutions to discuss research and evaluate potential new projects.  This is a wonderful opportunity for our investigators to join forces with a leader in oncology and new drug development, accelerate the pace of discovery and deliver clinical benefits to our patients,  said cancer specialist Everett Vokes, professor and chairman of medicine at the University of Chicago.  This will support pre-clinical research, give our physician-scientists earlier access to drugs in the AbbVie pipeline and lay the groundwork for further interaction and collaboration.  AbbVie also holds a membership to the Chicago Innovation Exchange, a hub for multidisciplinary collaborations and support for business startup activities and an observer seat at meetings of the University of Chicago Innovation Fund Advisory Committee, which provides guidance to the Innovation Fund, a $20 million investment fund focusing on commercializing early-stage research and supporting emerging companies at the University. The Innovation Fund is managed by the Chicago Innovation Exchange in partnership with UChicagoTech and the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation.   The agreement also provides AbbVie researchers with access to data commons technology developed by the Center for Data Intensive Science at the University of Chicago and the core technical team that is developing the technology. This novel platform powers several large-scale resources for the research community, including the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons one of the world s largest storage, analysis and distribution systems for cancer genomics data.  This collaboration highlights the University s strengths in clinical and basic research and commitment to translating ideas into real-world solutions,  said Alan Thomas, associate vice president and director of UChicagoTech, which was a critical partner in facilitating this collaboration.

We have selected 10 scientists and projects that we believe use new insights and fresh approaches and have high potential to make a difference for people with cancer,  said William G. Kaelin Jr., MD, professor of medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and chairman of the SU2C Innovative Research Grant (IRG) review committee.  Just as importantly, SU2C is investing in the future of cancer research by supporting an outstanding group of early-career investigators whom we believe are rising stars in science.  The announcement marks the third time SU2C has selected a class of Innovative Research Grant recipients. Previous classes were announced in 2009 and 2011. With the new class of IRGs, the total number of recipients now stands at 36. Serving as Stand Up To Cancer s celebrity ambassador at the event is Sonequa Martin-Green, 31, an actress and producer who is a main cast member in the hit television show  The Walking Dead,  in which she plays a survivor of the zombie apocalypse.  In real life, she has lost several members of her extended family to cancer, and has other relatives, including her mother, who are cancer survivors.  I have seen the terrible toll that cancer can take in a single family, so I respect and fully support these outstanding researchers in their battle against cancer,  Martin-Green said.  Hopefully the innovative ideas they are pursuing will one day spare other families the losses that my family, and so many other families have endured.  The 10 grant recipients work at eight different institutions across the country where they have their own, independent laboratories. These innovative projects are characterized as  high-risk  because they either challenge existing paradigms, utilize novel concepts or approaches, and because in order to receive a grant, the applicants were not required as they would be by most conventional funding mechanisms to have already conducted a portion of the research resulting in an established base of evidence. If successful, the projects have the potential for  high-reward  in terms of saving lives.  We re trying to find the superstars of tomorrow and set them on their course by giving them funding so they don t have to worry about that at this earlier stage of their career,  said Sara A. Courtneidge, PhD, associate director for translational sciences of the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University and vice-chairperson of the review committee.  These grants will allow them to get off to a really good start in their independent research programs, take this research to the next level and then apply for more traditional funding mechanisms to take it forward,  she said.  I see it as a really good opportunity for young people not to have to worry so much about where their next grant is coming from until they ve got themselves established.  The scope of the projects selected range from tumor metabolism to imaging of drug response in single cells to mathematical models of combination drug therapy to the use of certain enzymes as new anticancer targets, among other topics. With their institutions and the titles of their proposals, the IRG recipients are:   John G. Albeck, PhD, University of California, Davis: Targeting cellular plasticity in individual basal-type breast cancer cells;   Kara A. Bernstein, PhD, University of Pittsburgh: Uncovering how RAD51 paralog mutations contribute to cancer predisposition;   Juan R. Cubillos-Ruiz, PhD,  Weill Cornell Medicine :  Phospholipid messengers as drivers of dendritic cell dysfunction in cancer;   Greg Michael Delgoffe, PhD, University of Pittsburgh:  Metabolic reprogramming using oncolytic viruses to improve immunotherapy;   Martin Kampmann, PhD, University of California, San Francisco:  Weak links  in cancer proteostasis networks as new therapeutic targets;    Dan A. Landau, MD, PhD, Weill Cornell Medicine: Algorithmically-driven quantitative combination cancer therapy engineering;   Li Ma, PhD, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center: Deubiquitinating enzymes as novel anticancer targets;   Melissa Skala, PhD, Vanderbilt University (moving to Morgridge Institute for Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison): Imaging cell-level heterogeneity in solid tumors for personalized treatment;    Matthew G. Vander Heiden, MD, PhD, Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology:  Defining the metabolic dependencies of tumors; and   Hao Zhu, MD, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center: Defining the mechanistic connections between injury, regeneration, and cancer. More than 250 applications were received, from which 16 finalists were chosen to make presentations in person to a committee of senior scientists.  They were all incredibly good,  said William G. Nelson, MD, PhD, vice-chair of the review committee and director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center in Baltimore.  Very hard-working, ambitious, and imaginative, each and every one of them. Their ideas were high-risk and high-reward, but the young scientists themselves were sure bets. They are going to go places.  The term of the grants begins July 1 and runs for three years. The scientists will report their progress twice a year to SU2C and the AACR, which organized the application and review process and will administer the grants. Since 2008, SU2C has successfully launched 19 Dream Teams, two Translational Research Teams, and 36 Innovative Research Grants with funds committed by philanthropic, organizational, corporate and individual donors, as well as non-profit collaborators.","Published: April 21, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/do-gut-microbes-shape-our-evolution-192694,Do Gut Microbes Shape Our Evolution  Scientists increasingly realize the importance of gut and other microbes to our health and well being  but one UC Berkeley biologist is asking whether these microbes   our microbiota   might also have played a role in shaping who we are by steering evolution  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Biologists have gathered evidence that the interdependence between animals and their symbionts   the organisms, typically bacteria, that live in or on them   has consequences for the evolution of both. But Michael Shapira, a UC Berkeley assistant professor of integrative biology, believes that the diverse microbial communities that we harbor have a more profound effect, significantly ratcheting up evolution in an intimate collaboration for survival. In a paper now online and scheduled for publication in the July edition of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Shapira, who studies the gut microbes of the nematode C. elegans, reviews evidence that demonstrates how microbiotas affect and contribute to host evolution, either by evolving along with the host, or by stepping in at critical moments to help the host adapt to a new environmental challenge. These examples, he says, bolster the relatively recent concept of the hologenome, a term referring to the genomes of the host and its microbes together, encompassing perhaps thousands of different types of bacteria on the skin, in the gut and even in reproductive organs. In his recent paper, Shapira elaborates on a 2008 proposal by Tel Aviv University researchers that evolution can act on the hologenome, rather than on the genomes of the host and its microbiota separately. This implies that as the host evolves to suit a changing environment, its microbiota play a critical role in directing and participating in that evolution.  When I came across the paper by Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg and Eugene Rosenberg describing the hologenome concept, it blew my mind,  Shapira said.  The idea that animals could undergo selection not based solely on their own genome, but with the help of many more, opens the door for previously unimagined evolutionary paths.  Shapira expands on this idea to encompass some of the newest discoveries about amazing symbiotic relationships between organisms that, because they depend on one another, are tied together for life. Aphids and their gut bacteria Examples of co-evolution of hosts and their symbionts are all around us, Shapira said. Aphids have been shown to rely on bacteria to provide essential amino acids the aphids cannot make themselves, and cannot readily obtain from their diet, while the bacteria   a group called Buchnera   get room and, in the form of sap-derived sugars, board. Researchers examining the genes of different species of aphids and of their individual gut bacteria found that the emergence of new species of aphids during evolution was mirrored by speciation events in the insects Buchnera symbionts. This demonstrates how the linked fates of the two species lead to co-evolution. But Buchnera are not alone. Subsequent work showed that aphids also harbor other symbionts that are less important for, or dependent on, their host, but nevertheless help the insects adapt to new niches in a changing environment. Together, Shapira suggests, these species represent a basic hologenome, with essential, co-evolving symbionts, but also with a pool of microbes useful for flexibly adapting to a changing environment. Adaptation to new niches can potentially lead to population fragmentation, isolation and, subsequently, to the evolution of a new species. This is a pivotal consequence of life with symbionts, said Shapira, who believes that microbiotas, which involve many types of symbionts, represent an expanded version of this aphid-symbiont relationship. An experiment performed in fruit flies demonstrates this. When raised on different types of food, flies develop different gut microbiotas, presumably better at handling the available food. The surprising outcome, however, was that  within one generation, the flies developed mate preference for their own group, ignoring the others, and that this was dependent on the microbes in the gut that helped them utilize the food,  he said.  This led to de facto reproductive isolation of two populations and could facilitate future speciation, that is, real reproductive isolation   a genetic barrier preventing members of the two groups from parenting viable or fertile progeny.  Nematode s upset tummies In his own lab, he is raising nematodes on soil enriched with different types of produce   sugary versus fibrous, for example   and finds that no matter what the food source and the resulting environmental microbial diversity, worms have similar sets of bacteria in their guts. Some 32 types, in fact. The balance shifts with different food, as has been seen in humans as well. People with diets high in fat, for example, have a different microbiota than do vegans, though in humans it is far more difficult to identify a core microbiota. Studies have shown that these gut bacteria contribute to many aspects of the host s life, including development, fertility, metabolism, immunity and behavior. Microbe-free mice don t develop a robust immune system, for example, while nematodes rely on some gut microbes to fight off bad bugs. In his paper, Shapira proposes that animals and a set of core bacteria   or in general, a host with its core microbiota   evolve together, adapting as they can to changing conditions and perhaps, over time, becoming new species. The other bacteria swimming around in our guts are less tied to our essential functions, but are influenced by the changing environment, and ideally serve as a resource to help us adapt to sudden changes in diet or toxins, for example. In thinking about these possibilities, Shapira draws from various examples of symbiosis. One recent experiment showed, for example, that an insect, the broad-headed stink bug, was able to survive pesticide exposure thanks to acquisition of one type of gut microbe that detoxified the pesticide   a boon for the bug but a service needed from the microbe only in one unique situation.  In my mind, this is an example of the advantages of having a flexible pool of microbes. You can exchange them with the environment, you can get the strains that are better able to protect yourself,  he said.  That s one way to achieve adaptation.  Shapira s proposal implies, too, that some parts of the microbiota   that is, the core microbiota   can likely be passed on to an individual s children, but that other parts, belonging to the flexible pool, could be exchanged with the environment. Changes in either the host or the microbes change the entire hologenome.  With the growing understanding that all animals are in fact in a symbiotic relationship with complex microbial communities, the framework to consider how symbiotic interactions shape host evolution should be expanded,  he said. Shapira plans future experiments with C. elegans to test these ideas and clarify the mutually beneficial relationship between hosts and their microbiotas.","Published: April 21, 2016"

Since its discovery, scientists throughout the world have been working on ways of further improving or adjusting the CRISPR-Cas9 system to their specific needs. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, the Ume  University in Sweden and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig have now discovered a feature of the CRISPR-associated protein Cpf1 that has previously not been observed in this family of enzymes: Cpf1 exhibits dual, RNA and DNA, cleavage activity. In contrast to CRISPR-Cas9, Cpf1 is able to process the pre-crRNA on its own, and then using the processed RNA to specifically target and cut DNA. Not requiring a host derived RNase and the tracrRNA makes this the most minimalistic CRISPR immune system known to date. The mechanism of combining two separate catalytic moieties in one allows for possible new avenues for sequence specific genome engineering, most importantly facilitation of targeting multiple sites at once, the so-called multiplexing. CRISPR-Cas is part of the immune system of bacteria and is used to fight viruses. In the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the enzyme Cas9 cuts the virus DNA at a location specified by an RNA molecule   known as CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in complex with another RNA, the so-called tracrRNA. This puts the pathogens out of action. In 2011, Emmanuelle Charpentier and her co-workers described that the system consists of two RNAs forming a duplex (tracrRNA and pre-crRNA), with tracrRNA maturing pre-crRNA to crRNA, in the presence of the protein Cas9 (formerly named Csn1). A year later Emmanuelle Charpentier and colleagues demonstrated that tracrRNA and crRNA together, be it in form of the duplex of two guide RNAs or a fused single guide RNA, are required to specifically guide the Cas9 enzyme to the matching target DNA sequence. Since then, CRISPR-Cas9 has taken laboratories by storm. Both scientists and clinicians have great hopes for it: the latter aims to use the enzyme scissors to cure severe genetic diseases.  Although the workings of CRISPR-Cas9 sound simple, the details of the mechanisms involved are rather subtle,  says Charpentier, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology. Before the crRNA molecule can show the Cas9 protein the cutting point, it must be transformed into its final form itself: RNA-cleaving proteins are needed so that a functioning crRNA arises. One of these is RNase III. In 2011, Charpentier discovered that this enzyme is involved in the crRNA maturation process along with tracrRNA. A minimalistic CRISPR-system The researchers have now discovered that the immune defence mechanism of some bacteria is simpler in structure than CRISPR-Cas9. In addition to Cas9, these bacteria use the enzyme Cpf1 for cleaving foreign DNA. The results now show that Cpf1 can cut both RNA and DNA. Cpf1 first removes sections of the crRNA and thereby assists the maturation. Additional maturation enzymes like RNase III are not required. The mature RNA-molecule then guides Cpf1 to its target section on the DNA. Cpf1 thus has a dual function: it enables the functioning of crRNA and then cleaves the DNA in a sequence specific manner. In addition, unlike Cas9, Cpf1 is not depending on the help of a tracrRNA molecule to reach its destination. Consequently, it is even simpler in structure than CRISPR-Cas9.  CRISPR-Cpf1 is a plug-and-play system with no additional component needed. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas9 needs in its natural setting an assistant to activate the system,  explains Charpentier.  If the CRISPR-Cpf1 system provides any tangible added value over the CRISPR-Cas9 system when it comes to eukaryotic gene editing remains to be elucidated. However, it is stunning to see how evolution has succeeded to yield a dramatically minimalistic but effective immune system to fight invading viruses , says Charpentier.  There may be more such systems to be found in nature in the future, the search for them is already in full swing. ","Published: April 21, 2016"

Merkel cell carcinima is a rare, aggressive form of skin cancer.  Responses to the drug were seen in those whose cancers were driven by a virus, as well as those whose cancers were induced by exposure to ultraviolet light, a type of radiation from the sun or other sources .  In this clinical trial, patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma who received pembrolizumab had an objective response rate of 56 percent, which is similar to chemotherapy outcomes, but the duration of response to pembrolizumab appears to be significantly longer than that for chemotherapy,  said Paul Ngheim, affiliate investigator of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and and UW professor of medicine, Division of Dermatology.  While the study is still ongoing,"" Ngheim said, ""the vast majority of patients [86 percent] who responded to pembrolizumab are still experiencing excellent disease control more than six months after starting therapy.  In about 80 precent of cases of Merkel cell carcinoma, a virus called Merkel polyomavirus, abbreviated MCPyV, is the driving factor, Nghiem explained. The virus is often present on normal skin. About 2,000 new cases of this rare skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year. Merkel cell carcinoma is 35-fold less common than melanoma.  On average,however, it is about three times more likely to kill a patient than melanoma. Response to chemotherapy is typically quite brief, and half of patients develop progressive disease within three months of starting treatment, Nghiem added. Nghiem and his colleagues enrolled 26 patients with advanced, metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in this single-arm, open-label trial. None had received any prior, systematic therapy. Of them, 17 had MCPyV-positive disease. All patients received 2 mg/kg body weight of pembrolizumab every three weeks. Responses were assessed every nine to 12 weeks. At the time of data analysis, patients in the trial had received 4 to 49 weeks of therapy. The overall response rate was 63 percent in patients with virus-positive Merkel cell carcinoma and 44 percent in those with the virus-negative form induced by ultraviolet light.  Four patients, three with virus-positive disease, had complete responses, and 10 patients, seven with virus-positive disease, had partial responses. Adverse events in this trial were similar to other trials of other PD-1 inhibitors -- drugs that block an immune system checkpoint called programmed cell death protein 1 and activate the body's defenses to attack tumors. Side effects were largely managed with steroid treatment and stopping the study drug, Nghiem added. The condition of two patients who developed severe drug-related toxicities improved by treating with corticosteroids and quiting pembrolizumab.  Importantly, both these patients have ongoing antitumor responses many months after discontinuation of pembrolizumab,  he noted.  We believe that the immune system is likely  seeing  different targets in the virus-positive and virus-negative patients,  Nghiem said. He explained that the virus-positive tumors produce the viral proteins needed for the tumors to grow. These viral proteins may be readily detected by the immune system. In contrast, virus-negative Merkel cell carcinoma has extremely high numbers of mutations caused by sunlight. These mutations can change the normal cellular proteins so they no longer appear to be the body's own self.  Certain of the immune system's T cell should be able to recognize and attack these tumors, but sometimes are restrained. Pembrolizumab acts by removing the  brakes   on tumor-specific immune cells, thereby allowing the T cells to kill the cancer cells. Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma. ""We are expanding this trial to recruit additional patients.  We hope that these data will contribute to meaningful new therapeutic options becoming available for these patients,  Nghiem said.  It was initially challenging to partner with pharmaceutical companies because of the rarity of Merkel cell carcinoma,"" he added. "" We are v thankful that the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network, Merck, and multiple clinical sites came together to carry out this challenging study, which we believe is providing significant hope for Merkel cell carcinoma patients,  he added. Nghiem is a consultant for EMD Serono, Inc., and receives funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb to perform biomarker studies in Merkel cell cancer  clinical trials.","Published: April 21, 2016"

The design complements BD Vacutainer  evacuated blood collection tubes, and continues the BD heritage of ensuring best practice in the collection, transportation and processing of blood samples. BD Barricor  tubes are optimised to deliver a high quality plasma sample by reducing cellular content (vs. plasma gel tubes), as a result of the mechanical separator remaining open throughout the centrifugation cycle. It eliminates gel artefacts which can lead to instrument downtime. These factors together with longer sample stability can significantly improve the sample and laboratory workflow. According to the American Journal of Clinical Pathology, with 60 to 70 percent of the required information on a patient s chart coming from laboratory test results, there is a high demand for rapid test turnaround time among clinicians.1 BD Barricor tubes deliver a faster time-to-result for patients   with no clotting time required and a reduction in centrifugation time of up to 7 minutes, an overall saving in turnaround time of 37 minutes is possible.  Laboratory technicians are forced to choose between a clean sample with serum and a fast sample with plasma,  said Mike Fairbourn, Vice President and General Manager, UK and Ireland at BD.  BD Barricor tubes eliminate this tradeoff, providing a cleaner and faster plasma sample than current methods.

Night owls should take special note of a new study by University of Delaware researcher Freda Patterson and collaborators at the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University and the University of Arizona College of Medicine, who found that the early-to-bed, early-to-rise approach aligns much better with cardiovascular health. See Also: Weekend catch-up sleep can reduce diabetes risk associated with sleep loss Sleep deficits and poor-quality sleep have been linked to obesity and a myriad of health problems, but this study shows that when it comes to promoting healthy hearts, it's not a matter of getting more sleep. It's a matter of getting adequate sleep at optimal times. Doing that seems to reduce the kind of behaviors smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary choices that put hearts in harm's way. ""There are some who believe that sleep as a physiological function is upstream to these heart-health behaviors,"" said Patterson, assistant professor of behavioral health and nutrition in the University's College of Health Sciences. ""If that is true, the implication would be that if we can modify sleep as a central risk factor, we might be in much better position to leverage or modify some of our most stubborn cardiovascular risk behaviors such as tobacco use."" The study, published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, examined the duration and approximate timing of sleep to see what patterns might be linked to the three prime suspects of cardiovascular trouble smoking, poor diet and sedentary habits. Those three behaviors have been blamed for about 40 percent of cardiovascular deaths in the United States and the United Kingdom. The study had an enormous pool of data with which to work, drawing from the United Kingdom's Biobank Resource and a sample of 439,933 adults, between the ages of 40-69. They found several strong connections, but first, a few notes about definitions and methods. Don't Miss: Study warns of the risk entailed when 'night owls' rise early in the morning The study defined short sleep as less than six hours, adequate sleep as seven to eight hours, and long sleep as nine hours or more. Respondents were categorized by their self-reported sleep-timing or ""chronotype"" whether they considered themselves a morning person, more morning than evening, more evening than morning, or an evening person. Participants were asked about their physical activity, how much time they spent using a computer or watching TV on an average day, how many servings of fruits and vegetables they had each day and how many cigarettes they typically smoked in an average day. And the bottom line was this those whose sleep was either short or long and the night owls who went to bed later were more likely than adequate sleepers and those who went to bed earlier to smoke, remain sedentary and eat fewer fruits and vegetables. ""These data suggest that it's not just sleep deprivation that relates to cardiovascular risk behaviors, but too much sleep can relate as well,"" Patterson said. ""Oftentimes, health messages say we need to get more sleep, but this may be too simplistic. Going to bed earlier and getting adequate sleep was associated with better heart health behaviors."" The American Health Association reports that only 5-10 percent of adults meet ideal standards in diet, physical activity and tobacco use. The rest of us have work to do. ""We know that people who are active tend to have better sleep patterns, and we also know that people who do not get their sleep are less likely to be active,"" Patterson said. ""A pressing question for practitioners and researchers is how do you leverage one to improve the other?"" Data on the population studied were derived from the United Kingdom Biobank Resource, which draws on the UK's national health service. Subjects were between 40-69 years old during the four-year data collection period, which went from 2006 to 2010.

The researchers discovered a traveling spike generator that appears to move across the hippocampus and change direction, while generating brain waves. The generator itself, however, produces no electrical signal. See Also: Syllables that oscillate in neuronal circuits ""In epilepsy, we've thought the focus of seizures is fixed and, in severe cases, that part of the brain is surgically removed,"" said Dominique Durand, Elmer Lincoln Lindseth Professor in Biomedical Engineering at Case School of Engineering and leader of the study. ""But if the focus, or source, of seizures moves as we've described that's problematic."" The findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, builds on Durand's work published late last year, identifying brain waves that appear to be spread through a mild electrical field not the known transmissions through synapses, diffusion or gap junctions. The speed of the waves most closely match those found in epilepsy and in healthy sleep and theta waves, which are thought to help form memories. On this latest study, Durand worked with PhD students Mingming Zhang, Rajat S. Shivacharan, postdoctoral researcher Chia-Chu Chiang, and research associate Luis E Gonzales-Reyes. Working from the same data that revealed the brain waves, the team found the source was also moving too slow for synaptic transmission and a little too fast for diffusion. ""We don't know what's causing the propagation,"" Durand said. The engineers estimate the size of the source is 300 to 500 micrometers in diameter. It appears to generate spikes all around its periphery, but the source moves nearly 100 times slower than the spikes. ""The source is like a moving car with pulsing lights,"" Durand said. Learn More: It don t mean a thing if the brain ain t got that swing To find the source of the waves, the team tracked spikes propagating through an unfolded rat hippocampus. They used a penetrating microelectrode array of 64 electrodes arranged in a grid on the tissue, to record the activity. The delay between the initial spike and the peaks recorded along consecutive electrodes in the grid was measured in milliseconds. By inserting time values surrounding those recorded by each of the electrodes, the researchers refined the grid to include a total of 256 points or pixels. Using this data, the researchers created an isochrone map a map of lines connecting locations where a given spike arrived at the same time. The maps look something like topographical maps, but instead of showing elevations, the lines show the wave fronts as they spread over time. The source of each wave propagation was estimated to be the geometric center of the electrodes that recorded the first neural firing at maximum amplitude. Each brain wave appeared to have a slew of sources, firing it along either from the temporal region toward the septal or vice versa. The team applied Doppler effect equations to the frequency of spikes in front and behind the source. Like the direct observations, the results strongly indicate the sources are moving smoothly across the hippocampus. When a source reached the hippocampus edge, it started in the opposite direction, which may explain observations by others that waves moving in opposite directions have been found in the same brain tissue at the same time. Don't Miss: How brain waves guide memory formation Durand's lab is trying to understand how a source that moves without diffusion can move without electricity and generate electrical spikes. The team is also trying to understand what these non-synaptic events do and whether they are relevant to processing neural activity. Because the speed of these waves is close to the speed of sleep and theta waves, the researchers speculate they may be involved in consolidating memory. If the phenomenon is relevant to epilepsy, it may provide a target for therapies. ""Can we block the spikes without blocking the source?"" Durand asked. The lab is now developing new neural imaging methods to better track sources and learn how they propagate spikes. Case Western Reserve University Zhang M et al.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mapping-neurons-improve-treatment-parkinsons-284190,Mapping neurons to improve the treatment of Parkinson s  Researchers map a neural circuit responsible for motor impairment in patients with Parkinson s disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers map a neural circuit responsible for motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease -Because billions of neurons are packed into our brain, the neuronal circuits that are responsible for controlling our behaviors are by necessity highly intermingled. This tangled web makes it complicated to determine exactly which circuits do what. Now, using two laboratory techniques pioneered in part at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Caltech researchers have mapped out the pathways of a set of neurons responsible for the kinds of motor impairments such as difficulty walking found in patients with Parkinson's disease. The work from the laboratory of Viviana Gradinaru, assistant professor of biology and biological engineering is published in the journal Neuron. See Also: MRI brain scans detect people with early Parkinson's In patients with Parkinson's disease, gait disorders and difficulty with balance are often caused by the degeneration of a specific type of neuron called cholinergic neurons in a region of the brainstem called the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Damage to this same population of neurons in the PPN is also linked to reward-based behaviors and disorders, such as addiction. Previously, researchers had not been able to untangle the neural circuitry originating in the PPN to understand how both addictions and Parkinson's motor impairments are modulated within the same population of cells. Furthermore, this uncertainty created a barrier to treating those motor symptoms. After all, deep brain stimulation in which a device is inserted into the brain to deliver electrical pulses to a targeted region can be used to correct walking and balance difficulties in these patients, but without knowing exactly which part of the PPN to target, the procedure can lead to mixed results. ""The circuits responsible for controlling our behaviors are not nicely lined up, where this side does locomotion and this side does reward,"" Gradinaru says, and this disordered arrangement arises from the way neurons are structured. Much as a tree extends into the ground with long roots, neurons are made up of a cell body and a long string-like axon that can diverge and project elsewhere into different areas of the brain. Because of this shape, the researchers realized they could follow the neuron's ""roots"" to an area of the brain less crowded than the PPN. This would allow them to more easily look at the two very different behaviors and how they are implemented. Cheng Xiao, a senior research scientist at Caltech and first author on the study, began by mapping the projections of the cholinergic neurons in the PPN of a rat using a technique developed by the Gradinaru lab called Passive CLARITY Technique, or PACT. In this technique, a solution of chemicals is applied to the brain; the chemicals dissolve the lipids in the tissue and render that region of the brain optically transparent and able to take up fluorescent markers that can label different types of neurons. The researchers could then follow the path of the PPN neurons of interest, marked by a fluorescent protein, by simply looking through the rest of the brain. Learn More: Researchers map neural circuit involved in combining multiple senses Using this method, Gradinaru and Xiao were able to trace the axons of the PPN neurons as they extended into two regions of the midbrain: the ventral substantia nigra, a landmark area for Parkinson's disease that had been previously associated with locomotion; and the ventral tegmental area, a region of the brain that had been previously associated with reward. Next, the researchers used an electrical recording technique to keep track of the signals sent by PPN neurons confirming that these neurons do, in fact, communicate with their associated downstream structures in the midbrain. Then, the scientists went on to determine how this specific population of neurons affects behavior. To do this, they used a technique that Gradinaru helped develop called optogenetics, which allows researchers to manipulate neural activities in this case, by either exciting or inhibiting the PPN neural projections in the midbrain using different colors of light. Using the optogenetic approach in rats, the researchers found that exciting the neuronal projections in the ventral substantia nigra would stimulate the animal to walk around its environment; by contrast, they could stop the animal's movement by inhibiting these same projections. Furthermore, they found that they could stimulate reward-seeking behavior by exciting the neuronal projections in the ventral tegmental area, but could cause aversive behavior by inhibiting these projections. ""Our results show that the cholinergic neurons from the PPN indeed have a role in controlling both behaviors,"" Gradinaru says. ""Although the neurons are very densely packed and intermingled, these pathways are, to some extent, dedicated to very specialized behaviors."" Determining which pathways are associated with which behaviors might also improve future treatments, she adds. Don't Miss: Switching off brain circuit renders mice  out of touch  with environment ""In the past it's been difficult to target treatment to the PPN because the specific neurons associated with different behaviors are intermingled at the source the PPN. Our results show that you could target the axonal projections in the substantia nigra for movement disorders and projections in the ventral tegmental area for reward disorders, as addiction is,"" Gradinaru says. In addition, she notes, these projections in the midbrain are much easier to access surgically than their source in the PPN. Although this new information could inform clinical treatments for Parkinson's disease, the PPN is only one region of the brain and there are many more important examples of connectivity that need to be explored, Gradinaru says. ""These results highlight the need for brain-wide functional and anatomical maps of these long-range neuronal projections; we've shown that tissue clearing and optogenetics are enabling technologies in the creation of these maps.""

If no new cells are needed, the stem cells may enter a resting phase called quiescence. Biologists at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz have now discovered that the phases of quiescence in the Drosophila fruit fly central nervous system are controlled by the Hippo signaling pathway. Drosophila serves as a model organism that helps geneticists to decode the molecular fundamentals of cellular biology and unravel mechanisms that are conserved in human beings and other vertebrates. See Also: Stem cells in the brain: limited self-renewal Stem cells are undifferentiated cells able to produce specialized cell types. In the development and growth phases or during regeneration, stem cells provide backup and can generate sizeable amounts of daughter cells. Disruptions to the process can, in turn, result in tumor formation or early depletion of the stem cell reservoir. ""In other words, the activity of stem cells needs to be precisely regulated to meet the needs of an organism. If no cell production is required, the stem cells remain in a quiescent state,"" explained Dr. Christian Berger of the Institute of Genetics at Mainz University. His work group has now been able to show how the resting phase is maintained in Drosophila neural stem cells. Protein interactions between niche glial cells and the stem cells activate the Hippo signaling pathway in the stem cells to repress growth and cell division. ""The resting phases need to be actively triggered and maintained,"" added Berger. The Hippo signaling pathway, which is highly conserved up to humans, was known to play a critical role in organ size determination, like, for example, in the liver, but has not been demonstrated to influence neural stem cells in the central nervous system. The experiments were performed using Drosophila larvae. At the beginning of larval life, neural stem cells in the larval nervous system are naturally quiescent. Once the larvae take up food, the stem cells are activated and begin to grow. The Mainz-based team of geneticists working with Dr. Christian Berger has now discovered that growth starts earlier if the Hippo signaling pathway is deactivated, meaning the resting phase can no longer be correctly maintained. In addition, Berger's team has identified two surface proteins located on the neural stem cells and the surrounding niche glial cells that are responsible for the interactions between these cells. When the scientists remove these surface proteins from the niche glial cells, the stem cells begin to grow and prematurely form new daughter cells. In the physiological development process, this effect is regulated by the intake of nutrition. When the larvae begin to eat, the surface proteins Crumbs and Echinoid on the niche glial cells are deactivated about ten hours later and the stem cells begin to grow. Learn More: Human stem cell-derived neuron transplants reduce seizures in mice The final component in this long series of signal sequences is the Yorkie effector protein that is the decisive factor at the end of the Hippo signaling pathway and determines the start of reactivation, growth, and division in the stem cells. ""Our results with Drosophila exhibit surprising similarities in some respects to what we know about the regulation of resting phases in mammals, allowing for speculation as to whether the Hippo signaling pathway in neural stem cells functions in the same manner in both vertebrates and invertebrates,"" stated the paper's first author Rouven Ding. In order to strengthen the relevance of their results in mice, Berger's work group has started a joint project with Professor Benedikt Berninger of the Focus Program Translational Neurosciences at the Mainz University Medical Center. Their findings may turn out to be important when it comes to research into cerebral cancer, since it is known that components of the Hippo signaling pathway, such as neurofibromin 2, are involved in the generation of brain tumors.

In the work published in the Journal of Neuroscience, they show that the adaptor protein CD2AP is a key player in a type of neural growth known as collateral sprouting. See Also: Self-repairing mechanism can help to preserve brain function in neurodegenerative diseases In the first research to be published on this protein's role in the nervous system, Benjamin Harrison, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Anatomical Sciences and Neurobiology at the University of Louisville (UofL)and lead author of the article, and his colleagues show that CD2AP, an adaptor protein, orchestrates a complex arrangement of other proteins that controls the branching of nerve axons. This nerve growth occurs in uninjured nerve cells as they extend their reach and create new connections. ""CD2AP brings in all the correct players, forms a multi-protein complex and coordinates that multi-protein complex to achieve growth of the neurons,"" Harrison said. ""There are a whole bunch of proteins that it could bring together, but it only brings together the correct proteins to create the correct response. In this case, it changes the structure of the axons through sprouting and elongation."" This axon sprouting may be helpful, but too much of it can be harmful. In normal adult cells, this growth creates new connections and can lead to improved functionality after an injury or stroke. However, if the axons sprout uncontrollably, the result can be exacerbated epilepsy, blood pressure spikes or neuropathic pain. The researchers hope this new understanding of the nerve growth process will lead to therapies that can improve healing and recovery of function following nerve damage while minimizing excessive growth. ""Through targeting this molecule, we could help the body's natural healing process to coordinate the appropriate growth,"" Harrison said. Learn More: Scientists find brain plasticity assorted into functional networks The research team, based in the lab of Jeffrey Petruska, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Anatomical Sciences and Neurobiology and the Department of Neurological Surgery and the article's corresponding author, identified CD2AP as a player in the neurological system via a screen to detect genes associated with neuron growth. Their research examined how CD2AP interacts with various molecules in controlling the neural sprouting process, particularly its relationship with nerve growth factor (NGF). ""People have been studying nerve growth factor and the responses it induces for a while, but this protein (CD2AP) forms a nice link between NGF and the response in the cell,"" Harrison said. Previous research also has associated CD2AP with genetic changes among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and it may be helpful in understanding the mechanisms involved in Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease and spinal cord injuries. Petruska says this work relates closely to other research being conducted at UofL's Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center.

People who experience childhood abuse, neglect and other hallmarks of a rough childhood are more likely to develop heart disease, diabetes and other health problems later in life, even after the stressful events have passed, previous research shows. Don't Miss: Scans reveal South African's Taung Child's skull and brain not human-like in expansion A new study from Duke University, the University of Notre Dame and Princeton University finds that wild baboons that experience multiple misfortunes during the first years of life, such as drought or the loss of their mother, grow up to live much shorter adult lives. Their life expectancy is cut short by up to ten years compared with their more fortunate peers. The results are important because they show that early adversity can have long-term negative effects on survival even in the absence of factors commonly evoked to explain similar patterns in humans, such as differences in smoking, drinking or medical care, said Jenny Tung, an assistant professor of evolutionary anthropology and biology at Duke who co-authored the study. The findings, appearing in Nature Communications, come from a long-term study of 196 wild female baboons monitored on a nearly daily basis between 1983 and 2013 near Amboseli National Park in southern Kenya. Life isn t easy for a wild baboon. Like many animals on the African savanna, baboons endure drought, overcrowding, disease and predation. The researchers focused on six potential sources of early adversity. Some baboons, for example, saw very little rainfall in their first year of life, or experienced stiff competition for resources because of sibling spacing or rising numbers within their group. Others lost their mothers to death or illness, or had moms with lower rank or little social support. More than three-fourths of the baboons in the study had at least one of the six early risk factors; 15 percent had three or more. See Also: Early parental program improves long-term childhood outcomes Baboons who lost their mothers before age four, or whose next-born sibling arrived before they were fully weaned, were found to be the most vulnerable. For baboons, like humans, the tougher the childhood, the higher the risks of premature death later in life. Young females that experienced just one or no adverse events a group the researchers nicknamed the  silver spoon kids generally lived into their late teens and early twenties, whereas those that endured three or more often died by age nine. The  bad luck  babies not only lost more than ten years off their adult lives, they also had fewer surviving offspring.  It s like a snowball effect,  said co-author Elizabeth Archie, associate professor at the University of Notre Dame. Two females named Puma and Mystery, for example, were both born during years of little rainfall, and raised by low-ranking moms who died before their third birthdays. Puma eventually met her end at age seven at the jaws of a leopard. Mystery lived until her disappearance at age 14, presumably to a predator, leaving behind a single infant who died shortly thereafter. Some researchers studying the effects of childhood stress on adult health in humans pin the blame on differences in medical care or risky behavior. People who had troubled childhoods, the thinking goes, are more likely to turn to drugs, alcohol or other coping mechanisms that are bad for their health. But wild baboons don t smoke or binge on junk food, and they don t carry health insurance. This supports the idea that differences in lifestyle and medical care are only part of the story, said co-author Susan Alberts, professor of biology at Duke. Baboon females that experienced the most misfortune in their early years were also more socially isolated as adults, suggesting that social support may also be at play. See Also: Prenatal exposure to common household chemicals linked with substantial drop in child IQ Together with study co-author Jeanne Altmann of Princeton, the team plans to investigate how some baboons manage to overcome early adversity. It could be that those who form and maintain supportive relationships as they grow older are better able to survive and thrive, Archie said. Baboon DNA is 94 percent similar to that of humans, which indicates these patterns could be deep-rooted in primate physiology, the researchers say.  This suggests that human adult health effects from childhood stresses are not simply products of the modern environment, but have likely been present throughout our evolutionary history,  says George Gilchrist, program director in the National Science Foundation s Division of Environmental Biology, which funded the research.

A study in mice, published in Immunity, now reveals how the antiviral immune response alters brain activity. Upon infection, brain cells lining blood vessels produce a protein called CXCL10, which impairs neuronal firing in the hippocampus important in learning, memory, and mood. ""Cognitive dysfunction occurs frequently in RNA virus-infected individuals, as well as after treatment with type I interferons for autoimmune disorders and certain types of cancer, yet the underlying signaling pathways and cell types involved were not known until now,"" says first study author Thomas Blank of the University of Freiburg. ""We identified brain endothelial and epithelial cells (which line the interior surfaces of blood vessels or ventricles, respectively) as natural gate-keepers for virus-induced sickness behavior, and established a potential target for the treatment of behavioral changes during virus infection or type I interferon therapy."" See Also: Some chronic viral infections could contribute to cognitive decline with aging Viral infections frequently cause mood changes such as depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits, sleepiness, headache, and a general feeling of malaise. Similarly, antiviral molecules called type I interferons, which are naturally released after infection to prevent viral replication and used therapeutically to treat cancer, hepatitis C virus infection, and multiple sclerosis, can cause depressive-like symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and loss of appetite, as well as cognitive changes. Although there is clear evidence that the immune system can affect psychological and cognitive function, the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. To address this question, Thomas Blank and Marco Prinz of the University of Freiburg infected mice with the vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes flu-like symptoms in humans, and then assessed their depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. Viral infection caused an increase in the duration of animals' immobility response a behavioral sign of despair. This depressive-like behavior required the activation of the CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling pathway. CXCL10 released from brain endothelial and epithelial cells bound to neuronal CXCR3, which, in turn, impaired the activity of neurons in the hippocampus. Don't Miss: Viral infection during pregnancy causes autism-like behaviors in mice Taken together, the findings reveal the importance of brain endothelial and epithelial cells in the communication between the immune system and the central nervous system, acting as a switchboard that translates incoming signals from the periphery to the brain. Similarly, the study suggests that the CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling pathway acts as a bridge between rising interferon levels in the blood and changes in neuronal activity in the brain, explaining how virus infection or type I interferon treatment causes mood changes. ""In future studies, we will further explore the molecular and cellular changes underlying viral sickness behavior,"" Blank says. ""In the meantime, our findings suggest that preventing the release of CXCL10 or blocking its receptors at an early phase should eliminate at least the initial stages of sickness behavior seen in response to viral infection or type I interferon therapy.""

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/improving-flu-vaccine-effectiveness-198053,Improving Flu Vaccine Effectiveness NIH study finds factors that may influence influenza vaccine effectiveness  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The long-held approach to predicting seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness may need to be revisited, new research suggests. Currently, seasonal flu vaccines are designed to induce high levels of protective antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA), a protein found on the surface of the influenza virus that enables the virus to enter a human cell and initiate infection. New research conducted by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, found that higher levels of antibody against a different flu surface protein   neuraminidase (NA)   were the better predictor of protection against flu infection and its unpleasant side effects. Neuraminidase, which is not currently the main target antigen in traditional flu vaccines, enables newly formed flu viruses to exit the host cell and cause further viral replication in the body. The findings, from a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers were willingly exposed to naturally occurring 2009 H1N1 influenza type A virus, appear online in the open-access journal mBio.  Each year between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the United States die as the result of seasonal influenza and its complications,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci., M.D.  Annual vaccination against seasonal flu continues to be the most effective way to protect against infection, and this new study provides some interesting clues about how we might improve the level of protection that flu vaccines provide.  Higher levels of HA antibodies in a person s body have long been associated with greater protection against influenza infection. As a result, HA antibody levels have traditionally been used to guide vaccine strain selection and to infer how effective that vaccine might be against circulating viruses until field studies are available. However, variations in seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness over the past decade have raised questions about their protective ability and whether other factors, such as antibodies to the NA protein on the flu virus, should be considered in designing the annual flu vaccine to improve its performance.  The idea behind this study was to re-evaluate the bar that was previously established for evaluating a person s immune response to influenza vaccines,  said the study's principal investigator Matthew J. Memoli, M.D., director of the Clinical Studies Unit in NIAID s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases.  We wanted to test the conventional wisdom and see if people with high levels of HA antibodies were less likely to develop mild-to-moderate influenza compared with those with lower HA antibody levels.  To do this, the research team enrolled 65 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 years in the human challenge study   a type of research study in which individuals are exposed to disease-causing pathogens under carefully controlled conditions. The flu challenge study, which began in September 2013, was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in the specially designed Clinical Studies Unit, which has distinct isolation and infection control features. Dr. Memoli and his colleagues measured levels of existing anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies in the participants  blood. Based on those results, the volunteers were placed into two groups: those with high levels of anti-HA antibodies (25 participants) and those with low levels of anti-HA antibodies (40 participants). Each of the volunteers was then administered an intranasal dose (1 milliliter) of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus; the volunteers were required to stay in the study unit for nine days where they were monitored by medical staff 24 hours daily. After the nine-day testing period, participants were discharged after completing two days of negative flu tests. After that time, they had four follow-up visits with the study team over eight weeks. As expected, the researchers found that the group of participants who had high levels of anti-HA antibodies when enrolled in the trial experienced a significantly lower incidence of mild-to-moderate influenza disease and some reduction in its duration compared with participants with low HA antibody levels. However, the NIAID researchers also found that these participants were just as likely to experience some flu symptoms as those with low levels of HA antibodies. If these results are consistent with naturally occurring flu infection, it suggests that while high HA antibody levels may limit viral shedding, and thus the spread of virus from person to person, these levels may not prevent the development of flu symptoms. This would help to explain why some people who receive the seasonal flu vaccine might still report flu symptoms. Surprisingly, the researchers found that participants with high levels of NA antibodies experienced a more robust protective effect from the vaccine than did those in the high HA group. Specifically, the NIAID team found that the individuals with high NA antibody levels experienced less severe disease, a shorter duration of viral shedding and symptoms, and fewer and less severe  symptoms compared with those with high HA levels when challenged with the 2009 H1N1 virus. HA and NA antibody levels considered together may be a better predictor of whether someone develops mild-to-moderate influenza disease   and the severity of their symptoms   than either factor alone, but this study suggests that NA antibodies are the stronger factor for determining disease severity, the authors conclude. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that the role of NA immunity should be considered when studying influenza susceptibility and that NA antigens should be considered in the design of future flu vaccine platforms.","Published: April 20, 2016"

Existing therapies don t cure the disease and often don t even significantly alleviate the symptoms. Now, scientists from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University have identified a biological pathway that potentially explains why current asthma therapies don t work well in many cases and might be targeted to help those patients. Asthma is a chronic condition that affects more than 25 million people in the United States alone, including more than 7 million children. It accounts for nearly 2 million ER visits annually and about 1.5 million patient-days of hospital inpatient care.  Only 60 percent of asthma patients have an inflammatory or allergic component to their asthma and 40 percent of asthma patients wheeze in part due to intrinsic abnormalities of epithelial and smooth muscle cells,  said co-senior author Edward E. Morrisey, PhD, a professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and director of the Penn Center for Pulmonary Biology at Penn.  Curiously, these patients are refractory to current therapies,  said co-senior author Reynold A. Panettieri, Jr., MD, Vice Chancellor of Translational Medicine and Science at Rutgers.  There s a real need to understand the non-inflammatory aspects of asthma, and with this study we re getting closer to that understanding.  The study, which appears in the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, is a collaboration between the Morrisey laboratory and the laboratory of Panettieri, an asthma specialist who moved from Penn Medicine to Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences last summer. Clues from Goblet Cells The discovery of the possible new asthma pathway emerged from basic research by Morrisey and colleagues on the developmental biology of the epithelial layer of cells that line the lung and its airways. In experiments published in 2012, they found that the transcription factors Foxp1 and Foxp4 which can switch certain gene programs on or off normally repress the production of mucus-secreting goblet cells in the lung epithelia of mice. Genetic inactivation of these two transcription factors caused goblet cells to differentiate abnormally. Increased goblet cell differentiation in the airways is a hallmark of asthma. From this, the Morrisey lab investigated whether loss of the Foxp1/4 genes, specifically in the airway epithelium of the lung, also causes an asthma-like condition in mice. In an initial set of experiments, the team, including first author Shanru Li, a staff scientist in the Morrisey lab, studied the physiological function of airways lacking the Foxp1/4 genes in adult mice.  We found that the airways of these mice did indeed behave like asthmatic human airways,  Morrisey said. A classic sign of asthma is airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) an abnormally strong tendency for the smooth muscle cells underlying the airway epithelium to contract and cause a partial closure of the airway. The team found that the mice lacking airway Foxp1/4 showed significantly greater signs of AHR, compared to control mice, especially when experimentally challenged with airway irritants.  At the high doses of the challenge the Foxp1/4-knockout mice basically started to die because their airways closed off,  Morrisey said. Intriguingly, the airway lining in the Foxp1/4-knockout mice did not show signs of the type of inflammation that is typically associated with asthma and targeted with standard asthma drugs. Neuropeptide Y   The Key to Non-inflammatory Asthma? To find out the principal cause of the hyper-responsiveness in the airways of these mice, the researchers looked at the gene expression patterns of the affected airway epithelial cells, comparing them to the patterns seen in control mice that have normal levels of Foxp1/4 expression.  Because only Foxp1/4 genes were missing from the airway epithelium of these mutant mice, we hypothesized that epithelial cells in the mutants were secreting a factor that was causing the underlying smooth muscle cells to contract. Therefore, we looked specifically for expression changes in genes encoding molecules that could be secreted from the epithelial cells and be received by the airway smooth muscle cells,  Morrisey said. One such molecule, neuropeptide Y (NPY), stood out well above the rest it was not expressed in control airway epithelial cells but was expressed at high levels in the airway epithelia of the knockout mice. NPY is a signaling molecule and neurotransmitter found abundantly in the nervous system and some other parts of the body. Its many biological actions include stimulating the constriction of blood vessels. Previous research has linked variants of its gene to increased asthma risk, but NPY hasn t been known to have a direct role in asthma. Morrisey s team showed that NPY has a significant role in asthma by deleting the NPY gene while at the same time deleting the Foxp1/4 genes. This resulted in the airway hyper-responsiveness that is observed in Foxp1/4-mutant mice to return to almost normal levels. Importantly, since changes in NPY expression have been linked to asthma in humans, the investigators tested whether NPY could directly cause airway hyper-responsiveness in human lung tissue. These experiments showed that when normal human lung airways are exposed to NPY, they exhibit a marked increase in hyper-responsiveness to methacholine challenge. In all of these experiments, the inflammatory response remained unchanged, indicating that NPY did not cause alterations in the immune response that could cause asthmatic symptoms.  These data strongly suggest that NPY can cause airway hyper-responsiveness in human lungs and could be a causative mechanism in human asthma,  Morrisey said.  Further, the molecular mechanisms mediating airway hyper-responsiveness occur at the level of smooth muscle where NPY amplifies smooth muscle contraction at all mediators by activating Rho Kinase, a pivotal signaling molecule in the bronchoconstriction pathway,"" Panettieri said. It also suggests that inhibiting NPY activity in people with asthma, perhaps with an inhaled medication, might help the millions of patients who get little or no benefit from current asthma therapies. Pharmaceutical companies have already developed compounds that block NPY signaling for other applications such as obesity and hypertension.  Testing whether these NPY inhibitors would help human asthma patients would be worthwhile given the results of our studies  Morrisey said. In addition to setting up tests of NPY-blocking drugs, he and his team hope to replicate their mouse-model findings in a larger animal model of asthma, which better simulates the human disease.","Published: April 20, 2016"

Immuno-oncology is an exciting new area in the treatment of cancer where the body s immune system is activated to produce an immune response targeted at tumour cells. Immunotherapy drugs are poised to revolutionise the way cancer is treated and a number of immunotherapy antibody treatments have recently been approved. GPCRs are widely expressed on cells of the innate and adaptive immune system and play key roles in modulating cell migration and recruitment to the tumour environment, activation, survival, proliferation and differentiation. GPCRs act at critical checkpoints that can be targeted by novel immunotherapy antibodies. Under the agreement, Heptares will apply its StaR  platform to create stable antigens based on multiple GPCR targets chosen by the companies. Kymab will then use its Kymouse  human antibody discovery platform to generate antibodies in response to immunisation with these antigens. The Kymouse platform will assure the highest probability of finding the best-in-class antibodies with highly attractive drug properties. Promising leads will be progressed using the partners  complementary skills, resources and development capabilities in order to bring innovative products into the clinic. Under the agreement, the companies will jointly conduct and share the costs of each antibody discovery and development programme. Malcolm Weir, Chairman and CEO of Heptares, said:  GPCRs have long been intractable targets for antibody discovery resulting in dearth of products. We believe that our proven StaR technology can unlock this substantial opportunity, not just in immuno-oncology but also across other therapeutic areas where GPCR-targeted biologics could have a significant impact. By entering into strategic collaborations with companies with world-leading antibody discovery technologies, such as Kymab, we have the potential to discover, develop and commercialise a highly valuable pipeline of new biologic products.  David Chiswell, CEO of Kymab, said:  Antibodies are important therapeutic agents for cancer and other indications.  Our collaboration with Heptares will allow us to combine stable antigens based on multiple GPCR targets with our world-class Kymouse platform, which has unparalleled diversity and will therefore rapidly identify and yield highly selective potent human monoclonal antibodies for unmet medical needs.

Some of the most common antidepressants are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These work by increasing the amount of available serotonin, a chemical messenger that helps brain cells, or neurons, communicate. Serotonin levels affect sleep, mood, cognition, pain, hunger, and even aggressive behaviors. After being released into the gaps between neurons, serotonin is pumped back for reuse into the cell that released it via the serotonin transporter protein. SSRIs slow this recycling process by blocking the pump, leaving the serotonin accessible to other neurons. A research team led by Dr. Eric Gouaux of Oregon Health and Science University set out to solve the structure of the human serotonin transporter and determine how SSRIs interact with it. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The serotonin transporter can be difficult to prepare for X-ray crystallography, a technique that creates an image of a protein s 3-D structure. The protein is normally unstable during the purification and crystallization processes. The researchers genetically altered the transporter to withstand the temperatures used for isolation. They also added small antibody fragments to the protein solution to encourage crystallization. Using these modifications, they were able to create small crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography. The technique yielded a detailed molecular map of the human serotonin transporter s structure. The scientists were able to identify where different molecules interact with the transporter, including the sodium and chloride ions that are necessary for pumping serotonin. The group next determined where 2 SSRIs, citalopram (CeleXA) and paroxetine (Paxil), take hold of the transporter. They found that both bind to the pump s primary central binding site, preventing serotonin from binding and being pumped into the neuron. The SSRIs also fit in a second site on the protein, called an  allosteric  site, which affects how quickly molecules can get out of the central pocket. Thus, compounds that bind to this allosteric site can affect transport activity as well. The researchers could also see where genetic variations associated with various psychiatric disorders are located in the transporter. Knowing the structure of the transporter can help researchers gain insights into the molecular causes of these disorders and of antidepressant treatment resistance.  The heavy toll that devastating illnesses like anxiety and depression have on families and communities is, in many ways, incalculable,  says Gouaux.  Revealing the precise structure of the serotonin transporter holds promise for the development of life-changing drug treatments for these diseases. ","Published: April 20, 2016"

The research was published online on March 26 in the International Journal of Cancer in advance of its print publication later this year. The report, A Novel Microfluidic Platform for Size and Deformability Based Separation and the Subsequent Molecular Characterization of Viable Circulating Tumor Cells, determined that the Parsortix System enables isolation of viable CTCs at very high purity and  that are ready for a broad range of molecular and functional analyses.  The system s ability to provide numeration and molecular characterization of EpCAM-negative CTCs will help to broaden research into the mechanisms of cancer as well as facilitating the use of CTCs in  liquid biopsies,  the report stated. According to co-author Prof. Klaus Pantel, Chairman, Department of Tumour Biology at UKE s Centre of Experimental Medicine, systems that can comprehensively capture not only epithelial CTCs but also mesenchymal CTCs will play an important role in cancer diagnoses and subsequent treatment.  Our findings emphasize the importance of developing new label-free assays that allow the molecular characterization of CTCs for therapeutic targets and resistance mechanisms at the DNA, RNA and protein level,  Pantel said.  This information is vital as liquid biopsies will help clinicians to adapt therapies to the individual needs of cancer patients.  To put Parsortix through its paces, a team of ANGLE researchers in conjunction with Prof. Pantel, working in Philadelphia, Hamburg and Dusseldorf analyzed the performance of the epitope-independent system in capture of tumor cells from blood samples spiked with five different cancer cell lines, and from multiple patient samples including metastatic breast, non-metastatic colon, metastatic colon, metastatic lung, and non-metastatic lung cancer. Using the system, UKE researchers showed average tumor cell capture ranged from 42 per cent to 70 per cent with subsequent harvest of the cells ranging between 54 per cent and 69 per cent of the  cells captured.  One of the novel and powerful capabilities that distinguishes the Parsortix system is that it enables harvest of captured tumor cells for subsequent further analyses. Significantly, 99 per cent of the harvested CTCs from both spiked and patient samples were viable after processing and still functional for downstream molecular analysis as demonstrated by mRNA characterization and array based comparative genomic hybridization.   The epitope independent Parsortix system enables the isolation of viable CTCs at a very high purity. Using our system, viable tumour cells are easily accessible and ready for molecular and functional analysis,  said Dr George Hvichia, the inventor of the Parsortix technology and CSO, ANGLE plc.  The system s ability for enumeration and molecular characterization of EpCAM-negative CTCs will help to broaden research into the mechanisms of cancer as well as facilitating the use of CTCs as liquid biopsies.  A growing body of evidence has shown that cancer cells in the process of, or that have completed EMT, have increased invasion capabilities, which leads to the loss of an epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Currently, CTC isolation is still mainly dependent on expression of EpCAM on the surface of cancer cells of epithelial origin. New research, however, indicates that EMT plays a significant role in metastasis, and certain EMT cancer cells lose EpCAM expression. Isolation by techniques that are independent of marker expression, such as Parsortix, enables capture of those EMT CTCs, providing a more precise and comprehensive path to diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cancer. The results obtained by the collaborating team confirms the system s ability  to effectively harvest CTCs not only with epithelial characteristics, but also those in the process of, or that have completed, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) across a broad range of cancer types.

Unlike other fishes, cartilaginous fishes such as sharks, skates and rays have a series of skin flaps that protect their gills. These flaps are supported by arches of cartilage, with finger-like appendages called branchial rays attached. In 1878, influential German anatomist Karl Gegenbaur presented the theory that paired fins and eventually limbs evolved from a structure resembling the gill arch of cartilaginous fishes. However, nothing in the fossil record has ever been discovered to support this. Now, researchers have reinvestigated Gegenbaur s ideas using the latest genetic techniques on embryos of the little skate   a fish from the very group that first inspired the controversial theory over a century ago   and found striking similarities between the genetic mechanism used in the development of its gill arches and those in human limbs. Scientists say it comes down to a critical gene in limb development called  Sonic hedgehog , named for the videogame character by a research team at Harvard Medical School.  The new research shows that the functions of the Sonic hedgehog gene in human limb development, dictating the identity of each finger and maintaining growth of the limb skeleton, are mirrored in the development of the branchial rays in skate embryos.  Dr Andrew Gillis, from the University of Cambridge s Department of Zoology and the Marine Biological Laboratory, who led the research, says that it shows aspects of Gegenbaur s theory may in fact be correct, and provides greater understanding of the origin of jawed vertebrates   the group of animals that includes humans.  Gegenbaur looked at the way that these branchial rays connect to the gill arches and noticed that it looks very similar to the way that the fin and limb skeleton articulates with the shoulder,  says Gillis.  The branchial rays extend like a series of fingers down the side of a shark gill arch.   The fact that the Sonic hedgehog gene performs the same two functions in the development of gill arches and branchial rays in skate embryos as it does in the development of limbs in mammal embryos may help explain how Gegenbaur arrived at his controversial theory on the origin of fins and limbs.  In mammal embryos, the Sonic hedgehog gene sets up the axis of the limb in the early stages of development.  In a hand, for instance, Sonic hedgehog tells the limb which side will be the thumb and which side will be the pinky finger,  explains Gillis. In the later stages of development, Sonic hedgehog maintains outgrowth so that the limb grows to its full size. To test whether the gene functions in the same way in skate embryos, Gillis and his colleagues inhibited Sonic hedgehog at different points during their development. They found that if Sonic hedgehog was interrupted early in development, the branchial rays formed on the wrong side of the gill arch. If Sonic hedgehog was interrupted later in development, then fewer branchial rays formed but the ones that did grow, grew on the correct side of the gill arch   showing that the gene works in a remarkably similar way here as in the development of limbs.  Taken to the extreme, these experiments could be interpreted as evidence that limbs share a genetic programme with gill arches because fins and limbs evolved by transformation of a gill arch in an ancestral vertebrate, as proposed by Gegenbaur,  says Gillis.  However, it could also be that these structures evolved separately, but re-used the same pre-existing genetic programme. Without fossil evidence this remains a bit of a mystery   there is a gap in the fossil record between species with no fins and then suddenly species with paired fins   so we can t really be sure yet how paired appendages evolved.   Either way this is a fascinating discovery, because it provides evidence for a fundamental evolutionary link between branchial rays and limbs,  says Gillis.  While palaeontologists look for fossils to try to reconstruct the evolutionary history of anatomy, we are effectively trying to reconstruct the evolutionary history of genetic programmes that control the development of anatomy.  Paired appendages, such as arms and hands in humans, are one of the key anatomical features that distinguish jawed vertebrates from other groups.  There is a lot of interest in trying to understand the origins of jawed vertebrates, and the origins of novel features like fins and limbs,  says Gillis.  What we are learning is that many novel features may not have arisen suddenly from scratch, but rather by tweaking and re-using a relatively small number of ancient developmental programmes.  Gillis and his colleagues are further testing Gegenbaur s theory by comparing the function of more genes involved the development of skates  unusual gills and mammalian limbs.  Previous studies haven t found compelling developmental genetic similarities between gill arch derivatives and paired appendages   but these studies were done in animals like mice and zebrafish, which don t have branchial rays,  says Gillis.  It is useful to study cartilaginous fishes, not only because they were the group that first inspired Gegenbaur s theory, but also because they have a lot of unique features that other fishes don t   and we are finding that we can learn a lot about evolution from these unique features.   Many researchers look at mutant mice or fruit flies to understand the genetic control of anatomy. Our approach is to study and compare the diverse anatomical forms that can be found in nature, in order to gain insight into the evolution of the vertebrate body. ","Published: April 20, 2016"

This is an innovative and inexpensive biological tool which can be easy to use in economically restricted areas or developing countries. The detection of toxic contaminants is an essential element of analysis and control of water quality, something very needed in an increasingly urbanised and industrialised world. Chemical analysis techniques are of great utility in determining specific substances, but are limited when used to analyse complex samples which can contain multiple contaminants. In this sense, the use of biosensors is appropriate, in which they measure the effect samples have on a biological element, such as enzymes or proteins, or on a vital parameter of an indicator organism.  The innovation provided by our sensor is based on the use of absorbent paper matrices with entrapped bacteria with the aim of conducting colorimetric measures of toxicity , explains UAB researcher Ferran Pujol, who conducted this study as part of his PhD thesis. In this work, researchers used Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells were used as model bacteria. The paper was recently published in Analytica Chimica Acta. The detection technique proposed and validated by researchers is quick and simple. In fact, its mechanism is similar to that of paper strips used to measure the pH of water. The samples analysed are added to the matrices together with the colouring agent ferrocyanide, which ranges from yellow to transparent when breathed in by the microorganisms. The paper changes colours according to the intensity of the cell metabolism of the bacteria, inversely proportional to the toxicity of the sample: the more the colour changes, the less contamination detected. These changes can be measured with optical techniques, by analysing the image or with the naked eye. The bioassay, which researchers have applied a patent for, detects any contaminant which can be toxic for the microorganisms after some 15 to 30 minutes of coming into contact with the cells (time taken to conduct the test), such as heavy metals or hydrocarbons such as petroleum or benzene. The technique can be applied to both natural waters and urban and industrial wastewater. Using a material such as paper and without the need of complex tools makes this biosensor a simple and inexpensive technique which can be used to detect toxicity in contexts of economic restrictions or in developing countries, researchers indicate. Collaborating in the development of this bioassay were researchers from the UPC Centre for Research and Innovation in Toxicology and the National Centre for Microelectronics (IMB-CNM).","Published: April 20, 2016"

The $656,414 award is an administrative supplement to an existing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I/II Fast-track grant from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The grant will allow the Rheonix/NYUCD team to pursue the development of a fully automated screening and self-confirming assay that will simultaneously detect and confirm the presence of Zika virus in a single, small sample of saliva or blood. The proposed approach will build upon previous success in which the Rheonix/NYUCD team developed a dual assay for the simultaneous detection of HIV antibodies and viral RNA in a single specimen.  The assay will be performed on the Rheonix Chemistry and Reagent Device, or Rheonix CARD  cartridge interfaced with the Encompass Optimum  workstation. Once a raw sample is placed on the Rheonix CARD cartridge, the automated workstation runs with no user intervention through the process of sample extraction, purification, amplification and detection. This eliminates the need for multiple pieces of existing equipment, helping to make the testing process quicker, more efficient, less expensive and less likely to result in human error.  As we continue to demonstrate the utility of our novel microfluidic-based technology, we remain committed to deploying the technology to address global health needs,  said Greg Galvin, Ph.D., CEO and chairman at Rheonix.  Addressing the need to test for Zika virus certainly fits the bill given the elevated health alerts issued throughout the world.  In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Zika virus disease is caused by Zika viruses that are spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito; however, transmission from mother to child, through sexual contact and through blood transfusion have also been reported. According to the NIH, there is a tentative link between Zika virus infections in pregnant women and microcephaly, a condition characterized by a small head and brain, in their newborn babies. In addition, a possible connection exists between Zika infection and Guillain-Barr  syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system.  We have had a long-standing and very productive collaborative relationship with Dr. Dan Malamud s laboratory at New York University College of Dentistry, and it has been through those efforts that we successfully developed the dual assay for anti-HIV antibodies and viral RNA,  said Richard Montagna, Ph.D., FACB, senior vice president for scientific and clinical affairs at Rheonix, and the principal investigator on the grant.  It seemed to be a logical extension of those efforts to attempt the same approach for Zika virus.   The Zika virus appears to disappear from blood in six to 10 days, but is still detectable in saliva and urine,  explained Daniel Malamud, Ph.D., professor of basic sciences at NYUCD.  Anti-Zika antibodies can be detected several days after infection. A combined RNA and antibody test will enable detection of both early and late Zika virus infections. ","Published: April 20, 2016"

The tools have not been available to people who want to be able to test vaccines and antivirals against Zika virus,  says Matthew Aliota, assistant SVM scientist and lead author of the study that describes the model, published April 19 in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.  The caveat is that it s a mouse model, but it does allow us to test vaccines, and the pathology caused by the virus in the mouse brain could be used to understand the pathology in the brains of humans, especially fetuses.  Zika virus was first described in Uganda in 1947. Before last year, it had circulated in people in Africa, southeast Asia and in the Pacific Islands and only sporadically caused disease. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms, when it causes symptoms at all. However, in 2015 the virus began infecting unprecedented numbers of people in Brazil and then spread throughout the Americas. Public health officials in the United States expect it to spread to the southern U.S. as the weather warms and activity of the Aedes aegypti mosquito   the species that harbors the virus   subsequently increases. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed Zika virus is responsible for a large rise in brain defects in developing fetuses, including microcephaly. In fact, cases of microcephaly   marked by a small head, reduced brain size and cognitive impairments   were 20 times higher than usual in parts of Brazil last year. There has been some evidence of neurological effects in adults as well. Researchers now also know the disease can spread through sexual contact.  It s scary to know so little about something that can be so devastating,  says Katrina Larkin, a UW Madison undergraduate student and a study co-author.  Learning how instrumental animal models can be to combating diseases makes this work even more urgent.  Mouse models allow researchers to conduct larger-scale studies than animal models like nonhuman primates, and to perform experiments that are not possible to conduct in human beings. The mouse model described by Aliota and the rest of the research team, including Jorge Osorio, professor of pathobiological sciences at SVM, is an immunocompromised mouse the laboratory already possessed for research on viruses similar to Zika, like dengue virus. The team learned they could inject Zika virus into the foot pads of the mice, and under their skin, and the virus would then spread throughout the body, including the brain. Other mouse strains are resistant to infection with Zika virus.  Similar models have been revealed in the last two weeks, but there are also differences between those and ours,  says Aliota, who was part of the team that first found Zika virus in Colombia. The differences in their model will allow the researchers to test how exposure to other viruses, like dengue, may influence how the body responds to Zika infection. The team s mouse model lacks three types of interferons   known as alpha, beta and gamma   which are among the immune system s first lines of defense against some types of viral infections. Mice with normal interferons are resistant to Zika virus infection but those lacking them get sick. Humans also have interferons but they are less effective at blunting Zika virus infection. In the study, once the mice were infected with a range of doses of Zika virus   including doses similar to human exposure following a bite from an infected mosquito   they rapidly became ill. The virus was 100 percent fatal in mice at all doses, which is an effect not seen in humans. The mice were euthanized within one week of infection and, unlike in the other recent mouse model studies, the researchers examined the effects of the virus in various organs of the body, including the liver, spleen, brain, kidney, intestine, heart, lungs and skeletal muscles. The virus had spread throughout the body but Aliota says they were surprised to find it caused pathology only in the brain and skeletal muscle.  It looks really bad for the brain,  he says, noting they saw evidence of meningitis, cell infiltration and necrosis (abnormal cellular death). In addition to providing an opportunity for researchers to study vaccines and antivirals, the model also affords scientists the ability to study how the virus works, including whether it can replicate, or make copies of itself, and spread within brain tissue.  It s pretty easy for people to see on the news that there s this illness affecting lots of people and wonder why no one has come up with a vaccine yet,  says Emma Walker, another undergraduate researcher and study co-author,  but for Zika, which hasn t really been researched before, there s a lot of pressure just to find out more basic things   like how the virus works   before you can try to tackle  curing  the illness.  Aliota calls the students who worked on the study, including Ph.D. student Liz Caine,  outstanding,  and says it would not have been possible so quickly without their dedication and long hours in the lab. Zika findings from labs across the country have published at breakneck speed as researchers focus their efforts on combating the disease. In fact, Aliota and colleagues at UW Madison have made other aspects of their collaborative research available to other scientists and the public in real time.  I have been amazed with the amount of information that has been generated about Zika virus in such a short amount of time,  says Caine. Aliota also credits the resources available at UW Madison for the pace of Zika study progress here.  UW has become a center of Zika virus research. There are a lot of people with diverse expertise to take on this problem,  he says.  That s the advantage of having a medical school, a veterinary school and a primate center; it s possible to do things here that only a few institutions around the globe can accomplish.  For Aliota, who has long studied infectious diseases like Zika, the fact that his work and that of his team has had such profound impact in the response to a significant public health issue is vastly rewarding.  It s scary for the people living with it,  Aliota says.  Our goal is to translate what we find to the field. To see such immediate impact, that doesn t happen often. ","Published: April 20, 2016"

This form of the disease-pathogen may have an intrinsic ability to cause persistent, harmful, even deadly infections. The bacterium E. coli comes in many different varieties.  Many strains live unobtrusively in the gut or innocuously in the environment.  Some strains can cause diarrhea. Others can invade the urinary tract, the blood stream, or other parts of the body to provoke varying degrees of illness, from mild to serious and sometimes fatal.  A particular genetic family of E. coli, Sequence Type 131, produced the H30 strain, which appeared in late 1990s. In an almost unprecedented show of microbial force, it expanded around the world to become the dominant drug-resistant strain in virtually all populations.  No other type of E. coli is causing this much widespread damage,  said Evgeni Sokurenko, University of Washington professor of microbiology.  We need to pay as much attention to it as we do to the superbug MRSA, the treatment-resistant staph infection.  To make matters worse, H30 begins as a subtle infection that is hard to detect, he explained.  Once diagnosed, even if the right antibiotic is given, physicians have trouble eradicating the infection, and complications can set in. The power of the H30 strain, and why it has become so common, is puzzling. According to Sokurenko, most animal studies have failed to confirm that the H30 strain is especially virulent. It has also been assumed that H30 causes opportunistic infections, by taking advantage of the rapidly growing elderly population and others with weakened immune systems.  It is also thought that broad-spectrum antibiotic use might have promoted H30 s dominance by making it resistant to several drugs, particularly the fluoroquinolones (such as Cipro), which are widely prescribed for urinary tract infections. These factors, as well as possible presence of as yet-unknown pathogen traits, could have contributed to H30 s emergence as a public health problem. Each year in the United States alone, H30 may cause more than 1 million urinary tract infections, as well as much more lethal blood infections. Sokurenko is one of the leaders of a team of researchers from the University of Washington, the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, the University of Minnesota, Seattle Children s Hospital and Group Health Cooperative to assess the nature of H30 infections. Analyzing epidemiological and medical data, the team explored possible associations of H30 with patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment, and how well or poorly the patients fared. Their findings are published in the journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases. James R. Johnson, staff physician and director of the Molecular Epidemiology Unit at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System, and professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, was the lead author of the study. The researchers found that individuals at greater risk for E. coli H30 infection tended to be older women and men who had been in a healthcare facility, including long term care residences or hospitals, who had received antibiotics, and who had underlying conditions that weakened their ability to ward off infections.  The researchers also observed that patients who were later shown to have H30 were, at their first visit with the doctor, significantly less likely to be suspected of having an infection, and less likely to receive a proper antibiotic prescription. Within a month afterward, patients whose initial strain was H30 were more likely to experience a severe complication, including a hospital admission or a new infection at a different site.  Thus, the researchers reported that H30  was strongly associated with ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy, clinical and microbial persistence, and diverse, later-occurring adverse effects.  And even when the H30 infection seemed like any other E. coli infection during the first clinical encounter, and the patient received a correct antibiotic, the infection could persist for an unusually long time.  We don t know the exact reason, but it s possible that H30 might have been hiding from the patients  natural defenses against infection, thereby impairing the body s attempt to clear the pathogen during treatment,  Sokurenko said.  Distinctive properties that perhaps allow H30 to act as a defenses-evading pathogen might also be associated with the delayed complications,  he surmised. He added that the basis for the lack of response to supposedly effective antibiotic treatment and reasons for later-appearing complications is still unclear.  H30 might have that dangerous combination of being both highly resistant to antibiotics and highly successful as a stealth pathogen,  Sokurenko said.  This double-trouble may be why H30 is so widespread and has become a superbug. What makes it worse is that can go unnoticed in a patient until it causes significant damage.  Sokurenko would like to see better ways to anticipate, detect, and diagnose H30 in the elderly or other vulnerable patients who don t have the usual symptoms of urinary tract or bloodstream infection. In addition to improved surveillance, he also would like rapid tests to become available to determine which antibiotics may or may not work for an individual patient, to avoid antibiotic-bacteria mismatch and delayed treatment response.  Our findings reinforce the need for a more  individualized medicine  approach to prescribing antibiotics for E. coli infections,  he said.  Also, even if the infection seems mild the patient should be monitored carefully so it does not progress unchecked. ","Published: April 20, 2016"

The study is one of the largest genomic studies to date on behavioral genetics.  We have known for a long time that these traits have a genetic component, but until now, we had identified only a few specific genetic variants related to these traits,  said Daniel Benjamin, corresponding author and an associate professor of theCenter for Economic and Social Research at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Benjamin said that the genetic variants do not determine whether someone develops depressive symptoms, neuroticism or have a poor sense of well-being.  Psychological well-being is jointly influenced by genes and environment,  he said.  The genetic variants that we found account for a small fraction of these genetic associations.  Analyze this The scientists found three genetic variants associated with subjective well-being   how happy or satisfied a person reports feeling about his or her life   based on an analysis of roughly 300,000 people. The researchers also found two genetic variants associated with depressive symptoms, based on an analysis of nearly 180,000 people, and 11 genetic variants associated with neuroticism, based on an analysis of 170,000 people. The depression results were replicated through an analysis of another sample of nearly 370,000 people.  We found that most of the genetic variants associated with depressive symptoms and/or neuroticism also were linked to subjective well-being and vice-versa,  Benjamin said.  When examined individually, each genetic variant explains very little about these traits. But when taken together, these findings imply that the genetic influences on depression, neuroticism and subjective well-being result from the cumulative effects of at least thousands, if not millions, of different variants.  The study also found that subjective well-being, neuroticism and depression are predominantly influenced by the same set of genes. The scientists said this finding indicates that researchers may want to consider studying these traits jointly for future work. The interdisciplinary team   which included medical researchers and psychologists   also studied whether the genetic variants that they had identified overlap with genetic variants associated with other diseases and disorders, including Alzheimer s, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The strongest link was with anxiety disorders. The researchers also found the genetic variants tied to subjective well-being, depression and neuroticism moderately overlap with the variants that are associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Because the study has found some of the first genetic variants associated with well-being, depression and neuroticism, it is too soon to draw conclusions about how the genes affect biological mechanisms, Benjamin said. The scientists issued several cautions for interpreting the results of their study.  Genetics is only one factor that influences these psychological traits. The environment is at least as important, and it interacts with the genetic effects,  Benjamin said.","Published: April 20, 2016"

Rather, tumors arise from the complex interplay between any number of mutually exclusive abnormal changes in the genome, the combinations of which can be unique to each individual patient. To better characterize the functional context of genomic variations in cancer, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and the Broad Institute developed a new computer algorithm they call REVEALER. This tool, described in a paper published April 18 in Nature Biotechnology, is designed to help researchers identify groups of genetic variations that together associate with a particular way cancer cells get activated, or how they respond to certain treatments. REVEALER is available for free to the global scientific community via the bioinformatics software portal GenePattern.org.  This computational analysis method effectively uncovers the functional context of genomic alterations, such as gene mutations, amplifications, or deletions, that drive tumor formation,  said senior author Pablo Tamayo, PhD, professor and co-director of the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center Genomics and Computational Biology Shared Resource. Tamayo and team tested REVEALER using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the National Institutes of Health s database of genomic information from more than 500 human tumors representing many cancer types. REVEALER revealed gene alterations associated with the activation of several cellular processes known to play a role in tumor development and response to certain drugs. Some of these gene mutations were already known, but others were new. For example, the researchers discovered new activating genomic abnormalities for beta-catenin, a cancer-promoting protein, and for the oxidative stress response that some cancers hijack to increase their viability. REVEALER is a powerful approach but requires as input high-quality genomic data and a significant number of cancer samples, which can be a challenge, Tamayo says. But REVEALER is more sensitive at detecting similarities between different types of genomic features and less dependent on simplifying statistical assumptions, compared to other methods, he says.  This study demonstrates the potential of combining functional profiling of cells with the characterizations of cancer genomes via next generation sequencing,  said co-senior author Jill P. Mesirov, PhD, professor and associate vice chancellor for computational health sciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.","Published: April 20, 2016"

But precision medicine has an unsung partner that could affect the lives of many more people: Precision prevention   a reflection of the growing realization that preventing cancer and other diseases may not be one-size-fits-all.  Precision medicine has been kind of a buzzword recently, but often when people think about precision medicine, they think about treatment,  said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center biostatistician Dr. Li Hsu, who researches precision prevention for colorectal cancer.  I think it s just as important if not more important to prevent disease.  In work presented Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research s annual meeting in New Orleans, Hsu and other researchers from Fred Hutch, the University of Michigan and other institutes debuted their latest progress in precision prevention   an in-the-works method to predict risk of colorectal cancer that integrates genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors. This research is not yet ready to move into clinical practice, said Fred Hutch epidemiologistDr. Ulrike (Riki) Peters, one of the study authors. But it s the first attempt at combining so many different areas of colorectal cancer risk factors into one comprehensive risk predictor. Current risk stratification methods for colorectal cancer screening recommendations are based on age and family history alone. No family history of the disease? Start colonoscopies at age 50. Have an immediate relative who had colorectal cancer? Start at age 40. But these methods are likely missing many at risk, Peters said. Eighty percent of those with colorectal cancer have no known first-degree family history. And, unlike some cancers, it s a disease where screening and prevention are tightly linked   colonoscopies can catch premalignant lesions and if those lesions are removed, the patient is likely spared from developing cancer.  That is a very unique aspect of colorectal cancer,  Peters said. Even though the disease is highly preventable if caught in the precancerous stages, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (for men and women combined) in the U.S., topped only by lung cancer. So along with encouraging people to get the recommended colonoscopies, a better sieve to catch those at higher risk of the disease could have an impact both on cancer prevention and on sparing those at low risk unnecessary procedures.  At the end, what we want to do is to reduce disease burden given limited resources,  said Dr. Jihyoun Jeon, a cancer modeler and epidemiologist at the University of Michigan who presented the risk prediction model in a poster at the AACR meeting.  We want to save resources but also prevent as much [disease] as possible.  Stitching the risk factors together The improved risk prediction method was developed using data from more than 18,000 people, approximately 8,400 of whom had colorectal cancer. These data come from two large colorectal cancer studies that Peters leads or co-leads, known as the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colorectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT). Peters, Hsu and their colleagues have been working for years to identify the genetics behind colorectal cancer. It was always their goal to use that information to improve risk prediction, Hsu said, but only recently has the team amassed enough links between genes and disease to be able to work on the precision prevention piece of the puzzle. Using 19 known environmental and lifestyle risk factors for the disease and 64 common genetic variants, the statisticians sorted the more than 18,000 people in their dataset along a continuum of high to low risk of colorectal cancer. Some of the known risk factors for colorectal cancer include smoking, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle and diets high in red meat and processed meat, Peters said. Increasing folate, calcium, fruit and vegetable intake and, for some, use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce risk of the disease. Hsu stressed that the model, which was funded by the National Cancer Institute, currently only provides guidance on when to start regular colonoscopies. The researchers haven t yet addressed the issue of changing the frequency to more or less than what s currently recommended   every 10 years (for those at average risk)   as building such models requires additional information such as results from previous screenings. After crunching the numbers, their model spat out recommendations that those in the highest 10 percent of risk start screening at age 44 (for men) or 47 (for women), if they do not have any immediate family with colorectal cancer. In the lowest 10 percent, the model recommended starting colonoscopies at 58 for men and 63 for women.  If someone is at low risk and would not start screening until age 60, that means you would have one less screening during your lifetime,  Hsu said. The important question, of course, is whether their risk prediction model will catch and prevent more cases of cancer than current guidelines. The researchers don t yet know. But Peters is hoping to soon launch a new project to address that question by looking at how their model fares in a large community group, to be conducted with researchers from Kaiser Permanente. It s hard to predict when their method could show up in the clinic, the researchers said. They need to first validate that it works in another large dataset of study participants, which they re planning to start soon, using data from the NCI s Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. And they also need to assess whether the tool, which includes genetic testing, would be cost-effective. They have primary data suggesting that it is but need to do more analyses, Peters said. After which, the next step is to study the model s effectiveness at predicting cancer risk in a randomized clinical trial, she said.  This is showing the path where we would like to move toward,  Peters said.  Most [high-risk] people don t know that they have an increased risk. We would like to inform this better by not making this one size fits all. ","Published: April 20, 2016"

Microbes are rapidly evolving resistance to existing drugs, making the need for newer, more potent antibiotics greater than ever. Now, researchers have discovered the structure of a well-established target for antibiotic development, an enzyme called MraY, as it is bound to the natural antibacterial muraymycin. The results show that the enzyme dramatically changes its shape to reveal a hidden binding pocket, which muraymycin connects to like a two-pronged plug inserting into a socket. The study, published April 18 in Nature, provides important structural information for designing broad-spectrum antibiotics that target an enzyme essential to every known strain of bacteria, including those that cause tuberculosis and MRSA.  Nature has evolved a number of ways to inhibit this enzyme, but researchers haven t been able to mimic their properties in the laboratory,  said senior study author Seok-Yong Lee, Ph.D., assistant professor of biochemistry at Duke University School of Medicine.  Here, we provide a platform for understanding how these natural inhibitors work, with the degree of molecular detail necessary to accelerate drug development.  Many of the most widely used antibiotics were derived from substances concocted by soil-dwelling bacteria and fungi to poison their microbial competitors. The discovery of these natural products led some leaders in the scientific community to announce an end to infectious diseases, but those predictions proved premature as more stubborn, drug-resistant forms of bacteria emerged. But rather than keeping up with the need, antibiotic development has stagnated in recent decades. The World Health Organization now warns that society is on the cusp of a post-antibiotic era, where millions of people could die from previously curable diseases.  Structural biology provides a glimmer of hope. By capturing the interactions between bacteria and their natural killers, Lee believes that he can provide the inspiration for developing new and improved drugs. For instance, five different naturally-occurring antibiotics target MraY, an enzyme responsible for building up the cell wall to shield bacteria from outside attack. However, without knowing the structures involved, researchers have been unable to develop drugs with the same effects.  Almost three years ago, Lee solved the atomic structure of MraY. The finding, which was published in the journal Science, represented a critical first step to understanding how to disable the bacterial enzyme. In this study, Lee took the next step by visualizing the structure of MraY while it was locked in an embrace with the natural antibiotic muraymycin. He used a tool known as X-ray crystallography to generate an atomic level three-dimensional picture of this complex. When Lee compared the structures of MraY on its own versus when it was bound by muraymycin, he was surprised to find they were quite different. The enzyme essentially changed its shape to accommodate its inhibitor.  This is not the relationship that we typically see between enzymes and their substrates or inhibitors,  Lee said.  We usually think of the lock and key model, where there is a clearly defined shape for the inhibitor that fits into a corresponding shape on the surface of the enzyme. Instead, we found that this enzyme undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon binding to this inhibitor to expose a binding pocket that was not apparent before.  Lee used various molecular biology and biochemistry techniques to figure out which interactions were important to maintain the connection between MraY and its inhibitor. Basically, he found that muraymycin connects to the once-hidden pocket like a two-pronged plug inserting into a childproof outlet. Next, Lee plans to repeat the same experiments with other inhibitors of MraY.  Many natural product inhibitors bind and inhibit this enzyme in a different way, by a different mechanism,  he said.  If we understand every possible mechanism of inhibition of this enzyme, then we may be able to translate that knowledge into the development of drugs that can target it with the most specificity.

Currently, seasonal flu vaccines are designed to induce high levels of protective antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA), a protein found on the surface of the influenza virus that enables the virus to enter a human cell and initiate infection. New research conducted by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, found that higher levels of antibody against a different flu surface protein   neuraminidase (NA)   were the better predictor of protection against flu infection and its unpleasant side effects. Neuraminidase, which is not currently the main target antigen in traditional flu vaccines, enables newly formed flu viruses to exit the host cell and cause further viral replication in the body. The findings, from a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers were willingly exposed to naturally occurring 2009 H1N1 influenza type A virus, appear online in the open-access journal mBio.  Each year between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the United States die as the result of seasonal influenza and its complications,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci., M.D.  Annual vaccination against seasonal flu continues to be the most effective way to protect against infection, and this new study provides some interesting clues about how we might improve the level of protection that flu vaccines provide.  Higher levels of HA antibodies in a person s body have long been associated with greater protection against influenza infection. As a result, HA antibody levels have traditionally been used to guide vaccine strain selection and to infer how effective that vaccine might be against circulating viruses until field studies are available. However, variations in seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness over the past decade have raised questions about their protective ability and whether other factors, such as antibodies to the NA protein on the flu virus, should be considered in designing the annual flu vaccine to improve its performance.  The idea behind this study was to re-evaluate the bar that was previously established for evaluating a person s immune response to influenza vaccines,  said the study's principal investigator Matthew J. Memoli, M.D., director of the Clinical Studies Unit in NIAID s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases.  We wanted to test the conventional wisdom and see if people with high levels of HA antibodies were less likely to develop mild-to-moderate influenza compared with those with lower HA antibody levels.  To do this, the research team enrolled 65 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 years in the human challenge study   a type of research study in which individuals are exposed to disease-causing pathogens under carefully controlled conditions. The flu challenge study, which began in September 2013, was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in the specially designed Clinical Studies Unit, which has distinct isolation and infection control features. Dr. Memoli and his colleagues measured levels of existing anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies in the participants  blood. Based on those results, the volunteers were placed into two groups: those with high levels of anti-HA antibodies (25 participants) and those with low levels of anti-HA antibodies (40 participants). Each of the volunteers was then administered an intranasal dose (1 milliliter) of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus; the volunteers were required to stay in the study unit for nine days where they were monitored by medical staff 24 hours daily. After the nine-day testing period, participants were discharged after completing two days of negative flu tests. After that time, they had four follow-up visits with the study team over eight weeks. As expected, the researchers found that the group of participants who had high levels of anti-HA antibodies when enrolled in the trial experienced a significantly lower incidence of mild-to-moderate influenza disease and some reduction in its duration compared with participants with low HA antibody levels. However, the NIAID researchers also found that these participants were just as likely to experience some flu symptoms as those with low levels of HA antibodies. If these results are consistent with naturally occurring flu infection, it suggests that while high HA antibody levels may limit viral shedding, and thus the spread of virus from person to person, these levels may not prevent the development of flu symptoms. This would help to explain why some people who receive the seasonal flu vaccine might still report flu symptoms. Surprisingly, the researchers found that participants with high levels of NA antibodies experienced a more robust protective effect from the vaccine than did those in the high HA group. Specifically, the NIAID team found that the individuals with high NA antibody levels experienced less severe disease, a shorter duration of viral shedding and symptoms, and fewer and less severe symptoms compared with those with high HA levels when challenged with the 2009 H1N1 virus. HA and NA antibody levels considered together may be a better predictor of whether someone develops mild-to-moderate influenza disease   and the severity of their symptoms   than either factor alone, but this study suggests that NA antibodies are the stronger factor for determining disease severity, the authors conclude. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that the role of NA immunity should be considered when studying influenza susceptibility and that NA antigens should be considered in the design of future flu vaccine platforms. Additional information about the flu challenge trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov using the identifier NCT01971255. The research received additional funding support through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. NIAID conducts and supports research   at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide   to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.","Published: April 20, 2016"

Basically, they built a computer model of a cat brain's corticocortical network separated into 65 areas and connected by fibers of different densities. The areas were separated into four clusters, or cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor, and frontolimbic. The researchers subjected the computer model to seizure-like conditions and tested three different ways to control or avert seizure-like electrical patterns in the computer model. Their results appear in the current edition of the journal Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science. In it, the team reports results of its investigation into the specific seizure-related problem known as synchronization suppression using cluster analysis to evaluate three interventions. See Also: Researchers find an important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures Results show that of the three methods with therapeutic potential for correcting electrical disorders in the brain, the delayed feedback control is the most productive for synchronization suppression. The other two methods for achieving synchronization suppression that the team analyzed were external time-periodic driving and activation of selected neurons. ""We investigated the destruction of synchronization in a realistic neural network model whose connecting architecture is formed by a cluster of sub-network, and we found the most significant and interesting aspect to be the verification that the efficiency of synchronization suppression by delayed feedback control is higher and more efficient than for the two other methods: external time-periodic driving and activation of selected neurons. And importantly, the delayed feedback control is an intervention that does not damage the neurons,"" said Antonio M Batista, PhD, the team leader of the study from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at State University of Ponta Grossa, Brazil. Cluster analysis refers to an algorithm-based method commonly used to identify, classify and compare objects being studied into structures clusters that share a similar measure. It is broadly used in many disciplines to analyze a range of characteristics, from pattern recognition to economic data to textual analysis and biological parameters, in this case analyzing the brain's electrical output.

It's on the right side of the brain behind the ear, in a region called the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). See Also: ADHD: Brains not recognizing an angry expression In a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the researchers report that they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify a region of pSTS as the part of the brain activated when test subjects looked at images of people making different facial expressions. Further, the researchers have discovered that neural patterns within the pSTS are specialized for recognizing movement in specific parts of the face. One pattern is tuned to detect a furrowed brow, another is tuned to detect the upturn of lips into a smile, and so on. ""That suggests that our brains decode facial expressions by adding up sets of key muscle movements in the face of the person we are looking at,"" said Aleix Martinez, a cognitive scientist and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State. Martinez said that he and his team were able to create a machine learning algorithm that uses this brain activity to identify what facial expression a person is looking at based solely on the fMRI signal. fMRI showing activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) region of the brain of a test subject who is recognizing a facial expression. Courtesy: Ohio State University  ""Humans use a very large number of facial expressions to convey emotion, other non-verbal communication signals and language,"" Martinez said. ""Yet, when we see someone make a face, we recognize it instantly, seemingly without conscious awareness. In computational terms, a facial expression can encode information, and we've long wondered how the brain is able to decode this information so efficiently. ""Now we know that there is a small part of the brain devoted to this task.""

""That's a very powerful development, because it suggests that the coding of facial expressions is very similar in your brain and my brain and most everyone else's brain,"" Martinez said. The study doesn't say anything about people who exhibit atypical neural functioning, but it could give researchers new insights, said study co-author Julie Golomb, assistant professor of psychology and director of the Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Ohio State. ""This work could have a variety of applications, helping us not only understand how the brain processes facial expressions, but ultimately how this process may differ in people with autism, for example,"" she said. Doctoral student Ramprakash Srinivasan, Golomb and Martinez placed 10 college students into an fMRI machine and showed them more than 1,000 photographs of people making facial expressions. The expressions corresponded to seven different emotional categories: disgusted, happily surprised, happily disgusted, angrily surprised, fearfully surprised, sadly fearful and fearfully disgusted. While some of the expressions were positive and others negative, they all had some commonalities among them. For instance, ""happily surprised,"" ""angrily surprised"" and ""fearfully surprised"" all include raised eyebrows, though other parts of the face differ when we express these three emotions. fMRI detects increased blood flow in the brain, so the research group was able to obtain images of the part of the brain that was activated when the students recognized different expressions. Regardless of the expression they were looking at, all the students showed increased activity in the same region the pSTS. Then the research group used a computer to cross-reference the fMRI images with the different facial muscle movements shown in the test photographs. They were able to create a map of regions within the pSTS that activated for different facial muscle groups, such as the muscles of the eyebrows or lips. Don't Miss: Facial motion a clue to difficulties in social interaction among autistic adults First, they constructed maps using the fMRIs of 9 of the participants. Then, they fed the algorithm the fMRI images from the 10th student, and asked it to identify the expressions that student was looking at. Then they repeated the experiment, creating the map from scratch with data from nine of the students, but using a different student as the 10th subject. About 60 percent of the time, the algorithm was able to accurately identify the facial expression that the 10th person was looking at, based solely on that person's fMRI image. Martinez called the results ""very positive,"" and said that they indicate that the algorithm is making strides toward an understanding of what happens in that region of the brain.

The finding suggests that replay of previous experiences during rest is important for memory consolidation, a process whereby the brain stabilises and preserves memories for quick recall in the future. Understanding the physiological mechanism of this is essential for tackling amnesiac conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, where memory consolidation is affected.

The study, published in Nature Neuroscience and funded by the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society, investigated the role of sleep in memory consolidation by simultaneously studying two areas of the brain as the rats rested following activity. Six rats each ran for 30 minutes on a six metre long track before resting for 90 minutes. During rest, the team studied the responses of place cells in the hippocampus, where memories are formed, and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, where the memories were found to transfer to. The response of the place cells showed that the rats re-ran the track in their minds as they rested but did so at speeds 10-20 times faster than they experienced in reality. The same replay happened almost simultaneously, with a 10 millisecond delay, in grid cells located in a different part of the brain, suggesting that the rats' memories transferred from one part of the brain to another.

Diseases like Rett syndrome, central sleep apnea and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome are characterized by breathing difficulties that may be caused by dysfunction in the brain's breathing center. Now, Drexel University scientists have introduced a new concept of how the brain is involved in this essential function, providing new insight into how breathing disorders could be treated in the future. The brainstem, which connects the brain with the spinal cord, generates the breathing rhythm and controls its rate, depending on the body's demands. While this process normally occurs automatically, we can also control our breathing voluntarily, such as when speaking or eating. See Also: Surgical approaches mapped for auditory brainstem implantation Twenty-five years ago, a cluster of neurons within the brainstem, called the pre-B tzinger complex (pre-B tC), was identified as the likely source of rhythmic inhalation.

Two decades after the discovery of the pre-B tC, scientists hypothesized that two distinct systems in the brain interact to initiate breathing: a ""rhythm-generating"" layer composed of high- frequency neurons and a ""pattern-forming"" layer, which signals the diaphragm to contract and the lungs to fill with air. Using a series of computational models, Drexel researchers in the Laboratory for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience, under the leadership of Ilya Rybak, PhD, are the first to challenge this paradigm. Don't Miss: Study details brain pathways linking visual function, running Their study, recently published in the journal eLife, suggests that mixed-mode oscillations in the pre-B tC or regular back-and-forth movements result from synchronizations of many neurons with different levels of excitability. Neurons with low excitability have low bursting frequencies, but generate strong activity and recruit other neurons, ultimately producing the large amplitude bursts that cause breathing. The discovery could have important implications for our understanding of the brain's control of breathing. The findings may ultimately impact how scientists research and clinicians treat respiratory disorders. Many other parts of the nervous system also contain networks of neurons with diverse excitability. A challenge for future studies is to investigate whether networks similar to those in the pre-B tC complex generate the rhythms that control other repetitive actions, such as walking and chewing.

Rather, tumors arise from the complex interplay between any number of mutually exclusive abnormal changes in the genome, the combinations of which can be unique to each individual patient. To better characterize the functional context of genomic variations in cancer, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and the Broad Institute developed a new computer algorithm they call REVEALER. This tool, described in a paper published in Nature Biotechnology, is designed to help researchers identify groups of genetic variations that together associate with a particular way cancer cells get activated, or how they respond to certain treatments. REVEALER is available for free to the global scientific community via the bioinformatics software portal GenePattern.org.  This computational analysis method effectively uncovers the functional context of genomic alterations, such as gene mutations, amplifications, or deletions, that drive tumor formation,  said senior author Pablo Tamayo, PhD, professor and co-director of the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center Genomics and Computational Biology Shared Resource. Tamayo and team tested REVEALER using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the National Institutes of Health s database of genomic information from more than 500 human tumors representing many cancer types. REVEALER revealed gene alterations associated with the activation of several cellular processes known to play a role in tumor development and response to certain drugs. Some of these gene mutations were already known, but others were new. For example, the researchers discovered new activating genomic abnormalities for beta-catenin, a cancer-promoting protein, and for the oxidative stress response that some cancers hijack to increase their viability. REVEALER is a powerful approach but requires as input high-quality genomic data and a significant number of cancer samples, which can be a challenge, Tamayo says. But REVEALER is more sensitive at detecting similarities between different types of genomic features and less dependent on simplifying statistical assumptions, compared to other methods, he says.  This study demonstrates the potential of combining functional profiling of cells with the characterizations of cancer genomes via next generation sequencing,  said co-senior author Jill P. Mesirov, PhD, professor and associate vice chancellor for computational health sciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.","Published: April 19, 2016"

This initiative is in response to upcoming reforms that are designed to further strengthen the data protection policies, procedures, systems and controls of UK and other European organizations. The formal partnership enables Exco InTouch to step up to the regulatory challenge and to immediately satisfy mandatory requirements that aren t expected to come into force until 2018. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a range of companies responsible for handling sensitive data will be required to have Data Protection Officers in place by this two-year deadline. Dale Jessop, Chief Technology Officer at Exco InTouch remarked:  At Exco InTouch we take data protection very seriously indeed. A key factor underpinning our business has been the need to ensure that we meet   and exceed   data regulation requirements across all our global operations. This is why we have taken the decision to partner with Regulatory Strategies to take on the role of our Data Protection Officer.  Founder and Director of Regulatory Strategies, Mike Bradford, commented:  the imminent changes to the data regulation environment present some of the most fundamental challenges faced every day by all organizations, irrespective of size or sector.  The market understands the need to embed data protection into their businesses. However, in the health-care sector, typically under the current EU Data Protection Directive and US HIPAA privacy rules, the compliance bar is now being set much higher, with fines for non-compliance of up to 20 million euros or 4% of worldwide annual turnover. The need for organizations to be taking steps at this stage to ensure compliance with the new data protection regime was highlighted by Information Commissioner Christopher Graham at the ICO s annual Data Protection Practitioners  Conference on 14 March of this year. He stated that people have never been so aware of what their personal data is, and never cared so much about how it is used. Consequently, the law is changing to reflect this and EU data protection reforms promise to be the biggest shake up for consumers  data protection rights for three decades.  Organizations simply cannot afford to fall behind. We know Data Protection Officers understand this, and we know they sometimes find their views ignored in the boardroom. The new law gives directors 20 million reasons to start listening . Exco InTouch has recognized this and taken steps to ensure its position as a trusted custodian of sensitive medical and health data on behalf of its global clients and patients remains at the forefront of its strategy in respect of ensuring  best in class  data protection and regulatory compliance. Tim Davis, CEO and Founder of Exco InTouch commented:  Meeting the highest regulatory standards is a key commitment of our company. In achieving this, we have had the foresight to take an industry lead in compliance. Consequently, we have formed this alliance with Regulatory Strategies to be the first in our sector to comply with the need to engage and install Data Protection Officers years before the actual deadline has to be met. We will continue to invest in data protection and compliance to ensure that Exco InTouch remains at the forefront of clinical research and healthcare technology. ","Published: April 19, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/identifying-brain-tumours-in-real-time-197578,Identifying Brain Tumours in Real Time Researchers from VU Amsterdam demonstrate how a new method allows surgeons to identify brain tumours in real time  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.VU researchers from the Physics Department/LaserLab and VUmc have shown that a label-free optics technique can reveal exactly where brain tumors are, producing images in less than a second   unlike conventional methods that can take a whole day. ""The special thing about our images is that we showed they contain so much information"", says Marloes Groot (Physics/LaserLab). ""When I showed these images to the pathologists that we work with, they were amazed."" Groot and her colleagues describe their work in Biomedical Optics Express.  Laser pulses When operating on cancer, surgeons want to remove tumours and not healthy tissue. This is especially important and challenging when dealing with brain tumours, which are often spread out and mixed in with the healthy tissue. Pathologists typically use staining methods, in which chemicals like hematoxylin and eosin turn different tissue components blue and red, revealing its structure and whether there are any tumour cells. But for a definitive diagnosis this process can take up to 24 hours, which means surgeons may not realise some cancerous tissue has escaped from their attention until after surgery   requiring a second operation and more risk.  With the new technique, the researchers do not use any labeling or staining at all. Instead, they fire short, 200-femtosecond-long laser pulses into the tissue, and when three photons converge at the same time and place, the photons interact with the nonlinear optical properties of the tissue. Through well-known phenomena in optics called second and third harmonic generation, these interactions produce a single photon.  Deep tissue penetration The key is that the incoming and outgoing photons have different wavelengths. The incoming photons are at 1200 nanometers long enough to penetrate deep into the tissue. The single photon that is produced, however, is at 600 or 400 nanometers, depending on if it is second or third harmonic generation. The shorter wavelengths mean the photon can scatter in the tissue. The scattered photon thus contains information about the tissue, and when it reaches a detector, in this case a high-sensitivity GaAsP photomultiplier tube, it reveals what the tissue looks like inside.  While other researchers have exploited this technique for other applications   to make images of insects and fish embryos, for example   this is the first time anyone has used it to analyse glial brain tumours. These tumours are particularly deadly because it is hard to get rid of tumour cells by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy without substantial collateral damage to the surrounding brain tissue.  Real time The researchers tested their method on samples of glial brain tumours from humans, finding that the histological detail in these images was as good   if not better   than those made with conventional staining techniques. They were able to make most images in under a minute. The smaller ones took less than a second, while larger images of a few square millimeters took five minutes. ""This makes it possible to do it in real time in the operating room"", Groot says.  Now that they have shown their approach works, the researchers are developing a hand-held device that a surgeon can use to identify a tumour's border during surgery. The incoming laser pulses can only reach a depth of about 100 micrometers into the tissue. To reach farther, Groot envisions attaching a needle that can pierce the tissue and deliver photons deeper.  ""With our technique it is potentially possible to diagnose not only during an operation but possibly before surgery. ","Published: April 19, 2016"

As a result, the allergic reaction in the airways is shut down long- term and an asthma attack prevented. The technology can be applied to food allergies as well. The nanoparticle is currently being tested in a mouse model of peanut allergy, similar to food allergy in humans.  The findings represent a novel, safe and effective long-term way to treat and potentially  cure  patients with life-threatening respiratory and food allergies,  said senior author Stephen Miller, the Judy Gugenheim Research Professor of Microbiology-Immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  This may eliminate the need for life-long use of medications to treat lung allergy.  It s the first time this method for creating tolerance in the immune system has been used in allergic diseases. The approach has been used in autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and celiac disease in previous preclinical Northwestern research. The asthma allergy study was in mice, but the technology is progressing to clinical trials in autoimmune disease. The nanoparticle technology is being developed commercially by Cour Pharmaceuticals Development Co., which is working with Miller to bring this new approach to patients. A clinical trial using the nanoparticles to treat celiac disease is in development.   It s a universal treatment,  Miller said.  Depending on what allergy you want to eliminate, you can load up the nanoparticle with ragweed pollen or a peanut protein.  The nanoparticles are composed of an FDA-approved biopolymer called PLGA that includes lactic acid and glycolic acid. Also a senior author is Lonnie Shea, adjunct professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern s McCormick School of Engineering and of obstetrics and gynecology at Feinberg, and chair of biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan. When the allergen-loaded nanoparticle is injected into the bloodstream of mice, the immune system isn t concerned with it because it sees the particle as innocuous debris. Then the nanoparticle and its hidden cargo are consumed by a macrophage, essentially a vacuum-cleaner cell.  The vacuum-cleaner cell presents the allergen or antigen to the immune system in a way that says,  No worries, this belongs here,  Miller said. The immune system then shuts down its attack on the allergen, and the immune system is reset to normal. The allergen, in this case egg protein, was administered into the lungs of mice who have been pretreated to be allergic to the protein and already had antibodies in their blood against it. So when they were re-exposed to it, they responded with an allergic response like asthma. After being treated with the nanoparticle, they no longer had an allergic response to the allergen.   The approach also has a second benefit. It creates a more normal, balanced immune system by increasing the number of regulatory T cells, immune cells important for recognizing the airway allergens as normal. This method turns off the dangerous Th2 T cell that causes the allergy and expands the good, calming regulatory T cells.","Published: April 19, 2016"

For plants and animals, genetically close cousins tend to act in similar ways. Finches, for example, eat seeds, while swallows eat insects. For bacteria, however, the question is up for debate. Does evolutionary history predict how different types of bacteria behave and function? Or, conversely, do unrelated bacteria typically overlap each other s functions, providing the same ecosystem services a concept known as functional redundancy? The answer determines how much may be lost when strains of bacteria are lost from a soil community. Ecoss researchers at Northern Arizona University led by post-doctoral researcher Ember Morrissey now an assistant professor of Environmental Microbiology at West Virginia University took a close-up look at differences in bacterial activity in intact soil communities using a new tool. Quantitative stable isotope probing, known as qSIP, is an improvement over existing qualitative methods because it measures more than just the presence or absence of certain types of bacterial activity in soil it measures the rate of that activity. Activity rate can then be linked to the DNA of a specific bacterial strain to look for patterns of behavior at a much finer scale.  Using this new approach,  said Morrissey,  we can now answer many questions about the ecology of microorganisms and their role in determining ecosystem function that were previously out of reach.  The research was funded by a $1.4 million grant from the Department of Energy, Genomic Sciences Program. Results were recently published in The ISME Journal. Researchers incubated soil samples from an intact Northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest with water and glucose that were uniquely marked. The water contained a heavier form (isotope) of oxygen, and the glucose contained a heavier form of carbon. The amount of isotope used by different types of bacteria, measured using qSIP, is like a meter that shows how fast the bacteria grow and how much carbon they use. Bacteria sharing a closer evolutionary history showed similar population growth rates and carbon use. Bacteria farther apart by lineage differed in these behaviors. The rates that different types of bacteria grow and assimilate carbon both affect how an ecosystem functions. This suggests that different types of bacteria may not always be able to substitute for each other s contribution to important processes. Evolutionary history, or phylogeny, it turns out, does play a role in the activity of bacteria in intact soil communities. Linking bacterial lineages to specific types of activity in the soil offers a new way to understand how the specific mix of bacteria in soil influences ecosystem function.","Published: April 19, 2016"

However, making sense of this information is extremely difficult as it relies on computational expertise that many crop scientists do not possess. A team of scientists from The John Innes Centre and TGAC, led by crop geneticist Dr Cristobal Uauy, have used their expertise to develop a novel database analysis software tool called expVIP (expression Visualisation and Integration Platform). This is specifically designed to help the worldwide community of crop scientists get more out of their data.  ExpVIP allows researchers to submit information from any species into a single web-based tool that will provide a full analysis of their expression data. This enables scientists and breeders to know where and when genes are expressed in their favourite plants.   Dr Uauy, said:  This new tool will accelerate scientific discoveries by enabling researchers and breeders to more easily place their discoveries in the context of previous knowledge.  Most of the world s major crops are polyploid, meaning they have multiple copies of a very similar set of genes. This makes analysis of gene expression notoriously difficult. However, expVIP is designed to tackle this effectively and simplifies the interpretation and linkage of this complex data.  As a proof-of-concept, the scientists used expVIP to analyse publicly available data from wheat plants grown under a variety of growth conditions. Over 400 datasets which were previously separate and were not easily accessible to most breeders and researchers have now been opened up and linked thanks to this resource. This analysis and an explanation of the expVIP tool is available at http://www.wheat-expression.com/. Ricardo Ramirez-Gonzalez, PhD student at TGAC and JIC and a member of the team who created the new tool, said: ""ExpVIP makes the analysis of big data from expression experiments more accessible, enabling the research community to focus on the biology behind the experiments."" Philippa Borrill, a BBSRC Anniversary Future Leader Fellow and expVIP team member, envisages that: ""the ability to visualise the expression patterns and infer the functions of genes presents a tremendous opportunity to improve major food crops"". Analysis of genomic data is a key aspect of future strategies that researchers will use to develop improved crop species that are able to flourish in the world s changing climate. The expVIP tool is an important step to help researchers without advanced computer skills to get the most out of their data, ultimately, better preparing them to develop improved crop varieties.

Reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the UC Berkeley-led project involved scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute and Monash University in Australia. In the paper, the team, led by Daniel Rokhsar, a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and of physics, compared the cassava reference genome to the genomes of its relatives: the castor bean, rubber tree, Ceara rubber and 53 cultivated and wild cassava varieties from around the world. They found that the genetic diversity of cassava used in current breeding efforts has been greatly reduced in Africa, where viruses such as the cassava mosaic disease and the cassava brown streak disease have affected crop yields in many countries. They were able to detect the genetic signature of past cassava improvement programs going back to the 1930s, which interbred cassava and Ceara rubber, and the persistence of these Ceara rubber regions in elite cassava varieties suggests they confer desirable traits. They also mapped out how the many cultivated cassava varieties are related, which can help breeders maximize genetic diversity in improvement programs.  The variants and population structure described here are essential inputs for marker-assisted and genome selection-based approaches to improving disease resistance and yield for this staple crop,  noted the team, which included UC Berkeley specialist Jessen Bredeson and postdoctoral scholar Jessica Lyons. Cassava root is easy to grow and has a high starch content   between 20 and 40 percent by weight   which makes it an ideal source of calories. However, it is particularly vulnerable to plant pathogens, which can significantly reduce crop yields. The root crop also represents a strategic source of renewable energy   as biomass from which ethanol is being produced for transportation fuels. With the help of genomics, researchers hope to apply advanced breeding strategies that can improve cassava s resistance to diseases and improve crop yields, Rokhsar said. The work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the U.K. Department for International Development and the NEXTGEN Cassava Breeding project.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/coding-and-computers-help-spot-methane-explosives-190931,Coding and Computers Help Spot Methane  Explosives Coded apertures improve and shrink mass spectrometers for field use  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A modern twist on an old technology could soon help detect rogue methane leaks, hidden explosives and much more. A Duke University team is using software to dramatically improve the performance of chemical-sniffing mass spectrometers. Conventional mass spectrometers separate compounds by giving them an electric charge and passing them through electric and/or magnetic fields. The lighter the compound, the more it bends in the field. By determining what compounds make up a given sample, these instruments can identify almost any substance. Mass spectrometers were invented in the 1930s, and they re still typically the size of an oven or refrigerator. Inherent hurdles to miniaturization have made it difficult to use them outside of a laboratory. But with the help of modern data analytics, researchers at Duke have demonstrated a technology using a so-called  coded aperture  that promises to shrink these devices while maintaining their performance. The advance could lead to portable mass spectrometers that could be used to detect environmental or safety hazards in the field. The innovation is featured on the cover of the April issue of the Journal of Mass Spectrometry.  In a typical mass spectrometer, the charged molecules pass through a thin slit, which defines your resolution,  said Jeff Glass, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke and principal investigator for the project.  When you try to shrink the instrument, you have to shrink the slit too. That means the number of ions (charged molecules) passing through is going to drop and you re going to lose signal intensity. We got around this issue by using a several slits, which code the ions.  Glass likens the new technology to watching a solar eclipse in grade school. Students often poke a small hole in a piece of cardboard, which acts like a lens to create an image of the eclipse on the ground. And as anyone who has ever done this knows, the smaller the hole, the better the detail of the eclipse. But a smaller hole also makes it dimmer and harder to see. This is exactly the challenge faced when scaling down a mass spectrometer. The solution, Glass says, is to make many tiny pinholes to create an array of eclipses, and then to use a computer to reconstruct them into a single image. This way you get the sharpness of the tiny pinhole with the brightness of a large pinhole. The key is in knowing the pattern -- or code -- of the array of apertures. Thus the name of the technology, coded aperture.  This idea was actually mentioned in a short article from 1970,  said Jason Amsden, a research scientist and manager of the project.  But nobody since then has had all the parts to put it together.  The team drew on several different kinds of expertise.  Our group could do the fabrication of the microstructures, but we relied on engineering colleagues David Brady and Mike Gehm for the coding and computational aspects, and our colleagues at RTI International (in the nearby Research Triangle Park) for the electronics.  The researchers have demonstrated that their coded aperture works in a newer, more complex type of mass spectrometer created to help make the devices smaller, though not nearly as small or precise as coded apertures could make them. Previous papers by the Duke researchers have also shown that the approach improves the performance of very simple mass spectrometers, like those used in the early days of mass spectrometry. Their work now is focusing on trying coded apertures in different versions of mass spectrometers to determine which would be best for creating scaled down, mobile devices for field use. They are also working to show these devices can detect trace amounts of methane to spot leaks in infrastructure and various explosives to thwart terror attempts. But the technology can also have an immediate impact in research laboratories around the world.

In the trial, the Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen demonstrated a two-year overall survival (OS) rate of 69% compared to 53% for Yervoy alone (HR=0.58 [95% CI: 0.31-1.08]) in patients with BRAF wild-type advanced melanoma. Overall survival was an exploratory endpoint in this trial. The safety profile of the Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen in this study was consistent with previously reported studies. These data will be presented today as an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2016 Annual Meeting during the Immuno-Oncology Clinical Trials I Plenary Session from 2:15   4:00 P.M. CT in New Orleans, Louisiana (Late-Breaking and Clinical Trial Abstract #CT002). Bristol-Myers Squibb is also presenting extended follow-up data, including five-year OS rates, from the Phase 1 dose escalation study, CA209-003, evaluating Opdivomonotherapy in heavily pretreated advanced melanoma patients. These data represent the longest survival follow-up of patients who received an anti-PD-1 therapy in a clinical trial. At five years, patients who received Opdivo showed an OS rate of 34%, with an evident plateau in survival at approximately four years. The safety profile of Opdivo in study -003 was similar to previously reported studies, with no new safety signals identified. These data were featured during the Congress  official press program today at 12:30 P.M. CT, and will be presented as an oral presentation during the Immuno-Oncology Clinical Trials I Plenary Session from 2:15   4:00 P.M. CT (Late-Breaking and Clinical Trial Abstract #CT001).  The data from CheckMate -069 and study -003 showed durable responses for some patients with advanced melanoma using new Immuno-Oncology approaches. These data contribute to our growing understanding of this aggressive cancer and are promising news for advanced melanoma patients. In particular, we are seeing further data that evaluate the potential survival benefit of the nivolumab and ipilimumab combination,  said F. Stephen Hodi, M.D., director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Melanoma continues to be the most aggressive and deadliest form of skin cancer, with an increase in global incidence rates over the last 30 years. Despite advances in treatment, patients with advanced stages of the disease have lower survival rates, with a five-year survival of 15% - 20% for Stage IV disease. Jean Viallet, M.D., Global Clinical Research Lead, Oncology, Bristol-Myers Squibb, commented,  We are encouraged to see that the Opdivo and Yervoy combination showed improvement in overall survival versus Yervoy alone based on two-year follow-up from CheckMate -069, the registrational study of the combination regimen. These data further validate our scientific rationale for studying the combination of these Immuno-Oncology agents. Additionally, study -003 shows five-year overall survival withOpdivo monotherapy in heavily pretreated advanced melanoma patients. These data provide important information about the possible role of Opdivo as a single agent in improving long-term survival for these patients. ","Published: April 19, 2016"

This latest work means technologies developed for humans can be applied to wild and farmed salmon around the world.  The Atlantic salmon s genome has already enabled a refinement of the rainbow trout genome and is providing a framework for sequencing and assembling the genomes of other salmonids, such as Coho salmon and Arctic char,  says Davidson, a professor in SFU s Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.  The completion of the Atlantic salmon s genome allows this species to take its place beside domesticated animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, pig, chicken) whose genomes are being used routinely to enhance livestock production.  The team characterized a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) event, or mutation, that occurred in 80 million years ago, the fourth in the salmonid lineage, and studied the implications of the salmonid s unique capacity to double its genes, enabling them to dramatically expand the interaction of genes and their environment. While they found the salmonid genome is returning to its original stage following a period of genomic instability, some traces of duplication remain today.  The Atlantic salmon genome provides insights into rediploidization  was the result of collaboration between Davidson and the University of Victoria s Dr. Ben Koop, working as part of an international project involving experts from Canada, Chile and Norway. The project is supported by the International Cooperation to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome (ICSASG). The research provides a reference genome sequence and an atlas of genes that gives a whole new scientific baseline from which to improve and understand fisheries, conservation, ecology, physiology, evolution and aquaculture for over 70 economically, culturally and environmentally important salmonid species. The published research ensures that salmon genes, and opportunities for sustainable farming and wild salmon management, are just a mouse click away.  This publication is a testament to the successful partnership of the ICSASG: they have unravelled the extreme complexity of this species  genome, generated significant amounts of new knowledge and addressed many technological hurdles  says Dr. Alan Winter, President and CEO of Genome British Columbia.  The collaboration leaves behind a legacy that will benefit research and sustainable development of this economically and environmentally important species in Canada, Norway and Chile and other countries for years to come.

Researchers have begun to recognize in recent years that such so-called fibrotic scarring around tumors is a bad sign for patients   in extreme cases, it can exert such pressure that blood vessels in the tissue collapse, impeding drug delivery and preventing immune cells from accessing the tissue to demolish the tumor. Oxygen-starved tumors also tend to become increasingly aggressive and liable to metastasize to other parts of the body.  Not surprisingly, there has been a huge effort to prevent this buildup and stiffening of the connective tissue in cancer patients,  says Valerie M. Weaver, PhD, a professor of surgery, anatomy and bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at UCSF and the senior author of the new paper.  However, several high-profile efforts to treat cancers with drugs that try to untangle strangling fibrotic tissue have unfortunately crashed and burned, failing to show significant efficacy in phase 2 clinical trials.  Weaver, who also directs the Center for Bioengineering and Tissue Regeneration in Surgery at UCSF and is a member of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes these failures stem in part from the assumption by many researchers that fibrosis is just a matter of plumbing. Fibrotic ""stiff"" tissue also exerts physical forces on the tumor it surrounds, she says, like a web of rubber bands, and the tumor exerts its own physical forces in response. The new research demonstrates that the violence of the tug-of-war between PDAC tumors and surrounding tissue can have a major impact on how aggressive the cancer becomes. The study also suggests that the tumors of people with particular cancer-causing gene mutations may engage in this tug-of-war like players on steroids, becoming so tight and sinewy that they can roil the tissue around them into advanced states of fibrosis even in the presence of fibrosis-melting drugs.  We found that individuals with these  Schwarzenegger tumors  have a particularly poor prognosis and will require a different approach to treatment, one that should begin as early as possible,  Weaver said.  We re hopeful that these patients  highly contractile tumor cells may be detectable with non-invasive imaging   making it easier to identify them and guide their treatment without costly genetic tests.  SMAD4 Mutations Produce Aggressive  Schwarzenegger Tumors  Previous research had identified mutations in genes such as SMAD4 as potential risk factors for highly aggressive and invasive PDAC tumors, likely because these mutations weaken TGF-  signaling   an important molecular communication pathway in many cells in the body. Other studies had shown that lower TGF-  signaling also could result in denser, more fibrotic tumors. Weaver and her collaborators had long viewed fibrosis as an underappreciated risk factor determining cancer progression, and they decided to investigate this possible link. Using samples of dozens of human PDAC tumors, they found that tumors showing molecular signs of heightened aggressiveness as well as those from patients whose disease had progressed particularly quickly showed significantly worse signs of fibrosis and were surrounded by considerably thicker connective tissue than less-deadly tumors. In addition, tumors with genetic mutations that weaken TGF-  signaling were both more deadly and more likely to show signs of stiffness and fibrosis. To understand how such mutations could lead to both stiffer tumor tissue and lower patient survival rates, the researchers turned to mouse models of PDAC, where they confirmed that a weakening of TGF-b signaling could ratchet up tissue tension and increase the amount of fibrosis surrounding the pancreas. Further experiments showed that weakened TGF-b signaling boosts the activity of a gene called Stat3, which is involved in producing molecules that affect the stiffness of the connective tissue surrounding the pancreas. This heightened tissue tension also caused the mouse PDAC tumors to tighten up like wound springs, which in turn activates genes that induce inflammation and more aggressive forms of cancer. The researchers turned back to pancreatic tumor samples from human patients to confirm their findings, and demonstrated that tumors from patients with SMAD4 mutations and short survival times indeed had elevated levels of Stat3, high local tissue tension, altered connective tissue and molecular signs of a more aggressive status. Understanding of Tissue Mechanics Could Change Cancer Treatment These experiments suggest that not all tumor fibrosis is created equally: For patients with SMAD4 mutations   which Weaver estimates could be 15 to 20 percent of PDAC patients   high-tension tumors grow aggressive and trigger more inflammation, significantly increasing mortality risk. Furthermore, standard approaches to reduce fibrosis simply will not work:  You can melt the fibrosis all you want, but these tumors are so tightly wound that they ll just stir up more,  she said. Instead, approaches that crank down the tension in PDAC tumors, perhaps by reducing Stat3 signaling, could provide a unique opportunity to reduce patient mortality   particularly in patients with SMAD4 mutations   by interrupting the positive feedback loop of tissue tension and significantly improve the prognosis for these patients. It s even possible, Weaver says, that failed anti-fibrosis trials could be revisited: with these patients excluded, trials might show better results.  The problem is that no one s been looking at these physical factors at all,  Weaver said.  Tissue mechanics change how tumors behave, and cancer genes impact the mechanics. It s a really important concept to have in our arsenal. ","Published: April 19, 2016"

Now researchers have shown that it is possible to use genetic editing to snip away the  off switch  so that the immune system recognises cancer again.  The team used a cutting-edge gene editing technique to remove the switch - called PD-1* - from T cells found in the tumour. They found that the immune system was then able to wipe out the cancer cells which no longer had control over the T cells.  Researchers refer to this as  cutting the brakes  and allowing immune cells to do the rest. The study was carried out on mice in the laboratory. The researchers took T cells from the tumour, removed PD-1, multiplied the T cells and put them back into the mice and found that the tumours shrank. In experiments on melanoma and fibrosarcoma, mouse survival increased from less than 20% after 60 days without treatment to more than 70% with treatment. Going forward, the next step will be to test this approach in clinical trials. Dr Sergio Quezada, Head of the Immune Regulation and Cancer Immunotherapy lab at UCL Cancer Institute says: ""This is an exciting discovery and means we may have a way to get around cancer's defences while only targeting the immune cells that recognise the cancer. ""While drugs that block PD-1 do show promise, this method only knocks out PD-1 on the T cells that can find the tumour - which could mean fewer side effects for patients."" *The PD-1 switch   found on T cells   is normally a safety device that stops the immune cells from wrongly attacking harmless cells.

This transaction will result in Promethera becoming the world s leading and most advanced cell therapy and regenerative medicine company targeting liver diseases. Promethera acquired the Cytonet assets in exchange for Promethera shares. The Hopp family, the lead shareholder of Cytonet, will have up to 13% of the share capital after finalization of the transaction. This business combination will result in a more diversified and broader Promethera therapeutic pipeline to address a wide range of liver diseases including large indications. These conditions include Fibrosis, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (AoCLF) and Hemophilia. Promethera will evaluate additional options to target Acute Liver Failure (ALF) and Liver Graft Dysfunction in the future. Promethera will continue to target orphan indications, including Urea Cyle Disorders (UCD), ILMD and A1AT Deficiency ( 1-antitrypsin). By combining the three different cell products resulting from the strategic expansion, human hepatocytes (Heparesc ) and human liver derived stem cells (HepaStem  and H2Stem ) Promethera will mitigate the overall development risk profile of its pipeline whilst strengthening its execution capacities. Adding the advanced pre-commercial stage product candidate Heparesc to the Promethera product portfolio will enable early commercialization. This is targeted for 2017 through a Canadian market approval process and recognition by other countries. There is also the potential to combine the different cellular therapy approaches to develop future liver-targeting robust treatments using cell-encapsulation technologies (a Cytonet asset), including the use of biological scaffolds. The acquisition of the Cytonet assets will add to Promethera s Belgian headquarters (HQ) in Wallonia a U.S. facility in Durham, NC with a team of 18 people for organ and tissue processing, product manufacturing, and world-class liver sourcing with the largest existing Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) network in the U.S. In addition, a team of seven people from Germany will be added to Promethera Belgian HQ to support a filing of a new drug submission (NDS) for Heparesc with Health Canada. Promethera s team as a whole and its top management is now expanded with highly experienced talents and executives with an average of over 15 years of experience in liver cell therapy, cell therapy product manufacturing and commercialization. ""This acquisition by Promethera is the result of a new vision and an ambitious strategy I introduced to the company from early 2015.

These genes also provide clues for how scientists might develop new treatments for cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer s disease. Davis and his colleagues screened approximately 3,500 Drosophila genes and identified several dozen new memory suppressor genes that the brain has to help filter information and store only important parts. One of these suppressor genes, in particular, caught their attention.  When we knocked out this gene, the flies had a better memory a nearly two-fold better memory,  said Davis.  The fact that this gene is active in the same pathway as several cognitive enhancers currently used for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease suggests it could be a potential new therapeutic target.  When the scientists disabled this gene, known as DmSLC22A, flies  memory of smells (the most widely studied form of memory in this model) was enhanced while overexpression of the gene inhibited that same memory function.  Memory processes and the genes that make the brain proteins required for memory are evolutionarily conserved between mammals and fruit flies,  said Research Associate Ze Liu, co-first author of the study.  The majority of human cognitive disease-causing genes have the same functional genetic counterparts in flies.  The gene in question belongs to a family of  plasma membrane transporters,  which produce proteins that move molecules, large and small, across cell walls. In the case of DmSLC22A, the new study indicates that the gene makes a protein involved in moving neurotransmitter molecules from the synaptic space between neurons back into the neurons. When DmSLC22A functions normally, the protein removes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the synapse, helping to terminate the synaptic signal. When the protein is missing, more acetylcholine persists in the synapse, making the synaptic signal stronger and more persistent, leading to enhanced memory.    DmSLC22A serves as a bottleneck in memory formation,  said Research Associate Yunchao Gai, the study s other co-first author.  Considering the fact that plasma transporters are ideal pharmacological targets, drugs that inhibit this protein may provide a practical way to enhance memory in individuals with memory disorders.  The next step, Davis added, is to develop a screen for inhibitors of this pathway that, independently or in concert with other treatments, may offer a more effective way to deal with the problems of memory loss due to Alzheimer s and other neurodegenerative diseases.  One of the major reasons for working with the fly initially is to identify brain proteins that may be suitable targets for the development of cognitive enhancers in humans,  said Davis.  Otherwise, we would be guessing in the dark as to which of the more than 23,000 human proteins might be appropriate targets. ","Published: April 19, 2016"

A genetic component was also identified, with associations between A 1-40 and cognitive and brain volume measures predominantly observed in individuals carrying the  4 allele, while the opposite was observed in non-carriers. Longitudinal analysis revealed greater decline in global cognition and memory for the highest quintiles of A 1-42 and the ratio measure. Director of CHeBA and co-author on the paper, Professor Perminder Sachdev, said he was encouraged by the findings.

This is especially important and challenging when dealing with brain tumors, which are often spread out and mixed in with the healthy tissue. Now, researchers have shown that a well-established optics technique can reveal exactly where brain tumors are, producing images in less than a minute unlike conventional methods that can take a whole day. See Also: Scientists engineer toxin-secreting stem cells to treat brain tumors ""The special thing about our images is that we showed they contain so much information,"" said Marloes Groot of VU University Amsterdam, Netherlands. ""When I showed these images to the pathologists that we work with, they were amazed."" Groot and her colleagues describe their work in the journal Biomedical Optics Express, from The Optical Society. Pathologists typically use staining methods, in which chemicals like hematoxylin and eosin turn different tissue components blue and red, revealing its structure and whether there are any tumor cells. But for a definitive diagnosis this process can take up to 24 hours, which means surgeons may not realize some cancerous tissue has escaped from their attention until after surgery requiring a second operation and more risk. But with the new technique, the researchers don't use any labeling or staining at all. Instead, they fire short, 200-femtosecond-long laser pulses into the tissue, and when three photons converge at the same time and place, the photons interact with the nonlinear optical properties of the tissue. Through well-known phenomena in optics called second and third harmonic generation, these interactions produce a single photon. Learn More: Brain tumors: Mapping of motor areas in the brain by magnetic stimulation The key is that the incoming and outgoing photons have different wavelengths. The incoming photons are at 1200 nanometers, long enough to penetrate deep into the tissue. The single photon that is produced, however, is at 600 or 400 nanometers, depending on if it's second or third harmonic generation. The shorter wavelengths mean the photon can scatter in the tissue. The scattered photon thus contains information about the tissue, and when it reaches a detector, in this case a high-sensitivity GaAsP photomultiplier tube, it reveals what the tissue looks like inside. While other researchers have exploited this technique for other applications to make images of insects and fish embryos, for example this is the first time anyone has used it to analyze glial brain tumors. These tumors are particularly deadly because it's hard to get rid of tumor cells by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy without substantial collateral damage to the surrounding brain tissue. The researchers tested their method on samples of glial brain tumors from humans, finding that the histological detail in these images was as good if not better than those made with conventional staining techniques. They were able to make most images in under a minute. The smaller ones took less than a second, while larger images of a few square millimeters took five minutes. ""This makes it possible to do it in real time in the operating room,"" Groot said. Don't Miss: Discovery could prevent the development of brain tumors in children Now that they've shown their approach works, the researchers are developing a hand-held device that a surgeon can use to identify a tumor's border during surgery. The incoming laser pulses can only reach a depth of about 100 micrometers into the tissue. To reach farther, Groot envisions attaching a needle that can pierce the tissue and deliver photons deeper. ""With our technique it's potentially possible to diagnose not only during an operation but possibly before surgery,"" she said. The Optical Society   press release Kuzmin NV et al.

New research at Rice University suggests actin filaments that control the shape of neuron cells may also be the key to the molecular machinery that forms and stores long-term memories. See Also: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth The Rice lab of theoretical biological physicist Peter Wolynes reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences a theory about how long-term memories are made; the theory is based on simulations that analyze the energy landscapes of the proteins involved. Wolynes and his colleagues are pioneers in the development of an energy landscape theory for proteins, which enables them to build computer models of proteins to predict how they will fold. These molecular-dynamics simulations employ the principle of minimal frustration by which proteins find their most stable folded forms. For long-term memories, stability is desirable. Wolynes and his co-authors, Rice graduate student Mingchen Chen and postdoctoral researcher Weihua Zheng, determined the path to encoding memories may lie in the way actin filaments the ""muscle"" part of the cytoskeleton in every eukaryotic cell pull upon and stabilize soluble cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEB) into longer, insoluble prion-like fibers. A Rice University computer simulation shows how actin pulls upon and stabilizes soluble proteins known as CPEB into longer, insoluble prion-like fibers, a process believed to be key to stabilizing long-term memories. Credit:  Mingchen Chen/Rice University  Prions are proteins that, when they misfold, are thought to become self-propagating and cause infectious diseases like mad cow disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other disorders. But their very existence and the transitions known to take place in synapses suggest properly folded prions must have a biological function, the researchers wrote. These transitions were the focus of their study. CPEB proteins, when made in cells, first bind a few at a time in oligomers, which are coiled alpha helices. The intrinsic energy landscapes of these oligomers allow mechanical forces provided by actin to prompt a transition into longer beta strands that are much more stable. These now-stable fibers are thought to aggregate and encode memories in neurons' synaptic regions. Wolynes said Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, was onto something 20 years ago when he wrote about memory and molecular turnover. Crick puzzled over the fact that memories tend to last much longer than proteins typically do in living cells. ""Crick slightly anticipates, in one sentence, that perhaps what we have is a form of protein that aggregates somewhere,"" he said. ""By virtue of being an aggregate, it's not able to move. In that way it would be able to mark one particular synapse. Learn More: Researchers switch emotion linked to memory ""It's obviously very difficult to study the molecular basis of memory because memory involves a fairly complex activity,"" Wolynes said. ""You can't study it in a bacterium. You have to study it in some sort of organism that can learn. ""At the same time, it's clear that forming memories involves some very high-order neural processing and other things at the subcellular level in order to store the large amount of information you memorize. There are many steps in memory that are really not understood at all."" He said previous research shows that memories make changes in the synapse, the thousands of regions in each neuron responsible for sending electrical and chemical signals to other neurons. ""Short-term memories that last less than an hour or so seem to be done through the electrical and direct biochemical circuitry. Forming these memories doesn't seem to require creating new protein,"" Wolynes said. Researchers who conducted experiments with sea slugs poisoned to prevent them from synthesizing proteins seemed to confirm that, he said. ""They found these snails were able to memorize things for short periods of time but not for periods of hours when protein synthesis was stopped."" Chen, who led the Rice research, knew from the literature that actin has the ability to bind oligomeric CPEB. This fact, along with the computer simulation, suggests that the mechanical force provided by actin can restructure CPEB into a longer fiber with new hydrogen bonds between the coils. Wolynes said that the restructuring not only forces CPEB to a lower-energy, prion-like state, but also allows the prion to bind an RNA sequence that otherwise prevents more actin from being synthesized. The resulting feedback loop further stabilizes the memory. ""We still don't understand the beginning of the process, how you go from short-term to long-term memory,"" he said. ""But we can now see that actin starts to form in a particular location in response to electrical signals. The actin then takes any CPEB oligomers that are around and activates them, which makes more actin and causes the formation of a self-replicating prion of the CPEB. That prion aggregates until it stops, changing the structure of the synapse in a way that should last for a very long period of time, perhaps decades."" Related: Prion protein protects against epilepsy Wolynes said he put Chen on the job with few expectations. ""I give starting students a project I think will teach them the tools we use to look at protein dynamics,"" he said. ""It's usually a somewhat far-outish project, and if they don't get anywhere, I won't feel sad. ""So I said, 'Why don't we look at this protein that (Eric) Kandel and (Susan) Linquist said was involved in memory, this CPEB protein.'"" Wolynes said many neurobiologists have followed up on that pioneering work with sea slugs. ""But we add a new element by being able to look at the structures of these proteins and to predict the thermodynamics of the process,"" he said. ""We now can see how the force of the cytoskeleton can complete a feedback loop that allows the memories to be preserved.""

Did you then forget what it is you were going to say? A study of the brain's electrical activity offers a new explanation of how that happens. Published in Nature Communications, the study comes from the lab of neuroscientist Adam Aron at the University of California (UC), San Diego, together with collaborators at Oxford University in the UK, and was led by first author Jan Wessel, while a post-doctoral scholar in the Aron Lab. The researchers suggest that the same brain system that is involved in interrupting, or stopping, movement in our bodies also interrupts cognition which, in the example of the phone ringing, derails your train of thought. See Also: Electric current to brain boosts memory The findings may give insights into Parkinson's disease, said Aron, a professor of psychology in the UC San Diego Division of Social Sciences, and Wessel, now an assistant professor of psychology and neurology at the University of Iowa. The disease can cause muscle tremors as well as slowed-down movement and facial expression. Parkinson's patients may also present as the ""opposite of distractible,"" often with a thought stream so stable that it can seem hard to interrupt. The same brain system that is implicated in ""over-stopping"" motor activity in these patients, Aron said, might be also be keeping them over-focused. The current study focuses particularly on one part of the brain's stopping system the subthalamic nucleus (STN). This is a small lens-shaped cluster of densely packed neurons in the midbrain and is part of the basal ganglia system. A reconstruction of deep brain stimulation electrodes that have been surgically placed into the most common target structure for treatment of Parkinson's disease, the subthalamic nucleus (orange). The STN is part of the brain's stopping system and is a particular focus of this study. Credit: Andreashorn, Wikimedia Commons  Earlier research by Aron and colleagues had shown that the STN is engaged when action stopping is required. Specifically, it may be important, Aron said, for a ""broad stop."" A broad stop is the sort of whole-body jolt we experience when, for example, we're just about to exit an elevator and suddenly see that there's another person standing right there on the other side of the doors. The study analyzes signals from the scalp in 20 healthy subjects as well as signals from electrode implants in the STN of seven people with Parkinson's disease. (The STN is the main target for therapeutic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease). Learn More: When memories age: Neuroscientists follow the trace of memory All the volunteers were given a working memory task. On each trial, they were asked to hold in mind a string of letters, and then tested for recall. Most of the time, while they were maintaining the letters in mind, and before the recall test, they were played a simple, single-frequency tone. On a minority of trials, this sound was replaced by a birdsong segment which is not startling like a ""bang!"" but is unexpected and surprising, like a cell phone chirping suddenly. The volunteers' brain activity was recorded, as well as their accuracy in recalling the letters they'd been shown. The results show, the researchers write, that unexpected events manifest the same brain signature as outright stopping of the body. They also recruit the STN. And the more the STN was engaged - or the more that part of the brain responded to the unexpected sound - the more it affected the subjects' working memory and the more they lost hold of what they were trying to keep in mind. ""For now,"" said Wessel, ""we've shown that unexpected, or surprising, events recruit the same brain system we use to actively stop our actions, which, in turn, appears to influence the degree to which such surprising events affect our ongoing trains of thought."" A role for the STN in stopping the body and interrupting working memory does fit anatomical models of how the nucleus is situated within circuitry in the brain. Yet more research is needed, the researchers write, to determine if there's a causal link between the activity observed in the STN and the loss in working memory. Related: Working memory: Underlying processes are more complex than we thought ""An unexpected event appears to clear out what you were thinking,"" Aron said. ""The radically new idea is that just as the brain's stopping mechanism is involved in stopping what we're doing with our bodies it might also be responsible for interrupting and flushing out our thoughts."" A possible future line of investigation, Aron said, is to see if the STN and associated circuitry plays a role in conditions characterized by distractibility, like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ""This is highly speculative,"" he said, ""but it could be fruitful to explore if the STN is more readily triggered in ADHD."" Wessel added: ""It might also be potentially interesting to see if this system could be engaged deliberately - and actively used to interrupt intrusive thoughts or unwanted memories."" If further research bears out the connection suggested by the current study, between the STN and losing your train of thought following an unexpected event, the researchers say it might be that it is an adaptive feature of the brain, something we evolved long ago as a way to clear our cognition and re-focus on something new. Aron suggests this example: You're walking along one morning on the African Savannah, going to gather firewood. You're daydreaming about the meal you're going to prepare when you hear a rustle in the grass. You make a sudden stop - and all thoughts of dinner are gone as you shift your focus to figure out what might be in the grass.

Now, a new study from NYU Langone Medical Center may provide hope for symptomatic relief for some of the cognitive issues associated with the neurological disease. In a randomized controlled trial, people with MS who used a computer-based cognitive remediation training program at home for 12 weeks had significantly higher cognitive test scores than those who used a placebo computer program. The new research was presented April 17 at the American Academy of Neurology's 68th Annual Meeting in Vancouver. See Also: Coffee consumption habits impact the risk of mild cognitive impairment ""This trial demonstrates that computer-based cognitive remediation accessed from home can be effective in improving cognitive symptoms for individuals with MS,"" says lead study author Leigh Charvet, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Neurology, and director of MS Research at NYU Langone's Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. ""The remote delivery of an at-home test and findings of cognitive benefit may also be generalizable to other neurological conditions in which cognitive function is compromised."" Cognitive problems in MS may impact memory, attention and concentration, information processing, verbal fluency and executive functioning, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Problems people with MS may experience include difficulty finding the right words and keeping up in conversations, or trouble remembering routines at home or work. These changes may be linked to atrophy and volume loss in the brain's grey matter, according to the researchers. Previous studies showed that cognitive remediation or training programs to reverse cognitive declines, offer potential benefits for people with MS. But, to ensure maximum benefit, many of these programs require in-person treatment sessions in an outpatient setting multiple times a week for at least an hour. This can prove difficult for those with MS who are not able to take time off from jobs, or those with disease-associated disability who cannot easily get to a physician's office. To test the efficacy of an at-home cognitive remediation treatment intervention, 135 people with MS who were experiencing cognitive problems were randomized to receive either the active, computerized training program (71 participants) or a placebo program with ordinary computer games (64 participants). The cognitive remediation training program used in the study was a research version of Posit Science's Brain HQ, in which patients are instructed to play a series of games and tasks. Participants in both groups were asked to train for one hour per day, five days a week for 12 weeks. Technical support and weekly coaching sessions were provided by a study technician. People with MS who engaged in cognitive remediation through Brain HQ improved 29 percent on neuropsychological tests, compared to 15 percent improvement for those in the placebo group. While improvement was noted across a range of specific cognitive measures in the active group, there were no improvements measured in activities of daily living.

The breakthrough explains what happens when a toxin produced by Scorpio maurus   a scorpion species found in North Africa and the Middle East   permeates the cell membrane. They also report why the toxin loses its potency once inside cells and may actually become healthful.  This is the first time a toxin has been shown to chemically reprogram once inside a cell, becoming something that may be beneficial,  said Isaac Pessah, a professor of molecular biosciences at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.  Being able to understand how this family of toxins lose their toxicity and become pharmacologically beneficial by changing activity towards the calcium channel target inside the cell is what s novel and may have translational significance.  Calcium is key to cellular activity The controlled release of calcium is a key step in many cellular processes.  In any cell you can think of, calcium plays a role in shaping responses, activating or inhibiting enzymes, changing the shape of the cell or triggering cell division,  Pessah said. Calcium also is a key signal in both fertilization and programmed cell death. And, altered calcium regulation is a common step in many animal and human diseases. Pharmaceuticals that regulate cellular calcium homeostasis range from drugs for suppressing the immune system in organ transplant patients, to treatments for high blood pressure and heart disease. Investigating a paradox Several years ago, Pessah began working with researchers from the Institute for Neurosciences in Grenoble France and the Pasteur Institute in Tunisia to isolate a specific toxin peptide called maurocalcin, which targets a calcium channel called the ryanodine receptor inside the cell. Maurocalcin is quite unusual in that it readily permeates into cells, while most other peptide toxins target more accessible receptors on the cell s surface.  We therefore thought maurocalcin should be very toxic, since we previously showed that very low concentrations can completely stabilize an open (toxic) state of the ryanodine receptor and thereby upset a cell s calcium balance,  Pessah said. Maurocalcin, however, was seemingly benign once inside cells. Intrigued, the researchers set out to find the reason for this paradox. They discovered that once inside the cell, maurocalcin was modified by an enzymatic reaction called phosphorylation, a common cellular  switch  that normally turns reactions inside cells on or off by adding a phosphate group to a precise position on proteins. Potential toxin reprogrammed This is the first example of a scorpion peptide being subjected to such modification once inside a mammalian cell. Phosphorylation of maurocalcin was found to completely reprogram its activity from that of a potential toxin to a potentially useful pharmacological tool.  This is the real twist of nature,  Pessah said.  The toxic peptide is not supposed to get inside cells, but it does, and then is phosphorylated, which not only neutralizes its toxicity but also reprograms its activity to be beneficial.  The research team further tested the plausibility and molecular details responsible for pharmacological reprogramming by synthesizing artificial  phosphomimics,  and studying their three-dimensional structures and how they modified ryanodine receptor channels. Identifying the best synthetic substitutes for maurocalcin could pave the way for a novel strategy to control ryanodine receptor channels that leak calcium. Leaky ryanodine receptor channels are known to contribute to a number of human and animal diseases of genetic and/or environmental origins.","Published: April 18, 2016"

These sugar compounds selectively provide incredible nutrient support specifically for the growth of the infant gut microbes,  said lead researcher David Mills, a professor of food science and technology at UC Davis. Advancing earlier discoveries In previous studies, Mills and colleagues had shown that glycoproteins from human milk may be a source of sugar for the beneficial microbes in the infant gut. Glycoproteins are compounds with both protein and sugar molecules called oligosaccharides. The researchers also had earlier demonstrated that one such gut microbe   a bacterial subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis)   produced an enzyme called EndoBI-1 that could split the oligosaccharides away from the glycoproteins. But there was no definitive answer as to whether it was the sugar or the protein components of the glycoproteins that were supporting growth of B. infantis. New findings In the new study, the researchers set out to determine whether the oligosaccharides could, as they suspected, be a sole nutrient source for B. infantis in the infant gut. They used the EndoBI-1 enzyme to separate the oligosaccharides from the glycoproteins found in bovine colostrum   the  first milk  produced by a lactating cow. Cow s milk was used for the study because it was readily available in significant volumes. The researchers found that oligosaccharides separated out from the cow s colostrum fueled rapid growth of the B. infantis bacterium. However, the oligosaccharides from the cow s milk did not support growth of a related bacterium found in the intestines of adult humans. The study also showed that B. infantis did not grow on milk proteins from which the sugars had been separated out, clearly indicating that the oligosaccharides were the compounds that fed those specific bacteria. Mills noted that B. infantis has many genes that are involved with breaking down glycoproteins in mother s milk in order to release the oligosaccharides.  Mother s milk co-evolved over millions of years with mammals and the beneficial gut microbiota that the milk helped nourish,  he said.  And milk is the only food that co-evolved with humans to make us healthy.  In addition to solving the protein-or-sugar question related to the role of glycoproteins in feeding B. infantis, the findings also suggest that cow s milk could be a source of selective oligosaccharides, which might be used to make therapeutic prebiotics for infants.","Published: April 18, 2016"

The FDA has approved several DAA therapies that act by inhibiting NS5A, most recently Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) for the treatment of HCV in adults with genotypes 1 or 4 infections, in January 2016, and Daklinza  (daclatasvir), in combination with sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of patients with genotypes 1 or 3, in July 2015.

Their study sheds light on how cancer cells and normal cells communicate with each other, and could open up new approaches to cancer treatment. The research was published in the prestigious journal Cell on Thursday 14 April 2016, and was funded by the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK and the Rosetrees Trust. Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute based at The University of Manchester found that faulty versions of the KRAS gene   often mutated in cancer   can have an important effect on healthy tissue. Normal KRAS makes occasional signals that tell a cell to divide, but when mutated the gene becomes hyperactive and helps drive cancer cells  rapid and uncontrolled growth. In the new study, researchers found that mutated KRAS also plays an important role in turning healthy  stromal cells  into cancer s allies. The study showed for the first time that there is a communication loop with a cancer-causing gene controlling cancer via healthy stromal cells. Neighbours 'bullied' The researchers studied communication networks in cells from a type of pancreatic cancer called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma   one of the most deadly forms of cancer, responsible for around 9,000 deaths each year in the UK. KRAS is mutated in more than 90% of pancreatic cancer and in nearly 20% of all cancers. The team studied thousands of different growth factors, proteins and receptors across different pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells to see how signals were being transmitted. They recognised well-known pathways that KRAS uses to communicate with neighbouring healthy cells, but also noticed something unusual. By monitoring proteins in the two cells at the same time, they discovered that healthy cells were responding with a totally new message   a message that doubled the capacity for KRAS to drive malignant behaviour in the cancer cells. Study author Dr Chris Tape, Sir Henry Wellcome Research Fellow at the ICR, said:  What our research underlines is that cancer cells do not drive the growth and spread of tumours alone   they can bully their healthy neighbours into helping them.  Some pancreatic tumours have more healthy stromal cells within them than they do cancer cells, so understanding how cancer cells turn their neighbours into allies is critically important. We have discovered exactly how cancer cells can persuade stromal tissue to secrete key growth signals, and in doing so opened up exciting new possibilities for treatment."" Dr Claus Jorgensen, who led the research at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and is now a junior group leader at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester said:  We now know that tumours are a complex mix of genetically diverse cancer cells and multiple types of healthy cells, all communicating with each other via an intricate web of interactions.  Untangling this web, and decoding individual signals, is vital to identify which of the multitude of communications are most important for controlling tumour growth and spread.

The Cell Press journal, Cell Host & Microbe, published the findings today in its advance online edition.  The Zika virus has undergone significant genetic changes in the past 70 years,  explained senior author Genhong Cheng, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  By tracing its genetic mutations, we aimed to understand how the virus is transmitted from person to person and how it causes different types of disease.  First isolated in 1947, the Zika virus only sporadically caused disease in Africa and Asia until the 2007 Micronesia and 2013 French Polynesia outbreaks. Scientists previously believed that infection was spread solely by mosquitoes and caused only mild illnesses.  The latest epidemic has linked the virus to fetal brain-development disorders and Guillain-Barre syndrome. New modes of transmission, including infection through sexual contact and from mother to  fetus, have also surfaced.  We don t know why Zika infection was not associated with serious human disease, especially in newborns, until recently,  said co-author Dr. Stephanie Valderramos, a fellow in obstetrics-gynecology at the Geffen School.  We hoped that taking a closer look at the virus  genetic changes over time would reveal clues to this mystery.  Cheng s laboratory collaborated with researchers at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College in Beijing to compare individual genetic differences among 41 strains of Zika virus. Thirty strains originated from humans, 10 from mosquitoes and one from monkeys.  In sequencing the virus, the team identified substantial DNA changes between the strains, showing a major split between the Asian and African lineages, as well as the human and mosquito versions.   We suspect these mutations could help the virus replicate more efficiently, evade the body s immune response or invade new tissues that provide a safe harbor for it to spread,  said co-author Lulan Wang, a graduate student researcher in Cheng s laboratory.","Published: April 18, 2016"

The discovery is being published in a study today in the journal Cell Reports. It was made by combining several data sets from patients in two large health-tracking studies, the Nurses  Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Researchers first performed whole-exome sequencing on colorectal tumor samples from 619 patients   itemizing each letter of DNA that specifies how cell proteins are to be constructed. This information was merged with data from tests of the immune system s response to the tumors and with patient clinical data, including length of survival.        We were looking for genetic features that predict how extensively a tumor is infiltrated by lymphocytes [certain white blood cells] and which types of lymphocytes are present,  said study co-lead author, Marios Giannakis, MD, PhD, medical oncologist and clinical investigator at the Dana-Farber Gastrointestinal Cancer Treatment Center, and researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.  We found that tumors with a high  neoantigen load    which carry large quantities of neoantigens   tended to be infiltrated by a large number of lymphocytes, including memory T cells, which provide protection against previously encountered infections and diseases. Patients whose tumors had high numbers of neoantigens also survived longer than those with lower neoantigen loads.  Neoantigens are deviant forms of protein antigens, which are found on normal cells. Genetic mutations often cause cancer cells to produce abnormal proteins, some of which get lifted to the cell surface, where they serve as a red flag to the immune system that something is amiss with the cell.          There can be hundreds or thousands of neoantigens on tumor cells,  Giannakis explained.  Only a few of these may actually provoke T cells to infiltrate a tumor. But the more neoantigens on display, the greater the chance that some of them will spark an immune system response.  Therapies known as immune checkpoint inhibitors work by removing some of the barriers to an immune system attack on cancer. Although these agents have produced astonishing results in some cases, they re generally effective only in patients whose immune system has already launched an immune response to cancer. By showing that tumors with high antigen loads are apt to be laced with T cells   and therefore to have provoked an immune response   the study may help investigators identify which patients are most likely to benefit in new clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study s genomic analysis of colorectal tumor samples also found several often-mutated genes that had not previously been strongly associated with the disease, including BCL9L, RBM10, CTCF, and KLF5. The discovery of their prevalence in colorectal cancer suggests that they may be valuable targets for new therapies.          Our study helps shed light on the overall development of colorectal cancer,  Giannakis remarked.  It also shows the insights that can be gained by integrating molecular research with findings from other areas such as epidemiology and immunology. ","Published: April 18, 2016"

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-protein-that-spreads-cancer-186880,A Protein that Spreads Cancer Nils Halberg at the University of Bergen has identified a protein that makes it possible for cancer cells to spread  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The cells inside a tumour differ a lot. While some remains  good  and do not cause trouble, others become aggressive and starts to spread to other organ sites. It is very hard to predict which cells become aggressive or not. Nevertheless, by isolating these aggressive cancer cells in in vivotests on animals, Nils Halberg at the Department of Biomedicinet the University of Bergen (UiB) and the researchers Dr. Sohail Tavazoie and Dr. Caitlin Sengelaub at The Rockefeller University have discovered a certain protein (PITPNC1) that characterise aggressive cancer cells.  We discovered that the aggressive cancer cells that are spreading in colon, breast, and skin cancer contained a much higher portion of the protein PITPNC1, than the non-aggressive cancer cells,  says researcher Nils Halberg of the CELLNET Group at the Department of Biomedicine at UiB.  This means we can predict which of the cancer cells are getting aggressive and spread, at a much earlier stage than today.  How cells penetrate tissue The researcher also discovered that this protein, that characterizes the aggressive cancer cells, has got a very specific function in the process of spreading cancer. The cancer cells spread from one place in the body to another, through the blood vessel. To get into the blood vessels, the cell needs to penetrate tissue, both when it leaves the tumour and when it is attaching to a new organ.  The protein PITPNC1 regulates a process whereby the cancer cells are secreting molecules, which cut through a network of proteins outside the cells, like scissors. The cancer cell is then able to penetrate the tissue and set up a colonies at new organ sites,  Halberg explains. Custom-made therapy A tumour that is not spreading, is usually not dangerous for the patient if it is removed. The hard part in cancer therapy is when the tumour starts to spread. Guided by the new discoveries, supported by the Bergen Research Foundation s (BFS) Recruitment Programme, Halberg hopes to contribute to a better treatment of cancer patients.  If we get to the point where we can offer a custom-made therapy that targets the function of this protein, we might be able to stop it spreading,  says Nils Halberg.","Published: April 18, 2016"

The Penn team also found that patients with this genetic variation had a slower rate of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, and lower amounts of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Alpha-synuclein is a protein that experts know plays a role in the development of Parkinson's disease. See Also: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity Clinicians have long noted that the presence of tremors, rather than balance and walking problems, as the initial or dominant symptom of Parkinson's may suggest slower progression of the disease. The Penn-led study is one of the first to link this difference to a specific genetic variation. Tremor-dominant patients are also less likely to develop dementia, although this symptom was not assessed in the study. The finding is to be presented at the 68th Annual Meeting of American Academy of Neurology taking place April 15-21 in Vancouver, BC. ""We have never understood the reason why some people present with more tremor vs. walking/balance difficulties in Parkinson's disease,"" said the study's lead author, Christine Cooper, MD, a fellow in movement disorders at Penn Medicine. ""This finding gives us information, for the first time, that has implications for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention efforts."" In the study, the investigators ranked 251 Parkinson's disease patients at the University of Pennsylvania Health System on tremor and balance/walking scores. They then looked at the patients' genotypes to see if there were correlations between ten genetic variations previously associated with Parkinson's disease and the primary symptoms that the patients displayed. The researchers found that 39 of the 251 patients who had a genetic variation known as the GG genotype at the rs356182 SNP 3' to the SNCA gene were more likely to have: 1) tremors rather than walking/balance problems; 2) slower physical progression of the disease; and 3) lower levels of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Patients were followed up to seven years in some cases. The investigators carried out the same type of analysis with an additional group of 559 patients at three other clinical sites in the United States and found similar results for the association between the genotype and the type of PD symptoms. Learn More: Disputed theory on Parkinson's origin strengthened ""This is how we can start thinking about precision medicine in action,"" said the study's senior author, Alice S. Chen-Plotkin, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at Penn. ""We found that a relatively common genetic variation can both serve as a biomarker for and influence the disease course of Parkinson's patients. This opens up the possibility of achieving a hallmark of precision medicine: targeted therapies for different 'versions' of what was once thought to be a single disease."" Single nucleotide polymorphisms (or SNPs) of the kind the Penn-led team investigated are the most widespread kind of genetic variation among people. There are about 10 million of them in the human genome (often found in the DNA between genes), and most have no effect on health or development. But when SNPs occur within a gene or in a regulatory region near a gene, they may play a more active role in disease by affecting the gene's function. The investigators found that this indeed may be the case in Parkinson's patients with the GG genotype, a relatively common SNP near the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene. The human alpha-synuclein protein is made of 140 amino acids and is encoded by the SNCA gene. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy bodies, which are clumps of protein that develop inside nerve cells in Parkinson's disease and some other disorders.

Details of the particles  design and their potency against cancer in mice were published PNAS. They have not been tested in humans, although similar ways of packaging cisplatin have been in clinical trials. What makes these particles distinctive is that they start out relatively large -- 100 nanometers wide   to enable smooth transport into the tumor through leaky blood vessels. Then, in acidic conditions found close to tumors, the particles discharge ""bomblets"" just 5 nanometers in size. Inside tumor cells, a second chemical step activates the platinum-based cisplatin, which kills by crosslinking and damaging DNA. Doctors have used cisplatin to fight several types of cancer for decades, but toxic side effects   to the kidneys, nerves and inner ear -- can limit its effectiveness. The PNAS paper is the result of a collaboration between a team led by professor Jun Wang, PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China, and researchers led by professor Shuming Nie, PhD in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory. Nie is a member of the Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics research program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. The lead authors are graduate student Hong-Jun Li and postdoctoral fellows Jinzhi Du, PhD and Xiao-Jiao Du, PhD. ""The negative side effects of cisplatin are a long-standing limitation for conventional chemotherapy,"" says Jinzhi Du. ""In our study, the delivery system was able to improve tumor penetration to reach more cancer cells, as well as release the drugs specifically inside cancer cells through their size-transition property."" The researchers showed that their nanoparticles could enhance cisplatin drug accumulation in tumor tissues. When mice bearing human pancreatic tumors were given the same doses of free cisplatin or cisplatin clothed in pH-sensitive nanoparticles, the level of platinum in tumor tissues was seven times higher with the nanoparticles. This suggests the possibility that nanoparticle delivery of a limited dose of cisplatin could restrain the toxic side effects during cancer treatment. The researchers also showed that the nanoparticles were effective against a cisplatin-resistant lung cancer model and an invasive metastatic breast cancer model in mice. In the lung cancer model, a dose of free cisplatin yielded just 10 percent growth inhibition, while the same dose clothed in nanoparticles yielded 95 percent growth inhibition, the researchers report. In the metastatic breast cancer model, treating mice with cisplatin clothed in nanoparticles prolonged animal survival by weeks; 50 percent of the mice were surviving at 54 days with nanoparticles compared with 37 days for the same dose of free cisplatin. Enhanced efficacy in three different tumor models demonstrate that this strategy may be applicable to several types of cancer, Jinzhi Du says.","Published: April 16, 2016"

Researchers with UT Southwestern s Harry S. Moss Heart Center were able to unravel the molecular workings behind enzymes called HDACs that are known to spur the spread of cancer. Inhibiting them can also blunt excess enlargement of heart muscle cells, a condition known as cardiac hypertrophy. The findings suggest that drugs currently used to inhibit these enzymes in cancer may also be effective in treating enlargement of the heart muscle, the researchers reported.  This work opens the possibility of repurposing a drug that has been in use in cancer treatment for over a decade to target hypertrophic heart disease, a form of heart disease for which we have no effective therapy,  said senior author Dr. Joseph Hill, Chief of Cardiology and Director of the Harry S. Moss Heart Center at UT Southwestern.  We hope eventually to test this idea in clinical trials. Doing so is the Holy Grail for a physician-scientist   to translate fundamental molecular discoveries made in preclinical studies to humans.  High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can cause the heart muscle to work harder, resulting in the expansion of heart cells, which causes the walls of the heart to thicken. The condition, known as cardiac hypertrophy, can lead to heart failure if not stopped. Symptoms of cardiac hypertrophy can include shortness of breath, fatigue, fainting, and chest pain.  This work strengthens our emerging understanding of commonalities between cancer and heart disease,  said Dr. Hill, who holds the James T. Willerson, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Diseases and the Frank M. Ryburn, Jr. Chair in Heart Research.  In some cells, disruption of a molecular pathway can lead to cancer, whereas perturbations of that same pathway in heart cells can lead to heart failure. Thus, there are interesting and sometimes surprising commonalities across the biologies of cancer and heart disease.  Dr. Hill s lab, which studies cardiac hypertrophy, has focused on alterations in the processing of DNA, the blueprint of all cells, in heart disease. Recently, his group has found that targeting processes known to be disrupted in cancer can confer benefit in heart disease. The group of enzymes targeted in this study are known as class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs), which help regulate the replication and repair of DNA. HDACs can spur the growth of cancer cells. Drugs that inhibit this ability halt or slow the spread of cancer cells. In this study, researchers unraveled the molecular processes at work behind the scenes of those processes, and found that suppressing HDACs also suppressed the activity of a critical molecule called mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), which regulates the growth of cells. Mice that had been genetically altered to shut off HDAC activity reduced mTOR activity and slowed the enlargement of cardiac muscle cells. The work went on to decipher the molecular circuitry linking HDAC activity and mTOR.  HDAC inhibitors are approved to treat various cancers, and our results suggest how these drugs might work when repurposed to prevent heart failure,  said lead author Dr. Cyndi Morales, a postdoctoral researcher with the Harry S. Moss Heart Center. The work also adds to a growing understanding that epigenetic mechanisms, which are external factors that govern DNA expression, are a fruitful area of research for heart disease, said Dr. Hill, Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Biology. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. in both men and women, with more than 600,000 Americans dying of heart disease annually, or one in four deaths each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The finding in a 71-year-old man triggers a realization about HIV survivors now reaching the age when Alzheimer's risk begins to escalate. Published in journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring, neurologist R. Scott Turner, MD, PhD, diagnosed the patient after a PET scan showed deposition of amyloid in the brain. Until this point, Turner says, clinicians thought that individuals with HIV may not develop AD because HIV-related inflammation in the brain may prevent amyloid clumps from forming. Learn More: Why HIV patients develop dementia ""This patient may be a sentinel case that disputes what we thought we knew about dementia in HIV-positive individuals,"" says Turner, who leads the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. In addition, Turner says the finding suggests that some older HIV-positive patients with dementia may be misdiagnosed with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) when they may be developing AD. It also may be possible that some patients experience HAND and AD -- a new type of mixed dementia, Turner says. ""Chronic HIV infection and amyloid deposition with aging may represent a ""double-hit"" to the brain that results in progressive dementia."" ""While it may be challenging to diagnose the cause of dementia in an HIV-positive patient, the diagnosis matters because HAND and AD are treated differently,"" he says. ""For Alzheimer's disease, we now have four FDA-approved drugs and more effective treatments are on the way. For HAND, we prescribe anti-retroviral drugs that have a better chance of penetrating the brain. So getting a correct diagnosis is important, and a critical first step in advancing the field."" See Also: Timeline for HIV replication in the brain identified HAND will develop in 30-50 percent of individuals with long-term HIV infections. But HAND symptoms are identical to those with AD, Turner says. He adds, ""The medical community assumes that dementia with HIV is caused by HAND. Physicians haven't considered Alzheimer's, so it's possible that a number of older HIV-positive individuals may be misdiagnosed."" Published studies to date point to only five individuals with HAND who have undergone amyloid PET imaging, and all were negative; however, the oldest of these patients was 67, Turner says. Diagnosis of dementia in older HIV-infected individuals is on the rise. HIV-infected adults over 55 comprise the fastest growing age group in the HIV-positive population. According to the most recent CDC HIV Surveillance Report with data through 2013, 53,000 people in the U.S. living with HIV are 65 and older, the age when Alzheimer's disease risk begins to escalate. That number is expected to double in less than 10 years and doesn't include those who have not been diagnosed. Worldwide, more than 37 million people are living with HIV.

Identifying how a cell responds to a signal made by another cell, despite the level of noise present, may improve our understanding of developmental disorders. See Also: Cracking the code of brain development Thomas F. Schilling, professor of developmental & cell biology, and his colleagues, published this study online at eLife. During development, RA is an important secreted molecule that aids in the proper organization of the brain. The cellular response to RA depends upon its concentration, which is determined by its production, movement through tissue and interactions with many proteins within the cell. During normal development, cells can filter the ""noise"" in RA levels and establish appropriate brain organization. Schilling and study lead author Julian Sosnik wanted to measure the fluctuations in RA and determine how cells respond to the proper amount despite the presence of constant noise. To accomplish this, they used fluorescence lifetime imaging to exploit the auto-fluorescent nature of RA and measure its distribution across the developing zebrafish embryo. The team found that RA forms a gradient in the embryo, with a lower concentration at the head. They also observed that a large amount of noise exists within the RA gradient. Learn More: Researchers observe brain development in utero They identified one protein within developing cells that interacts with RA to help reduce the noise. When this protein was altered, cells could no longer control the level of noise within the RA gradient, which led to disruptions in brain organization. With this, the researchers concluded that noise reduction within cells is critical for the proper response to the RA gradient and normal organization of the brain. Future studies will employ new transgenic technologies to examine levels of noise in the expression of genes responding to RA in developing brain cells and address potential beneficial roles for noise in helping switch cells from one type to another in this system.

The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. See Also: New treatment for neuropathy? How cone snail venom minimizes pain Peripheral nerve damage is a common condition affecting nearly 8 million people in the United States, but until now a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms has held back the development of treatments. Drugs exist for the treatment of symptoms pain relievers, for instance but not for the condition itself, which can be caused by chemotherapy, diabetes, traumatic injury, heredity and other conditions. ""Our goal is to develop treatments that activate the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues,"" said Kevin Strange, PhD, president of the MDI Biological Laboratory. ""Sandra Rieger's research has advanced that mission by elucidating a mechanism underlying peripheral neuropathy, opening the door to the development of therapeutic agents that can reverse nerve damage linked to chemotherapy, and possibly diabetes and other conditions."" The MDI Biological Laboratory, located in Bar Harbor, Maine, is an independent, nonprofit biomedical research institution focused on increasing healthy lifespan and harnessing our natural ability to repair and regenerate tissues damaged by injury or disease. The institution develops solutions to human health problems through research, education and ventures that transform discoveries into cures. Rieger and other scientists working in the institution's Kathryn W. Davis Center for Regenerative Medicine study tissue repair, regeneration and aging in a diverse range of organisms that have robust mechanisms to repair and regenerate lost and damaged tissues. ""The general thinking is that no single drug can be effective for the treatment of all peripheral neuropathies, which stem from multiple causes,"" Rieger said. ""But our research indicates that there may potentially be a common underlying mechanism for some neuropathies affecting the sensory nervous system that could be manipulated with drugs targeting a single enzyme."" Rieger conducted her research in zebrafish exposed to paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent used for ovarian, breast, lung, pancreatic and other cancers. Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy affects the majority of treated patients; however, those who are most severely affected (about 30 percent) have to terminate chemotherapy or reduce the dose because of this condition, which can impact cancer survival. Rieger used zebrafish larvae to model peripheral neuropathy because the embryos develop rapidly and because the larval fish are translucent, making them ideal for studying the progression of nerve degeneration in live animals. Rieger's research showed that paclitaxel induces the degeneration of sensory nerve endings by damaging the outer layer of the skin, or epidermis. The epidermis is innervated by free sensory nerve endings that establish direct contact with skin cells. Her research showed that degeneration is caused by perturbations in the epidermis due to an increase in matrix-metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), an enzyme that degrades the collagen, or ""glue,"" between the cells. The increase in MMP-13 activity could be triggered by oxidative stress, which is also a hallmark of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Learn More: Researchers identify a new cause of inherited neuropathy In the research, Rieger treated the zebrafish with pharmacological agents that reduce MMP-13 activity, with the result that skin defects were improved and chemotherapy-induced nerve damage was reversed.

MMP-13 over-activation has also been linked to various other disease conditions, such as tendon injury, intestinal inflammatory and cancer, raising the possibility that drugs developed to treat peripheral neuropathy could yield other health benefits as well. The next step is to study the effect of MMP-13 on peripheral neuropathy in mammalian models. Studies are also underway in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to test the clinical relevance of these findings in humans.

For example, surgical treatment of acute appendicitis and arthroscopic surgery on degenerative knees have been called into question by recent research results reached by Finnish researchers. In neurosurgery, the evaluation of the success of treatment is challenging. Many patients undergoing surgery are either practically asymptomatic or extremely ill, meaning that the patient cannot him- or herself explain the impact of the surgery. See Also: Spinal surgery: Right on target Consequently, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) has been commonly used to evaluate outcome and even success of neurosurgical treatment. However, the scale was originally created to monitor the recovery process of stroke victims, not to assess the success of neurosurgery. The mRS runs from 0 to 6, and describes the patient's ability to function in broad terms, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 6 meaning that the patient is deceased. For example, a patient classified as mRS 2 exhibits slight disability, caused by whatever reason. At least three outcome studies on cerebrovascular surgery which resulted in significant changes to neurosurgical treatment everywhere in the world used the modified Rankin Scale to compare and evaluate treatment results. A study at the Department of Neurosurgery at the Helsinki University Hospital one of the largest neurosurgical units in the western world has now for the first time studied whether mRS is suitable for measuring the treatment results of brain surgery. ""We were astonished to see the results which indicate that mRS is very poorly suited to evaluating and reporting on the quality of neurosurgical treatment and related complications,"" says Dr. Elina Reponen, principal investigator and specialist in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine. Learn More: Touchless technology for vascular surgery is now being extended to neurosurgery According to the results, 24% of patients who underwent a normal procedure with no complications were classified with a worse mRS score 30 days after the procedure than before the surgery. This is to say that according to the mRS score, their ability to function decreased even when the treatment had been excellent and free from complications. On the other hand, 28% of patients who had experienced significant complications after surgery received an identical or better mRS score upon release. This means that the mRS score did not reflect the fact that the treatment may have been less than perfect and safe. ""The next suprise came when we found out how difficult it was to get these negative results published,"" Reponen says. The non-selective follow-up study monitored patients who underwent brain surgery at the Helsinki University Hospital during one year.

A newly discovered mechanism of color vision in mice might help answer this question, California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers say. Learn More: Bug eyes: Tiny glasses confirm 3D vision in insects The work, which was done in the laboratory of Markus Meister, Anne P. and Benjamin F. Biaggini Professor of Biological Sciences, is published in the journal Nature. In humans, vision is enabled by two types of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. When these photoreceptors detect light, they send a signal to specialized neurons in the retina called retinal ganglion cells, or RGCs, which then transmit visual information to the brain by firing electrical pulses along the optic nerve. A standard biology textbook would likely explain that vision in dim light is enabled by rods sensitive light detectors that are only capable of producing black and white vision. Color vision, on the other hand, is enabled by cones, which are active in bright light. Humans have three types of cones, and each cone contains a different light-sensitive chemical, or pigment, that reacts to different colors, or wavelengths, of light. We have red-, green-, and blue-sensitive cones, and the brain perceives color by comparing the different signals it receives from nearby cones of each type. To explore whether or not there were other modes of color vision, Meister and his team studied another mammal: the mouse. Previous behavioral studies indicated that mice are indeed capable of some form of color vision. As in humans, that vision is dependent on light signals picked up by cones. Mice have two types of cones one that is sensitive to medium-wavelength green light and one that is sensitive to short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UV). ""The odd thing about the mouse is that these two kinds of cones are actually located in different parts of the retina,"" Meister says. ""Mice look at the upper part of the visual field with their UV cones and the lower part with their green cones. We wanted to know how a mouse perceives color when any given part of the image is analyzed with only one cone or the other cone meaning the brain can't compare the two cone signals to determine a color."" The researchers discovered that a certain type of neuron in the mouse retina, called a JAMB retinal ganglion cell (J-RGC), was critical. These J-RGCs can signal color to the brain because they fire faster in response to green light and stop firing in response to ultraviolet light. Curiously, the J-RGCs were turned on by green light even in the upper part of the visual field, which contained no green cones. See Also: 'Brainbow' reveals startling data about visual connections in brain Through additional experiments, Meister and his team discovered how the J-RGC compares signals from the ultraviolet cones to signals from rods, which are also sensitive in the green part of the spectrum. This revealed, for the first time, an essential antagonistic relationship between the rods and the cones of the retina. Rods excite a neuron called a horizontal cell, which then inhibits the ultraviolet cones. Meister and his colleague, first author Maximilian Joesch from Harvard University, wanted to determine how this color vision system would be helpful to a mouse in its natural environment. To find out, they fitted a camera with filters that would replicate the wavelengths detected by the mouse rods and cones and used it to take images of plants and materials that a mouse might encounter in nature. Their photographic scavenger hunt yielded two materials seeds and mouse urine that were much more visible through the mouse's green and ultraviolet system than through human color vision. The researchers speculate that because mice need seeds for sustenance and use urine for social communication via ""urine posts,"" a form of territorial marking they might use this mechanism to find food and spot neighbors. Meister says there is reason to believe that this same pathway from rods to horizontal cells to cones is responsible for the human perception of the color blue in dim light. In the human retina, the horizontal cell preferentially inhibits the red and green cones, but not the blue cones. Learn More: Brain plasticity after vision loss has an  on-off switch  ""In really dim light, our cones don't receive enough photons to work, but they continue to emit a low-level baseline signal to the rest of the retina that is independent of light,"" he explains. ""The rods are active, however, and through the horizontal cell they inhibit both the red and green cones. Because this baseline signal from the red and green cones is suppressed, it looks like the blue cones are more active. To the rest of the retina, it seems like everything in the field of vision is blue."" So, perhaps Van Gogh's color choice for the night sky was a biological decision as well as an artistic one. ""Color has intrigued scientists, artists, and poets throughout human civilization. Our paper adds to the understanding of how this quality of the world is perceived,"" Meister says.

But exactly how such memory is formed is not well understood and remains, despite considerable research, a central question of inquiry in neuroscience. Neuroscientists at the University of California (UC), Riverside report in the Journal of Neuroscience that they now may have an answer to this question. Their study provides for the first time a mechanistic explanation for how deep sleep (also called slow-wave sleep) may be promoting the consolidation of recent memories. See Also: Sleep in a dish: Researchers isolate smallest unit of sleep to date During sleep, human and animal brains are primarily decoupled from sensory input. Nevertheless, the brain remains highly active, showing electrical activity in the form of sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus and large-amplitude slow oscillations in the cortex, reflecting alternating periods of active and silent states of cortical neurons during deep sleep. Traces of episodic memory acquired during wakefulness and initially stored in the hippocampus are progressively transferred to the cortex as long-term memory during sleep. Using a computational model, the UC Riverside researchers provide a link between electrical activity in the brain during deep sleep and synaptic connections between neurons. They show that patterns of slow oscillations in the cortex, which their model spontaneously generates, are influenced by the hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and that these patterns of slow oscillations determine synaptic changes in the cortex. (Change in synaptic strength is widely believed to underlie learning and memory storage in the brain). The model shows that the synaptic changes, in turn, affect the patterns of slow oscillations, promoting a kind of reinforcement and replay of specific firing sequences of the cortical neurons representing a replay of specific memory. ""These patterns of slow oscillations remain even without further input from the hippocampus,"" said Yina Wei, a postdoctoral researcher and the first author of the research paper. ""We interpret these results as a mechanistic explanation for the consolidation of specific memories during deep sleep, whereby the memory traces are formed in the cortex and become independent of the hippocampus."" Wei explained that according to the biologically realistic network model the researchers used, input from the hippocampus reaches the cortex during deep sleep and influences how the slow oscillations are initiated and propagated in the cortical network. ""Input from the hippocampus the sharp-wave ripples determines the spatial and temporal pattern of these slow oscillations,"" she said. ""By influencing the nature of these oscillations, this hippocampal input activates selective memories during deep sleep and causes a replay of specific memories. During such memory replay, the corresponding synapses are strengthened for long-term storage in the cortex. These results suggest the importance of the hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events in transferring memory information to the cortex.""

NREM sleep has three stages, Stage 3 being deep sleep. Deep sleep, which makes up at least 20 percent of a person's total sleep time, occurs mostly in the first third of the night. ""In our model, even weak and spatially localized input from the hippocampus influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of slow oscillations and led to a persistent change of synaptic efficacy between neurons,"" Wei said. ""Further, our model makes predictions that can be tested experimentally, including specific interventions to suppress or augment memory consolidation processes.""

Until now, the inflammation has been seen as a negative consequence that needs to be abolished as soon as possible. But, as it turns out, there are also some positive sides to the inflammation, and it can actually help the brain to self-repair. ""This is in total contrast to our previous beliefs"", says Professor Zaal Kokaia from Lund University in Sweden. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified Zaal Kokaia, together with Professor of Neurology Olle Lindvall, runs a research group at the Lund Stem Cell Center that, in collaboration with colleagues at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, is responsible for these findings. Hopefully, these new data will lead to new ways of treating stroke in the future. The study was recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience. When stroke occurs, the nerve cells in the damaged area of the brain die, causing an inflammation that attracts cells from the immune system. Among them you find monocytes a type of white blood cells produced in the bone marrow. The monocytes travel to the inflamed area, and here they develop into macrophages that clear out any dead tissue. But this is not all that they do: they also secrete substances that help the brain repair the damage. ""This is what we, together with Michal Schwartz's research group in Israel, have been able to show"", says Zaal Kokaia. Most stroke patients recover at least partly over time. This spontaneous improvement is well known, but not its exact cause. The Lund researchers now believe that the improvement is partly due to the substances released by the immune cells. In their study, they actually performed the opposite: in animal model of stroke they were able to ablate monocytes from the blood. Mice with decreased number of circulating monocytes were much less successful in their recovery from stroke than mice whose immune system was functioning as normal. Today's treatment against stroke primarily involves dissolving or removing the blood clot that caused the stroke. However, such treatments must be performed in the very early phase after the insult, which means that most stroke patients are too late to receive it. A future treatment method one that could be based on the Lund researchers' new findings and that aims to promote self-healing could be implemented later. This treatment could start at some point within the first few weeks, rather than within the first few hours after a stroke. Related: The immune system, microglia, and the brain The Lund researchers have focused on what happens in the brain during this later stage. Among other things, they were the first to show that, after a stroke, the brain produces new nerve cells from its own stem cells. They now want to proceed with animal experiments to see if the self-healing can be improved by adding more monocytes to the brain, or by stimulating the production of monocytes in bone marrow. ""Obviously, there is a difference between mice and humans, but there is no indication that our brains function differently in this regard"", says Olle Lindvall. He further argues that this new insight concerning the positive effects of inflammation could also be applied to other diseases. The Lund research group's collaborators from Israel have obtained similar results in cases of spinal cord injury. ""This is no less than a paradigm shift within research, as inflammation has in many instances been seen as a purely negative phenomenon that should be combatted using any means available. We now realise that this view is much too simplistic"", says Olle Lindvall. Lund University   press release Wattananit S et al.

For many years it has been hailed as a technology capable of revolutionising research in the chemical and biological sciences. However, high equipment costs and specialised skill requirements have created a barrier that has limited the uptake of microfluidics in laboratories where it could be most beneficial. The use of relatively cheap and simple 3D printers to fabricate microfluidic devices using widely available materials could open up the possibilities of microfluidics to the wider scientific community allowing devices to be easily shared and created. Dr Oliver Castell, School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and Prof. David Barrow in Cardiff School of Engineering have developed methods of printing Lego-like fluidic modules which can easily be used to create reconfigurable microfluidic systems. Optimisation of printing conditions and materials has enabled the printing of transparent devices for observation of fluid flow or even fluorescent imaging. This pioneering microfluidics work has been carried out by post-doctoral scientist in microfluidics and synthetic biology, Dr. Alex Morgan, in the laboratories at Cardiff University. Droplet microfluidics exploits the difference in fluid behaviour on the small scale, where surface and viscous forces dominate. Many small droplets of water in oil can be produced at a rapid rate with great regularity. These microdroplets are useful for miniaturisation of chemical reactions and rapid, high-throughput experimentation. In collaboration with colleagues Phil Stephens and Bing Song in Cardiff School of Dentistry, we show the potential use of 3D printed droplet microfluidic systems to encapsulate stem cells in droplet capsules. This technology enables scientists to culture cells in three-dimensional structures and create synthetic materials both supporting and protecting encapsulated cells. Such technology is expected to find use as implantable tissue scaffolds in regenerative medicine and tissue repair.","Published: April 15, 2016"

Drug resistance is one of the primary obstacles in treating glioblastoma   it is extremely common and affects virtually all people with the disease. But there is no consensus on why the body stops responding to treatment after a period of time, and scientists don t yet have a tool for predicting drug resistance during the early stages of treatment. The new technique uses penny-sized microfluidic chips that are equipped with minuscule DNA  bar codes,  which are no bigger than a single cell. Glioblastoma tumors can grow rapidly and spread throughout the brain. The aggressive behavior is triggered by genetic mutations that cause the tumor cells  protein signaling networks to become overly active. As a result, glioblastoma cells continuously receive signals that make them grow, divide and invade healthy tissue in the brain. The current treatments for glioblastoma are designed to disrupt specific elements of the protein networks and to block the signaling that powers the tumor cells. But even when that approach is successful, it usually only works for a short time before the body becomes resistant to the treatment. A paper about the new approach was published in the journal Cancer Cell. The research was led by James Heath, co-director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center s Nanotechnology Program. Heath and his team looked at how glioblastoma responded to a drug called CC214-2, which targets a signaling protein called mTOR. Mice with glioblastoma initially responded to CC214-2, but after a month they started to resist the drug, and their tumors began to grow again.  The researchers collected information from the microfluidic chips, which allowed them to anticipate resistance from a single or combination cancer treatment. They also found that within only two days after administering CC214-2, the cancer cells were adapting to the drug, and their ability to adapt foreshadowed full-scale drug resistance. The cancer cells  response to the drug was analogous to how automobile traffic responds to a road closure   they simply found new molecular routes through which to maintain their hyperactive signaling. In other words, the very cancer cells that had responded to the drug initially were the same ones that became resistant to the drug over time. The single-cell analysis also showed the researchers the specific  traffic patterns  the cells used to get around the inhibiting influence of the drug, which gave the scientists key insights about the drug combinations they could use to inhibit the mTOR protein and the proteins that provided the alternate signaling routes.  Previous findings had suggested that drug resistance against targeted inhibitors for glioblastoma or other tumors likely occurred from one generation of cancer cells to the next   meaning that the cells could randomly develop genetic mutations that either disrupt the drug binding or counteract its effects   rather than because of individual cells  ability to adapt. The new study was one of the first to show that cancer cells can adapt to drug treatments without genetic changes by rewiring their internal signaling circuitry.  By sensing this adaptation so early, we were able to anticipate and treat drug resistance,  said Heath, who is also the Elizabeth W. Gilloon Professor of Chemistry at Caltech.  The scientists used their single cell measurements to predict three drug combinations that would stop tumor growth over the long term, as well as four drugs or drug combos that would likely have no effect. While testing all seven predictions, they found that each prediction was correct. The findings have also shown positive results in mammal models with melanoma.","Published: April 15, 2016"

Do you pop a couple of antihistamines to avoid an allergic reaction? Or not? Sorry, a definitive answer is not provided here. However, a newly published study from the UO lab of John Halliwill has raised such questions. The research found that 795 (about 27 percent) of 3,000 genes activated after vigorous exercise become blunted in their responses during a three-hour recovery period if exercisers had taken strong doses of antihistamines. Halliwill, a professor in the Department of Human Physiology, discovered in 2005 that naturally occurring histamines in the body relax blood vessels, increasing blood flow that aids post-exercise recovery. That emerged from his original focus on why some people, including athletes, pass out after vigorous physical exertion. He later found a link between an overactivation of two histamine receptors to drops in blood pressure. The new study   led by doctoral student Steven A. Romero and in collaboration with Hans Dreyer, a departmental colleague who studies muscle physiology   expanded the research to a wider genetics level. Researchers sequenced RNA, molecules essential for making proteins and sending signals among genes, with state-of-the-art equipment in the UO's Genomics Core Facility. ""We were looking for pathways associated with the growth of new blood vessels,"" said Halliwill, director of the Exercise and Environmental Physiology Lab. ""We saw evidence of that, but we also saw gene expression associated with glucose uptake by muscles, restructuring of muscle in response to exercise, immune responses and intercellular communications."" In the research, 16 physically fit and active young adults performed an hour of knee-extension exercise at a pace of about 45 kicks per minute. Biopsies were done before exercise and three hours after to obtain samples from the quadriceps, the skeletal muscles on the side of the thighs. Eight participants took 540 milligrams of fexofenadine (Allegra) and 300 milligrams of ranitidine (Zantac) at nearly three times the recommended dosages of the over-the-counter antihistamines. Together they target the two histamine receptors involved in both allergic reactions and exercise-recovery responses. Blood flow, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the exercise. During the three-hour recovery window the research team was able to study early signs of gene expression; they found that 88 percent of the 795 genes affected by the antihistamines mostly responded with lower levels of expression. ""Histamine, a substance that we typically think of negatively and is most often associated with seasonal allergies, is an important substance contributing to the normal day-to-day response to exercise in humans,"" said Romero, who is now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas on a postdoctoral fellowship from the National Institutes of Health. In their conclusion, the 10 co-authors noted that the research highlighted only a small fraction of genes likely involved in signaling pathways influenced by the activation of histamine receptors during recovery. A key question is whether people should avoid taking antihistamines when they exercise. It's too early to make that call, Halliwill said. For now, he said, people should use their own judgment about choosing to take or avoid antihistamines when performing when they know they will be exposed to allergens. ""There are a lot of redundancies in physiological systems,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if blocking histamine receptors ends up being overcome by something else, but I also wouldn't be surprised if we can demonstrate that some responses to exercise training do become blunted if you take high doses of histamine blockers."" The study is now online ahead of print in the Journal of Physiology. The NIH and American Heart Association supported the research.","Published: April 15, 2016"

In patients with SLE, the immune system forms autoantibodies that attack the body s own cells, causing inflammation and tissue damage. How these rogue antibodies form is an important area of interest for lupus researchers. When a pathogen like a virus invades the body, immune cells called B lymphocytes multiply to fight the foreigner. These groups of B lymphocytes produce antibodies specially designed to fight the specific invader or turn into antibody-secreting cells and memory B cells that give long-term protection and help protect the next time the same pathogen is encountered. In both humans and mice with lupus, groups of B lymphocytes (B cells) spontaneously arise in the absence of a pathogenic infection. Instead of producing antibodies to fight an infection, these groups pump out specialized autoantibodies that efficiently attack healthy tissue. These attacks on the body s own cells are the hallmark of autoimmune disorders like lupus. Autoantibody-secreting B cells and memory B cells that continuously generate autoantibodies are also created, setting the body up for ongoing attacks, chronic inflammation and over time organ damage. But what factors drive the development of groups of B cells, called autoreactive B cells, that produce autoantibodies in lupus? Dr. Ziaur S.M. Rahman, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, is working to answer what factors drive the development of B lymphocyte groups without the presence of a pathogen. Penn State College of Medicine researchers homed in on the role of a particular cytokine a cell-signaling protein called interferon gamma, that is involved in the immune system.  People with SLE tend to have higher levels of interferon gamma production, and lupus mice that are deficient in it have reduced autoantibody production and less severe renal disease, a major lupus complication. To find out if interferon gamma is behind the formation of spontaneously developed B lymphocyte groups, the researchers looked at lupus mice whose interferon gamma receptors in B cells had been removed. These mice did not form the groups, while mice that had intact interferon gamma receptors did. These mice also had lower levels of autoantibodies involved in lupus compared to the normal mice.  This suggests that interferon gamma signaling in B cells is critical for the formation of spontaneously-developed B lymphocyte groups and autoimmunity,  Rahman said.  If you could target this interferon gamma signaling pathway in B cells, you could potentially treat lupus.  Moreover, the researchers also discovered that the formation of normal B lymphocyte groups that produce antibodies to fight real infections is not dependent on interferon gamma signaling. The current treatment options for SLE are limited to the use of immunosuppressive agents that make patients susceptible to infection. This novel intervention could be an improvement for lupus patients, as targeting interferon gamma signaling would eliminate spontaneously developed groups of B cells that produce autoantibodies and keep normal B cell responses intact to fight against infection, Rahman said.","Published: April 15, 2016"

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mutated-mitochondria-found-in-stem-cells-201756,Mutated Mitochondria Found in Stem Cells Researchers find hidden genetic mutations in patient derived stem cells which could ultimately undermine therapeutic benefit  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For the first time, scientists have confirmed the long-standing hypothesis that as people age, they accumulate gene mutations in their mitochondria -- cells' energy source. A team led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, Ph.D., director of the Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy at Oregon Health & Science University, has discovered that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, a type of stem cell derived from patients  skin or blood cells, contain faulty mitochondrial DNA.   Pathogenic mutations in our mitochondrial DNA have long been thought to be a driving force in aging and age-related diseases, though clear evidence was missing. Now with that evidence at hand, we know that we must screen stem cells for mutations or collect them at younger age to ensure their mitochondrial genes are healthy,  said Mitalipov.  This foundational knowledge of how cells are damaged in the natural process of aging may help to illuminate the role of mutated mitochondria in degenerative disease.  Mitochondrial genes reside outside of the nucleus and have been known to be prone to damage. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which arise randomly within individual cells as we age, can limit cells  ability to create energy, produce signals and function properly. Potential therapies using stem cells hold tremendous promise for treating human disease. However, defects in the mitochondria could undermine the iPS cells  ability to repair damaged tissue or organs. To avoid impairing iPS cells  therapeutic value, Mitalipov and colleagues recommend screening the cells for mitochondrial DNA mutations.  If you want to use iPS cells in a human, you must check for mutations in the mitochondrial genome,  said Taosheng Huang, M.D., Ph.D.,a medical geneticist and director of the Mitochondrial Disorders Program at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center.  Every single cell can be different. Two cells next to each other could have different mutations or different percentages of mutations.   This collaborative multi-disciplinary effort identifies  mitochondrial genome integrity  as a vital readout in assessing the proficiency of patient-derived regenerative products destined for clinical applications , adds study co-author Andre Terzic, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine. Every individual has trillions of cells and thousands of copies of mitochondria in each cell. As cells age, thousands of different mutations in each mitochondrial genome are possible. Because each cell has its own unique mutation, when researchers examine a pinch of skin or drop of blood containing millions of cells, most mitochondrial mutations are hidden. The mutation would only be visible if every cell has the same mutation. However, these mutations become detectable in iPS cells. In the process of making iPS cell lines, researchers expand clones from each individual patient skin or blood cell. As a result, every cell in the iPS cell line will contain the same mitochondrial DNA mutations as that initial adult cell. In this study, rather than studying one iPS cell line, the researchers derived and sequenced 10 iPS cell clones from each patient tissue sample to get a better understanding of mitochondrial DNA mutation rates. They took samples of blood and skin from healthy people and people with degenerative diseases, ranging in age from 24 to 72. When they tested the pooled skin or blood cells for mitochondrial DNA mutations, the levels of mutations appeared low. Then they profiled 20 iPS cell lines per patient   10 from their blood cells and 10 from their skin cells. When they sequenced the iPS cell lines, they found higher numbers of mitochondrial DNA mutations, particularly in cells from patients older than 60. They analyzed 130 iPS cell lines and discovered 80 percent showed mutations. They also found higher percentages of mitochondria containing mutations within a cell. The higher the load of mutated mitochondrial DNA in a cell, the greater the cell s function is compromised. The authors recommend producing and screening multiple lines per patient and then choosing the least damaged line. In May 2013, Mitalipov was the first scientist in the world to demonstrate the successful use of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, to produce human embryonic stem cells from an individual s skin cell. That breakthrough was one of a six-year chain of discoveries that included his 2007 work demonstrating the nuclear transfer method to create embryonic stem cells from a nonhuman primate. OHSU scientists have also demonstrated that SCNT allows replacement of mutated mitochondrial genes with healthy donor egg mitochondria while retaining the patient cell s nucleus. The study,  Age-Related Accumulation of Mitochondrial DNA mutations in Adult-Derived Human iPSCs,  was supported by the Fondation Leducq, Oregon Health & Science University institutional funds and Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine and the Cincinnati Children s Hospital Research Foundation.","Published: April 15, 2016"

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/rerouting-cancer-207241,Rerouting Cancer Caltech researchers show how cancer drug resistance could potentially be overcome  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cancer is capable of rapidly developing resistance to therapeutic drugs, rendering those drugs harmless often before they have a chance to work. Now, researchers at Caltech and their colleagues have identified how at least one brain cancer, called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), adapts so fast and they show that by formulating the right combination of drugs, doctors could potentially overcome this resistance and stop a tumor in its tracks. Some cancer drugs are designed to target a cell's chemical circuitry. This network of signaling pathways controls how a healthy cell functions, but in many cancers, the pathways are hyperactivated, directly leading to the aggressive nature of the disease. By blocking a key pathway, a drug can, in principle, stop the tumor from growing. ""The concept is that if you block a key node in the pathway, then the communication can't proceed and the cells can't get the signals to divide and multiply,"" explains Jim Heath, the Elizabeth W. Gilloon Professor of Chemistry and co-corresponding author on the paper. In reality, however, tumors can become resistant to a drug even if the drug works exactly as designed. With GBM, such resistance develops in almost every patient. ""In some patients, you can treat with a drug that does everything you could want it to do, but you would never know that the drug hit the target because the tumor adapts so quickly,"" Heath says. Some scientists have suspected that the cancer becomes resistant through Darwinian-type evolution, in a process similar to how bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. That is, the genetic differences of certain cancer cells may make those cells resistant to a drug. Nonresistant cells are killed by the drug and their death leaves room for the naturally resistant cells and tumors to grow and multiply. However, this mechanism was not what Heath and his colleagues found in studies of tissue from glioblastoma patients. Instead, the researchers discovered that the cancer cells that developed resistance to a drug were the same cells that had responded to the drug. When the drug blocks a signaling pathway in a cancer cell, they realized, the cell simply finds a detour, like a GPS navigator that reroutes to avoid traffic. ""You can block a key part,"" Heath says, ""and the cells will respond to route around that part you blocked."" This notion of shifting pathways is not new, but the work is the first to show that the process can happen in as little as two days. In particular, the researchers found that the changes occur with a specific drug (CC214 2) that targets a central GBM signaling-protein called mTOR. When mTOR is inhibited, certain GBM signaling pathways are repressed, but others are activated. To map the detours, the researchers separated individual GBM cells from patient tumors and measured the levels of several key proteins in the cells. These proteins called phosphoproteins because they are activated by the addition of a phosphoryl group to a molecule carry signals throughout the cell. Measurements of the abundance of the proteins showed that the drug was effective. The story was different at the single-cell level, at which Heath and his colleagues not only measured the levels of proteins in individual cells, but also the signaling between those proteins. For example, if protein A signals protein B, then the levels of A, as measured across many single cells, will correlate with the levels of B.  By measuring the presence of several such proteins, the researchers could infer the structure of the protein signaling network. They discovered that after the drug was introduced, the cell activated new pathways that previously had been dormant. This drug-induced pathway activation suggested several combination therapies that might halt the development of drug resistance, as well as drugging strategies that would have no effect. In mice, Heath and his team tested seven therapies or therapy combinations that they predicted would or would not halt resistance development. The four that they predicted would not work were, indeed, ineffectual; the three they thought would work, did. The researchers then showed that they could see similar effects in GBM patient tissues, as well as in melanoma tumor models. This kind of rapid drug adaptation by tumors may occur in many cancer types, and helps explain how cancers can develop resistance to targeted drugs so quickly, Heath says. The good news is that, by identifying the drug-activated signaling pathways, one may be able to find drug combinations that will suppress resistance, Heath says. Eventually, he says, clinicians may be able to analyze a patient's tumor at the single-cell level to determine the best therapy strategy. These kinds of drug combinations would likely remain a secondary therapy against cancer used when treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery fail. But, Heath says, they are essential for staving off the resistance that has severely limited the benefits that patients currently receive from targeted therapies.","Published: April 15, 2016"

The Penn team also found that patients with this genetic variation had a slower rate of Parkinson s disease progression, and lower amounts of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Alpha-synuclein is a protein that experts know plays a role in the development of Parkinson's disease. Clinicians have long noted that the presence of tremors, rather than balance and walking problems, as the initial or dominant symptom of Parkinson s may suggest slower progression of the disease. The Penn-led study is one of the first to link this difference to a specific genetic variation. Tremor-dominant patients are also less likely to develop dementia, although this symptom was not assessed in the study.  We have never understood the reason why some people present with more tremor vs. walking/balance difficulties in Parkinson s disease,  said the study s lead author, Christine A. Cooper, MD, a fellow in movement disorders at Penn Medicine.  This finding gives us information, for the first time, that has implications for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention efforts.  In the study, the investigators ranked 251 Parkinson s disease patients at the University of Pennsylvania Health System on tremor and balance/walking scores. They then looked at the patients  genotypes to see if there were correlations between ten genetic variations previously associated with Parkinson s disease and the primary symptoms that the patients displayed. The researchers found that 39 of the 251 patients who had a genetic variation known as the GG genotype at the rs356182 SNP 3  to the SNCA gene were more likely to have: 1) tremors rather than walking/balance problems; 2) slower physical progression of the disease; and 3) lower levels of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Patients were followed up to seven years in some cases. The investigators carried out the same type of analysis with an additional group of 559 patients at three other clinical sites in the United States and found similar results for the association between the genotype and the type of PD symptoms.  This is how we can start thinking about precision medicine in action,  said the study s senior author, Alice S. Chen-Plotkin, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at Penn.  We found that a relatively common genetic variation can both serve as a biomarker for and influence the disease course of Parkinson s patients. This opens up the possibility of achieving a hallmark of precision medicine: targeted therapies for different  versions  of what was once thought to be a single disease.  Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the kind the Penn-led team investigated, frequently called SNPs (pronounced  snips ), are the most widespread kind of genetic variation among people. There are about 10 million of them in the human genome (often found in the DNA between genes), and most have no effect on health or development. But when SNPs occur within a gene or in a regulatory region near a gene, they may play a more active role in disease by affecting the gene s function. The investigators found that this indeed may be the case in Parkinson s patients with the GG genotype, a relatively common SNP near the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene. The human alpha-synuclein protein is made of 140 amino acids and is encoded by the SNCA gene. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy bodies, which are clumps of protein that develop inside nerve cells in Parkinson's disease and some other disorders.","Published: April 15, 2016"

Solitary animals that rarely come face to face, binturongs use their roasty, popcorn-like aroma as a calling card to say  this is my turf  and find potential mates. Previous studies searched for compounds in secretions from the scent glands under the binturong s tail that could explain its signature scent, but nothing turned up. In a paper appearing online in the journal The Science of Nature - Naturwissenschaften, researchers analyzed urine samples collected during routine physical examinations of 33 binturongs at Carolina Tiger Rescue, a nonprofit wildlife sanctuary in Pittsboro, North Carolina. Binturongs pee in a squatting position, soaking their feet and bushy tails in the process. They also drag their tails as they move about in the trees, leaving a scent trail on the branches and leaves behind them. Using a technique called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the researchers identified 29 chemical compounds in the animals  urine. The one compound that emanated from every sample was 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, or 2-AP -- the same compound that gives popcorn its tantalizing scent. What s more, 2-AP was among the few compounds that lingered and became more dominant over time, a fact the researchers discovered when a rush airmail shipment of frozen binturong urine was delayed on a hot tarmac en route to co-author Thomas Goodwin of Hendrix College in Arkansas for analysis. Males secrete more 2-AP than females.  The fact that the compound was in every binturong we studied, and at relatively high concentrations, means it could be a signal that says,  A binturong was here,  and whether it was male or female,  said first author Lydia Greene, a graduate student at Duke University. The compound 2-AP normally forms in popcorn during the popping process, when heat kicks off reactions between sugars and amino acids in the corn kernels. The cooking produces a variety of new odor and flavor molecules in a chemical reaction called the Maillard reaction. The same compound is also responsible for the comforting aromas of toasted bread and cooked rice. The question was: how do they do it?  If you were to make this compound, you would have to use temperatures above what most animals can achieve physiologically,  said Christine Drea, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke who led the study.  How does this animal make a cooking smell, but without cooking?  It could be that binturong pee smells funny because of something they eat. The team searched for 2-AP in the binturongs  kibble, the one cooked item in their diet, but they didn t detect any. A more likely explanation, the researchers say, is that 2-AP is produced when binturong urine comes in contact with bacteria and other microorganisms that live on the animal s skin or fur or in its gut. Bacteria make smelly compounds as they break down sweat in our armpits in much the same way, Drea said. The time-release action of the microbes could help the binturongs  urine smell-o-grams last long after the animals move on, an essential mode of communication for solitary animals that rarely encounter each other, the researchers say. This research was supported by Duke, Hendrix College, and a grant from the National Science Foundation (IOS-1021633).

Repairing damage in DNA from anything that causes a mutation, such as UV radiation and tobacco smoke, is a fundamental process that protects our cells from becoming cancerous. In the study published today in the journal Nature, the scientists analysed more than 20 million DNA mutations from 1,161 tumours across 14 cancer types. They found that in many cancer types, especially skin cancers, the number of mutations was particular high in regions of the genome known as  gene promoters . Significantly, these DNA sequences control how genes are expressed which in turn determine cell type and function. The researchers showed that the numbers of DNA mutations are increased in gene promoters because the proteins that bind DNA to control gene expression block one of our cell repair systems responsible for fixing damaged DNA. This system is known as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and is one of a number of DNA repair mechanisms that occurs in human cells and the only one capable of repairing damage from UV light. Lead author of the study Dr Jason Wong, group leader of Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at UNSW s Lowy Cancer Research Centre, said the results provide compelling evidence that increased mutations at gene promoter sites are caused by a compromised NER system.  What this research also tells us is that while the human body is pretty good at repairing itself, there are certain parts of our genome that are poorly repaired when we sustain damage from mutagens such as UV light and cigarette smoke,  said Dr Wong, who is an Australian Research Council Future Fellow.  By actively avoiding these harmful environmental factors, we can minimise the number of mutations occurring in our body that can lead to cancer.  Internationally, scientists have so far identified only one promoter mutation, known as the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, that definitively contributes to cancer.  Our study highlights the need for further research on the role of gene promoter mutations in cancer development,  Dr Wong said.  This may ultimately help doctors to determine why certain cancers develop, enabling them to diagnose cancer earlier and select more tailored treatment therapies for patients.   The findings are all the more impressive because they were uncovered using existing and publicly available  big data , simply by asking the right questions,  said study co-author, haematologist and UNSW Associate Professor John Pimanda.  We didn't need to spend time and money recruiting patients, investigating their cancers and sequencing their cancer genomes. All of this data was available to researchers on public data sharing platforms.  The research highlights the returns that can result from investing in bioinformatics and genomics research,  Associate Professor Pimanda said.","Published: April 15, 2016"

Loblolly pine is an important economic resource across the southeastern U.S., including Texas,  Casola said.  We are just now starting to understand the different parts that form the very large genome of this pine tree and other conifers. Xuan Lin, one of Casola s doctoral students, and Dr. Nurul Faridi, leader of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service s Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory and a collaborating faculty member, were other members of the team. Their work,  An Ancient Trans-Kingdom Horizontal Transfer of Penelope-like Retroelements from Arthropods to Conifers,  was published recently in the Genome Biology and Evolution journal. It can be found at http://bit.ly/1ozJJ4Y.  We called these conifer DNA sequences  Dryads  after the Greek mythological nymphs that inhabit trees,  Casola said.  Dryads are one of the many groups of DNA sequences known as DNA repeats.  He said DNA repeats, also known as transposable elements, are particularly good at making new copies of themselves. As a result, they ended up forming more than half of the genome in some species, including conifers and other plants.  We know from studies in other plants that transposable elements affect both the activity and the structure of genes, and ultimately have a role in shaping certain traits, from the color of some grape varieties to the oval shape of some tomatoes.  He said because transposable elements make up a lot of the conifers  DNA, it is important to gather a better understanding of what they are and how they influence conifer genes and phenotypic traits.  You can think of transposable elements as  genomic parasites,  Casola explained.  They spread into new genomes kind of like viruses spread between people. Unlike flu and other viral disease, these  genomic infections  occur rarely, but once established, they can persist for millions of years.  The similarities between some transposable elements and viruses are not only superficial, he said. For example retroviruses, the group of viruses that includes the HIV, evolved from transposable elements long ago. On the other hand, Casola said, many transposable elements known as endogenous retroviruses, or ERVs, represent  DNA fossils  of retroviruses that once infected primates and other mammals.  No less than 8 percent of our own genome is made of ERVs,  he said.  Retroviruses, ERVs and other DNA repeats such as Penelope-like sequences share a unique way to make new copies of themselves.  In this process, a single DNA repeat acts as a template to make many molecules called RNAs, and these RNAs are then transformed back into just as many DNA copies that are sort of stitched back in the host genome, he explained. Because the generation of new DNA copies from RNAs is called retroposition, transposable elements that amplify through this mechanism are known as retroelements, Casola said. By looking at some specific features in the DNA of retroelements, it is possible to classify them into different families and subfamilies.  Dryads represent a conifer-specific subfamily within the larger family of Penelope-like retroelements, hence the manuscript s title,  Casola said.  Before we described Dryads, Penelope-like retroelements were known only in animals.  We thought that Dryads could have derived from Penelope-like retroelements that were somehow introduced into conifer genomes long ago,  he said.  To confirm that, we computationally analyzed the genome sequences from 1,029 species that were neither animals nor conifers.  Some of these other species seemed to contain Penelope-like retroelements; however, after thorough inspections of these DNA sequences, we concluded that they were due to DNA contamination from either animals or conifers.  Casola said they also did a lot of other analyses to confirm that Dryads are not artifacts and to show they are likely derived from insect Penelope-like retroelements.  One of the techniques used is called fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, and allowed to visualize the position of Dryad DNA sequences on the loblolly pine chromosomes,  Faridi said. Other lab experiments showed that Dryads do not occur in plants closely related to conifers, such as cycads and ginkgo, he said.  This helped us in timing the origin of Dryads between the separation of conifers  ancestors from other plants and the radiation of modern conifer groups known to have occurred about 340 million years ago,  Casola said. The consequences of Dryads invasion for conifers evolution remain unclear, he said. When DNA repeats like Dryads amplify in a genome, they can change the structure of chromosomes and alter the activity of genes, with potential negative consequences for the organism, Casola said. Most species have evolved genetic mechanisms that slow down the amplification of DNA repeats, but when they jump into new host genomes, these defense mechanisms are not in place yet and a new cycle of amplification ensues, he said. The same likely happened in Dryads, which generated hundreds of thousands of new copies in the past 340 million years but now seem to have a relatively low activity, at least in loblolly pine, Casola said.  We think that Dryads changed significantly the genome landscape of ancestral conifers and possibly are still introducing important changes into the DNA of these trees,  he said.  The next step in our research will be to understand how conifer chromosomes, and especially genes, were affected by the amplification of Dryads since their invasion of these plants,  Casola said.  Additionally, we want to know if Dryads and other DNA repeats show differences between loblolly pine trees that are associated with trait differences, for example drought tolerance and pest resistance. Both these aspects will be the focus of future research in our labs.

Genome instability suppressing (GIS) genes play an important role in correcting DNA damage involving the improper copying or reshuffling of large sections of chromosomes. Called gross chromosomal rearrangements, or GCRs, these structural errors can disrupt gene order or even result in an abnormal number of chromosomes.  Mutated GIS genes have long been suspected of playing a role in the development of many types of cancers, but identifying them has been difficult due in large part to a lack of comprehensive GCR tests, or assays, in mammalian systems,  said Christopher Putnam, an associate investigator at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, San Diego and one of the first authors of the study. In the current issue of the journal Nature Communications, Putnam, Kolodner and their colleagues describe a novel two-pronged approach that combines methods from genetics and bioinformatics to identify GIS genes first in yeast and then in humans.  This is one of the first large-scale studies to integrate these two methods,  said co-senior author Sandro de Souza, a professor of Bioinformatics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte s Brain Institute in Brazil, who received Ludwig support for this study. In the first step, the scientists used assays and technologies developed by Kolodner who is director of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, San Diego and a distinguished professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine and his lab to screen thousands of mutant yeast strains for genes that suppress GCRs. They identified 182 GIS genes, 98 of which had not been described before.  Ours is probably one of the most comprehensive lists of GIS genes in yeast to date,  Putnam said. The team also uncovered more than 400 previously unknown cooperating Genome Instability Suppressing genes (cGIS) genes, which only affect genome stability when combined with other mutations.  Before our experiment, only a few dozen cGIS genes were known. Now we know of hundreds,  said Putnam, who is also an adjunct assistant professor of Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  These results have highlighted the complex genetic network that maintains genome integrity in normal cells,  said first author Anjana Srivatsan, a postdoctoral fellow in Kolodner s lab at the Ludwig San Diego Branch and UC San Diego School of Medicine. To determine how many of the yeast GIS genes had human counterparts implicated in cancers, the researchers searched The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) a compilation of genomic data from thousands of patients for such human gene homologues. They also supplemented their candidate list with human genes that are not found in yeast but that participate in the same pathways and protein complexes as the yeast GIS genes.  We didn't want to just look for the human equivalent of yeast GIS genes because there are human GIS genes that don't have yeast homologs,  Putnam said. Three cancers in the TCGA were selected for screening: ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. The scientists hypothesized that a greater number of GIS gene defects should be implicated in ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer because these two cancers tend to involve numerous large-scale rearrangements of the genome. Leukemia served as an important control because it is a cancer with little genome instability, and thus should not involve any GIS gene defects. As expected, the team found that 93% of ovarian cancers and 66% of colorectal cancers had genetic defects affecting one or more of the predicted GIS genes, whereas acute myeloid leukemia did not appear to have defects involving GIS genes. The researchers are already screening more than a dozen other human cancers in the TCGA for GIS gene defects.  Understanding this process allows us to think more about how carcinogenesis proceeds and it might give us insights into defects that could be therapeutically actionable in the future,  said Putnam.","Published: April 15, 2016"

A report on the study is published online ahead of print in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Currently, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends one-time HCV testing for all adults born between 1945 and 1965, or for those with risk factors such as injection drug use, HIV or use of clotting factors. But up to one-quarter of infections could remain undiagnosed, according to results of the new study, and the authors say that universal one-time testing of all U.S. adults seeking care at inner-city emergency rooms might identify many more people who have the virus, getting them into management and treatment. Better screening would also reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. In November 2015, The Johns Hopkins Hospital expanded its testing for HCV to all eligible Emergency Department adults 18 and older who have their blood drawn as part of routine clinical care and are not known to be HCV antibody-positive. Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center adopted this expanded testing protocol in February 2016. The Johns Hopkins team specifically found that nearly 14 percent of patients among the 5,000 tested positive for HCV, one-third of whom were unaware they were infected.  Hepatitis C has a very long clinical arc, so if you get infected, you may not have obvious signs of illness for five to 10 years. Ultimately, it eats away at the liver in many people and can cause liver cancer,  says senior study author Thomas C. Quinn, M.D., professor of medicine and pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  This is an infection that can now be cured if detected early, rendering people noninfectious and thereby preventing the dire consequences that are associated with the virus. However, we found a large proportion of undocumented, undiagnosed hepatitis C infection in the population attending this ED.  Many people with risk factors like injection drug use don t disclose their risk information to emergency department staff, so universal testing,  in addition to the CDC recommendations, is the only way to identify as many HCV infections as possible,  adds lead study author Yu-Hsiang Hsieh, Ph.D., an associate professor in Johns Hopkins  Department of Emergency Medicine.  We found high prevalence rates of HCV even in young adult patients, suggesting we need to expand testing beyond the baby boomer cohort,  Hsieh says.  Urban EDs should consider expanding CDC HCV testing recommendations to permit more robust identification of patients with unknown HCV status.  For the study, the researchers examined blood samples from 4,713 patients older than 17 presenting to The Johns Hopkins Hospital s Emergency Department between June and August 2013. Of these patients, 652 (13.8 percent) were HCV antibody-positive, meaning they either had HCV currently or at a prior time, and 204 (31.3 percent) of those who tested positive had undocumented HCV infection. Patients born between 1945 and 1965 had an HCV prevalence of about 25 percent compared with adults born outside this range, who had an HCV prevalence of 7 percent. These baby boomers also had a higher prevalence of undocumented HCV   about 7 percent versus 2.6 percent in other adults tested. Non-African-American men and women as young as 18 to 34 (born between 1979 and 1995) had a high HCV prevalence of up to 7.6 percent. Among the 204 Emergency Department patients with undocumented HCV infection, 128 (63 percent) were in the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort, 45 (22 percent) were injection drug users and 10 (5 percent) were known to be infected with HIV. Further assessments by the researchers found that 99 (49 percent) would be diagnosed based on birth cohort testing alone, with an additional 54 (26 percent) identified based on modified CDC risk-based testing (based on injection drug use or known HIV status).  Had we established an emergency room HCV testing program with just these guidelines, 51 patients (25 percent) with undocumented HCV would not have been identified during our study period,  Hsieh says.  Given an estimated 7,727 unique ED patients with HCV infection in a one-year period, birth cohort testing would identify 1,815 undocumented infections, but universal testing would identify an additional 526 cases.  The results also underscore the need for federal and state HCV management and treatment resources to support emergency departments and HCV patients, Quinn and Hsieh say.  It sounds easy to do HCV testing for every eligible patient, but it takes a lot of effort,  Hsieh says. In the near future, the investigators hope to examine the cost-effectiveness of different HCV screening approaches in the emergency department setting, including universal testing and CDC-recommended birth cohort testing. But with a projected 3.2 million people infected with HCV in the U.S. alone, it s critical for all of these patients to be identified, treated and cured, say the researchers.  It s not often that we get to say we can cure a medical condition,  says Hsieh.  So when we can, we should implement protocols that allow us to easily identify those in need.

The Merger will create a company focused on the development of novel small-molecule drugs addressing major unmet needs in cardiovascular-metabolic diseases and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Madrigal s lead compound, MGL-3196, is a Phase 2-ready once-daily, oral, liver-directed selective thyroid hormone receptor-  (THR- ) agonist for the treatment of NASH and heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, HoFH). Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be named Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, and Paul A. Friedman, M.D. will become Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Synta will acquire all outstanding shares of Madrigal in exchange for approximately 253.9 million newly issued shares of Synta common stock. Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is anticipated that existing Synta shareholders will own 36.0% of the combined company and Madrigal shareholders will own 64.0% of the combined company. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and the shareholders of Madrigal. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of the merger by the shareholders of Synta. An investor syndicate that includes Bay City Capital, Fred Craves, Ph.D., Founder of Bay City Capital, and SQN LLC, a corporation held by Dr. Friedman and Rebecca Taub, M.D., has committed to invest up to $9 million in Madrigal prior to the closing of the Merger. The combined company intends to use these proceeds, in addition to Synta s cash balance at the closing of the merger, to fund the development of MGL-3196 through Phase 2 clinical studies in NASH, HeFH and HoFH.   Following an extensive review of strategic alternatives, Synta s Board of Directors believes that a merger with Madrigal Pharmaceuticals offers shareholders the most compelling opportunity for enhancing long-term value,  said Keith R. Gollust, Chairman of Synta.  Madrigal s lead compound, MGL- 3196, is a selective THR-  agonist with a unique lipid lowering profile that has been validated through early clinical and preclinical studies. The combined company will be well capitalized with a lead program that offers both a potentially substantial commercial opportunity in NASH, and an efficient clinical development plan with commercial potential in genetic lipid disorders.   MGL-3196 is designed to specifically target thyroid hormone beta receptors in the liver involved in metabolism and cholesterol regulation, and avoid side effects associated with thyroid hormone receptor activation outside the liver,  said Dr. Taub, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal.  As a result, and because of MGL-3196 s observed high liver uptake and high  -selectivity, it has a favorable safety profile and did not show adverse findings observed in chronic animal toxicology studies with a prior thyroid agonist. Madrigal has designed Phase 2 clinical programs to establish proof of concepts in both NASH and FH with data readouts for each program anticipated throughout 2017.  ","Published: April 15, 2016"

In a study of 10 children published online in the American Journal of Human Genetics, the researchers linked a constellation of birth defects affecting the brain, eye, ear, heart and kidney to mutations in a single gene, called RERE. The discovery is likely to aid researchers striving to understand the cause of birth defects more broadly, the study s authors said, but it is also a boon to families who know for the first time the reason their children share this group of developmental disabilities.  Just having an answer can be hugely beneficial for families,  said co-senior author Elliott Sherr, MD, PhD, a UCSF pediatric neurologist who directs the Brain Development Research Program and the Comprehensive Center for Brain Development at UCSF.  Of course, getting a genetic answer is just the first step, but for the longest time we didn t even have that much. It gives these families hope that we can move forward.  Finding Could Speed Search for Answers in More Common Genetic Syndrome In their paper, the researchers demonstrate that the developmental disabilities suffered by children with RERE mutations correspond almost perfectly to the well-known pattern of intellectual disabilities, heart defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and hearing and vision problems seen in 1p36 deletion syndrome, one of the most common sources of intellectual disability in children. This syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns, and is caused by a much larger (and harder to study) pattern of genetic damage in the so-called 1p36 region at the tip of human chromosome 1. The research group of Daryl Scott, MD, PHD, an associate professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine, has been working for many years to identify the specific genes that cause the medical problems in children with 1p36 deletion syndrome.  Previous research had narrowed it down to two smaller  critical regions  within the 1p36 region, but even these smaller regions contain dozens of different genes,  said Scott, who was co-senior author on the new study.   Scott s group had focused on the RERE gene, which lies within one of these 1p36 critical regions, because it plays a role in retinoic acid (vitamin A) signaling, an important pathway regulating the development of many organs, including the brain, eye and heart. The Baylor researchers found that mice with Rere mutations had birth defects that were very similar to the children with 1p36 deletions, but had initially been unable to prove that damage to this gene was sufficient produce the same developmental problems in humans. A Mother s Activism Spurs a Research Breakthrough Sherr and Scott credit the genesis of their collaboration to Chauntelle Trefz, the mother of one of Sherr s patients who connected the two researchers after discovering Scott s work on mice with Rere mutations online and whose Facebook page about her son, Harrison, became a hub for identifying other children with the same condition. Trefz says that getting the whole exome sequencing results from Sherr and learning that a single gene mutation was responsible for her son s dizzying array of symptoms   which include global developmental delay, vision problems, hearing problems, weak muscles, and constant acid reflux   was  a game-changer.   Learning about the mutation was like a huge weight had been lifted,  she said.  When you bring a child with special needs into the world you feel so guilty, like you ve done something wrong. Hope can be a hard thing to find. Dr. Sherr gave us hope.  Trefz started a Facebook page documenting the joys and challenges of raising and caring for Harrison, who is now 4, hoping to find other families whose children had the same condition.  Harrison is such a happy kid, and he seems normal in many ways, but he s really not,  she said.  I could see a lot of kids falling through the cracks without the right diagnosis. I wanted other parents to see this and say,  that sounds like my son.  Soon Sherr and Scott had identified 10 children with RERE mutations through collaborators around the US, as well as several from the Netherlands who had found the researchers through Trefz s Facebook page. The researchers began a thorough comparison of these 10 children with a cohort of 31 patients with the more common 1p36 deletion syndrome, and found that RERE mutations alone produced almost exactly the same pattern of symptoms as 1p36 syndrome, with the exception of a few of the craniofacial abnormalities and cardiomyopathies often seen in that more common syndrome. Additional experiments showed that unique brain and eye problems first observed in human patients were also seen in the mice with Rere mutations.  It s still a shock that [a mutation in] one gene is capable of causing all these different problems,  Scott said.  But this finding really brings everything together, from molecular studies to mouse experiments and all the way to human patients. We ve finally proved what we ve been talking about for all these years.  Though much more study is needed to understand the syndrome fully, Scott said, RERE mutations may be capable of inducing a diverse set of developmental problems because the protein encoded by the gene interacts with important developmental processes in many organs throughout the body, such as the retinoic acid signaling crucial for proper eye and heart development. When RERE doesn t function properly, the development of all of these organs is affected. Sherr acknowledges that the current sample of just 10 patients with RERE mutations, who each experience slightly different symptoms with notably different levels of severity, is too small to give a complete portrait of the new syndrome.  Now that we ve seen the first 10 cases, we want to know what the next 10, the next 20 look like,  he said.  That may not take very long. Before we d even published the paper, we d already gotten calls from more clinics around the country whose patients have similar mutations. We suspect this syndrome may be significantly more common than we previously appreciated.  The empowerment of families through social media and the plummeting cost of of gene sequencing technologies have produced a revolution in the pace of discovery about rare genetic conditions, Sherr said.  In the last five years alone there s been a huge explosion in the number of conditions we can decipher genetically   we can take a few kids with developmental disabilities, come up with a coherent genetic explanation for what has happened and use that as first step for how to move forward  he said.  When I started working in child neurology as a fellow back in the late  90s, we understood just a few of these super-rare genetic disorders but now there are hundreds. And we re just getting started.

Many doctors and scientists think they could improve the diagnosis and understanding of autism spectrum disorders if they had reliable means to identify specific abnormalities in the brain. Such  biomarkers  have proven elusive, often because methods that show promise with one group of patients fail when applied to another. In a new study in Nature Communications, however, scientists report a new degree of success. Their proposed biomarker worked with a comparably high degree of accuracy in assessing two diverse sets of adults. See Also: New insights into the male bias of autism The technology, principally developed at the Advanced Telecommunications Research (ATR) Institute International in Kyoto, Japan, with the major contributions from three co-authors at Brown University, is a computer algorithm called a  classifier  because it can classify sets of subjects   those with an autism spectrum disorder and those without   based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans. By analyzing thousands of connections of brain network connectivity in scores of people with and without autism, the software found 16 key interregional functional connections that allowed it to tell, with high accuracy, who had been traditionally diagnosed with autism and who had not. The team developed the classifier with 181 adult volunteers at three sites in Japan and then applied it in a group of 88 American adults at seven sites. All the study volunteers with autism diagnoses had no intellectual disability.  It is the first study to [successfully] apply a classifier to a totally different cohort,  said co-corresponding author Yuka Sasaki, a research associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown.  There have been numerous attempts before. We finally overcame the problem.  The classifier, which blends two machine-learning algorithms, worked well in each population, averaging 85 percent accuracy among the Japanese volunteers and 75 percent accuracy among the Americans. The researchers calculated that the probability of seeing this degree of cross-population performance purely by chance was 1.4 in a million. Learn More: Study reveals autism's 'noisy' secret  These results indicate that although we developed a highly reliable classifier using the training data only in Japan, it is sufficiently universal to classify [autism] in the U.S.A. validation cohort,  wrote the team of clinicians and basic researchers led by Mitsuo Kawato of ATR. In another way of validating the classifier, the researchers asked whether the differences it notes in the 16 connections were predictive not only of whether a person had an autism diagnosis at all, but whether they relate to performance on the main diagnostic method currently available to clinicians, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. ADOS is based not on markers of biology or physiology, but instead on a doctor s interviews and observations of behavior. The classifier was able to predict scores on the ADOS communications component with a statistically significant correlation of 0.44. The correlation suggests that the 16 connections identified by the classifier relate to attributes of importance in ADOS. When the researchers examined where these 16 connections are and what brain networks they affect, they found that 41 percent of the specific brain regions in which the 16 connections reside belonged within the cingulo-opercular network, which matters to brain functions such as conceiving of other people, face processing and emotional processing. Difficulties with such social and emotional perception tasks are important symptoms in autism spectrum disorders. Finally, the team looked to see whether the classifier appropriately reflects the similarities and differences between autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric conditions. Autism, for example, is known to share some similarities with schizophrenia but not with depression or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as indicated by a previous genome study. Applied to patients with each of these other disorders compared to similar people without the conditions, the classifier showed moderate but statistically significant accuracy in distinguishing schizophrenia patients, but not depression or ADHD patients. The MRI scans required to gather the data were simple, Sasaki said. Subjects only needed to spend about 10 minutes in the machine and didn t have to perform any special tasks. They just had to stay still and rest. Related: Largest-ever autism genome study finds most siblings have different autism-risk genes Despite that simplicity and even though the classifier performed unprecedentedly well as a matter of research, Sasaki said, it is not yet ready to be a clinical tool. While the future may bring that development, refinements will be necessary first.  The accuracy level needs to be much higher,  Sasaki said.  Eighty percent accuracy may not be useful in the real world.  It s also not clear how it would work among children, as the volunteers in this study were all adults. But if the classifier s accuracy can be improved further, the researchers hope that it can be used not only as a physiology-based diagnostic tool but also for monitoring treatment. Doctors perhaps will be able to use the tool someday to monitor whether therapies produce changes in brain connectivity, Sasaki said.

Millions of people have trouble with these transitions - they find it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep at night, and hard to stay awake during the day. Despite decades of research, how these transitions work the neurobiological mechanics of our circadian rhythm has remained largely a mystery to brain scientists. Now, however, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM) have identified the workings of a key pathway for these processes. The pathway that appears to play a key role in regulating the ""switch"" between wakefulness and sleep. This is the first study to elucidate this process in such biophysical detail. See Also: Biologists explore link between memory deficit and misfiring circadian clock Andrea Meredith, PhD, Associate Professor of Physiology at UM SOM, focused on a particular brain area, the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. This region acts as the brain's internal clock, determining when we feel like going to sleep, how long we sleep, and when we feel like getting up. Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is known as the SCN, she focused on certain ion channels, proteins that conduct electrical current, relaying information from one neuron to another. She focused on a group of channels known as BK potassium channels, which seem to be particularly active in the SCN. In the paper, which appeared recently in Nature Communications, Dr. Meredith examined mice, whose schedule is opposite to humans they sleep during the day and are awake at night. She found that BK channels are active during waking, which for the mice was at night; during the day the BK channels were inactive. She found that in this daytime context, the role of the BK channels is to inhibit wakefulness. Prof. Meredith examined normal mice, along with mice that had been genetically altered so that their BK channels could not be inactivated. She then recorded activity in these channels, via electrodes placed in SCN neurons. In the brains of the genetically modified group, the animals that could not inactivate their BK channels, she found lower levels of neuronal activity, which was associated with more daytime wakefulness. This was unusual, because mice generally sleep during the day. The new findings are surprising, for several reasons. The researchers didn't know of any physiological process in the body that relied on BK channel inactivation as a mechanism. Scientists had known that the channel acted in this way, but didn't know how neurons used this mechanism to regulate information coding in the brain. This is the first study to show that BK channel inactivation is critical for encoding circadian rhythm in the brain. Previously, BK channels had been known to be important for regulating other physiological functions. They are important for activating muscles, and play a prominent role in controlling blood pressure, heart rate, and bladder function. In the brain, BK channels have been known to be involved in regulating neuronal excitability, and play a role in motor control, learning and memory. In the brain, dysfunction in BK channels is associated with tremors, seizures, addiction, and problems with learning and memory. Learn More: Network of circadian neurons that communicate to re-establish synchronization revealed to single-cell resolution ""We knew that BK channels were widely important throughout the body,"" says Prof. Meredith. ""But now we have strong evidence that they are specifically and intrinsically involved in the wake-sleep cycle. That's really exciting."" Also, in the past, scientists had thought that the day-night pattern of firing was largely driven by a different mechanism, the number of ion channels that exist on the surface of SCN neurons. The new paper showed that this model is too simplistic. The new study shows that the key is not the number of channels, but the fact that the channels are being activated, and more importantly, inactivated, at specific times of day. The discovery has clinical implications. Prof. Meredith says the new understanding of the inactivation mechanism could potentially be used to develop drugs that target circadian rhythms. Such a medication could be used to treat sleep disorders, jet lag, and seasonal affective disorder, all of which involve problems with the SCN circadian clock.

Lower dopamine release was found in the striatum a brain region involved in working memory, impulsive behavior, and attention. Previous studies have shown that addiction to other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and heroin, have similar effects on dopamine release, but such evidence for cannabis was missing until now. See Also: Starting age of marijuana use may have long-term effects on brain development ""In light of the more widespread acceptance and use of marijuana, especially by young people, we believe it is important to look more closely at the potentially addictive effects of cannabis on key regions of the brain,"" said Anissa Abi-Dargham, MD, professor of psychiatry (in radiology) at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and a lead author of the paper. The study included 11 adults between the ages of 21 and 40 who were severely dependent on cannabis and 12 matched healthy controls. On average, the cannabis group started using at age 16, became dependent on cannabis by age 20, and have been dependent for the past 7 years. In the month prior to the study, nearly all users in this study smoked marijuana daily. Learn More: Study shows medical marijuana decreases migraines Using positron emission tomography (PET) to track a radiolabelled molecule that binds to dopamine receptors in the brain, the scientists measured dopamine release in the striatum and its subregions, as well as in several brain regions outside the striatum, including the thalamus, midbrain, and globus pallidus. The cannabis users in this study stayed in the hospital for a week of abstinence to ensure that the PET scans were not measuring the acute effects of the drug. Participants were scanned before and after being given oral amphetamine to elicit dopamine release. The percent change in the binding of the radiotracer was taken as an indicator of capacity for dopamine release. Compared with the controls, the cannabis users had significantly lower dopamine release in the striatum, including subregions involved in associative and sensorimotor learning, and in the globus pallidus. The investigators also explored the relationship between dopamine release in a key area of the striatum and cognitive performance on learning and working memory tasks. Although there was no difference between groups in task performance, in all participants lower dopamine release was associated with worse performance on both tasks.

Check the growth chart that the doctor gives you after each yearly checkup. Want to know if your child s brain is on track for healthy attention abilities? Someday, your doctor might have a growth chart for that too. See Also: Inside the adult ADHD brain New research from the University of Michigan (U-M) Medical School suggests that it might be possible to create a growth chart of brain networks that could identify early signs of attention difficulties and, potentially, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The team created the experimental growth chart by mapping the development of brain networks in more than 500 children and teens. They found networks are underdeveloped in those who have attention difficulties. While it s far too soon to start offering such charting to families, future development of the technique could mean better chances for children to get a firm diagnosis of ADHD sooner. It could also help track whether their ADHD treatment is improving their attention functioning, which can help them in school and life.  Growth Charts as Biomarkers The research, published in JAMA Psychiatry, shows the potential for brain imaging  biomarkers  for attention problems. But the idea could extend to other psychological conditions. Traditional growth charts show a child s height and weight as points on curves that are based on data from hundreds of thousands of other children, and indicate normal, near-normal and problematic development. Learn More: Utah study links rates of ADHD to altitude  Growth charts enable a family and their physician to quickly spot problematic development, and when necessary, intervene appropriately,  said team leader and U-M psychiatrist Chandra Sripada, MD, PhD  In the future, we want to provide clinicians with the same sort of guidance about brain development that we can about things like height and weight.  The researchers launched the growth-charting research after noticing a gap in the state of the science. Lead author Daniel Kessler explains,  We knew that the ability to sustain attention for an extended time increases dramatically during childhood and adolescence. We also knew that over the same time period, there are big changes in brain networks involved in attention. We came up with the idea of growth charting as a way to test if these two patterns were related: Would children with underdeveloped brain networks also have more difficulty with attention?  Along with colleague Michael Angstadt, MAS, the researchers used data from 519 children and teens who had genetic testing, brain imaging and tests of their cognitive development as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort based at the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers created growth charts that reflected the configuration of what are called intrinsic connectivity networks important units of functional brain organization. The way these networks interact may hold the key to healthy attention. For example, one called the default mode network seems to be involved in daydreaming and inwardly focused thought, whereas another set of networks are involved in cognitively demanding tasks. As we grow from children into adults, these two systems become more defined and separate, working in tandem like pistons: when one is on, the other turns off. But in children and those with attention difficulties, the  pistons  often misfire: the default mode network turns on and interrupts the other networks thereby interrupting attention. The researchers who gathered the data that the growth chart is based on measured attention functioning using a standard test in which children had to respond to a sequence of letters and numbers on a computer screen. The Michigan researchers then compared the brain development seen on the scans to attention functioning. Related: A global surge in ADHD diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine It turned out they could actually predict how well a child would do on the attention test based on their place on (or off) the brain network growth chart. The children with ADHD symptoms, and those with the lowest performance for their age on the attention tests, were the furthest off the curve of brain network development.   These brain network growth charts show real promise,  said Sripada, an assistant professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and Department of Philosophy.  But they are far away from being ready for clinical use.  The research used advanced MRI imaging, but Sripada and his colleagues hope to develop ways to track network maturity using less-expensive techniques such as electroencephalography, or EEG. They re working with other U-M researchers, led by Mary Heitzeg, PhD, and Robert Zucker, PhD, to see if the growth charting method will be useful in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD for short) that will involve 10,000 teens over several years.  The ABCD study is unprecedented in size and provides a real chance to develop definitive growth charts for brain networks,  explained Sripada.  We have the opportunity to understand how brain network development relates to a variety of outcomes, including cognition, emotion, personality, and behavior.

Immunovaccine will then formulate new antigens in its DepoVax  delivery system for pre-clinical testing. Together, the companies hope this project could serve as a replicable model for expediting the development and manufacture of vaccines to address current and future health emergencies.  Our virtual pharma approach ensures that we are not beholden to a particular technology or laboratory,  said Leidos Deputy Group President, Jerry Hogge.  We are able to seek the best solutions to suit the project at hand. This includes our partnership with Immunovaccine, which leverages the best capabilities of both companies.  Immunovaccine s proprietary DepoVax  adjuvanting delivery platform has been shown in multiple studies to produce a strong, high-quality immune response that has a specific and sustained immune effect with the potential for single-dose effectiveness. The platform has been shown to extend exposure of the immune system to practically any antigen and can be readily combined with other vaccine development strategies.  The understanding of the Zika virus and its public health threat is expanding almost daily. With current vaccine development models, there is too long between identification of risk of an epidemic and the creation of an effective vaccine.

The team uncovered a hidden energy switch that, when flipped, powers up pancreatic cells to respond to glucose, a step that eluded previous research. The result is the production of hundreds of millions of lab-produced human beta cells able to relieve diabetes in mice. For more than a decade, scientists across the globe strived to replace failing pancreatic beta cells linked to immune destruction in children (type 1 diabetes) or obesity-associated diabetes in adults (type 2 diabetes). Although cells made in a dish were able to produce insulin, they were sluggish or simply unable to respond to glucose.  We found the missing energy switch needed to produce robust and functional human beta cells, potentially turning this discovery into a viable treatment for human diabetes,  says Ronald Evans, co-senior author and director of the Gene Expression Laboratory at Salk. The new work was published in Cell Metabolism on April 12, 2016. The Salk technology begins with induced pluripotent cells (iPSC), a stem cell technique where tissue from a patient such as skin is reprogrammed into other types of cells, such as from the pancreas. This step yields the pre-beta cells, which produce insulin but are not yet functional. While several research groups reached this juncture, the road forward to functional cells was not clear.  Pancreatic beta cells must be able to do two things to work effectively: respond to glucose and produce insulin,  says Evans, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and the March of Dimes Chair in Molecular and Developmental Biology.  No one had been able to figure out how to make pancreatic cells from human patients that can do both until now.  The Salk team closely studied the basic biology of a beta cell and uncovered several molecular switches, called transcription factors, that were switched off but might control the transition to a fully functional state. The  secret sauce,  the Salk team found, was one particular switch the Evans lab had studied for years for its role in cell signaling. This protein switch, called ERR-gamma, turned out to be crucial to awaken silent beta-like cells that could now respond to glucose and release insulin accordingly.  This advance will result in a better controlled insulin response than currently available treatments,  says Michael Downes, co-senior author and a Salk senior staff scientist.  Previously there was nothing known about the maturation process in beta cells. We peeked into that black box and now we know what s going on.  He adds that the team s technique is an easy, fast and inexpensive way to make transplantable human pancreatic beta cells in a dish that genetically match patients.  When we added ERR-gamma to pre-diabetic beta cells in a dish, we successfully created a glucose-responsive, beta-like cell,  says Eiji Yoshihara, first author of the paper and a Salk research associate.  And when we remove ERR-gamma from animals, the glucose response is eliminated, proving that the factor is the master regulator of maturation for the beta cell.  But can these beta cells successfully treat diabetes? The Salk researchers found that, indeed, when the matured beta cells were transplanted into type 1 diabetic mice, the procedure quickly rescued their diabetes.  Hopefully, this mirrors what would happen in the clinic after someone is diagnosed with diabetes they could potentially get this treatment,  says Evans.  It s exciting because it suggests that cells in a dish are ready to go.  The researchers hope to move to human trials within the next few years.","Published: April 14, 2016"

The Parker Institute includes six centers   UCSF, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford Medicine, UCLA, the University of Pennsylvania and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The UCSF center will be directed by Lewis Lanier, PhD, the J. Michael Bishop, MD, Distinguished Professor and chair of UCSF s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, which is ranked #2 worldwide by US News & World Report. The Parker Institute s goal is to accelerate the development of breakthrough immune therapies capable of turning cancer into a curable disease by ensuring the coordination and collaboration of the field s top researchers and quickly translating their findings into patient treatments. The Parker Institute includes over 40 laboratories and more than 300 researchers from the country s top cancer centers. Each Parker Institute center has received initial funding of $10 million to $15 million, investments that will continue to grow on an annual basis through additional project grants, shared resources and central funding.  We are at an inflection point in cancer research and now is the time to maximize immunotherapy s unique potential to transform all cancers into manageable diseases, saving millions of lives,  said Parker, president of The Parker Foundation.  We believe that the creation of a new funding and research model can overcome many of the obstacles that currently prevent research breakthroughs. Working closely with our scientists and more than 30 industry partners, the Parker Institute is positioned to broadly disseminate discoveries and, most importantly, more rapidly deliver treatments to patients.  A Breakthrough Treatment Paradigm While at the University of Chicago in the mid-1990s, Bluestone and colleagues discovered that a protein called CTLA-4 can act as a checkpoint, or  brake,  on the immune response. This work formed the basis for the development of checkpoint-blockade drugs, therapies that have been much in the news for achieving dramatic remissions of advanced cancers in some patients, particularly in cases of melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer. New checkpoint inhibitors are now in development for virtually all types of cancer.  Immunotherapy represents a fundamentally new, breakthrough treatment paradigm in the fight against cancer   it harnesses the body s own powerful immune system to mobilize its highly refined disease-fighting arsenal to engage and eliminate the cancer cells,  said Bluestone. A former executive vice chancellor and provost at UCSF, Bluestone was the founder and served for 10 years as director of the Immune Tolerance Network, the largest NIH-funded multicenter clinical immunology research program.  Parker Institute scientists at all six centers are leaders in the field and will now work together to make discoveries to treat and potentially cure cancer.  Entrepreneurial Mindset for Immunotherapy Research Parker Institute centers have access to dedicated research and clinical resources, as well as to key technologies needed to accelerate research discoveries in cancer immunotherapy. In a unique agreement among the centers, the administration of intellectual property will be shared, enabling all researchers to have immediate access to a broad swath of core discoveries.  The Parker Institute is unique in that it makes it possible for scientists to mobilize resources quickly when they have an exciting new idea, and to begin experiments to test that idea as rapidly as possible,  said Lanier, who leads the Cancer, Immunity, and Microenvironment Program at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. This entrepreneurial mindset should considerably accelerate progress in immunotherapy, a field with immense promise for cancer patients.  The Parker Institute s emphasis on collaboration will also speed up research, Lanier said, citing the fact that only about 20 percent of patients with certain types of cancer respond to checkpoint-blockade drugs.  Though these drugs have led to dramatic cancer remissions in many patients, finding out how to increase the response rate is a major goal in the field. By amassing patient data from six centers, we can figure out that question six times as quickly.  Applying Research to New Treatments Complementing UCSF s Parker Institute center is a new Cancer Immunotherapy Program (CIP), located at the UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus Heights. Lawrence Fong, MD, co-clinical director of UCSF s Parker Institute center, will lead the CIP, offering state-of-the-art treatments and clinical trial opportunities for patients.  Immunotherapies are changing the paradigm for how we treat patients with cancer,  said Fong, the Efim Guzik Distinguished Professor in Cancer Biology, and a cancer immunotherapy pioneer.  I believe they will prove valuable in treating many, if not most, types of cancer. In the context of clinical trials, we aim to provide access to novel immunotherapies that patients otherwise would not have access to.  Alan Ashworth, PhD, FRS, president of the Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and E. Dixon Heise Distinguished Professor in Oncology, said that UCSF s Parker Institute center will be a boon to researchers, physicians and patients alike.  Cancer immunotherapy is a transformative approach to treating cancer, and we at UCSF are thrilled to be part of this unique nationwide alliance of top cancer centers,  Ashworth said.  By joining forces with other researchers, our scientists can make discoveries more rapidly, and our physicians can offer their patients access to the newest cancer immunotherapies and clinical trials.  The Parker Institute center is the latest in a series of investments made by The Parker Foundation to advance research at UCSF. In July, 2015 the Foundation donated $4.5 million to UCSF s Global Health Group to develop innovative and aggressive approaches to combat the mosquito species that transmits malaria. In November, 2015 a $10 million gift from the Foundation established the Sean N. Parker Autoimmune Research Laboratory, in which Bluestone leads research on diseases such at type 1 diabetes.  With his generosity and creativity, Sean Parker has backed some of the most dynamic research programs at UCSF,  said Chancellor Sam Hawgood, MBBS.  The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, including its affiliated center on our campus, is Sean s boldest initiative to date, and we are proud to play important roles in this nationwide effort that will profoundly transform the understanding and treatment of cancer.

Inspired by pregnancy tests, researchers from Florida Atlantic University, Stanford University, and Baskent University in Turkey, have developed a novel method to store microfluidic devices for CD4 T cell testing in extreme weather conditions for up to six months without refrigeration. Microfluidic devices with immunochemistry have broad applications in chemotherapy monitoring, transplant patient monitoring, and especially in monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy.  Monitoring HIV patients at point-of-care settings in resource-constrained countries like Africa is critical in knowing how their treatment is progressing and whether or not a particular drug is working the way it should be,  said Waseem Asghar, Ph.D., co-first author on the study and assistant professor of electrical engineering in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at FAU. This research also has employed a lensless imaging method to rapidly count CD4 T cells using CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensor   the same imaging sensor found in cell phone cameras. Lensless imaging technology allows rapid cell counting and does not require skilled technicians to operate, making it suitable for point-of-care settings. If produced at a large scale, the microfluidic device would cost less than $1 compared with the current cost of a CD4 assay which is about $30-$50.  Similar to pregnancy tests that can be stored at room temperature, we investigated methods to store and preserve multi-layer, immuno-functionalized microfluidic devices in refrigeration-free settings for applications in resource-limited settings at the point-of-care,"" said Utkan Demirci, Ph.D., senior author of the paper, Stanford University School of Medicine.   Current microfluidic devices used for biomedical applications to test for various diseases and conditions including HIV and cancer need to be stored at low temperatures (4 to 8 degrees centigrade) to prevent the degradation of antibodies. In addition, transporting these biomaterials is expensive and increases the assay costs.  Asghar and his colleagues used trehalose, a form of sugar that is present in some plants and animals, to preserve the microfluidic device. Since trehalose has the capability to enable plants to thrive in very harsh hot and cold conditions, they determined that it could have the same effect on multi-layer surfaces like a microfluidic device. They packaged and vacuum sealed the trelahose treated device in plastic and used a drying agent to address the effects of humidity. They exposed the device to extreme weather conditions in a laboratory environment to test its functionality and shelf-life.   Results of the study revealed that they were able to preserve the microfluidic devices over a period of six months using this method. At room temperature, they observed 90 percent specificity for up to six months.  The researchers also integrated these stabilized microfluidic devices post-reactivation with the CMOS lensless imaging technology. The captured CD4 T cells were counted rapidly and automatically from unprocessed whole blood, creating a portable, battery-operated, inexpensive, and microscope-free CD4 T cell counting platform with a long shelf-life.  This technology also is widely applicable to global health applications when resources are limited to address viral load, sepsis, tuberculosis, malaria, as well as cancer detection. It also offers advantages in the developed world in settings such as in a primary care physician s office or in the home setting,  said Asghar.","Published: April 14, 2016"

The team uncovered a hidden energy switch that, when flipped, powers up pancreatic cells to respond to glucose, a step that eluded previous research. The result is the production of hundreds of millions of lab-produced human beta cells able to relieve diabetes in mice. For more than a decade, scientists across the globe strived to replace failing pancreatic beta cells linked to immune destruction in children (type 1 diabetes) or obesity-associated diabetes in adults (type 2 diabetes). Although cells made in a dish were able to produce insulin, they were sluggish or simply unable to respond to glucose.  We found the missing energy switch needed to produce robust and functional human beta cells, potentially turning this discovery into a viable treatment for human diabetes,  says Ronald Evans, co-senior author and director of the Gene Expression Laboratory at Salk.

This license agreement will enable BioSilta will combine its EnPresso culture systems technology with CyDisCo protein production technology to make EnPresso-CyDisCo expression systems available to scientists and bio-processing engineers. As part of the agreement, BioSilta will also have future access to those that invented and enhanced the CyDisCo protein production technology for future R&D consultation   Prof. Lloyd Ruddock and his group from the University of Oulu Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Future intellectual property will be shared between both parties. The EnPresso-CyDisCo expression systems will provide scientists and bio-processing engineers with a tool set to produce difficult and hard to produce proteins. These proteins can be produced in any strain of E. coli, including full size antibodies and antibody fragments. In addition, these technologies enable and enhance the production of many other proteins containing multiple disulphide bonds, such as hormones and bioactive peptides. The EnPresso-CyDisCo technology will also provide a system that will deliver proteins with higher yields, level of quality and consistency. The BioSilta EnPresso-CyDisCo technology will be essential towards five major industries that need production of difficult and hard to produce proteins. These industries include life sciences, where small to medium scale production of proteins in a short time scale is essential to support research. The diagnostic industry will also benefit, with proteins essential for early detection of critical diseases, and the therapeutics industry, for the development of novel biologic drugs and lowering the cost of production of bio-similar and bio-better drugs. As many as 7 of the top selling drugs in any recent year are protein based. Other industries that will benefit from protein production using BioSilta EnPresso-CyDisCo technology are household care, where pressures are increasing to produce high efficiency detergent systems effective at lower temperatures to reduce energy and environmental impact, and the food and beverage sector, to reduce costs of healthier food products whilst increasing shelf life using natural additives. BioSilta also has the option to explore future production in brewing and bio-fuel industries.  This is a critical deal for BioSilta, enabling the combination of two technologies that will become a major part of future efforts of the company. This will enable us to address multiple, critical unmet needs in protein production that will be applicable to a wide variety of industries,  said Paul Whitaker, Managing Director, BioSilta.  As a former spin-out of the University of Oulu, BioSilta already has maintained extensive links with the academic institution, and this has resulted in access to a technology which provides an essential solution to wide ranging problems across a variety of sectors. BioSilta s on-going research & development is directed to solving other critical problems within these sectors through a series of future efforts.  Producing proteins in bacterial expression systems like E. coli are simple, stable, productive and highly scalable with low production costs. However, production has been limited to certain types of proteins that are easier to produce. Proteins produced in mammalian cell line expression systems have to date been unreliable and unstable, with increased time and costs of production, increased by considerable and complex intellectual property rights. Improving bacterial expression systems by mutating E. coli strains to express difficult and hard to produce proteins has often resulted in low yields and low protein quality.","Published: April 13, 2016"

The program will be led by Bernhard Palsson, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Bioengineering and Pediatrics, and Victor Nizet, MD, professor of pediatrics and pharmacy. Bacteria that no longer reliably respond to antibiotic therapy, so-called  superbugs,  pose one of the greatest threats in modern medicine. Superbugs, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), often strike hospitalized patients, the elderly or those with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that at least 2 million Americans become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections.  I worry that approaches currently used in the clinic to evaluate antibiotic activity are antiquated and simplistic, and address the drug s action only on bacteria growing in artificial laboratory media without attention to the human immune system,  Nizet said.  Our research has shown that certain antibiotics can synergize with the natural defenses of our immune system to clear infections in a way that wouldn t have been predicted by current testing paradigms."" Palsson is a leader in the emerging field of systems biology, which explores the complexity of living systems   from the genome to the entire organism   using experimental and computational methods. Concerned by the exploding problem of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, Palsson reached out to Nizet, a physician-scientist, to explore whether systems-level approaches could be coupled with experimental models of antibiotic drugs, living bacterial pathogens, human immune cells and animal models of infection to benefit patients with antibiotic-resistant infections.  Dr. Nizet s work demonstrates how unexpected environmental factors influence the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, improving treatment outcomes in serious or antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection will require systems-level analyses at the molecular level,  said Palsson.  We could paraphrase and honor geneticist and evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky s famous quote by saying:  Nothing in biology makes sense, except in the light of systems thinking.   By bringing together researchers from our School of Medicine, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Jacobs School of Engineering, this new center embodies the collaborative, interdisciplinary spirit for which UC San Diego is known,  said David Brenner, MD, vice chancellor of UC San Diego Health Sciences and dean of UC San Diego School of Medicine.  We re grateful to the NIH for recognizing our leading-edge capabilities in medicine, engineering and computer science, and for supporting researchers ambitious and talented enough to take on one of the greatest global medical challenges of our time.

When cancer develops, old or damaged cells survive rather than dying, and new cells form when they re not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors. As tumors grow, some cancer cells can break off and spread to other places in the body, a process called metastasis. To migrate to another area, cancer cells must move through a dense scaffolding of proteins called the extracellular matrix. The cells can cut their way through by using molecular scissors, or enzymes. They can also physically contort to fit through small openings called pores. When squeezing through, cells have a limitation: the nucleus, a large structure surrounded by a protective outer lining called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus is substantially more rigid than the rest of the cell. Deforming it is risky because it houses the cell s DNA and serves as a vital control center. A research group headed by Dr. Jan Lammerding at Cornell University investigated what happens to nuclei as cells distort to get through the extracellular matrix. They designed a microfluidic device to watch cells move through pore sizes that mimic those in the extracellular matrix in tissues. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The researchers examined breast cancer, fibrosarcoma, and human skin fibroblast cells. As the cells squished through pores that were about the size of their nuclei or smaller, the nuclear envelopes sometimes ruptured. The chance of nuclei ripping open increased exponentially as pore sizes decreased. By labeling nuclear proteins with green and red fluorescent tags, the researchers were able to watch as the torn nuclei let proteins spill out into the cell. They saw similar results in biological environments, either using fibrillar collagen matrices or imaging cancer cells moving inside living mice. The nuclear tears were only temporary, and the membranes closed shortly after. However, the researchers observed that DNA damage had occurred during the nuclear deformation and rupturing. Nearly 90% of cells survived despite these injuries. Further investigation revealed that, upon rupturing, members of the ESCRT family of proteins appeared at the site of damage and resealed the nuclear membranes. Inhibiting these proteins didn t increase cell death. Neither did blocking the cells  DNA damage-repair machinery. But blocking both together substantially increased cell death after nuclear envelope rupture.  Most cells in the body stay in place, and it s presumably mostly cancer cells that are moving around,  Lammerding says.  So if we can block the mechanisms that allow them to repair themselves, then we potentially could target metastatic cancer cells.  Metastatic cells are not the only cells that migrate throughout the body and infiltrate tissues. In order to develop treatments that avoid interfering with healthy cells, future research will be needed to identify deformation and repair properties that are unique to invading cancer cells.","Published: April 13, 2016"

The reviewed data shows that in the first cohort comprising 3 patients treated, there was a good safety profile with no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the WT1-TCR T cell therapy. Importantly, the therapy also met the protocol specified requirements for cell persistence, showing that the WT1 targeted T cells can survive and expand in patients. Passing this first interim review has enabled the clinical trial to enter its second phase. Dosing has now successfully started in the second cohort of patients in the trial which allows patients to receive a higher dose of the gene modified WT1 TCR T cells.   The therapy uses TCR gene-modified T cells to target WT1-overexpressing cells. It involves modification by gene therapy of the patient's own T cells, so that they may recognise and destroy WT1-expressing cells when infused back into the body. It shows potential in disorders such as acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and has been ranked by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) as the number 1 target for cancer immunotherapy. The trial is operated by Catapult Therapy TCR Limited, a company formed by the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult with UCLB and Imperial Innovations to develop the T cell therapy, and is supported by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at University College London Hospitals. Pre-clinical development of the TCR gene therapy programme was supported by Bloodwise, previously Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research. In August 2015 the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult appointed Cellular Therapeutics Limited (CTL), as a manufacturer for the clinical trial.  Developing TCR gene-modified T cells to target WT1-overexpressing cells continues to show promise as an immunotherapy for a range of cancers including the trials that we have underway in acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome,  said Keith Thompson, CEO, the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult.  The progress of the WT1 TCR clinical trials supported by the positive DSMB review, is encouraging and we look forward to expanding these trials across the UK and Europe. Further results are expected during 2017.

Both drugs have previously been shown to benefit patients with renal cell carcinoma when the disease has already spread to other parts of the body.  This study was designed to determine if a one-year course of treatment with two different drugs that block blood vessel proliferation within the tumor microenvironment would improve the progression-free and overall survival of patients with renal cell cancer,  Dr. Kuzel said.  Unfortunately, neither of the drugs demonstrated benefit compared with the placebo control arm, and both study drugs were associated with significant side effects.  Renal cell carcinoma, the most common type of kidney cancer, occurs when malignant cells develop from the lining of small tubes in the kidney responsible for filtering blood. About one-third of patients diagnosed with the cancer will die from metastatic disease. It is currently difficult to predict whether renal cell carcinoma will recur, which is why investigators are interested in discovering new adjuvant therapies. The drugs sunitinib and sorafenib inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, a protein involved in the formation of new blood vessels, a process thought to assist in tumor growth. The results of the trial, however, suggest that the development of blood vessels may not be associated with cancer recurrence after all   or that the benefits of inhibiting it are too small to have been detected in this trial. In the study, nearly 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive sunitinib, sorafenib or a placebo showed no significance differences in disease-free survival. More than half of the patients in the experimental groups experienced severe adverse events. Altogether, these results led the investigators to a clear conclusion.  It s important that practitioners do not use these drugs in patients with completely resected renal cell cancers that they feel are at high risk of recurrence,  said Dr. Kuzel, who is director of the Walter S. and Lucienne Driskill Immunotherapy Research Program within the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.  This study reaffirms that observation and close surveillance should be recommended to assess risk of disease recurrence in this population, as per guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

Nicknamed  Schlep  or  SHLP  for  small humanin-like peptides,  these proteins appear to play several big roles in our bodies  cells, from decreasing the amount of damaging free radicals and controlling the rate at which cells die, to boosting metabolism and helping tissues throughout the body respond better to insulin. The naturally occurring amounts of each protein decrease with age, leading researchers to believe that they play an important role in the aging process and the onset of age-related diseases. The research team led by Pinchas Cohen, dean and professor of the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, identified the tiny proteins for the first time and observed their surprising origin: organelles in the cell called mitochondria and their game-changing roles in metabolism and cell survival. This latest finding builds upon prior research by Cohen and his team that uncovered two significant proteins, humanin and MOTS-c, hormones that appear to have significant roles in metabolism and diseases of aging. Unlike most other proteins, humanin and MOTS-c are encoded in mitochondria, the structure within cells that produces energy from food, instead of in the cell s nucleus where most genes are contained. Mitochondria have their own small collection of genes, which were once thought to play only minor roles within cells, but recent research indicates that they have important functions throughout the body. Cohen s team used computer analysis to see if the part of the mitochondrial genome that provides the code for humanin was coding for other proteins as well, and uncovered the six new proteins. The team examined both mouse tissues and human cells to determine their abundance in different organs, as well as their functions. The proteins were distributed quite differently among organs, which suggests that the proteins have varying functions based on where they are in the body. Of particular interest is SHLP 2, Cohen said. The protein appears to have profound insulin-sensitizing, anti-diabetic effects as well as potent neuro-protective activity that may emerge as a strategy to combat Alzheimer s disease. He added that SHLP 6 is also intriguing, with a unique ability to promote cancer cell death and thus potentially target malignant diseases.  Together, with the previously identified mitochondrial peptides, the newly recognized SHLP family expands the understanding of the mitochondria as an intracellular signaling organelle that communicates with the rest of the body to regulate metabolism and cell fate,  Cohen said.  The findings are an important advance that will be ripe for rapid translation into drug development for diseases of aging. ","Published: April 13, 2016"

If a T-cell surface receptor detects a threat during its surveillance, it relays a signal to the interior of the cell and activates it to attack. Once this crucial  call of duty  is heard in the cell, how the signal is relayed through a series of proteins to activate the cell s immune response is clarified in a new paper in Science by a team working at the Whitman Center of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole. By successfully re-creating a T-cell receptor signaling pathway independent of the cell itself, the scientists gained novel insights into how protein signaling works in a complex cellular process.    We focused on one T-cell receptor signaling pathway involving 12 different proteins, but what we discovered is probably reflective of the way other signaling pathways happen in the cell, as well,  said co-author Ron Vale, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator at the University of California, San Francisco and a Whitman Center scientist. The study, supported by HHMI, was performed by scientists from several institutions who convene at the MBL to work collaboratively. Their study revealed  a very important self-organization of the protein molecules in the signaling pathway, where they end up clustering to form dense structures in which the proteins are talking to one another,  Vale said. The protein molecules separate into structures by a process similar to phase separation of oil and water, he said.  That spatial organization seems to be very important for the efficiency of the signaling pathway.   It s very important that we could conduct this research at MBL,  Vale said.  This reconstitution was a complicated undertaking that was beyond what any single lab could do. At MBL, we could bring all these labs together with different expertise to make it work.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibiotics-dont-promote-swapping-of-resistance-genes-186645,Antibiotics Don t Promote Swapping of Resistance Genes Bacterial resistance spreads through population dynamics  not an increase in gene transfers  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers have shown that, outside of a few specific examples, antibiotics do not promote the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance through genetic swapping, as previously assumed. While the overuse of antibiotics is undeniably at the heart of the growing global crisis, new research published online April 11 in Nature Microbiology suggests differential birth and death rates and not DNA donation are to blame. The results have implications for designing antibiotic protocols to avoid the spread of antibacterial resistance.  The entire field knows there s a huge problem of overusing antibiotics,  said Lingchong You, the Paul Ruffin Scarborough Associate Professor of Engineering at Duke University and lead author on the paper.  It is incredibly tempting to assume that antibiotics are promoting the spread of resistance by increasing the rate at which bacteria share resistant genes with each other, but our research shows they often aren t.  It s long been known that bacteria can swap DNA through a process called conjugation, which allows helpful genes to spread quickly between individuals and even between species. Because the number of resistant bacteria rises when antibiotics fail to kill them, researchers assumed that the drugs increased the amount of genetic swapping taking place. But You thought maybe the drugs were killing off the two  parent  lineages and allowing a newly resistant strain to thrive instead.  Previous studies haven t been able to tease these two ideas apart, but our work decoupled them,  said Allison Lopatkin, a doctoral student in You s laboratory and the lead author of the study.  We showed at the single-cell level that the exchange of resistant genes is not influenced by antibiotics at all, which is in contrast to the literature.  In her experiments, Lopatkin put bacterial cells under a sort of suspended animation where they could neither die nor reproduce but they could still swap genes. With the birth and death rates no longer a variable, the researchers could see how the rate of gene exchanges responded to antibiotics. They tested nine clinical pathogens commonly associated with the rapid spread of resistance and exposed them to ten common drugs representing each major class of antibiotics. The rates of gene exchange in each test remained flat and, in a few cases, actually decreased slightly as the concentration of antibiotics grew.  It would seem that when antibiotics are applied, the DNA swapping has already occurred and continues to do so,  You said.  Depending on their doses, the drugs can let the newly resistant bacteria emerge as the winners. When this occurs, the new strain is much more prevalent than before if tests are run after some growth of the new strain.  You points out that there are a few proven examples of antibiotics directly inducing the expression of the genes responsible for donating resistance, but they are very specific. For example, the antibiotic tetracycline induces the expression of genes that only transfer tetracycline resistance. The new study shows that despite these outliers, antibiotics don t promote resistance spread by inducing global changes at the cellular level. The researchers hope further research will soon help clinicians design better antibacterial protocols.  This has direct implications in terms of how we design doses and protocols,  said You.  Some antibacterial combinations can drastically promote the overall transfer dynamics. Other combinations, on the other hand, can suppress the pathogens equally well without promoting genetic transfers. These are the issues we re hoping to address in follow-up research. We re trying to learn how to design the antibiotic treatment protocols in such a way that they will be effective but won t promote the spread of antibiotic resistance. ","Published: April 13, 2016"

This retrospective study of more than 589,000 genomes was a first step for the Resilience Project and was performed with researchers from 23andMe, BGI, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, and other institutions. The Resilience Project launched in 2014 with a unique vision by Stephen Friend and Eric Schadt that by studying massive numbers of healthy adults, scientists might find rare individuals who are unaffected by genetic variants that should induce disease. Genome analysis of these resilient people could uncover naturally occurring, protective mechanisms that would serve as novel treatments for people affected by these diseases.  Most genomic studies focus on finding the cause of a disease, but we see tremendous opportunity in figuring out what keeps people healthy,  said Eric Schadt, PhD, the Jean C. and James W. Crystal Professor of Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Founding Director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.  Millions of years of evolution have produced far more protective mechanisms than we currently understand. Characterizing the intricacies of our genomes will ultimately reveal elements that could promote health in ways we haven t even imagined.  In this study, researchers analyzed DNA from 12 previously collected data sets, using a newly developed targeted sequencing panel to screen 874 genes for 584 distinct genetic diseases. The diseases, which were mostly metabolic conditions, neurological diseases, or developmental disorders, present in childhood with severe symptoms. All genomes analyzed were from adults who had never been diagnosed with any of these diseases. A sophisticated, in-depth analysis process identified 13 healthy people with genetic variants associated with eight diseases.  This study demonstrates the power of using big data to ask new biological questions,  said Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of 23andMe, which participated in the project.  More than 400,000 23andMe customers contributed to this effort, showing that engaged consumers can make a real impact on scientific research.  In narrowing the pool of potentially resilient people from an original list of nearly 16,000 candidates, the researchers encountered two significant challenges. First, more than 75% of the candidates were eliminated due to inaccurate or low-confidence variant calls in the existing data, highlighting the need for better protocols and standards for interpreting genetic data. Second, none of the 13 final candidates could be contacted with follow-up questions due to limitations in the original studies  informed consent policies. It will be impossible to determine whether these people are truly resistant to disease without additional information.  There s an important lesson here for genome scientists around the world: the value of any project becomes exponentially greater when informed consent policies allow other scientists to reach out to the original study participants,  said Stephen Friend, President of Sage Bionetworks, Professor of Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine, and co-founder of the Resilience Project.  If we could contact these 13 people, we might be even closer to finding natural protections against disease. We anticipate launching a prospective study in the future that will include a more broadly useful consent policy.  ""While most genomics research in medicine has been disease focused, this important work exemplifies the benefit of studying health and resilience the converse of disease to understand the mechanism for protection in individuals with pathogenic sequence variants,  said Eric Topol, MD, Director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, and Chief Academic Officer of Scripps Health, who was not involved in this study but has been a champion of shifting the research focus to include healthy individuals.  This makes for a standout contribution from the Icahn Institute, Sage Bionetworks, and their extensive network of collaborators.   This work demonstrates the power of scale in analyzing root genetic causes of human disease, but more importantly human health. Its focus on studying healthy individuals to understand the things that keep them healthy sounds obvious but actually lies at the vanguard of a movement which puts the engaged study participant at the center of scientific research,  said Vik Bajaj, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Verily, who was not involved in this study but has advocated for harnessing big data for improved healthcare.

According to the model, consciousness arises only in time intervals of up to 400 milliseconds, with gaps of unconsciousness in between. See Also: LSD changes consciousness by reorganizing human brain networks The driver ahead suddenly stops, and you find yourself stomping on your breaks before you even realize what is going on. We would call this a reflex, but the underlying reality is much more complex, forming a debate that goes back centuries: Is consciousness a constant, uninterrupted stream or a series of discrete bits - like the 24 frames-per-second of a movie reel? Scientists from EPFL and the universities of Ulm and Zurich, now put forward a new model of how the brain processes unconscious information, suggesting that consciousness arises only in intervals up to 400 milliseconds, with no consciousness in between. The work is published in PLOS Biology. Consciousness seems to work as continuous stream: one image or sound or smell or touch smoothly follows the other, providing us with a continuous image of the world around us. As far as we are concerned, it seems that sensory information is continuously translated into conscious perception: we see objects move smoothly, we hear sounds continuously, and we smell and feel without interruption. However, another school of thought argues that our brain collects sensory information only at discrete time-points, like a camera taking snapshots. Even though there is a growing body of evidence against ""continuous"" consciousness, it also looks like that the ""discrete"" theory of snapshots is too simple to be true. Learn More: Functional brain imaging reliably predicts which vegetative patients have potential to recover consciousness Michael Herzog at EPFL, working with Frank Scharnowski at the University of Zurich, have now developed a new paradigm, or ""conceptual framework"", of how consciousness might actually work. They did this by reviewing data from previously published psychological and behavioral experiments that aim to determine if consciousness is continuous or discrete. Such experiments can involve showing a person two images in rapid succession and asking them to distinguish between them while monitoring their brain activity. The new model proposes a two-stage processing of information. First comes the unconscious stage: The brain processes specific features of objects, e.g. color or shape, and analyzes them quasi-continuously and unconsciously with a very high time-resolution. However, the model suggests that there is no perception of time during this unconscious processing. Even time features, such as duration or color change, are not perceived during this period. Instead, the brain represents its duration as a kind of ""number"", just as it does for color and shape. Then comes the conscious stage: Unconscious processing is completed, and the brain simultaneously renders all the features conscious. This produces the final ""picture"", which the brain finally presents to our consciousness, making us aware of the stimulus. Credit: EPFL  The whole process, from stimulus to conscious perception, can last up to 400 milliseconds, which is a considerable delay from a physiological point of view. ""The reason is that the brain wants to give you the best, clearest information it can, and this demands a substantial amount of time,"" explains Michael Herzog. ""There is no advantage in making you aware of its unconscious processing, because that would be immensely confusing."" This model focuses on visual perception, but the time delay might be different for other sensory information, e.g. auditory or olfactory. See Also: To recover consciousness, brain activity passes through newly detected states This is the first two-stage model of how consciousness arises, and it provides a more complete picture of how the brain manages consciousness than the ""continuous versus discrete"" debate envisages. But it especially provides useful insights about the way the brain processes time and relates it to our perception of the world.

Both groups were comprised of elderly subjects who had volunteered for the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders and the Brain and Body Donation Program. When LTS is present, it is possible to see it by using an immunohistochemical staining technique. In the image, the dark line is a nerve fiber in the submandibular gland, made visible with the stain.

The research potentially reveals a biological cause of weakness and instability in older people, as well as a possible future treatment that would target the proteins specifically. The researchers reported in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity that proteins in the family MHCI, or major histocompatibility complex class I, ""prune"" the synapses between motor neurons and muscle fibers. Pruning is necessary during early development because at birth each muscle fiber in humans, mice and other vertebrates receives signals from dozens of neural connections. Proper motor control, however, requires that each muscle fiber receive signals from only a single motor neuron, so without the pruning carried out by MHCI proteins, fine motor control would never emerge. See Also: Scientists see motor neurons 'walking' in real time But the researchers also found that MHCI levels can rise again in old age, and that the proteins may resume pruning nerve-muscle synapses -- except that in a mature organism there are no extra synapses. The result is that individual muscle fibers become completely ""denervated,"" or detached from nervous system control. Denervated muscle fibers cannot be recruited during muscle contraction, which can leave older people weaker and more susceptible to devastating falls, making independent living difficult. However, the Princeton researchers discovered that when MHCI levels were reduced in mice, denervation during aging was largely prevented. These findings could help scientists identify and treat the neurological causes of denervation and muscle weakness in the elderly. Corresponding author Lisa Boulanger, an assistant professor in the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, explained that in infants, motor neurons initially make far too many connections to muscle fibers, which is part of why infants lack fine motor control. Synapse overproduction followed by pruning occurs in many different regions of the vertebrate nervous system, and the neuromuscular junction has often been used as a model for studying this process. It is not known why more synapses are made during development than are needed. One possibility is that it allows the wiring diagram of the nervous system to be precisely tuned based on the way the circuit is used, Boulanger said. MHCI proteins help limit the final number of connections so that communication between neurons and muscles is more precise and efficient than would be possible using just a molecular code that produced a set number of connections. Learn More: Targeting upper motor neurons to treat ALS ""Molecules might get you to the right zip code, but pruning can make sure you arrive at the right house,"" Boulanger said. ""During development, it's essential to get rid of extra synapses. But when you up-regulate MHCI when you're older and start pruning synapses again, but you don't have any extras to replace them."" Boulanger worked with first author Mazell Tetruashvily, who received her doctorate in molecular biology from Princeton in 2015 and is now completing her M.D. training at University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey; Marin McDonald, who received her doctorate in neuroscience from the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) in 2010, and is now a radiology resident at UCSD; and Karla Frietze, a doctoral student in Princeton's Department of Molecular Biology. Boulanger was on the UCSD faculty before moving her lab to Princeton in 2009. In the immune system, MHCI proteins present protein fragments, or peptides, to T cells, which are white blood cells with a central role in the body's response to infection. This peptide presentation allows T cells to recognize and kill infected and cancerous cells, which present abnormal or foreign peptides on their MHCI proteins. It is unknown if the proteins' ability to help recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells is mechanistically related to the proteins' ability to help eliminate excess synapses that the Princeton researchers discovered. In the nervous system, MHCI proteins stop pruning synapses early in life. Why they may resume their synapse-eliminating activity later in life is unknown, Boulanger said. As immune-system proteins, MHCI levels increase with inflammation, she said. Aging is associated with chronic inflammation, which could explain the observed increase in MHCI levels and the reactivation of its former role. Image from a 2-year-old (elderly) normal mouse shows denervation in the upper-right synapse, which is apparent as very little overlap of the red and green fluorescent markers used to indicate places where the neuron and muscle fiber connect. At lower left, a healthy-looking synapse displays good overlap. Credit: Lisa Boulanger & Mazell Tetruashvily  The Princeton researchers found that mice bred to express less MHCI proteins had ""more youthful"" patterns of muscle innervation, since they were protected from denervation as they aged, Boulanger said. The mice actually lacked a protein known as beta-2 microglobulin, which forms a complex with MHCI and is necessary for MHCI expression on the surface of cells. This could be beneficial from a clinical perspective because beta-2 microglobulin is a soluble protein and can be removed from the blood, Boulanger said. Related: A better way to grow motor neurons from stem cells ""If a rise in MHCI is the problem, having less beta-2 microglobulin might be protective,"" Boulanger said. Recent results from a lab at Stanford University showed that reducing beta-2 microglobulin also helped with cognitive aging because of its effects on MHCI proteins. ""Our studies raise the possibility that targeting one protein could help with both motor and cognitive aspects of aging,"" Boulanger said. Because MHCI proteins are important in the immune system, however, such an approach could result in compromised immunity, Boulanger said. The mice bred to not express beta-2 microglobulin had weakened immune systems, as a result of their lower levels of MHCI proteins. Future work will include exploring the effectiveness of other approaches to reducing the proteins' synapse-eliminating activity in older nervous systems, ideally while leaving their immune functions intact, she said.

See Also: Cold-shock protein protects against neurodegeneration ""Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain are hallmarks of AD patients and people with DS.

""Effective treatments will have to target earlier changes that take place in the nerve cells, eventually leading to their demise. Our current study highlights the significance of abnormally active Rab5 protein as a key contributor to early development of the disease. We believe this will open new possibilities for understanding the disease and for developing novel and effective therapies."" The endosome/lysosome or endocytic pathway in cells moves molecules, such as signaling proteins, from the surface or distant regions of a cell into the cell's body (via compartments called endosomes) or to another type of cell organelle (lysosomes) where they can be recycled. A small molecule called Rab5 plays a key role in regulating these vital processes. But in AD and DS, the endocytic system does not work properly, though the precise nature of the underlying dysfunction was not understood. In their new paper, Wu and colleagues suggest a major reason is abnormally enlarged versions of Rab5-endosomes, which occur early and precede the onset of dementia and emergence of the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that characterize AD and DS. Specifically, the scientists determined that increased accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and/or a small portion of APP ( -carboxyl terminal fragment) in neurons, boosts activation of Rab5, causing enlargement of early endosomes and disruption of retrograde axonal transport of nerve growth factors (NGF) signals. As a result, impacted neurons do not function normally. Learn More: New type of prion may cause, transmit neurodegeneration The findings were based on tests with cultured cells and rodent models. Interestingly, when researchers introduced a dominant-negative Rab5 mutant in a fruit fly model, APP-induced axonal blockage was reduced. Wu said the research underscores the fundamental importance of endosomal function in regulating retrograde axonal trafficking, which conveys materials from axon to cell body, and signaling of NGF. He said further studies will be needed to determine whether reducing Rab5 activation prevents or reverses neurodegeneration in AD and DS.

One need only experience a bout of jetlag to appreciate how we resynchronize various bodily functions to a new time zone. However, while the overall effects of these circadian activities have been studied, relatively little is understood about the structure of the network of brain cells as they communicate to control the synchronization process. In a paper that appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, University of California (UC) Santa Barbara researchers and collaborators infer the architecture of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the control center for the circadian processes in mammals. See Also: Setting the circadian clock  We wanted to know how it is wired up,  said Linda Petzold, a professor in the departments of mechanical engineering and of computer science at UC Santa Barbara. By understanding which cells are communicating as they perform certain tasks, she explained, it is possible to gain insight into how this small organelle of about 20,000 neurons keeps the entire body on a 24-hour clock, regulating essential functions such as sleep, hunger, body-temperature regulation, hormone release and gene expression.  There are two big tasks that we know these cells do that have to do with timekeeping,  Petzold said. One of them is synchronization, which is necessary because individual neurons, which have their own pacemaking capabilities, need to work together to be effective.  Any single circadian cell is kind of a poor clock. Together, if they synchronize, they can do a good job. The other function is entrainment, which is in response to environmental cues, such as day and night.  To observe how the SCN synchronizes, the researchers had to first desynchronize the network and watch it resynchronize. To do this, they tagged Per2 proteins (which play a significant role in circadian timekeeping) in in vitro samples with a bioluminescent marker, exposed the samples to a neurotoxin to dampen their signals and then washed the neurotoxin away and waited.  From the fluorescence of a given cell, you can tell what the cell thinks its internal time is,  said Petzold. Within days, the previously off-line neurons not only began to glow, but did so in concert, reverting slowly to their behavior prior to their exposure to the neurotoxin. Learn More: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions Taking a cue from information theory, the researchers then took the concept of the maximal information coefficient, a metric based on mutual information shared between two variables (in this case two neurons), and measured the overlap of information between each pair. From these measurements they could see areas of strong communication and, by extension, the network that runs through the SCN.  The SCN has two lobes and there are distinct regions of cells,  Petzold said. Each lobe consists of a core and a shell. According to the study, the cells in the cores showed a high degree of connectivity to each other and to the shell neurons. There was also a high degree of connectivity between the cores. However, there was a relatively low amount of connectivity within the shells.  It confirms some speculation in the literature that the SCN network is a  small-world structure,  said Petzold, referring to the architecture used by the organelle to convey information. Small-world structures are characterized by nodes that are not necessarily connected directly to their neighbors, but most nodes can be reached from every other node through only a few connections, she explained. Additionally, small-world structures tend to include several  hubs  of high connectivity. Social networks are an example of networks with small-world structures, with clusters of individuals in hubs, mutual friends and few degrees of separation between many people. Related: New  reset  button discovered for circadian clock  It has been suggested in the literature that small-world networks are optimal in some sense,  she said.  Small-world networks provide advantages and robustness due to having hubs of high-node degree, as well as less important nodes able to maintain short paths of communication.  In this way, she continued, should parts of the SCN network be removed, there is a redundancy provided by the hubs, and the short paths between neurons would continue to ensure communication and synchronize without a large energy cost. Much remains to be learned about the SCN, Petzold said. Future studies may investigate the direction of the connections found therein.

A recent study has demonstrated that, beyond causing memory problems, Alzheimer's disease also impairs visual face perception. This finding may help families better understand their loved one's inevitable difficulties and lead to new avenues to postpone this painful aspect of the disease. Research in this area by the team of Dr. Sven Joubert, PhD, a researcher at the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de g riatrie de Montr al and a professor with the Department of Psychology at Universit  de Montr al, is published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. Learn More: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression Face perception plays a fundamental role in human communication, which is why humans have evolved into experts at quickly detecting and identifying faces. This faculty is thought to depend on the ability to perceive a face as a whole. Also known as ""holistic perception,"" this ability is in contrast to the local and detailed analysis required to perceive individual facial features, such as the eyes, nose or mouth. Dr. Joubert's study has demonstrated that the holistic ability to perceive faces is impaired by Alzheimer's disease. For the study, the Montreal team recruited people with Alzheimer's along with healthy seniors to study their ability to perceive faces and cars in photos that were either upright or upside down. Dr. Joubert explains the team's findings: ""The results for people with Alzheimer's were similar to those in the control group in terms of answer accuracy and the time to process the upside-down faces and cars. To perform these tasks, the brain must perform a local analysis of the various image components perceived by the eye. However, with the upright faces, people with Alzheimer's were much slower and made more mistakes than the healthy individuals. This leads us to believe that holistic face recognition in particular becomes impaired. Subjects with Alzheimer's disease also demonstrated normal recognition of the upright cars, a task that in theory does not require holistic processing. This suggests that Alzheimer's leads to visual perception problems specifically with faces."" What's also surprising about this impairment is that it is observed in the early stages of the disease. See Also: Study helps fill in gaps in our visual perception Overall, Dr. Joubert's study better explains the mechanism involved in the problem that people with Alzheimer's have with recognizing the faces of family members or celebrities. The fact that impaired facial recognition might stem from a holistic perception problem--and not just a general memory problem opens the door to different strategies (such as the recognition of particular facial traits or voice recognition) to help patients recognize their loved ones for longer.

This retrospective study of more than 589,000 genomes was a first step for the Resilience Project and was performed with researchers from 23andMe, BGI, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, and other institutions. The Resilience Project launched in 2014 with a unique vision by Stephen Friend and Eric Schadt that by studying massive numbers of healthy adults, scientists might find rare individuals who are unaffected by genetic variants that should induce disease. Genome analysis of these resilient people could uncover naturally occurring, protective mechanisms that would serve as novel treatments for people affected by these diseases.  Most genomic studies focus on finding the cause of a disease, but we see tremendous opportunity in figuring out what keeps people healthy,  said Eric Schadt, PhD, the Jean C. and James W. Crystal Professor of Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Founding Director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.  Millions of years of evolution have produced far more protective mechanisms than we currently understand. Characterizing the intricacies of our genomes will ultimately reveal elements that could promote health in ways we haven t even imagined.  In this study, researchers analyzed DNA from 12 previously collected data sets, using a newly developed targeted sequencing panel to screen 874 genes for 584 distinct genetic diseases. The diseases, which were mostly metabolic conditions, neurological diseases, or developmental disorders, present in childhood with severe symptoms. All genomes analyzed were from adults who had never been diagnosed with any of these diseases. A sophisticated, in-depth analysis process identified 13 healthy people with genetic variants associated with eight diseases.  This study demonstrates the power of using big data to ask new biological questions,  said Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of 23andMe, which participated in the project.  More than 400,000 23andMe customers contributed to this effort, showing that engaged consumers can make a real impact on scientific research.  In narrowing the pool of potentially resilient people from an original list of nearly 16,000 candidates, the researchers encountered two significant challenges. First, more than 75% of the candidates were eliminated due to inaccurate or low-confidence variant calls in the existing data, highlighting the need for better protocols and standards for interpreting genetic data. Second, none of the 13 final candidates could be contacted with follow-up questions due to limitations in the original studies  informed consent policies. It will be impossible to determine whether these people are truly resistant to disease without additional information.  There s an important lesson here for genome scientists around the world: the value of any project becomes exponentially greater when informed consent policies allow other scientists to reach out to the original study participants,  said Stephen Friend, President of Sage Bionetworks, Professor of Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine, and co-founder of the Resilience Project.  If we could contact these 13 people, we might be even closer to finding natural protections against disease. We anticipate launching a prospective study in the future that will include a more broadly useful consent policy.  ""While most genomics research in medicine has been disease focused, this important work exemplifies the benefit of studying health and resilience the converse of disease to understand the mechanism for protection in individuals with pathogenic sequence variants,  said Eric Topol, MD, Director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, and Chief Academic Officer of Scripps Health, who was not involved in this study but has been a champion of shifting the research focus to include healthy individuals.  This makes for a standout contribution from the Icahn Institute, Sage Bionetworks, and their extensive network of collaborators.   This work demonstrates the power of scale in analyzing root genetic causes of human disease, but more importantly human health. Its focus on studying healthy individuals to understand the things that keep them healthy sounds obvious but actually lies at the vanguard of a movement which puts the engaged study participant at the center of scientific research,  said Vik Bajaj, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Verily, who was not involved in this study but has advocated for harnessing big data for improved healthcare.  This research also points to the need for more effective standardization in the generation and analysis of genetic data, a field in which the authors are pre-eminent practitioners.

TB remains one of the world's major killer diseases, infecting 9.6 million people and killing 1.5 million in 2014. The only available vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Gu rin (BCG), works well to prevent severe disease in children but is very variable in how well it protects against lung disease, particularly in countries where TB is most common.  While BCG is one of the safest and most widely used vaccines worldwide, there is one key issue: It is currently very difficult to determine whether it will work or not. This also makes it really hard to determine if any new vaccines might work. For many vaccines, medics and scientists can use what are called immune correlates or biomarkers, typically in the blood, which can be measured to determine whether a vaccine has successfully induced immunity. Not only are these correlates useful in measuring the success of existing vaccination programmes, they are also invaluable in assessing whether potential new vaccines could be effective. With a pressing need for a TB vaccine that is more effective than BCG, a research team drawn from a number of groups at Oxford University, working with colleagues from the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative at the University of Cape Town and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, set out to identify immune correlates that could facilitate TB vaccine development.  The team, funded by the Wellcome Trust and Aeras, and led by Professor Helen McShane and Dr Helen Fletcher, studied immune responses in infants in South Africa who were taking part in a TB vaccine trial. Professor McShane said: 'We looked at a number of factors that could be used as immune correlates, to try and find biomarkers that will help us develop a better vaccine.' The team carried out tests for twenty-two possible factors. One   levels of activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T-cells   was linked to higher TB disease risk. Meanwhile, BCG-specific Interferon-gamma secreting T-cells indicated lower TB risk, with higher levels of these cells directly linked to greater reduction of the risk of TB. Antibodies to a TB protein, Ag85A, were also identified as a possible correlate. Higher levels of Ag85A antibody were associated with lower TB risk. However, the team cautions that other environmental and disease factors could also cause Ag85A antibody levels to rise and so there may not be a direct link between the antibody and TB risk. Professor McShane said: 'These are useful results which ideally would now be confirmed in further trials. They show that antigen-specific T cells are important in protection against TB, but that activated T cells increase the risk'. Dr Helen Fletcher from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'For the first time we have some evidence of how BCG might work, and also what could block it from working. Although there is still much work to do, these findings may bring us a step closer to developing a more effective vaccine for TB.' Dr Tom Scriba from the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative said: 'TB is still a major international killer, and rates of TB disease in some areas of South Africa are among the highest in the world. These findings provide important clues about the type of immunity TB vaccines should elicit, and bring us closer to our vision, a world without TB.' The team is continuing its work to develop a TB vaccine, aiming to protect more people from the disease.","Published: April 12, 2016"

However, a new study, affiliated with UNIST finds that DNA molecules directly interact with one another in a way that s dependent on the sequence of the DNA and epigenetic factors. The team made up of scientists from the University of Illinois Center for the Physics of Living Cells in the United States, Johns Hopkins University in the United States, and UNIST published their work in the current edition of Nature Communications on March 22, 2016. In their study, the team presented direct evidence for sequence-dependent attractive interactions between double-stranded DNA molecules that neither involve intermolecular strand exchange nor are mediated by DNA-binding proteins. Professor Hajin Kim (School of Life Sciences, UNIST), the lead author of the study notes  DNA molecules tend to repel each other in water, but in the presense of special types of cations, they can attract each other just like nuclei pulling each other by sharing electrons in between.  He explains,  Our study suggests that the attractive force strongly depends on the nucleic acid sequence and also the epigenetic modifications.  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Prof. Kim and his colleagues used atomic-level simulations to measure the forces between a pair of double-stranded DNA helices and proposed that the distribution of methyl groups on the DNA are the key to regulating this sequence-dependent attraction. Then, by observing a single pair of DNAs within nanoscale bubbles, they experimentally verified the model. From further simulations, researchers postulate that such direct DNA DNA interactions could play a central role in how chromosomes are organized in the cell and which ones are expanded or folded up compactly, ultimately determining functions of different cell types or regulating the cell cycle.  Biophysics is a fascinating subject that explores the fundamental principles behind a variety of biological processes and life phenomena,  says Prof. Kim.  Our study requires cross-disciplinary efforts from physicists, biologists, chemists, and engineering scientists and we pursue the diversity of scientific disciplines within the group.  Prof. Kim adds,  In our lab, we try to unravel the mysteries within human cells based on the principles of physics and the mechanisms of biology. In the long run, we are seeking for ways to prevent chronic illnesses and diseases associated with aging. ","Published: April 12, 2016"

These molecules are transcribed from genes and are often abundant in cells, yet they do not code for proteins. Their functions have been almost entirely unknown and in recent years have attracted much research and debate. Reporting in the journal Molecular Cell, the scientists determined that one prominent lncRNA may be a  red herring,  with no evident biological role to play whereas the DNA from which it originates does perform an important function, as an  enhancer  that stimulates the expression of an important protein-coding gene nearby.  An implication of this finding is that many lncRNA-producing regions of DNA may not function through their lncRNA products at all, but only through the DNA itself,  Vikram R. Paralkar, MD, an instructor in the division of Hematology/Oncology at Penn s Perelman School of Medicine, and first author of the study, said. The discovery underscores the importance of non-protein-coding DNA in biology, and the importance of exploring its functions. Although a popular view still has it that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and the RNA is usually translated into protein, scientists recently have learned that protein-coding DNA makes up less than two percent of the mammalian genome and is vastly outnumbered by non-protein-coding DNA. Some non-protein-coding genes produce small RNA molecules, and many of these have known functions, often in regulating other genes or RNAs. But thousands of our genes produce lncRNAs defined as being at least 200 nucleotides in length and their functions remain poorly understood. In a study published in 2014, Paralkar and colleagues identified over a thousand distinct lncRNAs in mouse and human blood cells. Most had never been described before. But many turned out to originate from areas of the genome containing known or suspected enhancers small regions of DNA where transcription factor molecules gather, to stimulate the transcription of nearby genes. In the new study, Paralkar and colleagues, including senior author Mitchell J. Weiss, MD, of St. Jude Children s Research Hospital in Memphis, and researchers from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, examined the possible enhancer function associated with one of these mystery lncRNAs, a product of a mouse gene called Lockd. The Lockd RNA product is particularly abundant in mouse red blood cells and some other cell types. One possibility is that this lncRNA has some undiscovered function in cells. Another possibility is that the LockdDNA itself has some function, while the RNA transcript is without function a genomic  red herring.  Lockd s transcription-starting  promoter  region contains binding sites for multiple transcription factors, and it lies immediately downstream, on the mouse genome, to Cdkn1b, a gene whose protein product plays a key role in regulating cell division.  To investigate the functions of Lockd, Paralkar and colleagues used an advanced gene-editing technique to delete the Lockd DNA from a mouse blood cell line.  When we did this, the expression of Cdkn1b was reduced by 70 percent,  Paralkar said. Next, the researchers used a different technique to block the transcription of Lockd RNA while leaving the Lockd DNA intact. The Cdkn1b expression was not affected.  In other words, getting rid of the RNA transcript doesn t make a difference, but getting rid of the DNA does make a difference,  Paralkar said. The researchers found strong evidence that in the twisted, looping, double-helix structure of the genome, the promoter end of Lockd DNA comes into direct physical contact with the promoter end of its neighbor Cdkn1b, and in that way acts as an enhancer to stimulate Cdkn1b s transcription. Paralkar acknowledged that the Lockd RNA may one day be found to have some other function.  It s impossible to prove absolutely that it has no function but it seems at least that it has no obvious function in regulating its neighbor Cdkn1b,  he said. He emphasized, however, that in determining the function of non-coding DNA and RNA, both DNA-deletion and RNA-blocking experiments as in this study are needed to distinguish the function of DNA from its RNA product.   One has to decouple the transcript from the DNA,  Paralkar said.  Future studies of lncRNA function should adhere to that requirement.  He added that the discovery of this enhancer function for one example of a lncRNA gene points to the possibility that this is a broadly used mechanism in the genome, found in non-coding and perhaps even some protein-coding genes. Indeed, enhancers are theorized to be one of the key genomic features that distinguishes species such as mice and humans which share nearly all their protein-coding genes, but relatively few of their enhancers and lncRNA-coding genes.  The fact that mice and humans are so different may be due largely to the fact that their genes are being regulated so differently by enhancers, some of which produce RNA molecules that we detect as lncRNAs,  Paralkar said.","Published: April 12, 2016"

In the presence of glucose, the beta cells generated using this  genetic software  produce the hormone insulin   just like natural beta cells, which are found in the pancreas.  Maturation dynamic reproduced The Basel-based researchers took the stem cells and added a highly complex synthetic network of genes   the genetic software. They designed this network to precisely recreate the key growth factors involved in this maturation process. Central to the process are the growth factors Ngn3, Pdx1 and MafA. Concentrations of these factors change during the differentiation process. For instance, MafA is not present at the start of maturation. Only on day four, in the final maturation step, does it appear, its concentration rising steeply and then remaining at a high level. The changes in concentration of Ngn3 and Pdx1, however, are very complex: while the concentration of Ngn3 rises and then falls again, the level of Pdx1 rises at the beginning and towards the end of maturation. Fussenegger stresses that it is essential to reproduce these natural processes as closely as possible in order to produce functioning beta cells:  The timing and the quantities of these growth factors are extremely important.  New beta cells respond to glucose In Fussenegger s opinion, it is a real breakthrough that a synthetic gene network has been successfully used to achieve genetic reprogramming that delivers beta cells. Until now, scientists have controlled such stem cell differentiation processes by adding various chemicals and proteins using pipettes.  It s not only really hard to add just the right quantities of these components at just the right time, it s also inefficient and impossible to scale up,  Fussenegger says. In contrast, the new process can successfully transform three out of four adipose stem cells into beta cells. These beta cells not only look very similar to their natural counterparts   both kinds contain dark spots known as granules, which store insulin. The artificial beta cells also function in a very similar way.  At the present time, the quantities of insulin they secrete are not as great as with natural beta cells,  he admits. But the key point is that the researchers have for the first time succeeded in reproducing the entire natural process chain, from stem cell to differentiated beta cell. Implants of endogenous cells In future, the Basel-based ETH researchers  new technique might make it possible to implant new functional beta cells  in diabetes sufferers that are made from their own adipose tissue. While beta cells have been transplanted in the past, this has always required subsequent suppression of the recipient s immune system   as with any transplant of donor organs or tissue.  With our beta cells, there would likely be no need for this action, since we can make them using endogenous cell material taken from the patient s own body,  Fussenegger says, adding:  This is why our work is of such interest in the treatment of diabetes.  Complete maturation in the petri dish To date, the ETH researchers have merely cultured their beta cells; they have yet to implant them in a diabetes sufferer. This is because they first wanted to test whether stem cells could be fully differentiated from start to finish using genetic programming. Fussenegger is convinced that this new method could also be used to produce other cells. Stem cells taken from adipose tissue could be differentiated into various cell types, he says    And most people have an overabundance of fat from which these stem cells can be harvested.

But figuring out the best way for the particles to get past the tumor s  velvet rope  and enter the tumor is a challenge scientists are still working out. Drexel University researchers believe that the trick to gaining access to the pernicious cellular masses is to give the nanoparticles a new look   and that dressing to impress will be able to get them past the tumor s biological bouncers. Targeted cancer therapy is most effective when the medication is released as close as possible to the interior of a tumor, to increase its odds of penetrating and killing off cancerous cells. The challenge that has faced cancer researchers for years is making a delivery vehicle that is sturdy enough to safely get the medication through the bloodstream to tumors   which is no smooth ride   but is also lithe enough to squeeze through the tumor s dense extra cellular space   a matrix stuffed with sugars called hyaluronic acid. In research recently published in the journal Nano Letters, lead author Hao Cheng, PhD, an assistant professor with an appointment in Drexel s College of Engineering, and affiliation with School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems; reports that the way to get past the tumor s front door has everything to do with how the tiny particle is suited up for the journey.  What we ve reported here is a strategy to overcome biological barriers that plague delivery of medication, such as nonvehicle clearance in the bloodstream by the host immune system, and ineffective diffusion in the extracellular matrix of tumor cells,  Cheng said.  It s a unique strategy that involves the decoration of nanovehicles with enzymes known to break down hyaluronic acid, which is a main barrier in the extracellular space, and the addition of an extra layer of polyethylene glycol to partially cover the enzymes.  In the paper entitled  Hyaluronidase Embedded in Nanocarrier PEG Shell for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Highly Efficient Antitumor Efficacy,  the group reports that their method is four times more effective at sending nanoparticles into a solid tumor than one of the best strategies currently in use. When cancer medication is loaded in the tiny particle, it has been shown to inhibit the growth of a type of aggressive breast cancer. The team, which also included researchers Wilbur Bowne, MD, an associate professor in Drexel s College of Medicine; Dimitrios Arhontoulis, an undergraduate in Drexel s School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems; lead author Hao Zhou and Zhiyuan Fan, doctoral candidates, Junjie Deng, PhD, postdoctoral researchers, and Pelin Lemons, a graduate student, all in the Materials Science and Engineering Department in the College of Engineering, created its nanoparticle suit by starting with one that is common in this area of cancer research and making some key alterations.  In the general design of nanoparticles, bioactive molecules   not limited to enzymes   were attached on the outermost layer of particles,  Cheng said.  These enzymes can degrade the extra cellular matrix and enhance the nanoparticle s ability to penetrate solid tumors.  But in the body, this extra cargo can cause problems. One issue is that attaching enzymes to nanoparticles could cause them to come up short of the tumor and be cleared by the bloodstream before delivering the medication. There s also a chance that the trip through the bloodstream could render the enzymes inert. To counter these issues and keep the nanoparticles on course, the team decided to add an extra layer that not only protects the precious payload, but also positions the enzymes for maximum impact.  The novelty of our design is that we partially embedded the hyaluronidase enzymes in a second polyethylene glycol layer to form the outer shell of the nanoparticle,  Cheng said.  This design dramatically reduces the enzymes  effect on slowing the particle s circulation and allows enzymes to maintain their function after the particle diffuses into the tumor.  Embedding the enzymes in the layers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ensures that the nanoparticle s appearance tricks the immune system into leaving it alone during its trip to the tumor, yet and still allows the particle to deal with any hyaluronic acid it encounters on its penetration of the tumor. Other researchers have tested a theory that exposes tumors to the enzymes first, and then to nanoparticles, but this is not nearly as effective as Cheng s method, because the nanoparticles developed at Drexel retain the enzymes through the duration of their diffusion into tumors, minimizing unnecessary hyaluronic acid degradation.  The degradation of hyaluronic acid removes the barrier for nanoparticles to diffuse and allows them to access more cancer cells,  Cheng said.  The enhanced diffusion also increases the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors, and the more nanoparticles that get into tumors the more effective they are at reducing its size.  As part of the research, the team tested their nanoparticle against competitors that did not have a second layer of polyethylene glycol and ones that did not have the ECM-degrading enzymes. It was no surprise that their nanoparticle performed better in both penetrating tumors and accumulating in the cancerous cells.  This exciting, novel nanoparticle drug delivery system will improve delivery of anti-cancer agents, enhancing anti-cancer activity to improve patient outcomes,  said Bowne. He foresees enormous potential for this strategy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for a number difficult to treat cancers such as locally advanced breast, pancreatic and mucin-producing gastrointestinal cancers.","Published: April 12, 2016"

Until now, the prevailing theory has been that the blood brain barrier provided the protective effect by preventing immune cells and molecules from entering the brain. However, when inflammation does occur, the brain has a way other than the blood brain barrier of slowing or stopping it, the Yale team observed Just as humans communicate using language, cells communicate using cell surface molecules and soluble proteins. And it is a particular conversation between a protein known as HVEM (herpes virus entry mediator) and SALM5, a molecule mainly found in neuronal cells, that suppresses CNS inflammation, said senior author on the paper, Lieping Chen, MD, PhD United Technologies Corporation Professor in Cancer Research, professor of immunobiology, dermatology, and medicine (medical oncology); and co-director, cancer immunology program at Yale Cancer Center.  We ve identified a key molecular pathway that may control CNS inflammation and provide evidence that this pathway could be manipulated by a monoclonal antibody to enhance immune response,  Chen said.  Also, we developed a new receptor array technology to identify the interaction between HVEM and SALM5. Both discoveries could be applied to the study of other pathways in the search for new therapies.  Chen said his team s interpretation opens the way for new drugs that can control CNS disease, including brain tumors. Specifically, using a strategy similar the anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 therapy developed in his lab many years ago to promote immune response in other human cancers.","Published: April 12, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/neanderthal-y-chromosome-genes-extinct-202186,Neanderthal Y Chromosome Genes Extinct The Neanderthal counterpart of the human Y chromosome  or male sex chromosome  appears to have died out  Why this happened is up for debate  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Although it s widely known that modern humans carry traces of Neanderthal DNA, a new international study led by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine suggests that Neanderthal Y-chromosome genes disappeared from the human genome long ago. The study was published April 7 in The American Journal of Human Genetics, in English and in Spanish, and will be available to view for free. The senior author is Carlos Bustamante, PhD, professor of biomedical data science and of genetics at the School of Medicine, and the lead author is Fernando Mendez, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford. The Y chromosome is one of two human sex chromosomes. Unlike the X chromosome, the Y chromosome is passed exclusively from father to son. This is the first study to examine a Neanderthal Y chromosome, Mendez said. Previous studies sequenced DNA from the fossils of Neanderthal women or from mitochondrial DNA, which is passed to children of either sex from their mother. Other research has shown that the DNA of modern humans is from 2.5 to 4 percent Neanderthal DNA, a legacy of breeding between modern humans and Neanderthals 50,000 years ago. As a result, the team was excited to find that, unlike other kinds of DNA, the Neanderthal Y chromosome DNA was apparently not passed to modern humans during this time.  We ve never observed the Neanderthal Y chromosome DNA in any human sample ever tested,  Bustamante said.  That doesn t prove it s totally extinct, but it likely is.  Why no Neanderthal DNA? Why is not yet clear. The Neanderthal Y chromosome genes could have simply drifted out of the human gene pool by chance over the millennia. Another possibility, said Mendez, is that Neanderthal Y chromosomes include genes that are incompatible with other human genes, and he and his colleagues have found evidence supporting this idea. Indeed, one of the Y chromosome genes that differ in Neanderthals has previously been implicated in transplant rejection when males donate organs to women.   The functional nature of the mutations we found,  said Bustamante,  suggests to us that Neanderthal Y chromosome sequences may have played a role in barriers to gene flow, but we need to do experiments to demonstrate this and are working to plan these now.  Several Neanderthal Y chromosome genes that differ from those in humans function as part of the immune system. Three are ""minor histocompatibility antigens,"" or H-Y genes, which resemble the HLA antigens that transplant surgeons check to make sure that organ donors and organ recipients have similar immune profiles. Because these Neanderthal antigen genes are on the Y chromosome, they are specific to males.  Theoretically, said Mendez, a woman s immune system might attack a male fetus carrying Neanderthal H-Y genes. If women consistently miscarried male babies carrying Neanderthal Y chromosomes, that would explain its absence in modern humans. So far this is just a hypothesis, but the immune systems of modern women are known to sometimes react to male offspring when there s genetic incompatibility. When did we part ways? The Y chromosome data also shed new light on the timeline for the divergence of humans and Neanderthals. The human lineage diverged from other apes over several million years, ending as late as 4 million years ago. After the final split from other apes, the human lineage branched into a series of different types of humans, including separate lineages for Neanderthals and what are now modern humans. Previous estimates based on mitochondrial DNA put the divergence of the human and Neanderthal lineages at between 400,000 and 800,000 years ago. The last common ancestor of Neanderthals and humans   based on the Y chromosome DNA sequenced in the study   is about 550,000 years ago. Scientists believe Neanderthals died out about 40,000 years ago.  Sequencing the Neanderthal Y chromosome may shed further light on the relationship between humans and Neanderthals. One challenge for the research team is to find out whether the Y chromosome Neanderthal gene variants identified were indeed incompatible with human genes. The data for the study came from public gene sequencing databases. ""We did not collect any data for this work,"" said Mendez. ""It was all public data.""","Published: April 12, 2016"

This organism causes a life-threatening pneumonia in immunosuppressed hosts. Pneumocystis was one of the first infections that led to the initial recognition of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been responsible for thousands of deaths over the past 30 years and remains a significant risk in the HIV/AIDS population as well as in transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed patients. Findings were published in Nature Communications. NIH scientists collaborated with investigators from the Broad Institute and Leidos, Inc. Through analysis of the genomes, researchers now better understand where the organism lives and how it avoids elimination by its hosts  immune system. The high quality of the genomes allowed not only identification of metabolic pathways that are critical to the growth and survival of the organism, but also recognition that a large number of pathways that are present in other closely related fungi are absent from Pneumocystis. These pathways likely disappeared as Pneumocystis evolved to become highly dependent on its mammalian host to stay alive.  Our long term goal is to learn more about human Pneumocystis infection and to decrease its impact on immunosuppressed humans. This study is an important step in that direction  said Joseph Kovacs, M.D., senior investigator and head of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Section for the NIH Clinical Center Critical Care Medicine Department.  Having the genome information helped us recognize the unusual biology of Pneumocystis and how it co-exists with its mammalian hosts. It also gives researchers insight into why they ve been unable to reproducibly grow the organism in lab cultures thus far,  said Liang Ma, M.D., staff scientist in the NIH Clinical Center Critical Care Medicine Department and first author of the paper. The research has mapped out a clearer picture of these genomes than any prior studies. The team s effort has resulted in high-quality, near chromosomal draft genomes, which is the highest level of genomic mapping. This detailed description of the genes that are present or missing should facilitate attempts to culture the organism, a critical milestone in Pneumocystis research. Culturing could allow for screening of a large number of drugs to speed up identification of new treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia, and potentially allow for genetic manipulation to modify individual genes and see what impact they have on organism growth and on its harmful impact to the host.","Published: April 12, 2016"

The team administered LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) to 20 healthy volunteers in a specialist research centre and used various leading-edge and complementary brain scanning techniques to visualise how LSD alters the way the brain works. The findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), reveal what happens in the brain when people experience the complex visual hallucinations that are often associated with LSD state. They also shed light on the brain changes that underlie the profound altered state of consciousness the drug can produce. A major finding of the research is the discovery of what happens in the brain when people experience complex dreamlike hallucinations under LSD. Under normal conditions, information from our eyes is processed in a part of the brain at the back of the head called the visual cortex. However, when the volunteers took LSD, many additional brain areas - not just the visual cortex - contributed to visual processing. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the research, explained: ""We observed brain changes under LSD that suggested our volunteers were 'seeing with their eyes shut' - albeit they were seeing things from their imagination rather than from the outside world. We saw that many more areas of the brain than normal were contributing to visual processing under LSD - even though the volunteers' eyes were closed. Furthermore, the size of this effect correlated with volunteers' ratings of complex, dreamlike visions. "" The study also revealed what happens in the brain when people report a fundamental change in the quality of their consciousness under LSD. Dr Carhart-Harris explained: ""Normally our brain consists of independent networks that perform separate specialised functions, such as vision, movement and hearing - as well as more complex things like attention. However, under LSD the separateness of these networks breaks down and instead you see a more integrated or unified brain. ""Our results suggest that this effect underlies the profound altered state of consciousness that people often describe during an LSD experience. It is also related to what people sometimes call 'ego-dissolution', which means the normal sense of self is broken down and replaced by a sense of reconnection with themselves, others and the natural world. This experience is sometimes framed in a religious or spiritual way - and seems to be associated with improvements in well-being after the drug's effects have subsided."" Dr Carhart-Harris added: ""Our brains become more constrained and compartmentalised as we develop from infancy into adulthood, and we may become more focused and rigid in our thinking as we mature. In many ways, the brain in the LSD state resembles the state our brains were in when we were infants: free and unconstrained. This also makes sense when we consider the hyper-emotional and imaginative nature of an infant's mind."" In addition to these findings, research from the same group, part of the Beckley/Imperial Research Programme, revealed that listening to music while taking LSD triggered interesting changes in brain signalling that were associated with eyes-closed visions. In a study published in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, the researchers found altered visual cortex activity under the drug, and that the combination of LSD and music caused this region to receive more information from an area of the brain called the parahippocampus. The parahippocampus is involved in mental imagery and personal memory, and the more it communicated with the visual cortex, the more people reported experiencing complex visions, such as seeing scenes from their lives. PhD student Mendel Kaelen from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who was lead author of the music paper, said: ""This is the first time we have witnessed the interaction of a psychedelic compound and music with the brain's biology. The Beckley/Imperial Research Programme hope these collective findings may pave the way for these compounds being one day used to treat psychiatric disorders. They could be particularly useful in conditions where negative thought patterns have become entrenched, say the scientists, such as in depression or addiction. Mendel Kaelen added: ""A major focus for future research is how we can use the knowledge gained from our current research to develop more effective therapeutic approaches for treatments such as depression; for example, music-listening and LSD may be a powerful therapeutic combination if provided in the right way."" Professor David Nutt, the senior researcher on the study and Edmond J Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, said: ""Scientists have waited 50 years for this moment - the revealing of how LSD alters our brain biology. For the first time we can really see what's happening in the brain during the psychedelic state, and can better understand why LSD had such a profound impact on self-awareness in users and on music and art. This could have great implications for psychiatry, and helping patients overcome conditions such as depression."" Amanda Feilding, Director of the Beckley Foundation, said: ""We are finally unveiling the brain mechanisms underlying the potential of LSD, not only to heal, but also to deepen our understanding of consciousness itself."" The research involved 20 healthy volunteers - each of whom received both LSD and placebo - and all of whom were deemed psychologically and physically healthy. All the volunteers had previously taken some type of psychedelic drug. During carefully controlled and supervised experiments in a specialist research centre, each volunteer received an injection of either 75 micrograms of LSD, or placebo. Their brains were then scanned using various techniques including fMRI and magneto encephalography (MEG). These enabled the researchers to study activity within the whole of the brain by monitoring blood flow and electrical activity.

The results offer evidence for how Zika virus may cause brain defects in babies and specifically microcephaly, a rare birth defect in which the brain fails to grow properly. Brazil is in the midst of an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), which was first detected in the country in May 2015. Since then, reports of microcephaly in the country have increased significantly, but a link between the virus and the birth defect has not been proven. See Also: Why neural stem cells may be vulnerable to Zika infection In the work published in Science, Patricia Garcez and colleagues examined the effects of Zika virus infection in human neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and growing as either clusters of neural stem cells (called neurospheres) or as brain organoids; both systems represent models with which to study embryonic brain development in vitro. When the researchers infected the growing cells with Zika virus isolated from a Brazilian patient, the virus killed most of the neurospheres within a few days. Under control conditions, meanwhile, hundreds of neurospheres grew. Confocal micrograph of human neural stem cell culture infected with Zika virus (red). Cell nuclei are shown in blue. Credit:  Erick Loiola, Rodrigo Madeiro / IDOR  In a second experiment focused on the brain organoid model, infection with the virus reduced the growth of infected organoids by 40% compared to brain organoids under control conditions. Finally, an experiment evaluating the impact of dengue virus, a flavivirus with similarities to ZIKV, showed a significant difference in cell viability after six days, with dengue-infected cells surviving much better. And brain organoids exposed to dengue virus showed no reduction in growth compared to controls. Related: An accessible approach to making a mini-brain The results, which suggest that the negative consequences of ZIKV in human neural stem cells are not a general feature of the flavivirus family, provide insights into ZIKV's possible effects on the developing brain.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-yields-the-key-to-effective-personalized-medicine-210724,Study Yields the Key to Effective Personalized Medicine A team of UCLA bioengineers and surgeons has taken a major step toward making personalized medicine a reality  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.UCLA scientists say the finding that every patient s response to medical treatment produces a parabola-shaped graph, like those here, is a landmark advance. The researchers, from the UCLA schools of dentistry, engineering and medicine, developed a revolutionary technology platform called phenotypic personalized medicine, or PPM, which can accurately identify a person s optimal drug and dose combinations throughout an entire course of treatment. Their research is the April 6 cover article of the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Unlike other approaches to personalized medicine currently being tested, PPM doesn t require complex, time-consuming analysis of a patient s genetic information or of the disease s cellular makeup. Instead, it produces a personalized drug regimen based on information about a person s phenotype   biological traits that could include anything from blood pressure to the size of a tumor or the health of a specific organ. Dean Ho, who holds appointments in oral biology and medicine at the UCLA School of Dentistry, and in bioengineering at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, said one of the platform s remarkable capabilities is its ability to produce graphs  personalized for each individual patient that represent precisely how they respond to treatment. The graphs plot the drug dose along the horizontal axis and the patient s response to treatment on the vertical axis. (Data for the patient s response is dictated by whatever health goal the doctor is trying to achieve: shrinking the size of a tumor, having a certain level of medication in the blood or reducing toxicity level, for example.) Remarkably, Ho said, every person produces a graph in the shape of a curve called a parabola   picture a  U  either right-side up or upside down   and that parabola dictates how doctors should proceed with the treatment. Each person s unique curve provides doctors with a visual guide to determine the exact doses of medicine they should prescribe as the treatment continues, which Ho said is the key to achieving truly personalized medicine.  This study demonstrated the ability to use a patient s phenotype to personalize their treatment in an actionable manner without the need for genome profiling,  said Ho, a corresponding author of the study.  We also have shown that PPM can be extended to optimize combination therapy for a wide spectrum of diseases.  Showing that every patient s response to medical treatment   for diseases ranging from cancer to infectious diseases, or following an organ transplant   produces a parabola-shaped graph is a landmark advance, Ho said. Among other things, the approach will allow doctors to prescribe the precise amount of medicine needed to shrink a tumor or ensure the body doesn t reject an organ, for example, as opposed to using a higher,  standard  dose that s recommended based on an average of how all patients have responded in the past. Another benefit of PPM is that it can be recalibrated in real time to adapt to changes during treatment   for example if a person undergoes surgery or develops an infection, or if their organ function changes over time, any of which could mean that drug dosages or combinations need to be modified. The platform can use the patient s new data to provide doctors with a new parabola and revised recommendations. Tested for post-transplant care The new study evaluated eight people who had recently received liver transplants. Most transplant patients take an immunosuppressive drug called tacrolimus to prevent their bodies from rejecting the organ. In general, doctors prescribe dosages of the drug based on how other patients have responded in the past, and they adjust those amounts if and when complications arise. In the UCLA research, four patients received care followed the traditional approach and four received treatment that was guided by PPM.  Properly managing patients  immunosuppression can have profound long-term impacts on the survival of the organ and the patient,  said Dr. Ali Zarrinpar, assistant professor of surgery in the UCLA division of liver and pancreas transplantation and a corresponding author of the study.  This study shows that we can pinpoint drug doses that can substantially improve patient outcomes. The ability to confidently and systematically guide the treatment of each patient is a critical advance in minimizing the chance that transplant recipients will reject their new organs, while also avoiding drug side effects.  To know whether the PPM approach was successful, researchers wanted to see the amount of tacrolimus in each patient s body stay within the  ideal  range, as dictated by each patient s unique parabola-shaped graph. They found that those who were treated following PPM spent as much as 50 percent less time outside of that range than the patients whose treatment followed the traditional approach.  Optimizing the drug ratios during combination therapy for a population or a specific patient has, until now, been virtually impossible,  said Chih-Ming Ho, who is UCLA Engineering s Ben Rich Lockheed Martin Professor, and a corresponding author of the study.  Our ability to calibrate how individual patients respond to treatment and to use that information to robustly guide their regimen based on the parabola-based approach has made personalized medicine a reality.  Chih-Ming Ho, who holds faculty appointments in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and in bioengineering, pioneered the development of PPM.  The team is using PPM in several other clinical trials, some of which are already underway, including for treating cancer and infectious diseases.

At a session dedicated to late-breaking abstracts on colistin resistance, researchers presented evidence on the prevalence of the gene in bacteria (including Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli,Salmonella or Klebsiella). Scientists also presented evaluations of treatment and management options, as well as new diagnostic methods and assays to help identify mcr-1. The late-breaking data was released at ECCMID 2016   the annual meeting of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESCMID). The mcr-1 gene is particularly significant as it can be carried by plasmids, small DNA molecules, which can be transferred between single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, through so-called horizontal gene transfer. These genes can then be transferred sideways to other strains or species, not just vertically down to the offspring by replication. Horizontal gene transfer is the primary reason for antibiotic resistance.   The mechanism, first discovered in an E. coli strain from a pig in China in November 2015, has over the past months been identified in bacterial samples across the world. The increased prevalence of plasmid-mediated resistance is causing major concern among infectious disease specialists, because it threatens to reduce options to treat infections and is creating new resistant bacterial strains.","Published: April 11, 2016"

Now, 140 years since its founding, this major pharmaceutical company is again breaking new ground with the launch of multiple experiments to the ISS. Why are they going so far? The stable, persistent microgravity environment on the ISS cannot be found on Earth. Eli Lilly is planning to conduct five experiments on the ISS U.S. National Laboratory over the next year; science conducted in space to make discoveries that will improve life on Earth. Three of the five experiments are launching on the SpaceX-8 mission: two performing the delicate process of protein crystal growth and one testing a new treatment for muscle wasting. The process of growing protein crystals is very specialized. Individual protein molecules must be coaxed to align uniformly into repeating patterns to form a 3-D crystallized structure. High-quality crystals are thus difficult to grow and can be extremely fragile. This is where space can provide an advantage. In a gravity environment, proteins often sediment out of a solution before they can properly align. Gravity is also responsible for convective forces, a type of fluid movement that further disrupts the crystallization process. By performing protein crystallization experiments in the functional absence of gravity on the ISS, Eli Lilly researchers are, in a way, hanging a  Do Not Disturb  sign seeking to maximize the potential for high-quality crystal growth. The usefulness of protein crystals to a pharmaceutical company such as Eli Lilly is in analyzing crystal structure to gather clues about the unique features of the individual proteins. Scientists do this using  X-ray diffraction,  the same technique that famously revealed the structure of DNA. By determining the structure of a protein involved in disease, for example, one can see features that would be good target areas where new drugs might bind. Toward this end, Eli Lilly is specifically growing crystals of not only individual proteins, but also proteins bound together with potential drugs (a technique called  co-crystallization ). Results from the SpaceX-8 experiments could give the researchers a better understanding of the drug-protein interaction, allowing them to improve structure-based drug design efforts.  Assessment of Myostatin Inhibition to Prevent Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and Weakness in Mice Exposed to Long-Duration Spaceflight, from Dr. Rosamund Smith In addition to exploring crystal growth in space for drug discovery, Eli Lilly is also tackling drug development from a different angle seeking to improve treatments for muscle loss through spaceflight drug testing. Muscle  wasting  is a common disease of bed-ridden patients, such as those recovering from surgery, those with paralysis, the chronically ill, and the elderly. In many ways, microgravity mimics the effects of the immobility experienced by these patients. Moreover, muscle wasting on Earth is a slow process, but it occurs quickly in space because muscles are  unloaded  in microgravity and researchers can see effects much faster. This is true whether evaluating humans (to improve astronaut health for long-duration spaceflight) or animal models, such as rodents, worms, or flies. Animal models have been studied on Earth and in space for decades, but the ISS National Lab provides an opportunity for longer-term studies that have the potential to translate more quickly into applications to improve human health on Earth.   Humans have a naturally occurring regulator of muscle growth in our DNA: a gene called myostatin. From this gene, a protein is produced that binds to cells and signals muscle growth to stop. It may seem counterintuitive that our bodies would negatively regulate muscle growth, but muscle overgrowth can be unhealthy and a burden on the body s systems. Interestingly, however, stopping this regulation by myostatin might represent an effective way to treat muscle wasting. The third Eli Lilly experiment on SpaceX-8 is assessing just that, by testing a drug that blocks the myostatin protein. By using this drug on rodents in space, researchers may be able to observe a fast-tracked model of whether this drug is protecting the animals from spaceflight-induced muscle loss. Back on Earth, Eli Lilly can use these observations to better understand the role of myostatin in muscle loss, the effectiveness of the drug, and the mechanisms of changing muscle mass and function in space all to improve the quality of life on Earth.

In addition, 4D has encountered a number of constraints, both in terms of size of the facilities and the availability of those facilities, in working with contract research organisations. 4D believed working solely with third party providers was no longer optimal given the number of programmes within the 4D pipeline and the current speed of development. Biomar, based in Le n in north-west Spain, has been working as an outsourced development partner since 2014. Formed in 1996, Biomar had initially focused on research into marine microorganisms and their use in pharmaceutical, bio-energy and food production. In 2001 it began to expand its technologies into microbial fermentation, providing contract services in this field and expanding its production capabilities up to 3,000 litres in 2010. 4D has been working with Biomar on several development projects generated by the MicroRx platform, as well as providing a secondary or back up facility for both the Thetanix and Blautix programmes. The facilities and experience of the team at Biomar have the capability to translate research programmes from our laboratories through clinical development to support initial production requirements. The work to date has shown the flexibility of the facility and the team at Biomar and, with the potential to expand the facility further, 4D made the decision to acquire Biomar's production assets. The transaction will see 4D Pharma Le n, S.L.U. (""4D Le n""), a newly incorporated Spanish subsidiary, acquire the relevant business assets from Biomar, and take a lease at Biomar's Le n premises.  Of the current Biomar staff, 13 will move over to 4D Le n as part of the transaction, with the expectation that a further five staff will be recruited over the next six months. The consideration for the acquisition is 3 million euros which is payable on completion, and of which 2 million euros will be paid in cash, with the remaining 1 million euros being satisfied by the issue of 82,349 4D shares, at a price of  9.805 (being the average mid-market price of a 4D share for the five business days immediately preceding completion of the acquisition).

The process of new blood vessel growth   angiogenesis   is important for cancers to grow, and several anti-angiogenic drugs have been developed to combat it. However, cancers often become resistant to these drugs through mechanisms which, until now, were poorly understood. The study, from researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, shows it could be possible to treat cancers by designing new therapies that block both vessel co-option and angiogenesis. These may be more effective than existing treatments, which only block angiogenesis. The research has recently been published  and was funded by organisations including the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Worldwide Cancer Research, Canadian Liver Cancer Foundation and Breast Cancer Now. In the study, scientists used mice to examine how a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma can become resistant to an anti-angiogenic drug called sorafenib. They discovered that tumours which responded to treatment initially relied mainly on growing their own blood vessels, but developed resistance to treatment by actively stealing the normal, pre-existing blood vessels of the liver instead. Potential in other cancer types The researchers believe their study may have implications not only for the treatment of liver cancer but also for other cancer types, including metastatic breast cancer and metastatic bowel cancer. Scientists at the ICR are currently investigating the implications of this research for these other cancer types.  Interestingly, the researchers also found that the switch to vessel co-option was reversible. On stopping treatment, the tumours switched back to using angiogenesis   providing a potential explanation as to why some patients can respond again to the same anti-angiogenic drug after they have a  treatment holiday . Because there are no existing drugs that target vessel co-option, the researchers also carried out experiments to identify how vessel co-option works. They discovered that the cancer cells increase their ability to move when they co-opt vessels, suggesting that targeting cancer cell movement might be used to block vessel co-option. Study co-leader Dr Andrew Reynolds, Leader of the Tumour Biology team at the ICR, said:  Our study is the first to show that cancers can adapt to treatment by actively co-opting blood vessels from nearby tissues as a mechanism of drug resistance.  In the future, we hope our results will lead to the development of new drug types that target vessel co-option. We believe that drugs which are designed to target vessel co-option could be particularly effective when used alongside existing therapies that block new blood vessel growth.  Although the current study was focused on liver cancer in mice, we are also currently investigating whether our results are relevant for patients affected by breast and bowel cancer. Our research also emphasises the importance of further studies to better understand the process of vessel co-option, which seems to play an important role in tumour growth but has been relatively under-studied.  Improved therapies Study co-leader Professor Robert Kerbel and lead author Elizabeth Kuczynski from the Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, said:  This work has been a multinational and multi-disciplinary collaboration. By working with Dr Reynolds in the UK and Dr Vermeulen in Belgium, as well Dr Yousef and Dr Foster in Toronto, we combined expertise in molecular and cellular biology, pathology and imaging in order to address a key question in the field. ""As a result, we have obtained important information which should eventually lead to improved anti-cancer therapies for patients in the future.  Katie Goates, Senior Research Communications Officer at Breast Cancer Now, said:  This new insight into how cancers could be commandeering nearby blood vessels to resist treatments may be significant for a number of disease areas. We hope that this knowledge can now be harnessed and applied to help slow the spread of breast cancer.  Ultimately, if we can stop breast cancers spreading in the first place   where they become incurable   we ll finally be able to stop women losing their lives to this dreadful disease.

Researchers who used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate HIV-1 within cellular DNA found that while single mutations can inhibit viral replication, some also led to unexpected resistance. They believe targeting multiple viral DNA regions may be necessary for the potential antiviral aspect of CRISPR/Cas9 to be effective. Upon entry into a cell, HIV s RNA genome is converted into DNA and becomes entwined with the cellular DNA. From here, CRISPR/Cas9 can be programmed to target a DNA sequence and cleave viral DNA. The problem is that HIV is notoriously good at surviving and thriving with new mutations, so while many viruses are killed by the targeted approach, those that escape the CRISPR/Cas9 treatment become more difficult to target.  When we sequence the viral RNA of escaped HIV, the surprise is that the majority of the mutations that the virus has are nicely aligned at the site where Cas9 cleaves the DNA, which immediately indicates that these mutations, instead of resulting from the errors of viral reverse transcriptase, are rather introduced by the cellular non-homologous end joining machinery when repairing the broken DNA,  says Dr. Liang.  Some mutations are tiny only a single nucleotide but the mutation changes the sequence so Cas9 cannot recognize it anymore. Such mutations do no harm to the virus, so these resistant viruses can still replicate.  The study, a collaborative effort between researchers at McGill University and the Universit  de Montr al and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, serves as a cautionary tale for those who hope to apply CRISPR/Cas9 as an antiviral. Dr. Liang doesn t believe the effort is futile, however, as there are strategies that could overcome this limitation. For example, targeting multiple sites with CRISPR/Cas9 or using other enzymes aside from Cas9.  Once a solution is identified, the next barrier will be identifying ways to deliver the treatment to patients.  CRISPR/Cas9 gives a new hope toward finding a cure, not just for HIV-1, but for many other viruses,  Dr. Liang says.  We have a long road toward the goal, and there may be many barriers and limitations that we need to overcome, but we re confident that we will find success. ","Published: April 11, 2016"

Moreover, through the collaboration between biologists and chemists, the group has synthesized a disaccharide, i.e. a double sugar, which exhibits the same properties as AMOR. This discovery is expected to lead to advances in research to improve plant fertilization efficiency as well as carbohydrate chemistry for plants. Nagoya, Japan - Dr. Akane Mizukami and Professor Tetsuya Higashiyama of the JST-ERATO Higashiyama Live-Holonics Project and the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM) of Nagoya University, and their colleagues have reported their new findings on April 8, 2016, in Current Biology, on their success in identifying a sugar chain that activates pollen tubes to respond to attractant molecules that promote fertilization in plants. When pollen grains (male reproductive organ) germinate at the tip of the pistil (female reproductive organ), a pollen tube grows through the pistil. There have been many reports that suggest the presence of a compound that is present inside the pistil, which activates the pollen tube to respond to attractant molecules for fertilization, i.e. like a love potion sent out by the female organ to attract the male organ towards them. However, the actual nature of this substance has been a mystery up to now. Using Torenia fournieri as a model plant, Higashiyama's group and his colleagues have succeeded for the first time in identifying the activator for pollen tubes. This activator consists of arabinogalactan, which is a sugar chain specific for plants. The group named it as Activation Molecule for Response-Capability (AMOR), taken from the Latin word meaning ""love"" and ""cupid"", thus illustrating its function to bring female and male organs together, to promote fertilization in plants. In their study, the group also reported that the two sugar units at the terminus of AMOR were the active component responsible for pollen tube activation towards attractant molecules. Thus, through the collaboration with synthetic chemists, Dr. Jiao Jiao and Dr. Junichiro Yamaguchi, the team synthesized a disaccharide that consists of methyl-glucuronic acid and galactose linked together. They found that the newly synthesized molecule activates the pollen tube to respond to attractant molecules, and lead to successful fertilization. ""We are excited to demonstrate for the first time, that this terminus disaccharide, which is characteristic to sugar chains in plants, is responsible for the signaling between plant cells,"" says Higashiyama, project leader of the ERATO project and a Professor/Vice-Director at ITbM, Nagoya University. ""This could lead to the development of new methods to improve the plant fertilization efficiency and open a new avenue for carbohydrate research in plant biology using synthetic chemistry approaches."" For fertilization to occur in seed plants (angiosperms), it is necessary for pollen grains to pollinate at the pistil, followed by germination and growth of a pollen tube through the pistil, with final delivery of the sperm cells to the ovules that contain the egg cells. Upon passing through the pistil, the pollen tube receives various substances, such as plant hormones and glycoproteins. In mammals, a phenomenon called sperm capacitation, which is where the sperm becomes activated by substances originating from the female organs, has been known for a long time. Thus, there has been much research ongoing to uncover its molecular mechanism. Similarly in plants, there have been reports on a phenomenon where pollen tubes receive attractant molecules that are produced from the two synergid cells located next to the egg cells, in order to grow their tubes towards the egg cells and lead to fertilization. However, the molecular mechanism on how pollen tubes become capable of responding to attractant molecules has not been uncovered. ""In this research, I have used Torenia fournieri plants to develop new experiments to test which factors cause the pollen tubes to gain response capability towards attractant molecules,"" says Akane Mizukami, currently an assistant professor at the Aichi Gakuin University, who mainly conducted the biological assay. Torenia fournieri is unique in that the egg apparatus, containing the egg cell and the two synergid cells, protrudes from the ovule. ""By using this method to measure the activities in various parts of the Torenia flower, we found AMOR, the molecule which enabled pollen tubes to gain the ability to respond to attractant molecules produced by the synergid cells,"" describes Mizukami. Through the purification of AMOR, the group found that AMOR contains a sugar chain called arabinogalactan, which is characteristic for plants. Furthermore, by using a digestive enzyme specific for cutting the arabinogalactan sugar chain at various sections, the group was able to identify that a disaccharide moiety containing a methyl-glucuronic acid unit located at the terminus of arabinogalactan, was essential for AMOR's activity. The organic chemists in the group then synthesized the disaccharide moiety on the terminus of arabinogalactan. ""Although I can now say it is easy, at the beginning when I joined this project, I struggled a lot to synthesize and isolate the sugar compounds, because I was not exactly an expert in sugar chemistry, and it was a new research field for me,"" says Jiao Jiao, a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Kenichiro Itami's lab at ITbM, Nagoya University. ""I also find many organic chemists have the same feeling that sugar compounds are difficult to handle, especially when handling them in isolation."" ""It took me about three months to obtain the desired compound with a confirmed structure and good purity. The synthesis of this small sugar molecule was really like a total synthetic project. My mentor, Junichiro Yamaguchi (Associate Professor at Nagoya University) was an expert for making natural products, and he designed the synthetic route initially,"" continues Jiao. ""We discussed and modified the procedure to make it better and better both in selectivity and yield. I guess the three months for me was really a precious time for studying new chemistry and getting a good experience for my future."" Interestingly, when the  -linkage isomer of the synthesized methyl-glucuronosyl galactose disaccharide was added to the culture, the pollen tube was attracted to the attractant molecule. ""This shows that this particular disaccharide was the key structure for AMOR activity,"" explains Mizukami. Other synthesized derivatives of the disaccharide were also added to the culture to see its effect on pollen tube response capability towards attractant molecules. The group also found that the methyl group on the methyl-glucuronic acid unit and the  -linkage between the two sugars was also necessary for attraction of the pollen tube. ""This behavior of pollen tubes indicates that they are clearly recognizing the specific structure of the disaccharide."" This new study has revealed the presence of AMOR, the sugar molecule responsible for controlling the pollen tube's response capability towards attractant molecules, which is an ability that is essential for plant fertilization to succeed. The arabinogalactan sugar chain is commonly present in the cell wall of plants and is known to be involved in various signaling pathways within the cell. However, effective analytical methods to identify the active sites on the sugar chain have not been well established and the exact role of the sugar chain structure has not been fully clarified up to now. Through the combination of a biological approach using various sugar-digesting enzymes and a chemical approach using synthetic sugars, the group succeeded in uncovering the active functional site on the plant's sugar chain. In addition, it was the first time that a specific sugar chain structure that is part of the extracellular matrix in plants, has been identified as a bioactive species that functions in the signaling pathway between cells. ""The interdisciplinary research between biology and chemistry has been absolutely fantastic,"" speaks Jiao. ""I feel super fun to talk and discuss about research with biologists. We share a different knowledge of science, experimental techniques and so on. We never feel shy to ask some ""stupid"" question because we are not only collaborators but also like friends or teachers to each other. I definitely want to and am looking forward to such kind of collaboration again in the near future,"" she continues. ""This research is an outcome of a fantastic fusion between my colleagues, which include biologists in my lab, chemists in the Itami lab, as well as the Molecular Structure Center at ITbM,"" says Higashiyama.

The new study, which is published in the journal Cell, also shows that genes on the X chromosome are regulated differently. Early human embryonic development is difficult to study, and most of our knowledge comes from mice. During the first seven days of fertilisation, the egg develops from a single cell to a blastocyst, a hollow cluster of some 200 to 300 cells. It is during this time that the first three cell types appear: the trophectoderm, which gives rise to the placenta, the hypoblast, which forms the embryonic endoderm, and the embryonic cells that go to make up the embryo itself. If the embryo is to adhere to the uterus wall and pregnancy commence, all these three cell types must mature properly. However, exactly when and in which order and how the cell types form in humans has not been known. By detecting gene expression in individual cells, from donated human embryos that were not used for IVF treatment, two research groups led by Rickard Sandberg and Fredrik Lanner have managed to identify which genes are used in the embryo s cells at different times during the first week of development. Mature more simultaneously  The Lanner-Sandberg team found that the first three cell types form later and seem to mature more simultaneously in the human than in the mouse.   The fundamental knowledge generated by our research doesn t only help us understand embryonic development better, it also tells us more about how pluripotent cells are formed and regulated in its early stages,  says Fredrik Lanner, assistant professor at the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology.  This is important for the use of embryonic stem cells in regenerative medicine.  The researchers also found that the expression of genes situated on the X chromosome is subject to an unexpected expression pattern. The X chromosome has a particular gene regulation problem, since women s cells have two X chromosomes, while men only have a copy (XY). To avoid women having twice the level of expression of all genes on the X chromosome as men, women s cells must offset the gene expression. In mice, where this process is well-studied, one of the two X chromosomes is simply shut off during the first week. However, it has always been uncertain if this process even begins during the first week of human embryo development. Offset the gene expression  What we ve been able to demonstrate is that dose balance is gradually attained during day 4 to 7, interestingly through a completely new manner in which the gene expression from both X chromosomes in the female embryo is suppressed,  says Rickard Sandberg, professor at Karolinska Institutet s Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and the Ludwig Cancer Research.","Published: April 11, 2016"

The research, authored by a team including postdoctoral fellow Dan Randles and researchers from the University of British Columbia, is the first neurological study to look at how acetaminophen could be inhibiting the brain response associated with making errors. ""Past research tells us physical pain and social rejection share a neural process that we experience as distress, and both have been traced to same part of the brain,"" says Randles. See Also: A new approach to visualize drug delivery to the central nervous system Recent research has begun to show how exactly acetaminophen inhibits pain, while behavioral studies suggest it may also inhibit evaluative responses more generally. Randles own past research has found that people are less reactive to uncertain situations when under the effect of acetaminophen. ""The core idea of our study is that we don't fully understand how acetaminophen affects the brain,"" says Randles. ""While there's been recent behavioral research on the effects of acetaminophen, we wanted to have a sense of what's happening neurologically."" To test the idea two groups of 30 were given a target-detection task called the Go or No Go. Participants were asked to hit a Go button every time the letter F flashed on a screen but refrain from hitting the button if an E flashed on the screen. ""The trick is you're supposed to move very quickly capturing all the GOs, but hold back when you see a No Go,"" says Randles. Each participant was hooked up to an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain. The researchers were looking for a particular wave called Error Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Related Positivity (Pe). Essentially what happens is that when people are hooked up to an EEG and make an error in the task there is a robust increase in ERN and Pe. One group, which was given 1,000 mg of acetaminophen the equivalent of a normal maximum dose showed a smaller Pe when making mistakes than those who didn't receive a dose, suggesting that acetaminophen inhibits our conscious awareness of the error. ""It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error, which may have implications for cognitive control in daily life,"" says Randles. Cognitive control is an important neurological function because people are constantly doing cognitive tasks that flow automatically like reading, walking or talking. These tasks require very little cognitive control because they are well mapped out neurological processes, notes Randles. Learn More: New technologies can help short circuit chronic pain ""Sometimes you need to interrupt your normal processes or they'll lead to a mistake, like when you're talking to a friend while crossing the street, you should still be ready to react to an erratic driver,"" explains Randles. ""The task we designed is meant to capture that since most of the stimuli were Go, so you end up getting into a routine of automatically hitting the Go button. When you see a No Go, that requires cognitive control because you need to interrupt the process."" The study was double blind, so neither the researcher running the study nor the participant knew whether they had been given a placebo or acetaminophen. An unexpected and surprise finding that Randles plans to explore more closely is that those who received an acetaminophen dose appeared to miss more of the Go stimuli than they should have. He plans on expanding on the error detection aspect of the research to see whether acetaminophen is possibly causing people to ""mind wander"" and become distracted. ""An obvious question is if people aren't detecting these errors, are they also making errors more often when taking acetaminophen?

According to a new mouse study, astrocyte scars may actually be required for repair and regrowth following spinal cord injury. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and published in Nature.  See Also: First look at how astrocytes function in humans  At first, we were completely surprised when our early studies revealed that blocking scar formation after injury resulted in worse outcomes. Once we began looking specifically at regrowth, though, we became convinced that scars may actually be beneficial,  said Michael V. Sofroniew, MD, PhD, professor of neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and senior author of the study.  Our results suggest that scars may be a bridge and not a barrier towards developing better treatments for paralyzing spinal cord injuries.  When axons in the brain or spinal cord are severed, they do not grow back automatically. For example, damaged axons in the spinal cord can result in paralysis. When an injury occurs, astrocytes become activated and go to the injury site, along with cells from the immune system and form a scar. Scars have immediate benefits by decreasing inflammation at the injury site and preventing spread of tissue damage. However, long-term effects of the scars were thought to interfere with axon regrowth. Using three different mouse models to examine the effect of astrocyte scars on axonal regrowth, Dr. Sofroniew s team was able to remove the scars or prevent them from forming after a spinal cord injury. The results revealed that without astrocyte scars, there was no regrowth. Learn More: Astrocytes help blood vessels in the brain keep a grip on a healthy tone In another experiment of spinal cord injury in mice, Dr. Sofroniew s team shuttled growth factors, specific molecules that stimulate axons to grow, to the injury site and discovered that there was robust regrowth through astrocyte scars. However, if the researchers prevented scar formation, the regrowth was significantly reduced. Genetic analyses revealed that astrocytes as well as non-astrocyte cells released a variety of chemicals involved in regrowth at the injury site. In this mix, Dr. Sofroniew and his colleagues found molecules that block regrowth along with molecules that support it.   This important research provides further evidence about the complexity of the brain and spinal cord s injury response. It shows that scar forming astrocytes support axon growth and suggests that therapeutics directed only at blocking these cells may not enhance regeneration of the injured spinal cord,  said Lyn Jakeman, PhD, program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which provided funding for the study. Trauma leads to spinal cord injury in about 12,500 people in the US each year. It is estimated that 276,000 individuals in the country suffer from long-term effects of spinal cord injury. The ultimate goal of spinal cord injury research is to enable connections to develop that cross the level of injury and rewire the normal cord below. See Also: ALS: Renewing brain's aging support cells may help neurons survive Dr. Sofroniew and his colleagues are planning to investigate the exact mechanisms by which astrocytic scars support growth and ways to increase that response.

During spinal cord injury, the extensive area adjacent to the epicenter of the injury gets involved in the pathological process. So in order to achieve complete therapeutic action, the therapeutic gene must be delivered not only to the epicenter of traumatic injury but also to the surrounding areas distant from the epicenter of injury. See Also: Do spinal cord injuries cause subsequent brain damage? Two transgenes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), proved to be powerful factors in the maintenance of viability of a number of different cell populations in the spinal cord, including motor neurons. VEGF stimulates neurogenesis and axonal growth as well as the rapid reproduction of astrocytes, neural stem, and Schwann cells. GDNF reduces apoptosis and tissue degeneration, supports expression of neurofilament protein, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and growth associated protein 43. For this study, researchers from Kazan Federal University and Kazan State Medical University chose human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MCs) (easy to produce and safe, with low immunogenicity and the potential to increase neuroregeneration) transduced with the two genes VEGF and GDNF. ""Considering the action of VEGF and GDNF through different receptors and pathways, we hypothesized that the simultaneous delivery of these two therapeutic genes would promote synergistic neuroprotective effects. Thus, using a rat contusion spinal cord injury model we examined the efficacy of the construct on tissue sparing, glial scar severity, the extent of axonal regeneration, recovery of motor function, and analyzed the expression of the recombinant genes VEGF and GNDF in vitro and in vivo"" comments one of the authors Yana Mukhamedshina.

Several separate analyses converged on a key molecular process the overlap of two major signaling pathways as well as on several groups of genes that participate in that process and contribute to other conditions. See Also: Altered cell cycle gene activity underlies brain overgrowth in toddlers with autism ""Our pathway network analysis is the first bioinformatics study in autism to connect the dots of brain and body of autism and accompanying medical conditions, of autism and vulnerability to environmental stress in one investigation,"" says Ya Wen, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Neurology at MGH and MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) and lead author of the study published in PLoS One. ""This coherence of results from different approaches reinforced our confidence that we were on to something fundamentally important."" While it was originally expected that variations in only a few genes would explain the development of ASDs, major databases now list hundreds of genes that have been associated with the developmental disorders, with more added frequently. The MGH research team drew on the SFARI (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative) Gene database, which listed more than 650 genes as relevant to ASDs at the time the study was performed. To make sense of this diversity, they used additional databases to determine the pathways in which these genes participate and generate a network based on pathway interactions. Learn More: Study reveals autism's 'noisy' secret Not only did the pathways found to be most strongly associated with ASDs have many interactions with each other, they also had overlapping associations with conditions as diverse as cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, and heart disease. Most prominent were the calcium and MAP kinase signaling pathways which control key cellular activities followed by metabolic and neural pathways. Particularly intriguing was that the calcium and MAP kinase pathways overlapped in a process known to play a central role in a large range of biological functions, the activities of which when abnormal are known to be associated with cancer, metabolic and neural disorders, and heart disease. ""As the science of autism has moved from looking for a few genes to finding hundreds, we have been challenged to explain how so many different genes could contribute to such a distinctive condition,"" says Martha Herbert, MD, PhD, director of the TRANSCEND (Treatment Research and NeuroSCience Evaluation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) research lab in the MGH/MGHfC Department of Neurology, senior author of the PLoS One report and an assistant professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""Our pathway analyses show that the diversity of genes may be linked by a smaller number of impactful pathways, and we hope our findings contribute to increasing the coherence and power of autism research and treatment.""

""Many present treatments attempt to control or reduce particular symptoms of autism, but this study suggests that targeting core biological processes may be a more efficient strategy,"" says Wen. ""Addressing a core process that generates a spectrum of symptoms may give you a shot at affecting all of those symptoms at ones.

It s the first time researchers have been able to study the brain while reading actual texts, instead of individual words, and it s already helping settle some ideas about just how we read.  It s a key advance in understanding reading in the brain, because people are just reading normally,  said John Henderson, professor of psychology at the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain. The work is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.See Also: A dominant hemisphere for handedness and language? Until now, neuroscientists have only measured brain activity as a volunteer fixes his or her attention on individual words. The signals of brain activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) last for several seconds too slow to keep up with natural reading, which processes several words a second. Instead, Henderson and colleagues combined fMRI with eye tracking. Lying in an MRI scanner, subjects read text on a screen while the eye-tracking device registers which word they are paying attention to at any given time. They call this new method fixation-related, or  FIRE  fMRI.  By tracking their eye movements as they read natural paragraphs, we can know which word they are attending to, and see the neural signal for fixation on each word,  Henderson said. The team has applied the technology to test ideas about how words are represented in the brain. There are two theories about this, Henderson said. The first holds that words are represented by connections to the real world: What does it look like, how do I handle it, how does it make me feel, reflected in brain areas for vision, touch, emotion and so on. The second theory holds that words are represented as abstract symbols that interact with each other. To test these ideas, Henderson and colleagues scored the nouns in their test paragraphs for  manipulability : do they refer to real objects that can be manipulated to some degree? Learn More: Mapping language in the brain As volunteers read the manipulable nouns, areas of the brain that deal with manipulation and carrying out physical actions lit up, lending support to the view that words are represented in the brain by connections with real actions. By providing a window into brain activity during natural reading, the FIRE-fMRI technique allows the UC Davis group to look at all kinds of unanswered questions, Henderson said, such as whether language and grammar are handled by a specific part of the brain, and whether the brain anticipates upcoming words as we read. These discoveries would have implications not just for human psychology but also for artificial intelligence, he said. The research has potential implications for understanding dyslexia and other reading deficits, Henderson said.

Under this non-exclusive agreement, Meiogenix will provide access to the SpiX technology and the know-how that Meiogenix has built over the years through different research programs in rice, maize and wheat. SpiX is a plant breeding technology developed by Meiogenix that increases the genetic diversity of plant germplasm by redirecting the natural and conserved process of meiotic recombination, or an exchange of genetic material that takes place during the formation of gametes. This technology initiates the meiotic recombination by introducing natural and Spo11-targeted recombination events. This approach results in an enhancement of the genetic diversity of the segregants and thus facilitates the identification of novel traits of interest. By doing such, the technology could play significant role in future food production. Giacomo Bastianelli, Co-founder & CEO of Meiogenix declared:  We look forward to working with Bayer in applying our technologies to crops. We have invested years in developing these technologies and we are excited that they are reaching the maturity to be applied at larger scale. I personally believe that genetic technologies that mimic natural processes will contribute to producing food for generations to come.  Feeding 9 billion people in 2050 is a major challenge for humanity and conventional breeding alone will not be sufficient to meet this ambitious goal. However, in recent years, a series of plant breeding technologies such as SpiX were developed that could help in developing new plant varieties to address our needs while respecting the environment and global resources.

His ideas for improving the odds are great enough for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to invest in them. Zhang has won a pair of prestigious NIH R01 grants in the past month to develop novel therapeutic tools. The first, awarded in March by the NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute will allow his lab at Rice s BioScience Research Collaborative to develop probes that help next-generation sequencing (NGS) find and profile disease-causing DNA sequence variants by removing the vast majority of healthy sequences from view. That grant is for more than $2.5 million over five years. The lab customizes its molecular capture probes to bind to healthy DNA, effectively moving it out of the way as other probes identify sequences of interest that can be enriched for further analysis. The second grant, awarded this month, targets early detection of cancer. That grant was awarded by the National Cancer Institute and is for $3 million over five years. It will fund the design and validation of novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and instruments for low-cost, point-of-care analysis of cancer-specific mutations.  My research has three main areas,  Zhang said.  One is to understand the basic science of DNA and RNA. The second is to make very rapid diagnostics for point-of-care use for infectious diseases.  The third is to make comprehensive tools for diagnostics and profiling. We need a way to enrich DNA of interest by removing the vast majority of healthy DNA that does not provide meaningful scientific or clinical information,  a task he compared to finding one purple bead in a large jar of white ones.  If you re doing random sampling, chances are you ll only see the white ones. We can get rid of them to reveal all the unusual ones.  The first grant will help the lab perform such comprehensive diagnostics using next-generation sequencing.  It s matured in the past 10 years into a powerful technology that s able to easily and cost effectively look at many different DNA molecules within a bio specimen, be it blood or urine or tissue, in a high-throughput way,  Zhang said. The grant will allow the lab to purchase a next-generation sequencer that will also be available to Texas Medical Center colleagues.  I hope this will be an enticement to potential clinical collaborators,  Zhang said. The Rice lab is developing NGS techniques to locate rare DNA variants.  In cancer, for example, most of your DNA are healthy,  Zhang said.  You only have a very small fraction that s cancer DNA.  Obviously, there are many other applications,  he said.  For example, for food safety, most of a sample of ground beef should be beef DNA, but there might be bacterial or viral DNA you want to detect. If you re looking at soil, you might have mostly benign bacteria but also legumes and other things.  He said the technique can either help find known DNA sequences or sidestep good DNA  to detect everything that s unhealthy.  With the second grant, Zhang and his team plan to develop a PCR platform capable of the simultaneous detection and quantitation of 1,000 rare single nucleotide variants in a biological sample. Once validated in the lab, they hope to test the technology on blood samples from non-small-cell lung cancer patients.","Published: April 8, 2016"

The test, known as a liquid biopsy, proved so reliable in the study that Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) expects to offer it soon to all patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), either at the time of first diagnosis or of relapse following previous treatment. NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, diagnosed in more than 200,000 people in the United States each year, according to the American Cancer Society. An estimated 30 percent of NSCLC patients have mutations in either of the genes included in the study, and can often be treated with targeted therapies. The study is being published online today by the journal JAMA Oncology. The liquid biopsy tested in the study   technically known as rapid plasma genotyping   involves taking a test tube-full of blood, which contains free-floating DNA from cancer cells, and analyzing that DNA for mutations or other abnormalities. (When tumor cells die, their DNA spills into the bloodstream, where it s known as cell-free DNA.) The technique, which provides a  snapshot  of key genetic irregularities in a tumor, is a common tool in research for probing the molecular make-up of different kinds of cancers.  We see plasma genotyping as having enormous potential as a clinical test, or assay   a rapid, noninvasive way of screening a cancer for common genetic fingerprints, while avoiding the challenges of traditional invasive biopsies,  said the senior author of the study, Geoffrey Oxnard, MD, thoracic oncologist and lung cancer researcher at Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women s Hospital.  Our study was the first to demonstrate prospectively that a liquid biopsy technique can be a practical tool for making treatment decisions in cancer patients. The trial was such a success that we are transitioning the assay into a clinical test for lung cancer patients at DF/BWCC.  The study involved 180 patients with NSCLC, 120 of whom were newly diagnosed, and 60 of whom had become resistant to a previous treatment, allowing the disease to recur. Participants  cell-free DNA was tested for mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes, and for a separate mutation in EGFR that allows tumor cells to become resistant to front-line targeted drugs. The test was performed with a technique known as droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), which counts the individual letters of the genetic code in cell-free DNA to determine if specific mutations are present. Each participant also underwent a conventional tissue biopsy to test for the same mutations. The results of the liquid biopsies were then compared to those of the tissue biopsies. The data showed that liquid biopsies returned results much more quickly. The median turnaround time for liquid biopsies was three days, compared to 12 days for tissue biopsies in newly diagnosed patients and 27 days in drug-resistant patients. Liquid biopsy was also found to be highly accurate. In newly diagnosed patients, the  predictive value  of plasma ddPCR was 100 percent for the primary EGFR mutation and the KRAS mutation   meaning that a patient who tested positive for either mutation was certain to have that mutation in his or her tumor. For patients with the EGFR resistance mutation, the predictive value of the ddPCR test was 79 percent, suggesting the blood test was able to find additional cases with the mutation that were missed using standard biopsies.  In some patients with the EGFR resistance mutation, ddPCR detected mutations missed by standard tissue biopsy,  Oxnard remarked.  A resistant tumor is inherently made up of multiple subsets of cells, some of which carry different patterns of genetic mutations. A single biopsy is only analyzing a single part of the tumor, and may miss a mutation present elsewhere in the body. A liquid biopsy, in contrast, may better reflect the distribution of mutations in the tumor as a whole.  When ddPCR failed to detect these mutations, the cause was less clear-cut, Oxnard says. It could indicate that the tumor cells don t carry the mutations or, alternatively, that the tumor isn t shedding its DNA into the bloodstream. This discrepancy between the test results and the presence of mutations was less common in patients whose cancer had metastasized to multiple sites in the body, researchers found. The ddPCR-based test, or assay, was piloted and optimized for patients at the Translational Resarch lab of the Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science at Dana-Farber. It was then validated for clinical use at Dana-Farber s Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology. An advantage of this form of liquid biopsy is that it can help doctors quickly determine whether a patient is responding to therapy. Fifty participants in the study had repeat testing done after starting treatment for their cancer.  Those whose blood tests showed a disappearance of the mutations within two weeks were more likely to stay on the treatment than patients who didn t see such a reduction,  said the study s lead author, Adrian Sacher, MD, of Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women s Hospital. And because tumors are constantly evolving and acquiring additional mutations, repeated liquid biopsies can provide early detection of a new mutation   such as the EGFR resistance mutation   that can potentially be treated with targeted agents.  The study data are compelling,  said DF/BWCC pathologist Lynette Sholl, MD, explaining the center s decision to begin offering ddPCR-based liquid biopsy to all lung cancer patients.  We validated the authors  findings by cross-comparing results from liquid and tissue biopsies in 34 NSCLC patients. To work as a real-world clinical test, liquid biopsy needs to provide reliable, accurate data and be logistically practical. That s what we ve seen with the ddPCR-based blood test.  The test has great utility both for patients newly diagnosed with NSCLC and for those with a recurrence of the disease,  she continued.  It s fast, it s quantitative (it indicates the amount of mutant DNA in a sample), and it can be readily employed at a cancer treatment center.

Lucky descendants of this creature, including today s salamanders or zebrafish, can still perform the feat, but humans lost much of their regenerative power over millions of years of evolution.  In an effort to understand what was lost, researchers have built a running list of the genes that enable regenerating animals to grow back a severed tail or repair damaged tissues. Surprisingly, they have found that genes important for regeneration in these creatures also have counterparts in humans. The key difference might not lie in the genes themselves but in the sequences that regulate how those genes are activated during injury. A Duke study appearing April 6 in the journal Nature has discovered the presence of these regulatory sequences in zebrafish, a favored model of regeneration research. Called  tissue regeneration enhancer elements  or TREEs, these sequences can turn on genes in injury sites and even be engineered to change the ability of animals to regenerate.   We want to know how regeneration happens, with the ultimate goal of helping humans realize their full regenerative potential,"" said Kenneth D. Poss, Ph.D., senior author of the study and professor of cell biology at Duke University School of Medicine.  Our study points to a way that we could potentially awaken the genes responsible for regeneration that we all carry within us.  Over the last decade, researchers have identified dozens of regeneration genes in organisms like zebrafish, flies, and mice. For example, one molecule called neuregulin 1 can make heart muscle cells proliferate and others called fibroblast growth factors can promote the regeneration of a severed fin. Yet, Poss says, what has not been explored are the regulatory elements that turn these genes on in injured tissue, keep them on during regeneration, and then turn them off when regeneration is done.  In this study, Poss and his colleagues wanted to determine whether or not these important stretches of DNA exist, and if so, pinpoint their location. It was already well known that small chunks of sequence, called enhancer elements, control when genes are turned on in a developing embryo. But it wasn t clear whether these elements are also used to drive regeneration. First, lead study author Junsu Kang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Poss lab, looked for genes that were strongly induced during fin and heart regeneration in the zebrafish. He found that a gene called leptin b was turned on in fish with amputated fins or injured hearts. Kang scoured the 150,000 base pairs of sequence surrounding leptin b and identified an enhancer element roughly 7,000 base pairs away from the gene. He then whittled the enhancer down to the shortest required DNA sequence. In the process, Kang discovered that the element could be separated into two distinct parts: one that activates genes in an injured heart, and, next to it, another that activates genes in an injured fin. He fused these sequences to two regeneration genes, fibroblast growth factor and neuregulin 1, to create transgenic zebrafish whose fins and hearts had superior regenerative responses after injury. Finally, the researchers tested whether these  tissue regeneration enhancer elements  or TREEs could have a similar effect in mammalian systems like mice. Collaborator Brian L. Black, PhD, of the University of California, San Francisco attached one TREE to a gene called lacZ that produces a blue color wherever it is turned on. Remarkably, he found that borrowing these elements from the genome of zebrafish could activate gene expression in the injured paws and hearts of transgenic mice.  We are just at the beginning of this work, but now we have an encouraging proof of concept that these elements possess all the sequences necessary to work with mammalian machinery after an injury,  said Poss. He suspects there may be many different types of TREEs: those that turn on genes in all tissues; those that turn on genes only in one tissue like the heart; and those that are active in the embryo as it develops and then are reactivated in the adult as it regenerates. Eventually, Poss thinks that genetic elements like these could be combined with genome-editing technologies to improve the ability of mammals, even humans, to repair and regrow damaged or missing body parts.  We want to find more of these types of elements so we can understand what turns on and ultimately controls the program of regeneration,  said Poss.  There may be strong elements that boost expression of the gene much higher than others, or elements that activate genes in a specific cell type that is injured. Having that level of specificity may one day enable us to change a poorly regenerative tissue to a better one with near-surgical precision. ","Published: April 8, 2016"

This study finds that two very different metabolic processes are linked in a way that is specifically required for cells to adapt to the stress associated with cancer progression.  The study, available online today in the journal Nature, reveals that cancer cells use an alternate version of two well-known metabolic pathways called the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the Krebs cycle to defend against toxins. The toxins are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill cells via oxidative stress. This work builds on earlier studies by Dr. DeBerardinis  laboratory that found the Krebs cycle, a series of chemical reactions that cells use to generate energy, could reverse itself under certain conditions to nourish cancer cells. Dr. DeBerardinis said most normal cells and tumor cells grow by attaching to nutrient-rich tissue called a matrix.  They are dependent on matrix attachment to receive growth-promoting signals and to regulate their metabolism in a way that supports cell growth, proliferation, and survival,  he said. Detachment from the matrix results in a sudden increase in ROS that is lethal to normal cells, he added. Cancer cells seem to have a workaround. The destruction of healthy cells when detached from the matrix was reported in a landmark 2009 Nature study by Harvard Medical School cell biologist Dr. Joan Brugge. Intriguingly, that same study found that inserting an oncogene   a gene with the potential to cause cancer   into a normal cell caused it to behave like a cancer cell and survive detachment, said Dr. DeBerardinis, who also is affiliated with the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth & Development, holds the Joel B. Steinberg, M.D. Chair in Pediatrics, and is a Sowell Family Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.  Another Nature study, this one from CRI Director Dr. Sean Morrison slaboratory in November 2015, found that the rare skin cancer cells that were able to detach from the primary tumor and successfully metastasize to other parts of the body had the ability to keep ROS levels from getting dangerously high,  Dr. DeBerardinis said. Dr. Morrison, also a CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, holds the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatrics Genetics at UT Southwestern. Working under the premise that the two findings were pieces of the same puzzle, a crucial part of the picture seemed to be missing, he said. It was known for decades that the PPP was a major source of NADPH, which provides a source of reducing equivalents (that is, electrons) to scavenge ROS; however, the PPP produces NADPH in a part of the cell called the cytosol, whereas the reactive oxygen species are generated primarily in another subcellular structure called the mitochondria.  If you think of ROS as fire, then NADPH is like the water used by cancer cells to douse the flames,  Dr. DeBerardinis said. But how could NADPH from the PPP help deal with the stress of ROS produced in a completely different part of the cell?  What we did was to discover how this happens,  Dr. DeBerardinis said. The current study in Nature demonstrates that cancer cells use a  piggybacking  system to carry reducing equivalents from the PPP into the mitochondria. This movement involves an unusual reaction in the cytosol that transfers reducing equivalents from NADPH to a molecule called citrate, similar to a reversed reaction of the Krebs cycle, he said. The citrate then enters the mitochondria and stimulates another pathway that results in the release of reducing equivalents to produce NADPH right at the location of ROS creation, allowing the cancer cells to survive and grow without the benefit of matrix attachment.  We knew that both the PPP and Krebs cycle provide metabolic benefits to cancer cells.  But we had no idea that they were linked in this unusual fashion,  he said.  Strikingly, normal cells were unable to transport NADPH by this mechanism, and died as a result of the high ROS levels.  Dr. DeBerardinis stressed that the findings were based on cultured cell models, and more research will be necessary to test the role of the pathway in living organisms.  We are particularly excited to test whether this pathway is required for metastasis, because cancer cells need to survive in a matrix-detached state in the circulation in order to metastasize,  he said.","Published: April 8, 2016"

UQ School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences Deputy Head Professor James De Voss said the discovery held promise for the development of treatments. The research team, led by Professor Paul Ortiz de Montellano in the US, investigated the impact of compounds related to cholesterol on the tuberculosis-causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cholesterol is known to affect the virulence and infectivity of TB.  What Paul s team and our team have shown is that if you give this bacterium modified cholesterol instead, then it can t use it as its energy source and so it stops growing,  Professor De Voss said.  Interestingly, we don t quite understand why this happens.  Our discovery suggests a new way in which we can robustly inhibit growth of the TB bacterium.  TB is a highly infectious lung disease that kills one person every 21 seconds. There were 9.6 million new cases of TB in 2014, resulting in 1.5 million deaths. One in three people globally is infected with TB, with the bulk of the disease burden falling on developing countries. Professor De Voss said the scale of the threat, compounded by the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant strains of bacteria, meant it was vital to find new ways to combat tuberculosis. The team at UQ, including postdoctoral research fellow Dr Siew Hoon Wong, was responsible for synthesising inhibitors of the enzymes used to modify the cholesterol by M. tuberculosis. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and is published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Professor De Voss said his team would now partner with School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences researcher Dr Nick West, who is the founder and Laboratory Head of the UQ Tuberculosis Research Laboratory, the only Australian laboratory dedicated to TB microbiology.","Published: April 8, 2016"

Now, an international team of scientists led by The Wistar Institute have shown that tumor cells in aged skin behave differently than tumor cells in younger skin, according to study results published in the journal Nature. Age-related changes in the microenvironment make tumor cells more metastatic and more resistant to treatment with targeted therapies. In light of these findings, the scientists demonstrated how antioxidants could serve as a better treatment strategy for older patients with melanoma.  It s fascinating to see that the microenvironment can have such a profound effect on both metastasis, and response to a therapy that is specifically targeted to a mutation in a gene. This tells us that no tumor is an island, and even therapies targeted against these driver mutations are affected by the way the tumor cell communicates with its microenvironment,  said lead author Ashani Weeraratna, Ph.D., associate professor in the Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program at Wistar. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and patients with advanced cases of the disease only have a 20 percent chance of surviving five years after their diagnosis. Multiple targeted therapies for melanoma have been approved in the last few years, but patients who receive these drugs eventually relapse and become resistant to these treatment options. While multiple factors may contribute to the age-related increases in cancer, for the first time, the Weeraratna Lab has pinpointed age-related changes that occur in the microenvironment of tumor cells. Cells found in the skin called dermal fibroblasts help the skin recover from injuries, and can contribute to the growth and invasion of melanoma cells. The researchers used dermal fibroblasts from healthy donors 25-35 years of age or from donors 55-65 years of age to understand what factors contribute to the difference in melanoma progression in aging cell populations. Weeraratna and colleagues determined that a secreted factor sFRP2 was present in aging skin cells. SFRP2 regulates another protein called  -catenin that normally blocks the invasion of melanoma cells. In addition, b-catenin loss has been shown to promote oxidative stress in some cell types. The researchers showed that in an aged microenvironment, there are fewer scavengers of free oxygen radicals, leading to more activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the same time, the age-induced loss of beta-catenin renders melanoma cells less capable of dealing with ROS, resulting in a genetically unstable tumor. Due to increased activity of ROS and decreased levels of  -catenin, older patients are more resistant to treatment with drugs that inhibit a gene, BRAF, mutated in approximately half of all cases of melanoma. Wistar scientists also showed how antioxidants can make these therapies more effective for older melanoma patients.  Our findings highlight how vital it is to treat that melanoma in an age-appropriate manner,  said Amanpreet Kaur, a graduate student in the Weeraratna lab and first author of the study.  With other studies confirming the effectiveness of anti-oxidants in treating BRAF-mutated cancers, we have more evidence of how an older population may benefit from new therapeutic strategies.  Wistar's business development team is actively seeking meaningful collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners to comprehensively interrogate the tumor microenvironment's response to targeted therapies.

Under the terms of the agreement, Heptares will receive an upfront payment of $125 million and is eligible to receive contingent milestone payments of up to approximately $665 million associated with the successful Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical development and launch of the first three licensed compounds for multiple indications and up to approximately $2.5 billion associated with achieving certain annual sales thresholds during the several years following launch. In addition, Heptares is eligible to receive up to double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of all products resulting from the partnership. Allergan is also committing up to $50 million to a research and development program to be conducted jointly by Allergan and Heptares aimed at advancing multiple candidates through Phase 2 clinical studies. Allergan will be responsible for the development of licensed compounds upon initiation of Phase 2b studies and for subsequent manufacturing and commercialization of the products. The agreement covers first-in-class selective small molecule agonists targeting muscarinic M1 and M4 receptors in the brain, discovered using Heptares  proprietary StaR  technology platform. Allergan will receive exclusive rights to a broad clinical and preclinical portfolio of M1, M4 and dual M1/M4 agonists, including HTL9936 and HTL18318, selective M1 agonists currently in Phase 1 clinical development. M1 selective compounds are in development for the potential treatment of symptomatic cognitive deficits in Alzheimer s patients, with the potential upside of better tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available treatments. M4 selective compounds may provide a novel approach to treat the neurobehavioral symptoms (psychoses) associated with Alzheimer s disease and related neurological disorders, through a different mechanism of action than available antipsychotics. Combined, dual M1/M4 agonists may be able to treat both cognitive impairment and neurobehavioral symptoms. ""Cognitive impairment and psychosis are progressive and debilitating symptoms associated with many CNS diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, with few approved therapies available,  said David Nicholson, Executive Vice President and President, Global Brands Research and Development at Allergan. ""The Heptares M1 compounds have shown promising results in early development in their ability to selectively target the M1 receptor without also activating the M2 or M3 receptors, which are associated with undesirable side effects.  We look forward to advancing these compounds into the next stages of development, and potentially adding new approaches to helping physicians treat patients suffering from the effects of Alzheimer s disease, an area of medicine where Allergan remains committed to continued innovation.  The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of HTL9936 were assessed in a recently completed Phase 1 study. The data provide strong evidence of a therapeutic window for the selective M1 agonist mechanism in general, and for progression of HTL9936 and similar molecules as medicines to treat cognitive disorders. HTL9936 exhibited good brain penetration and M1 selectivity with no adverse events typically attributed to the stimulation of M2 and M3 receptors. HTL9936 also exhibited robust and statistically significant changes in brain electrical activity measured using multiple electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers relevant to cognition. These pro-cognitive effects were seen at low doses and low blood concentrations that were safe and well tolerated. Malcolm Weir, Chief Executive Officer of Heptares and Chief R&D Officer at Sosei, said:  We are delighted that the quality of our muscarinic agonist candidates, discovered and developed wholly in-house, and our translational capabilities have been recognized by Allergan, a global leader in the development and commercialization of treatments for CNS diseases. We have a highly committed and experienced partner in Allergan and look forward to working together towards the development of multiple new breakthrough medicines over the coming years.  Shinichi Tamura, Chairman and CEO of Sosei Group Corporation, added:  This new agreement with Allergan marks an important milestone in our journey to become a global biopharmaceutical company. This agreement further endorses our strategic decision to acquire Heptares in February last year, placing its GPCR-directed drug discovery and development capabilities at the heart of our business.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/boosting-gene-transfer-capabilities-189117,Boosting Gene Transfer Capabilities  A new and highly efficient method for gene transfer has been developed  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The technique, which involves culturing and transfecting cells with genetic material on an array of carbon nanotubes, appears to overcome the limitations of other gene editing technologies. The device is the product of a collaboration between researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) and the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).  This platform holds the potential to make the gene transfer process more robust and decrease toxic effects, while increasing amount and diversity of genetic cargo we can deliver into cells,  said Ian Dickerson, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience at the URMC and co-author of the paper.  This represents a very simple, inexpensive, and efficient process that is well-tolerated by cells and can successfully deliver DNA into tens of thousands of cells simultaneously,  said Michael Schrlau, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering at RIT and co-author of the paper. Gene transfer therapies have long held great promise in medicine.  New gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, now enable researchers to precisely target segments of genetic code giving rise to a range of potential scientific and medical applications from fixing genetic defects, to manipulating stem cells, to reengineering immune cells to fight infection and cancer.  Scientists currently employ several different methods to insert new genetic instructions into cells, including creating small holes in the cell membrane using electrical pulses, injecting DNA into cells using a device called a  gene gun,  and employing viruses to  infect  cells with new genetic code. However, all of these methods tend to suffer from two fundamental problems.  First, these processes can be highly toxic, leaving scientists with too few healthy cells to work with.  And second, these methods are restricted in the amount of genetic information   or  payload    they can deliver into the cells, limiting their application.  These techniques can also be time consuming and expensive.  The new device described in the study was fabricated in the Schrlau Nano-Bio Interface Laboratory at RIT by Masoud Golshadi, first author of the paper.  Using a process called chemical vapor deposition, the researchers created a structure akin to a honeycomb consisting of millions of densely packed carbo nanotubes with openings on both sides of a thin disk shaped membrane.   The device was employed in the Dickerson Lab at URMC to culture a series of different human and animal cells.  After 48 hours, the cells were bathed in a medium that contained liquid DNA.  The carbon nanotubes acted as conduits drawing the genetic material into the cells.  Using this method, the researchers observed that 98 percent of the cells survived and 85 percent were successfully transfected with the new genetic material.  The mechanism of DNA transfer is still under investigation, but the researchers suspect it may be via a process called enhanced endocytosis, a method by which cells transfer bundles of proteins back and forth through the cell membrane.  The device has also shown the ability to successfully culture a wide range of cell types, including cells that are typically difficult to grow and keep alive, such as immune cells, stem cells, and neurons.  The researchers are now optimizing the technology in hopes that the device   which is inexpensive to produce   can be made available to researchers and, ultimately, used to develop new treatments for a range of diseases.","Published: April 8, 2016"

The discriminant analysis was performed using both whole grain and flour. The transgenic sample set included 409 samples for whole grain sorting and 414 samples for flour experiments, while the non-transgenic set consisted of 126 and 156 samples for whole grain and flour, respectively. Methods and Results Samples were scanned using a Foss-NIR Systems 6500 System II instrument. Discrimination models were developed using the entire spectral range (400 2500 nm) and ranges of 400 780 nm, 800 1098 nm and 1100 2500 nm, followed by analysis of means of partial least square (PLS). Two external validations were made, using samples from the years 2013 and 2014 and a minimum of 99% of the flour samples and 96% of the whole grain samples were classified correctly. Conclusions The results demonstrate the ability of NIRS to successfully discriminate between wheat samples with low-gliadin content and wild types.

Today you can only use X-rays to see how much air babies  lungs contain, but, according to research from Lund University in Sweden, in the future, these types of tests could be done using laser light.  Multiple X-ray examinations involve a certain increase in the risk of developing cancer, not least in small children. Decreasing the number of X-ray examinations would be a major advantage , says Emilie Krite Svanberg. The basic principle of the method is to send light of a certain wavelength into the body, and then measure how much of the light can be retrieved. Based on this, it is possible to calculate the oxygen supply. Technology that measures oxygen bound in the blood already exists. Free oxygen that exists in cavities such as lungs is much more difficult to measure. Here, the submitted light must be at exactly the right wavelength   achieving a wavelength of 760 nanometres is not enough; the light beam must be precisely 760.445 nm. The Lund University researchers are the first ones ever to successfully perform these types of measurements. Trials with healthy newborn babies have shown that the method works. The research group, with roots in both the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Engineering, has, along with private companies, received a large EU grant to continue developing the method.  Today, the method requires one person to hold a measuring instrument against the baby s chest, while another sits by the computer, registering the results. Our goal is to simplify this technology , says Emilie Krite Svanberg, and continues:  We hope that the measurements will be possible to perform automatically, by using small transmitters attached to the baby s chest. This would enable measuring the lung function continuously, in a way that is completely safe and that doesn t bother the child . These measurements could help determine whether or not a premature baby needs treatment in order to improve their breathing. If intensive interventions are necessary, such as inflating collapsed parts of the lungs, light measurements could also be used to minimise the risk of injury from the treatment. Another part of Emilie Krite Svanberg s doctoral thesis is about refined oxygen measurements to monitor severely ill adult patients. In critical conditions, such as circulatory failure (medical shock), the body focuses mainly on maintaining blood supply to the brain and the heart. The blood flow to less vital parts of the body, such as arms and legs, decreases, which can be measured through a newer method that uses short laser pulses.  In cases of circulatory failure, time is crucial. The faster healthcare staff realise the oncoming crisis, the better the chances of the patient to survive , says Emilie Krite Svanberg, hoping that by measuring the oxygen supply, in for instance the forearm, it will be possible to detect signs of medical deterioration at an early stage and thereby save lives. The technology is not yet available in hospitals, but could soon be introduced. Another advantage is that the technology is so simple that it could be used not only within intensive care, but also in emergency wards and other healthcare clinics.","Published: April 8, 2016"

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/treatment-of-common-prostate-cancer-212349,Treatment of Common Prostate Cancer Researchers at UTSW have found that the prostate cancer treatments suppress immune response and may promote relapse  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Prostate cancer patients and their doctors may want to think twice about the best timing for chemotherapy or radiation therapy in conjunction with a common nonsurgical treatment, based on international research findings led by UT Southwestern Medical Center investigators. Researchers using mouse models found that many medical androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs)   the most commonly used nonsurgical treatments for prostate cancer   may suppress responses patients  adaptive immune, preventing immunotherapies from working if both treatments are used but not sequenced properly. ADTs are anti-hormone therapies that decrease the body s levels of androgens, the type of hormone that is required for prostate cancer to survive and grow. The study findings were published this week in Science Translational Medicine.  Medical ADTs have been used for a half century to treat prostate cancer, and promising clinical results for cancer immunotherapy have led to attempts to combine it and other standard-of-care therapies with immunotherapy to treat the disease,  said senior author and principal investigator. Relapse of prostate tumors, however, has been a major problem.  While surgical ADT castration   works well with immunotherapy, we determined that some androgen receptor antagonists could reduce the T-cell response against prostate cancer, leading to early tumor relapse,  said Dr. Fu, who holds the Mary Nell and Ralph B. Rogers Professorship in Immunology and also is a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. In other words, the suppressed immune response caused by medical ADTs block the efficacy of immunotherapy and leads to the relapses in cancer commonly seen in clinical trials.  Our study shows that in some patients, this poor response could also be due to the radiation or chemotherapy itself suppressing the immune response,  Dr. Fu explained.  These treatments may reduce the tumor burden in the short term, but at the same time, they can suppress the immune response   and because they don t kill every cancer cell, resistant clones will be selected, especially when the body s immune response is not mobilized, and the tumor will relapse much more aggressively. Careful regulation of the timing, types, and dosage of anti androgens used with immunotherapy are key to maximizing the anti-tumor effects of combination therapy, the study indicates.  The findings also highlight an underappreciated mechanism of androgen receptor (AR) antagonist-mediated immune suppression and provide a new strategy to enhance the immune response and perhaps prevent or delay the relapse of advanced prostate cancer,  Dr. Fu said. More studies are needed, Dr. Fu said, but the upshot is that some chemotherapies and radiation therapies should not be used concurrently with immunotherapies.  We hope that our findings will cause physicians to think twice before starting chemotherapy or radiation on their cancer patients, to consider the best way to combine them with immunotherapies,  he said.  The idea is to kill the tumor cells while also considering whether these therapies are suppressing or activating the immune system.

Although the phenomenon was demonstrated using transgenic mice, researchers believe that the findings are convincing enough to warrant further investigation in humans. See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression ""We know that the incidence of Alzheimer's is low before age 65, but doubles every 5 to 6 years afterward,"" explains the study's lead author Fr d ric Calon, professor at the Universit  Laval Faculty of Pharmacy and researcher at Centre de recherche du CHU de Qu bec-Universit  Laval. ""We also know that metabolism and body temperature decrease as people get older. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the changes in the body's thermoregulation that occur with age amplify the main manifestations of Alzheimer's and that a vicious circle can even set in because the disease expresses itself in certain areas of the brain involved in temperature regulation."" To test this hypothesis, the researchers used a type of transgenic mice that express the main manifestations of Alzheimer's disease as they age: They produce beta-amyloid, which leads to the formation of senile plaque in the brain; they are affected by a pathology that renders neurons non-functional; and they lose synaptic proteins. In these mice, memory problems begin to arise at the age of 6 months. By comparing these transgenic mice with normal ones, researchers first established that the transgenic mice were less able to effectively maintain their body temperature as they aged. The difference reached almost 1  Celsius by the age of 12 months. The researchers also observed that the manifestations of Alzheimer's were markedly more pronounced in transgenic mice when they were exposed to low temperatures: ""The abnormal tau proteins responsible for neuron deterioration increase more in transgenic mice than normal mice, and the loss of synaptic proteins is more pronounced,"" explains Professor Calon. Learn More: Connecting Alzheimer's disease and the immune system Conversely, researchers observed that exposure to a high ambient temperature mitigated some manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. After one week in a 28 C environment, the transgenic mice's body temperature had increased by 1 C, beta-amyloid production had dropped substantially, and memory test results were comparable to those of normal mice. ""Our findings suggest that it is worth exploring the treatment of thermoregulation among seniors suffering from Alzheimer's,"" says Professor Calon.

In contrast, when researchers used a more opinion-based scoring system, gray matter scores did not show a significant association with neurodevelopmental impairment. ""We let the data drive our model,"" said Laurel Slaughter, MD, a neurologist at Nationwide Children's and lead author of the study. ""We measured numerous individual imaging factors and their correlation to outcomes, instead of deciding ahead of time what we believed would be important. There is still some subjectivity, and neuroradiologists are going to have slightly different readings or interpretations. But our model is more objective."" The study, published in the journal Neonatology, involved 122 infants born premature with a weight equal to or less than 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram). Brain MRIs were performed at term-equivalent age at Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital, Houston, under the supervision of Nehal Parikh, DO. Dr. Parikh, now a neonatologist at Nationwide Children's and principal investigator in the Center for Perinatal Research in The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's, is the study's senior author. At 18 to 24 months of age, the infants were tested using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III, and all had a standard neurologic examination for the presence of cerebral palsy. Along with the findings involving gyral maturational delay, researchers discovered that diffuse cystic abnormality was a significant predictor of cerebral palsy with the data-driven scoring system. This result is consistent with several previous studies. These predictors exhibited high specificity (95% to 99%), so when gyral maturational delay and diffuse cystic abnormality were found, often impairments were as well. However, both predictors showed comparatively low sensitivity (30% to 67%), illustrating that the absence of gyral maturational delay and diffuse cystic abnormality does not always mean impairments are also absent.

According to Dr. Slaughter, the study may suggest to physicians that if these predictors are found, therapies should begin at the earliest moment that impairments become obvious. This research also focuses more attention on the brain's gray matter, while previous studies have focused on white matter.

See Also: Blocking DNA repair mechanisms could improve radiation therapy for glioblastoma In research with rats, these membrane structures secreted by cells called microvesicles transplanted two days after cranial irradiation restored cognitive function, reduced inflammation and protected neurons, as measured in four- and six-week assessments, with no sign of immunorejection or tumor growth two stem cell-related risk factors. Study results appear this week online in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science. Microvesicles are small, fluid-filled sacs secreted by all human cells. Their plasma contains a range of bioactive cargo (proteins, RNAs, etc.) that can benefit cellular physiology. In the brain, they help regulate the health and functionality of neurons. Microvesicles also can play an important role in tissue regeneration. For the UCI research, Charles Limoli, professor of radiation oncology, and colleagues isolated and removed microvesicles secreted by multipotent human neural stem cells. Through a series of injections in areas above the hippocampus (a region known for the growth of new neurons) microvesicles were transplanted into the brains of rats that had undergone radiation treatment. Each injection contained 2 microliters of microvesicles. Starting one month after irradiation, the rodents receiving microvesicle injections showed significant improvements in cognition as gauged by four independent behavioral tasks. Limoli said these cognitive benefits were associated with considerable reductions in neuroinflammation and the preservation of neuronal structures both classic signs that radiation injury in the brain was either prevented or reversed. Limoli reported similar results from a 2011 study in which multipotent human neural stem cells were used. However, stem cells may present certain risks, such as rejection by the body's immune system, altering the growth of existing tumors or forming into teratomas conditions that are less problematic with microvesicles. Learn More: Hyperfractionated radiation therapy improves local-regional control for patients with head, neck cancer ""The appeal of strategies using microvesicles instead of stem cells is that they eliminate any concerns for teratoma formation and substantially minimize side effects associated with immunorejection,"" Limoli said. Radiotherapy for brain tumors is limited by how well the surrounding tissue tolerates it. Patients receiving radiation at effective levels suffer varying degrees of learning and memory loss that can adversely affect their quality of life. ""In almost every instance, people experience severe cognitive impairment that's progressive and debilitating,"" Limoli said. ""Pediatric cancer patients can experience a drop of up to three IQ points per year."" He added that further work is needed to identify the specific factors within microvesicles that are responsible for the neuroprotective effects and to determine how long these beneficial effects persist.

But a few regions continue to grow new nerve cells and require the services of cellular sentinels, specialized immune cells that keep the brain safe by getting rid of dead or dysfunctional cells. See Also: Scientists catch brain damage in the act Now, Salk scientists have uncovered the surprising extent to which both dying and dead neurons are cleared away, and have identified specific cellular switches that are key to this process. The work is detailed in Nature.  We discovered that receptors on immune cells in the brain are vital for both healthy and injured states,  says Greg Lemke, senior author of the work, a Salk professor of molecular neurobiology and the holder of the Fran oise Gilot-Salk Chair.  These receptors could be potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions or inflammation-related disorders, such as Parkinson s disease.  Two decades ago, the Lemke lab discovered that immune cells express critical molecules called TAM receptors, which have since become a focus for autoimmune and cancer research in many laboratories. Two of the TAM receptors, dubbed Mer and Axl, help immune cells called macrophages act as garbage collectors, identifying and consuming the over 100 billion dead cells that are generated in a human body every day. For the current study, the team asked if Mer and Axl did the same job in the brain. Specialized central nervous system macrophages called microglia make up about 10 percent of cells in the brain, where they detect, respond to and destroy pathogens. The researchers removed Axl and Mer in the microglia of otherwise healthy mice. To their surprise, they found that the absence of the two receptors resulted in a large pile-up of dead cells, but not everywhere in the brain. Cellular corpses were seen only in the small regions where the production of new neurons  neurogenesis is observed. Learn More: The immune system, microglia, and the brain Many cells die normally during adult neurogenesis, but they are immediately eaten by microglia.  It is very hard to detect even a single dead cell in a normal brain, because they are so efficiently recognized and cleared by microglia,  says Paqui G. Trav s, a co-first author on the paper and former Salk research associate.  But in the neurogenic regions of mice lacking Mer and Axl, we detected many such cells.  When the researchers more closely examined this process by tagging the newly growing neurons in mice s microglia missing Mer and Axl, they noticed something else interesting. New neurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb, or smell center, increased dramatically without Axl and Mer around. Mice lacking the TAM receptors had a 70 percent increase in newly generated cells in the olfactory bulb than normal mice. How and to what extent this unchecked new neural growth affects a mouse s sense of smell is not yet known, according to Lemke, though it is an area the lab will explore. But the fact that so many more living nerve cells were able to migrate into the olfactory bulb in the absence of the receptors suggests that Mer and Axl have another role aside from clearing dead cells they may actually also target living, but functionally compromised, cells.  It appears as though a significant fraction of cell death in neurogenic regions is not due to intrinsic death of the cells but rather is a result of the microglia themselves, which are killing a fraction of the cells by engulfment,  says Lemke.  In other words, some of these newborn neuron progenitors are actually being eaten alive.  This isn t necessarily a bad thing in the healthy brain, Lemke adds. The brain produces more neurons than it can use and then prunes back the cells that aren t needed. However, in an inflamed or diseased brain, the destruction of living cells may backfire. In the area of a brain lacking Mer and Axl a  trail of death  is apparent from the migratory pathway from the neurogenic region to the olfactory bulb. Blue all cells; green spots are dead cells. No green spots are seen in the same section from a normal mouse. Credit: Salk Institute  The Lemke lab did one more series of experiments to understand the role of TAM receptors in disease: they looked at the activity of Axl and Mer in a mouse model of Parkinson s disease. This model produces a human protein present in an inherited form of the disease that results in a slow degeneration of the brain. The team saw that Axl was far more active in this setting, consistent with other studies showing that increased Axl is a reliable indicator of inflammation in tissues. See Also: Blocking inflammation prevents cell death, improves memory in Alzheimer's disease But the researchers were in for a surprise when they removed Axl and Mer from the Parkinson s mice. Instead of being worse off compared to mice with the disease but with normal microglia, the mice missing Axl and Mer actually lived longer. This may be because Axl and Mer target and destroy sick, dysfunctional neurons. In the presence of disease, there could be more dysfunctional neurons than normal, so Axl and Mer may be prompting the destruction of too many neurons, in effect hastening the disease.  It seems that we can modify the course of the disease in an animal model by manipulating Axl and Mer,  says Lawrence Fourgeaud, a co-first author on the paper and former Salk research associate. The team cautions that more research needs to be done to determine if modulating the TAM receptors could be a viable therapy for neurodegenerative disease involving microglia.

The discovery could lead directly to better care for people with rare diseases like spinocerebellar ataxia, leukodsystrophy, spastic paraplegia and many other conditions. The test, called exome sequencing, involves determining the order of all of the genes in a person s genome. When used in concert with a complete patient evaluation and family medical history, the approach can help doctors identify disorders that may have gone undiagnosed for years, said Dr. Brent Fogel, first author of a review that appears in the April issue of Neurology Clinical Practice.

A $1.02 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the UW will fund the project. The new, larger study builds on an earlier, small pilot project that found that oral swabs correctly detected TB in most of the adult participants who had the infection. About 8 million people develop TB each year. The infection results in about 1.5 million deaths annually. The World Health Organization reported last year that alternatives to the current diagnostic method were badly needed to identify suspected TB cases. Currently, diagnosing TB relies on testing a sample of sputum, a thick, sticky phlegm coughed up from the lungs. The gelatinous quality and complexity of the material make finding the TB bacteria difficult. Sputum samples are examined under a microscope, or run through molecular testing instruments, if such technology is available. Using sputum is problematic for other reasons, too.  Asking patients sick with TB to cough up sputum releases aerosols that can spread infection to healthcare providers. Moreover, neither those not yet ill with symptoms nor children will be able to produce sputum.  An alternative to sputum testing has been a Holy Grail in TB testing and diagnostics. There s a huge need, and we think the oral swab addresses this need,  said Gerard Cangelosi, who leads the research study. He is a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences and of global health in the UW School of Public Health. TB bacteria can be found in mouths of people infected with the disease. The oral swabs are used to gently scrape the inside of the patient s mouth. Then the samples are analyzed for the bacteria. Lisa Jones-Engel, a research scientist with the UW National Primate Research Center, pioneered the method to screen monkeys and apes for TB. Rachel Wood, a research scientist working with Cangelosi, led the pilot study that correctly detected TB in oral swabs taken from 18 out of 20 patients. The disease is preventable and curable with antimicrobial drugs. Yet, treatment is often delayed because it can be difficult to motivate people to visit a clinic and provide a sputum sample for testing. As a result of these delays, those ill with TB may infect up to 15 people a year through contact at home, school, work, or in clinics.  By the time people are coughing and producing sputum, they are often sick and highly contagious. An important goal in eradicating TB is to diagnose and treat people early to prevent the disease spreading to others,  said Mark Hatherill, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa who directs the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative.  The study, run as a blinded experiment, will include 245 South African adults over the age of 18 and 100 South African children, most under the age of five. The adults will include 175 people suspected of TB infection and an additional 70 people confirmed with a blood test not to have TB. The study subjects also may be positive for HIV infection. The areas in the world with the most HIV-positive individuals also have the highest burden of TB.   The researchers will compare two different kinds of oral swabs and three sampling locations in the mouth: cheek, tongue and gums. Results obtained from the oral swab samples will be compared to traditional methods including sputum testing as well as clinical diagnosis.","Published: April 7, 2016"

The work, led by HSCI principal faculty member Kornelia Polyak and Rulla Tamimi of BWH, was published in an early online release and in the April 1 issue of Cancer Research. The study builds on Polyak s earlier research finding that women already identified as having a high risk of developing cancer   namely those with a mutation called BRCA1 or BRCA2   or women who did not give birth before their 30s had a higher number of mammary gland progenitor cells. In the latest study, Polyak, Tamimi, and their colleagues examined biopsies, some taken as many as four decades ago, from 302 participants in the Nurses  Health Study and the Nurses  Health Study II who had been diagnosed with benign breast disease. The researchers compared tissue from the 69 women who later developed cancer to the tissue from the 233 women who did not. They found that women were five times as likely to develop cancer if they had a higher percentage of Ki67, a molecular marker that identifies proliferating cells, in the cells that line the mammary ducts and milk-producing lobules. These cells, called the mammary epithelium, undergo drastic changes throughout a woman s life, and the majority of breast cancers originate in these tissues. Doctors already test breast tumors for Ki67 levels, which can inform decisions about treatment, but this is the first time scientists have been able to link Ki67 to precancerous tissue and use it as a predictive tool.  Instead of only telling women that they don t have cancer, we could test the biopsies and tell women if they were at high risk or low risk for developing breast cancer in the future,  said Polyak, a breast cancer researcher at Dana-Farber and co-senior author of the paper.  Currently, we are not able to do a very good job at distinguishing women at high and low risk of breast cancer,  added co-senior author Tamimi, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School.  By identifying women at high risk of breast cancer, we can better develop individualized screening and also target risk reducing strategies.  To date, mammograms are the best tool for the early detection, but there are risks associated with screening. False positive and negative results and over-diagnosis could cause psychological distress, delay treatment, or lead to overtreatment, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Mammography machines also use low doses of radiation. While a single mammogram is unlikely to cause harm, repeated screening can potentially cause cancer, though the NCI writes that the benefits  nearly always outweigh the risks.   If we can minimize unnecessary radiation for women at low risk, that would be good,  said Tamimi. Screening for Ki67 levels would  be easy to apply in the current setting,  said Polyak, though the researchers first want to reproduce the results in an independent cohort of women.","Published: April 7, 2016"

This non-invasive, real-time approach to patient data will offer new insights into disease progression and treatment plans. By applying advanced analytics and machine learning to sensor data, the hope is to transform how neurological diseases are diagnosed and treated. (Photo Credit: Jon Simon/Feature Photo Service for IBM)  Pfizer and IBM today announced a first-of-its-kind research collaboration to develop innovative remote monitoring solutions aimed at transforming how clinicians deliver care to patients suffering from Parkinson s disease. The experimental approach will rely on a system of sensors, mobile devices, and machine learning to provide real-time, around-the-clock disease symptom information to clinicians and researchers. The ultimate goal is to obtain a better understanding of a patient s disease progression and medication response to help inform treatment decisions and clinical trial design, while also speeding the development of new therapeutic options.  Parkinson s disease in particular requires ongoing adjustment to medication depending on the progression of the disease and response of the patient. The collaboration seeks to create a holistic view of a patient s well-being by seeking to accurately measure a variety of health indicators, including motor function, dyskinesia, cognition, sleep and daily activities such as grooming, dressing and eating. Insights from these data could help clinicians understand the effect of a patient s medication as the disease progresses, enabling them to help optimize the patient s treatment regimen as needed. Data generated through the system could also arm researchers with the insights and real-world evidence needed to help accelerate potential new and better therapies.  According to the World Health Organization, neurological disorders including Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy impact almost one billion families around the world and account for 12 percent of total deaths globally. Many diseases of the brain, spine, and nerves are progressive conditions that get worse over time and can create uncontrolled movement, impair the ability to think, and cause other debilitating symptoms impacting the patient s quality of life. Approximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson s disease each year according to the Parkinson s Disease Foundation, and an estimated seven to 10 million people suffer from the disease globally.  We have an opportunity to potentially redefine how we think about patient outcomes and 24/7 monitoring, by combining Pfizer s scientific, medical and regulatory expertise with IBM s ability to integrate and interpret complex data in innovative ways,  said Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., President of Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development.  The key to our success will be to deliver a reliable, scalable system of measurement and analysis that would help inform our clinical programs across important areas of unmet medical need, potentially accelerating the drug development and regulatory approval processes and helping us to get better therapies to patients, faster.   With the proliferation of digital health information, one area that remains elusive is the collection of real-time physiological data to support disease management,  said Arvind Krishna, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research.  We are testing ways to create a system that passively collects data with little to no burden on the patient, and to provide doctors and researchers with objective, real-time insights that we believe could fundamentally change the way patients are monitored and treated.  The two companies project that the system will move into initial clinical testing quickly. Pfizer and IBM will convene an external advisory board of patient groups, advocacy organizations, clinicians, and neuroscientists for guidance on the use of technology, medical devices, data management, and research protocols, and to ensure the needs of patients guide the program.

This technology helps researchers connect mutations in the so-called genomic  dark matter  with the genes they affect, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets for genetic disorders. In the study the researchers looked at fragments of non-coding DNA called enhancers. Enhancers act like an instruction manual for a gene, dictating when and where a gene is turned on. Genes can be separated from their enhancers by long stretches of DNA that contain many other genes.  Most genetic mutations that are associated with disease occur in enhancers, making them an incredibly important area of study,  said senior author Katherine Pollard, PhD, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes.  Before now, we struggled to understand how enhancers find the distant genes they act upon.  Scientists originally believed that enhancers mostly affect the gene nearest to them. However, the new study revealed that, on a strand of DNA, enhancers can be millions of letters away from the gene they influence, skipping over the genes in between. When an enhancer is far away from the gene it affects, the two connect by forming a three-dimensional loop, like a bow on the genome. Using machine learning technology, the researchers analyzed hundreds of existing datasets from six different cell types to look for patterns in the genome that identify where a gene and enhancer interact. They discovered several patterns that exist on the loops that connect enhancers to genes. This pattern accurately predicted whether a gene-enhancer interaction occurred 85 percent of the time.   It s remarkable that we can predict complex three-dimensional interactions from relatively simple data,  said first author Sean Whalen, PhD, a biostatistician at Gladstone.  No one had looked at the information stored on loops before, and we were surprised to discover how important that information is.  Performing experiments in the lab to identify all of these gene-enhancer interactions can take millions of dollars and years of research. The new computational approach is a much cheaper and less time-consuming way to identify gene-enhancer connections in the genome. The technology also provides insight into how DNA loops form and how they might break in disease. The scientists have offered all of the code and data from TargetFinder online for free.  Our ability to predict the gene targets of enhancers so accurately enables us to link mutations in enhancers to the genes they target,  said Pollard.  Having that link is the first step towards using these connections to treat diseases.","Published: April 7, 2016"

Any drug that is dosed frequently could be amenable to this kind of system,  says Giovanni Traverso, a research affiliate at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women s Hospital, and one of the senior authors of a paper describing the device in the April 6 issue of the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials. Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor and a member of the Koch Institute, is also a senior author of the paper. The paper s lead author is Young-Ah Lucy Lee, a technical assistant at the Koch Institute. Two faces Over the past several decades, Langer s lab has developed many types of materials that can be implanted in the body or attached to the skin for long-term drug release. To achieve similar, long-term drug release in the gastrointestinal tract, the researchers focused on a type of material known as mucoadhesives, which can stick to the mucosal linings of organs such as the stomach. Scientists have previously explored using this kind of material for drug delivery to the GI tract, but it has proven difficult because food and liquid in the stomach become stuck to the tablet, pulling it away from the tissue before it can deliver its entire drug payload.  The challenge with mucoadhesives is that the GI tract is a very rough and abrasive environment,  says Lee, a 2014 Wellesley College graduate who began this project as her senior thesis. To overcome this challenge, the researchers decided to create a dual-sided device, also called a Janus device after the two-faced Roman god. One side sticks to mucosal surfaces, while the other is omniphobic, meaning that it repels everything it encounters. For the mucoadhesive side, the researchers used a commercially available polymer known as Carbopol, which is often used industrially as a stabilizing or thickening agent. The omniphobic side consists of cellulose acetate that the researchers textured so that its surface would mimic that of a lotus leaf, which has micro and nanoscale protrusions that make it extremely hydrophobic. They then fluorinated and lubricated the surface, making it repel nearly any material. The researchers used a pill presser to combine the polymers into two-sided tablets, which can be formed in many shape and sizes. Drugs can be either embedded within the cellulose acetate layer or placed between the two layers. Long-term attachment Using intestinal tissue from pigs, the researchers tested three versions of the tablet   a dual-sided mucoadhesive tablet, a dual-sided omniphobic tablet, and the Janus version, with one mucoadhesive side and one omniphobic side. To simulate the tumultuous environment of the GI tract, the researchers flowed a mix of food including liquids and small pieces of bread and rice along the tissue and then added the tablets. The dual-sided omniphobic tablet took less than 1 second to travel along the tissue, and the dual-sided mucoadhesive stuck to the tissue for only 7 seconds before being pulled off. The Janus version stayed attached for the length of the experiment, about 10 minutes. Tejal Desai, a professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California at San Francisco, says this approach could make it possible to deliver larger quantities of drugs through the GI tract.  The ability to precisely engineer the adhesiveness of a particle opens up possibilities of designing particles to selectively adhere to specific regions of the GI tract, which in turn can increase the local or systemic concentrations of a particular drug,  says Desai, who was not involved in the work.   The researchers now plan to do further tests in animals to help them tune how long the tablets can stay attached, the rate at which drugs are released from the material, and the ability to target the material to specific sections of the GI tract. In addition to delivering antibiotics, the two-sided material may help to simplify drug regimens for malaria or tuberculosis, among other diseases, Traverso says. The researchers may also further pursue the development of tablets with omniphobic coatings on both sides, which they believe could help patients who have trouble swallowing pills.  There are certain medications that are known to get stuck, particularly in the esophagus. It causes this massive amount of inflammation because it gets stuck and it causes irritation,  Traverso says.  Texturing the surfaces really opens up a new way of thinking about controlling and tuning how these drug formulations travel. ","Published: April 7, 2016"

It s long been thought that if we could target tumor-specific metabolic pathways, it could lead to effective ways to treat cancer,  said senior author Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis, Associate Professor of CRI and Pediatrics, Director of CRI s Genetic and Metabolic Disease Program, and Chief of the Division of Pediatric Genetics and Metabolism at UT Southwestern.  This study finds that two very different metabolic processes are linked in a way that is specifically required for cells to adapt to the stress associated with cancer progression.  The study, available online in the journal Nature, reveals that cancer cells use an alternate version of two well-known metabolic pathways called the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the Krebs cycle to defend against toxins. The toxins are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill cells via oxidative stress. This work builds on earlier studies by Dr. DeBerardinis  laboratory that found the Krebs cycle, a series of chemical reactions that cells use to generate energy, could reverse itself under certain conditions to nourish cancer cells. Dr. DeBerardinis said most normal cells and tumor cells grow by attaching to nutrient-rich tissue called a matrix.  They are dependent on matrix attachment to receive growth-promoting signals and to regulate their metabolism in a way that supports cell growth, proliferation, and survival,  he said. Detachment from the matrix results in a sudden increase in ROS that is lethal to normal cells, he added. Cancer cells seem to have a workaround. The destruction of healthy cells when detached from the matrix was reported in a landmark 2009 Nature study by Harvard Medical School cell biologist Dr. Joan Brugge. Intriguingly, that same study found that inserting an oncogene   a gene with the potential to cause cancer   into a normal cell caused it to behave like a cancer cell and survive detachment, said Dr. DeBerardinis, who also is affiliated with the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth & Development, holds the Joel B. Steinberg, M.D. Chair in Pediatrics, and is a Sowell Family Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.  Another Nature study, this one from CRI Director Dr. Sean Morrison s laboratory in November 2015, found that the rare skin cancer cells that were able to detach from the primary tumor and successfully metastasize to other parts of the body had the ability to keep ROS levels from getting dangerously high,  Dr. DeBerardinis said. Dr. Morrison, also a CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, holds the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatrics Genetics at UT Southwestern. Working under the premise that the two findings were pieces of the same puzzle, a crucial part of the picture seemed to be missing, he said. It was known for decades that the PPP was a major source of NADPH, which provides a source of reducing equivalents (that is, electrons) to scavenge ROS; however, the PPP produces NADPH in a part of the cell called the cytosol, whereas the reactive oxygen species are generated primarily in another subcellular structure called the mitochondria.  If you think of ROS as fire, then NADPH is like the water used by cancer cells to douse the flames,  Dr. DeBerardinis said. But how could NADPH from the PPP help deal with the stress of ROS produced in a completely different part of the cell?  What we did was to discover how this happens,  Dr. DeBerardinis said. The current study in Nature demonstrates that cancer cells use a  piggybacking  system to carry reducing equivalents from the PPP into the mitochondria. This movement involves an unusual reaction in the cytosol that transfers reducing equivalents from NADPH to a molecule called citrate, similar to a reversed reaction of the Krebs cycle, he said. The citrate then enters the mitochondria and stimulates another pathway that results in the release of reducing equivalents to produce NADPH right at the location of ROS creation, allowing the cancer cells to survive and grow without the benefit of matrix attachment.  We knew that both the PPP and Krebs cycle provide metabolic benefits to cancer cells. But we had no idea that they were linked in this unusual fashion,  he said.  Strikingly, normal cells were unable to transport NADPH by this mechanism, and died as a result of the high ROS levels.  Dr. DeBerardinis stressed that the findings were based on cultured cell models, and more research will be necessary to test the role of the pathway in living organisms.  We are particularly excited to test whether this pathway is required for metastasis, because cancer cells need to survive in a matrix-detached state in the circulation in order to metastasize,  he said.

Chan School of Public Health, the World Health Organization and nearly 500 researchers across the globe, incorporated data from 4.4 million adults in most of the world s countries. The research team has also created interactive maps and other visuals that show the data for each country, and how they compare to each other. The study, published in the journal The Lancet, compared diabetes levels among adult men and women from 1980 to 2014. Diabetes results in a person being unable to regulate levels of sugar in their blood, and increases the risk of heart and kidney disease, vision loss, and amputations. The team adjusted their results to account for diabetes becoming more common as a person ages and that some countries have an older population. Using age-adjusted figures, they found the incidence of diabetes in men across the world has more than doubled - from 4.3 per cent in 1980 to 9 per cent in 2014   after adjusting for the effect of ageing. Meanwhile diabetes among women has risen from 5 per cent in 1980 to 7.9 per cent in 2014. This rise translates as 422 million adults in the world with diabetes in 2014   which has nearly quadrupled since 1980 (108 million). The study follows previous work by the same Wellcome Trust-funded team, which studied global obesity levels, and was published in The Lancet last week. The data published also reveals the age-adjusted levels of diabetes in 2014 were lowest in some countries in northwestern Europe, where around 4% of women and 6% of men have diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes was highest in Polynesia and Micronesia, where more than one in five adults has the condition. Overall, low- and middle-income countries had the largest rise in diabetes levels over the 34-year period. The team also calculated the annual cost of diabetes   which included the cost of treating and managing the disease and its complications, such as limb amputations. This was calculated in International Dollars. The global cost was 825 billion dollars per year, with the largest cost to individual countries being in China ($170 billion), the USA ($105 billion) and India ($73 billion). The authors add that the calculation did not include work days lost due to diabetes, which would make the costs far greater if incorporated. The study also found that:Diabetes has increased most dramatically in Pacific island nations and in the Middle East and North Africa region, which now have the highest diabetes levels in the world. In Polynesia and Micronesia, where prevalence is highest, more than one in five adults have diabetes. In Nauru and American Samoa, the number is nearly one in every three men and women. Among high-income countries, the rise in diabetes was relatively small in western Europe, especially among women. Diabetes was lowest in Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands. After age-adjustment, 6.6% of men and 4.9% of women in the UK in 2014 had diabetes. UK men were 169th in the world (out of 200) in terms of diabetes prevalence, and 33rd in Europe (out of 43 nations). In comparison, UK women were 181st in the world, and 29th in Europe. In the USA in 2014, 8.2% of men and 6.4% of women had diabetes, making US rank 114th for men and 146th for women in the world. The number of US men with diabetes has increased by more than two thirds since 1980, when the number was 4.7 %. The figure for women in 1980 was 4.3 %. One half of the 422 million adults with diabetes in 2014 lived in five countries: China, India, USA, Brazil and Indonesia. If current trends continue, over 700 million adults worldwide would be affected with diabetes by 2025. The study did not differentiate between type one and type two diabetes, as this wasn t included in most of the raw data. At least 85-90% of diabetes cases are type two. Professor Majid Ezzati, senior author of the study, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said:  This is the first time we have had such a complete global picture about diabetes   and the data reveals the disease has reached levels that can bankrupt some countries  health systems. The enormous cost of this disease   to both governments and individuals   could otherwise go towards life essentials such as food and education.  He added that, until we find effective ways of addressing the global obesity epidemic, focusing on individuals who are at high risk of the condition is key to tackling the diabetes crisis.  We need financially accessible and effective health systems that can highlight those at high risk of diabetes or at pre-diabetes stage. Healthcare staff can then deliver medication and lifestyle advice to delay or even prevent the onset of the condition, as has been done in some countries in western Europe . Professor Goodarz Danaei, co-lead author of the study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said:  The most important risk factor for diabetes is obesity. Yet global obesity levels are soaring out of control.  He continued that genetics and foetal and early life conditions may play a role in why some countries seem to have much higher rates of diabetes:  There is increasing evidence that the interaction of genes and the environment plays a role in diabetes. For example, certain genotypes may increase the risk of diabetes especially in people with unhealthy lifestyles. In addition, inadequate nutrition during pregnancy and in early life may increase the risk of diabetes later in life. Therefore, long-term diabetes prevention should address nutrition in every stage of life. ","Published: April 7, 2016"

Researchers from Charit  - Universit tsmedizin Berlin have now been able to show that the brain can produce its own learning signals in cases where no such external feedback is available. A report on the mechanisms underlying these self-generated feedback signals has been published in journal eLife, and shows clear parallels between the neurobiological processes involved in learning based on external and self-generated feedback. See Also: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning While learning forms an integral part of our day-to-day lives, there are only certain instances in which we receive external feedback about our performance. A group of researchers, led by Prof. Dr. Philipp Sterzer from the Visual Perception Working Group at Charit 's Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, have investigated the neurobiological basis of learning in the absence of external feedback. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the researchers measured neural activity levels in the brains of healthy volunteers as they performed challenging perceptual learning tasks. Instead of receiving feedback about their performance, participants were asked to report levels of confidence in their assessment of visual stimuli. ""Our experiments showed that the brain activity levels recorded during confidence-based learning mirrored many of the features previously recorded in relation to external feedback-based learning,"" says the study's first author, Dr. Matthias Guggenmos. Earlier studies on external, reward-based feedback had shown that participants' brain activity levels at the start of a task reflected their prediction about the upcoming reward. Once the reward had been received, a 'prediction error' was recorded reflecting the difference between predicted and actual reward. As part of the current study, the researchers were able to record an identical response pattern in learning processes not involving external feedback. In this study, the prediction signal corresponded to the participant's own level of confidence, while the prediction error corresponded to the surprise experienced at the discrepancy in the actual level of confidence. ""These remarkable parallels suggest that subjective confidence just like external reward is a general learning signal, and that it may also play an important role in other types of learning that do not involve feedback, such as school homework assignments,"" says Dr. Guggenmos.

The researchers detected frequency-following responses (FFRs) coming from a part of the brain not previously known to emit them. FFRs are neural signals generated in the brain when people hear sounds. See Also: Hearing experts break sound barrier for children born without hearing nerve To help pinpoint the source of FFRs, the team used magnetoencephalography (MEG), a technique that allowed them to determine the source of the FFR, because it is not affected by interference from brain and skull tissues like electroencephalography (EEG), the more commonly used method to study electrical signals in the brain. Twenty people were selected to take part in the study after testing showed they were neurologically healthy and had normal hearing. Subjects' neural responses to sound were measured using MEG, which records fluctuations in magnetic fields caused by neural activity. From the MEG signal, researchers were able to detect FFR signals coming from the auditory cortex, in addition to the known sub-cortical generators, something that had not previously been detected. The discovery of FFRs originating from the auditory cortex better informs research on neuroplasticity and its potential to improve auditory processing. Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brain to adapt to external stimuli with training. For example, studies have shown that children exposed to music have better language skills, possibly due to subcortical sound processing. The ability to understand speech in a noisy environment has also been shown to improve with musical training. Learn More: How does the brain respond to hearing loss? The effects of training on the brain have been inferred using FFR. A better understanding of FFR and its origins will therefore allow researchers to more accurately measure how the brain changes with experience. FFR has also been used to study learning disabilities and autism. Children with these disorders have been shown to have altered FFRs, a finding attributed to functional impairments at the brainstem level. The researchers' findings provide a clearer picture of how FFRs are generated, and thus aids further research into hearing-related disorders. ""Traditionally FFRs were called the 'auditory brainstem responses', so we were very surprised when our method revealed that they also included a big contribution from the cortex,"" says Robert Zatorre, Professor of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University, and senior author. ""This changes everything, because now we know to look both in the brainstem and in the cortex for effects related to enhanced hearing, due to musical training for instance, or for effects related to impaired hearing, as in aging, or some disorders."" ""I think we'll be able to learn something new about several disorders,"" says Emily Coffey, a PhD candidate with Robert Zatorre at the MNI and first author of the paper. ""We will be able to more effectively think about and test treatments because this technique allows us to observe the interactions of components of the auditory system as we process sound, and maybe target training to improve poorly functioning parts."" In addition to the discovery of new FFR origins, the use of MEG to pinpoint FFR origin is itself an important step forward for research into the human auditory system. Related: Stop and listen: Study shows how movement affects hearing Previously, MEG was considered unsuited to study early auditory responses in the brain, as the strength of the signal decreases rapidly as distance from the sensors increases. To study deeper parts of the brain such as the brainstem, EEG was the preferred method. However, advances in MEG technology over the past decade allowed the team to gather accurate data about the origins of FFRs using MEG. The researchers recorded responses to 12,000 sounds per person to average out the effect of random noise. They also applied some of the latest distributed source modelling techniques, allowing them to mathematically reconstruct where the signal was coming from in the brain. Because of these new MEG methods, scientists will now be able to look at FFR sources separately, and figure out where changes and differences in the FFR can be found. ""We have opened up a new research area by developing a new tool,"" says Coffey. ""Researchers will be able to ask new and useful questions about how the auditory system is organized and what has gone wrong when it's not working properly.""

The repair system, similar to the method used by salamanders to regenerate limbs, could be used to repair everything from spinal discs to bone fractures, and has the potential to transform current treatment approaches to regenerative medicine. Study lead author, haematologist and UNSW Associate Professor John Pimanda, said the new technique, which reprograms bone and fat cells into induced multipotent stem cells (iMS), has been successfully demonstrated in mice.  This technique is a significant advance on many of the current unproven stem cell therapies, which have shown little or no objective evidence they contribute directly to new tissue formation,  Associate Professor Pimanda said.  We are currently assessing whether adult human fat cells reprogrammed into iMS cells can safely repair damaged tissue in mice, with human trials expected to begin in late 2017.  There are different types of stem cells including embryonic stem (ES) cells, which during embryonic development generate every type of cell in the human body, and adult stem cells, which are tissue-specific. There are no adult stem cells that regenerate multiple tissue types.  This technique is ground-breaking because iMS cells regenerate multiple tissue types,  Associate Professor Pimanda said.  We have taken bone and fat cells, switched off their memory and converted them into stem cells so they can repair different cell types once they are put back inside the body.  The technique developed by UNSW researchers involves extracting adult human fat cells and treating them with the compound 5-Azacytidine (AZA), along with platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) for approximately two days. The cells are then treated with the growth factor alone for a further two-three weeks. AZA is known to induce cell plasticity, which is crucial for reprogramming cells. The AZA compound relaxes the hard-wiring of the cell, which is expanded by the growth factor, transforming the bone and fat cells into iMS cells. When the stem cells are inserted into the damaged tissue site, they multiply, promoting growth and healing. The new technique is similar to salamander limb regeneration, which is also dependent on the plasticity of differentiated cells, which can repair multiple tissue types, depending on which body part needs replacing. The study s first author, Dr Vashe Chandrakanthan, who developed the technology, said the new technique is an advance on other stem cell therapies being investigated, which have a number of deficiencies.  Embryonic stem cells cannot be used to treat damaged tissues because of their tumour forming capacity. The other problem when generating stem cells is the requirement to use viruses to transform cells into stem cells, which is clinically unacceptable,  Dr Chandrakanthan said.  We believe we ve overcome these issues with this new technique.  Neurosurgeon and Conjoint Lecturer with UNSW s Prince of Wales Clinical School, Dr Ralph Mobbs, will lead the human trials, once the safety and effectiveness of the technique using human cells in mice has been demonstrated.  The therapy has enormous potential for treating back and neck pain, spinal disc injury, joint and muscle degeneration and could also speed up recovery following complex surgeries where bones and joints need to integrate with the body,  Dr Mobbs said. Research shows that up to 20% of spinal implants either don t heal or there is delayed healing. The rates are higher for smokers, older people and patients with diseases such diabetes or kidney disease.  Spinal implants currently used to replace damaged or troubled discs don t always weld with the adjacent bones, so by transplanting these reprogrammed stem cells, we hope to be able to better fuse these implants to the host bone,  Dr Mobbs said.  This represents a potential huge leap forward for spinal and orthopaedic procedures.  Along with confirming that human adult fat cells reprogrammed into iMS stem cells can safely repair damaged tissue in mice, the researchers said further work is required to establish whether iMS cells remain dormant at the sites of transplantation and retain their capacity to proliferate on demand.","Published: April 6, 2016"

Borrowing from the Greek legend of Pandora s box and chaos theory by calling it the  lupus butterfly theory,  the idea was described recently in the journal Nature Reviews Rheumatology. Lupus, symbolized by the purple butterfly, is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues. The disease, often characterized by a butterfly-shaped rash, carries an unusual cancer risk profile, with a small increase in overall risk but reduced rates of certain malignancies, such as breast cancer. The reasons for this risk profile are unknown, but the lupus butterfly theory now proposes that lupus antibodies are a contributing factor. Antibodies that bind to DNA, the genetic blueprints for life, are a hallmark of lupus. Research led by James E. Hansen, M.D, assistant professor of therapeutic radiology, has shown that some of these antibodies actually damage the DNA inside living cells, and that some cancer cells are much more sensitive to them than normal cells. Based on these findings, Hansen and colleagues theorize that certain cancers are suppressed in lupus patients due to a protective effect mediated by the DNA-damaging antibodies. Consistent with this idea, cancers that are underrepresented in lupus are associated with genetic defects that make them vulnerable to DNA damage. So, even though lupus antibodies that attack DNA may contribute to immunologic chaos, they may also be considered sources of hope by providing protection against certain malignancies. Furthermore, there is hope that these antibodies may be able to be harnessed for use as new therapies against tumors that are highly vulnerable to DNA damage.  It s exciting that our efforts to apply lupus antibodies to cancer therapy may also help to answer unresolved questions about the associations between autoimmunity and cancer,  said Philip W. Noble, PhD, first author on the paper and postdoctoral research associate in the Hansen lab. Hansen added,  Chaos theory suggests that a regular butterfly can change the weather just by flapping its wings. I m hoping that when a lupus butterfly  flaps its wings  it can change the face of cancer therapy. ","Published: April 6, 2016"

The delivery system, a nanogel developed in the lab of associate professor Tarek Fahmy, can be used for multiple combinations of drugs for many different cancers and some immune disorders. The platform is designed to deliver multiple drugs with different chemical properties. A single particle can carry hundreds of drug molecules that concentrate in the tumor, increasing the efficacy of the drug combination while decreasing its toxicity. Fahmy describes the delivery system as a kind of  rational  therapy, in that it fuses established biological and clinical findings to the emerging field of nanotechnology.  It creates a new solution that could potentially deal a significant blow to cancer and even autoimmune disease in future applications,  said Fahmy, who teaches biomedical engineering and immunobiology. The first use of this delivery system will be a drug known as IMM-01. A multi-pronged treatment for metastatic cancer, it contains two agents: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and an inhibitor of tissue growth factor (TGF beta). IL-2 amplifies the body s immune system, while the TGF-beta inhibitor dampens the cancer cells  ability to hide from the immune system. Because their size and makeup differ greatly, the two agents would normally be incompatible. Fahmy, however, developed a novel biodegradable gel that can contain both drugs and then release them in the tumor. TVM Life Science Ventures VII is providing funding to Modulate Therapeutics Inc. to develop the drug to clinical proof of concept. Modulate secured the rights to IMM-01 from Yale and the Yale start-up company Immunova L.L.C., which was co-founded by Fahmy, Johns Hopkins University professor of oncology Ephraim Fuchs, and entrepreneur Bernard Friedman. Friedman noted that the complexity of disease biology often hinders treatments.  Successful therapies must strike multiple targets,  he said.  The technology developed by Dr. Fahmy provides an elegant solution.   It s about leveraging the biology of the system, not fighting it,  added Brian Horsburgh, CEO of Immunova and Modulate.  You want to wake up the immune system and harness that.  Yale s Office of Cooperative Research (OCR) helped launch Immunova in 2012 and develop Fahmy s drug delivery technology. Fahmy is a member of the Yale Cancer Center.  It s great to see this technology moving forward to the clinic, and we re hopeful that this will be the first of many life-saving drugs to use this technology,  said Dr. John Puziss, director of technology licensing in OCR.","Published: April 6, 2016"

However, current methods to evaluate mitochondrial activity still rely on traditional tests called end-point assays, which provide limited prognostic information. Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip technology, which uses microchip-manufacturing methods to arrange living cell cultures to simulate the physiology of tissues and organs, is poised to replace drug toxicity testing in animals, but thus far has demonstrated few advantages over traditional methods and animal experiments. Now, researchers from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem describe a new generation of Liver on Chip devices, in which the researchers add glucose and lactate micro-sensors, allowing them to measure minuscule changes in central carbon metabolism in real time (seconds to minutes).  The robust microfluidic platform is composed of sub-millimeter human tissues, which the authors characterize as  bionic  as they contain optoelectronic sensors for oxygen and are maintained under conditions simulating the human physiological environment. The platform includes a computer-controlled switchboard and permits the automated measurement of glucose and lactate using clinical-grade micro-sensors. The sensor-integrated platform permits real-time tracking of the dynamics of metabolic adaptation to any type of mitochondrial damage for over a month in culture. The study, entitled  Real-time Monitoring of Metabolic Function in Liver-on-Chip Microdevices Tracks the Dynamics of Mitochondrial Dysfunction,  appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Central carbon, or glucose and amino acid, metabolism is by far the most important source of energy and materials for our cells. It is the backbone of cellular function,  said the study s lead author Prof. Yaakov Nahmias, Director of the Alexander Grass Center for Bioengineering at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Otto Warburg recognized the importance of changes in central carbon metabolism to cancer development back in 1924, and more recent studies tied alterations in this pathway to the emergence of stem cells.  This metabolic pathway is very sensitive, and any toxic damage will either directly or ultimately lead to changes in glucose metabolism,  said Nahmias. This approach already enabled Nahmias and his team to identify a new mode of acetaminophen (Tylenol ) toxicity back in June, suggesting the drug could directly block respiration in the kidneys and skin. In the current research, the team used an array of micro-sensors to measure small changes in metabolic fluxes. In other words, the sensor-integrated  bionic  micro-livers actively told researchers how they change their metabolic pathways (what they  eat,   digest  and  spew out ) when exposed to new drugs.  This allows researchers to identify new causes for idiosyncratic toxicity, one of the biggest problems in drug discovery and the main cause for post-market drug withdrawal.  Idiosyncratic toxicity occurs without obvious reason to about 1:100,000 in the population, forcing new warning labels or complete withdraw of the drug (costing billions).  The researchers tested the new technology on troglitazone (Rezulin ), an anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory drug which was removed from the US market in 2000 due to severe drug-induced liver injury, costing Pfizer Inc. over $750 million in lawsuits.  The results showed that even at low troglitazone concentrations previously regarded as safe, in which traditional tests don t reveal any damage to the cells, the new liver-on-chip technology was able to detect mitochondrial stress that forces the liver to increase its reliance on glucose metabolism.  By revealing the dynamics of cellular adaptation to mitochondrial damage, this novel organ-on-chip technology permits detection of chemical toxicity before any effects on cell or tissue viability can be observed. Prof. Nahmias said:  The ability to measure metabolic fluxes using small numbers of cells under physiological conditions can redefine the study of neurodegenerative disease, stem cells and cancer, in addition to drug discovery. In contrast to other instruments, such as the SeaHorse Flux Analyzer, our sensors do not require calibration and our cells do not undergo hypoxia or become exposed to decaying chemical signals due to non-specific absorption. Our microfluidic system could be of significant interest to biological and clinical laboratories, whose work can range from the study of mitochondria and oxidative stress in neurological disorders (Alzheimer s, Parkinson s), to metabolic disease (diabetes, obesity), stem cell biology (pluripotency), virology and cancer.  Dr. Daniel Duche, former head of the Early Safety Laboratory, unit of the Predictive Models and Methods Development Department of L Or al Research & Innovation, said:  The work performed by Y. Nahmias s team demonstrates that it becomes possible to monitor dynamically in real time metabolic functions of cells exposed to different drug concentrations over a long period using organ-on-chip microdevices. That helps to define Adverse Outcome Pathways and brings a real breakthrough in the in vitro alternative methods to animal experimentation for evaluating toxicity of chemicals.  Yissum, the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University, has recently filed two provisional patent applications covering the promising Liver-on-Chip technology, that will be the basis of a new company to be established together with Prof. Yaakov Nahmias. This New Company will provide diagnostic and prognostic analysis for Pharmaceutical and Cosmetics companies to help define drug safety and screen out idiosyncratic drug toxicity.

Their study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that N. bombi was present in the U.S. as early as 1980, well before several species of wild bumble bees started to go missing across the country. The study also found that N. bombi infections in large-scale commercial bumble bee pollination operations coincided with infections and declines in wild bumble bees. ""We used molecular techniques to screen thousands of bumble bees to track Nosema infections before and after the bees began to decline,"" said University of Illinois entomology professor Sydney Cameron, who led the new research. ""We wanted to test the idea floating about for a couple of decades that Nosema bombi prevalence in declining populations is connected with commercial production of bumble bees for pollination."" The study included an analysis of DNA sequence variation in N. bombi over time and in different geographical locations. For historical evidence of infection, the team turned to bee specimens in natural history collections in North America and Europe. ""Our results support the hypothesis that Nosema is a key player in U.S. bumble bee declines,"" Cameron said. ""They also indicate a temporal connection between historical infections in wild bumble bee populations and the late 1990s Nosema-induced collapse of commercial production of Bombus occidentalis in North America."" The researchers found parallels between the use of bumble bees to pollinate greenhouse tomatoes in the Pacific West and Eastern Canada and declines in wild bumble bee species that inhabit those same regions. The N. bombi-related declines in wild bees occurred shortly after many commercial bumble bee operations collapsed as a result of N. bombi infections, Cameron said. ""These associations support the hypothesis that Nosema escaped into wild populations from heavily infected commercial colonies, at least during the earlier years of bumble bee domestication in the U.S.,"" she said. While the new study is not a definitive explanation of the widespread bumble bee losses, which are likely the result of many factors, Cameron said, it challenges a popular hypothesis about the sudden declines of wild bumblebees in the early 1990s. That hypothesis - that a newly arrived N. bombi strain from Europe caused the bumble bee declines - was an educated guess, since wild bees and commercial bees suffered devastating losses linked to N. bombi infections at about the same time, in the early 1990s, Cameron said. ""But we found low genetic diversity and very few genetic differences between European and U.S. Nosema strains,"" she said. ""And we found no evidence to support the arrival of an unusual strain of N. bombi in North America in the 1990s."" The coincidence of N. bombi infections and losses of bumblebees in wild and commercial populations suggests the fungus is a key player in bumble bee declines, Cameron said. ""But we still don't know whether the fungus is becoming more virulent or the bumble bees   already stressed from habitat loss and degradation and other infections   are becoming more susceptible to Nosema.""

Since 2009, Israel has seen precipitous declines in tilapia, with annual yields plummeting as much as 85 percent highly unusual considering the fish is known to be relatively resistant to viral infections. Similar die-offs have been seen in Ecuador and Colombia. The scientists used high-throughput sequencing to determine the genetic code of the virus from tissue taken from diseased fish in Israel and Ecuador. This process would normally be sufficient to identify the culprit, but in this case, the resulting DNA sequences didn t match any known virus, with the exception of a small genetic segment that only remotely resembled a virus associated with the reproduction of influenza C. Undeterred, the researchers employed other tools from their scientific tackle box, providing ample evidence that the genetic material was the same as the implicated virus dubbed TiLV. They used mass spectroscopy to characterize the proteins in cells growing the virus, which matched those they expected to see based on the genetic sequence. By analyzing the structure of viral DNA, they went on to observe 10 gene clusters with complementary endpoints, suggesting a circular form associated with a common type of viral reproduction involving a protein called a polymerase. Finally and conclusively, healthy fish were exposed to TiLV cultured in a laboratory, resulting in disease that matched with what was seen in those countries: in Israel, the fish had swollen brains; in Ecuador, liver disease. In the coming weeks, the researchers will publish on the link between the TiLV and an outbreak of disease among tilapia in Colombia.  The TiLV sequence has only minimal similarity in a small region of its genome to other viruses; thus, the methods we typically use to identify and characterize viruses through sequencing alone were insufficient,  says first author Eran Bacharach, a molecular virologist at Tel Aviv University.  It appears to be most closely related to a family of influenza viruses called orthomyxoviruses; however, we still don t understand much about its biology,  adds Nischay Mishra, associate research scientist at the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia s Mailman School. Importantly, the findings provide the genomic and protein sequences necessary for TiLV detection, containment, and vaccine development.  We are shifting our focus now to implementing diagnostic tests for containment of infection and to developing vaccines to prevent disease,  says Avi Eldar of the Kimron Veterinary Institute in Bet Dagan, Israel. The team of 18 researchers represent five institutions in four countries: the Center for Infection and Immunity and the New York Genome Center in the U.S., Tel Aviv University and Kimron Veterinary Institute in Israel; the University of Edinburgh, Scotland; and St. George s University, Grenada, West Indies.  The New York Genome Center was excited to join in characterizing this novel virus and contribute to this important environmental and globally impactful research,  says Toby Bloom, the Center s deputy scientific director.  Gumshoe epidemiology, molecular gymnastics and classical microbiological methods were required to link this new virus to disease,  says Ian Lipkin, senior author, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity and John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at the Mailman School.  Resolution of this mystery was only possible through the concerted efforts of this talented group of international collaborators.  While best known for identifying viruses behind human disease, the Center for Infection and Immunity, pinpointed the virus beyond a disease that decimated salmon farms in Europe in 2010. They have done similar work with seals, sea lions, and Great Apes.  The current research was supported by grants from the United States-Israel Bi-National Agricultural Research & Development Fund (BARD IS-4583-13), the Israel Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Development Chief Scientist Office (847-0389-14), U.S. National Institutes for Health (AI109761), USAID PREDICT, and a fellowship to J.E.K.T. from the Manna Center Program in Food Safety and Security at Tel Aviv University.

Studies on survivors of traumatic events have suggested that exposure to stress may indeed have lasting effects on subsequent generations. But how exactly are these genetic ""memories"" passed on? A new Tel Aviv University study pinpoints the precise mechanism that turns the inheritance of environmental influences ""on"" and ""off."" The research, published in Cell and led by Dr. Oded Rechavi and his group from TAU's The George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences and Sagol School of Neuroscience, reveals the rules that dictate which epigenetic responses will be inherited, and for how long. ""Until now, it has been assumed that a passive dilution or decay governs the inheritance of epigenetic responses,"" Dr. Rechavi said. ""But we showed that there is an active process that regulates epigenetic inheritance down through generations."" Passing stress from one generation to the next Researchers have been preoccupied with how the effects of stress, trauma, and other environmental exposures are passed from one generation to the next for years. Small RNA molecules   short sequences of RNA that regulate the expression of genes   are among the key factors involved in mediating this kind of inheritance. Dr. Rechavi and his team had previously identified a ""small RNA inheritance"" mechanism through which RNA molecules produced a response to the needs of specific cells and how they were regulated between generations. ""We previously showed that worms inherited small RNAs following the starvation and viral infections of their parents. These small RNAs helped prepare their offspring for similar hardships,"" Dr. Rechavi said. ""We also identified a mechanism that amplified heritable small RNAs across generations, so the response was not diluted. We found that enzymes called RdRPs are required for re-creating new small RNAs to keep the response going in subsequent generations."" Most inheritable epigenetic responses in C.elegans worms were found to persist for only a few generations. This created the assumption that epigenetic effects simply ""petered out"" over time, through a process of dilution or decay. ""But this assumption ignored the possibility that this process doesn't simply die out but is regulated instead,"" said Dr. Rechavi, who in this study treated C.elegans worms with small RNAs that target the GFP (green fluorescent protein), a reporter gene commonly used in experiments. ""By following heritable small RNAs that regulated GFP   that 'silenced' its expression   we revealed an active, tuneable inheritance mechanism that can be turned 'on' or 'off.'"" The scientists discovered that specific genes, which they named ""MOTEK"" (Modified Transgenerational Epigenetic Kinetics), were involved in turning on and off epigenetic transmissions. ""We discovered how to manipulate the transgenerational duration of epigenetic inheritance in worms by switching 'on' and 'off' the small RNAs that worms use to regulate genes,"" said Dr. Rechavi. ""These switches are controlled by a feedback interaction between gene-regulating small RNAs, which are inheritable, and the MOTEK genes that are required to produce and transmit these small RNAs across generations. ""The feedback determines whether epigenetic memory will continue to the progeny or not, and how long each epigenetic response will last."" A comprehensive theory of heredity? Although their research was conducted on worms, the team believes that understanding the principles that control the inheritance of epigenetic information is crucial for constructing a comprehensive theory of heredity for all organisms, humans included. ""We are now planning to study the MOTEK genes to know exactly how these genes affect the duration of epigenetic effects,"" said Leah Houri-Zeevi, a PhD student in Dr. Rechavi's lab and first author of the paper. ""Moreover, we are planning to examine whether similar mechanisms exist in humans.""","Published: April 6, 2016"

This is actually the first example of how we can go back to the really early stage to see how this antibody lineage was born and can develop,  said TSRI biologist Jiang Zhu, who served as co-senior author of the study. The research was an international collaboration, also led by Yuxing Li of the University of Maryland, Yiming Shao of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Peking University and Nankai University and Ian Wilson of TSRI. The new knowledge of the evolution and key traits of anti-HIV antibodies could help researchers design a vaccine to prevent AIDS. Targeting the Virus HIV has been hard to beat because the virus mutates rapidly and has a sturdy set of defenses including a  shield  of glycan molecules on the surface of its envelope glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are the viral machinery used to make initial contact and subsequently infect human host cells. Because HIV presents such a challenge to the immune system, scientists can t use traditional methods to create a vaccine. Instead, Zhu explained, they have to  reverse engineer  the right vaccine candidates using rare effective antibodies from HIV-positive patients as guides. The antibody in the new study came from a patient in China who was what scientists call an  elite  controller, meaning the patient s immune system had managed to create antibodies with some ability to fight the disease. The patient was among the top 5 percent of neutralizers assessed in a screening of hundreds of Chinese HIV patients by China CDC scientists. Genetically, the antibody found in this donor resembled members of the VRC01 class of antibodies, which are  broadly neutralizing antibodies,  named for their ability to target a key site of vulnerability on many strains of the virus. Yet the new antibody also lacked one of the key structural traits of VRC01 antibodies.  There was something a little bit weird about this antibody,  said Zhu. Further studies into the antibody s genetics and structure showed that it was a precursor to mature VRC01 antibodies in other words, it represented a middle stage in the evolution of this class of HIV killers. Zhu called the antibody a  teenager  and said it gives scientists a unique view of the steps needed to prompt the immune system to effectively target HIV. Guiding Antibody Development The researchers studied samples taken from the patient over five years, starting in 2006 when Zhu said the antibody was a  toddler.  Each sample showed the antibody in a different stage of development, giving researchers a possible guide for how to elicit these antibodies with a vaccine. Zhu and his colleagues were surprised to find that the antibody evolved rapidly between 2006 and 2008, gaining many of the traits it would need to fight HIV. This finding contradicts previous studies suggesting that it can take up to 10 to 15 years for VRC01 antibodies to develop useful traits.  That was a solid theory until we saw the antibody from this donor,  said Zhu.  Now we know these specialized antibodies can evolve in just one or two years,  added TSRI Research Associate Yajing Chen, who served as co-first author of the study with Leopold Kong (formerly of TSRI, now at NIH), TSRI Staff Scientist Linling He, and Bin Ju, Jiandong Liu and Li Ren of the China CDC. Zhu said this discovery is encouraging, since an HIV vaccine will also need to prompt the body to make antibodies quickly. The scientists also spotted a hurdle they will have to overcome as they engineer their own antibodies: The teenage VRC01 has a slightly longer amino acid chain at one site than the mature version, and this chain clashes with part of the glycoprotein shield (gp120) on HIV and prevents the antibody from effectively neutralizing the virus. The researchers managed to tweak the immature antibody to make it into a broadly neutralizing antibody.  As long as you have some of those VRC01 signatures, a teenage-stage antibody can become a killer for HIV,  said Zhu. The researchers also noted that this is the first time a VRC01-like antibody has been isolated from a patient of Asian descent the other VRC01s had come from African or Caucasian patients. This means people with different genetic backgrounds may benefit from a vaccine that harnesses a person s ability to make VRC01s.  This could be important for developing a universal HIV vaccine,  Zhu said.","Published: April 6, 2016"

The initiative will lay a foundation for vaccine developers to improve current vaccines, design vaccines for new and emerging infectious diseases and expedite vaccine research for diseases currently without preventative inoculations, like HIV and tuberculosis. Adjuvants improve the effectiveness of many vaccines. These agents can accelerate and enhance the immune response elicited by antigens, the active components of vaccines, especially in populations with weak immune systems, such as children and the elderly. Adjuvants can also allow developers to use less antigen, which can be costly or in short supply, and create more enduring immune responses in individuals, eliminating the need for booster vaccinations. However, very little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of how individual adjuvants provide these benefits, or how they might work in combination to boost vaccine effectiveness. The NIAID-led Molecular Mechanisms of Combination Adjuvants research program funds projects designed to shed light on how adjuvants work in combination. These adjuvants may be either in current clinical use or in development. Investigators will study which adjuvants work best together and why, how combinations of adjuvants interact with the immune system, and how synergies between adjuvants can be optimized. The research addresses goals set out in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Research on Vaccine Adjuvants, which prioritizes gaining basic scientific knowledge of adjuvant mechanisms of action in order to improve vaccine research.

The agreement has been signed by Massimo Dominici, M.D., ISCT President, and Morrie Ruffin, ARM Managing Director. ISCT will become an honorary member of ARM, and vice versa. This agreement will extend collaborations between the two international organizations. Since ARM s establishment in 2009, both organizations have collaborated on a series of projects, including authoring white papers. ARM and ISCT members have held leadership roles in both organizations. This MOU will enable the two organizations to collaborate more closely in future. An ISCT-ARM Joint Committee will monitor and plan activities and projects on a considerably wider and more consistent basis. These joint activities will commence with a number of proposed projects on standards. This includes formulating and managing an International Standards Coordinating Body as well as a number of activities to improve ISO standards for cell therapy and other regenerative medicines. ISCT and ARM will also collaborate on each other s conference programs, communication and education initiatives specifically related to cell therapy.  In recent years, cellular therapies have expanded exponentially. This is in terms of scientific discoveries, clinical results and investment, all of which generates enormous opportunities for patients as well as the industry,  said Massimo Dominici, M.D., ISCT President.  This potential requires a collaboration from the top organizations representing the cell therapy community combining pre-clinical research and cell processing with clinical translation and commercialization. This has the goal to bring together academic and pharmaceutical developments in the field, at the same time respecting and valuing the combined expertise. As a result, it will be critical for ISCT and ARM to work closely together to monitor and drive the cell therapy sector to jointly face the challenges and to realize its full potential in delivering life saving and changing treatments to patients.  ISCT has also increased its ability to work towards developing consensus between key stakeholders and balancing the interests of industry, academia and regulators by implementing changes in its Global Executive Committee.

These highlight the growing need for more detailed, personal assessment of protein profiles to improve the management of cancer treatment. In the first study two groups from University College London and Cancer Research UK demonstrated that genetic mutations in cancer can lead to changes in the proteins on the cell surface1. These are new sequences which are seen as foreign by the body s immune system and, with appropriate immunotherapy, the level of response in lung cancer was greatly enhanced. However many of the patients with these types of mutations unfortunately still did not respond which highlighted the need for deeper analysis of the protein expression in tumours in order to better appreciate the mechanisms that contribute to treatment failure. The second study, led by Professor Nigel Bundred of Manchester University, reported that use of two drugs that act on the same breast cancer target, an over-expressing protein called Her-2, were able to eradicate detectable tumours in around 10% of those treated in just 11 days, with 87% of those treated having a proteomic change indicating cells had stopped growing and/or cell death had increased2. Whilst these results appear very promising it is worth noting that the over-expressing Her-2 target is only present in about 20% of breast tumours meaning this combination therapy was successful in clearing tumours in just 2% of the total breast cancer population. Dr. Ian Pike, Chief Operating Officer of Proteome Sciences commented,  Both these recent studies should rightly be recognised as important steps forward towards better cancer treatment. However, in order to overcome the limitations of current drug therapy programs, a much deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the complex protein networks that regulate tumour growth and survival is required and will be essential to achieve a major advance in the battle to treat cancer.  Our SysQuant  workflows provide that solution. As an example, in pancreatic cancer3 we have successfully mapped the complex network of regulatory processes and demonstrate the ability to devise personalised treatment combinations on an individual basis for each patient. A retrospective study with SysQuant  to predict response to the targeted drug Sorafenib in liver cancer is in process and we are planning further prospective trials to guide personalised treatment selection in liver cancer.  We are already delivering systems-wide biology solutions through SysQuant  and TMTcalibrator  programs to our clients that are generating novel biological data and results using more sensitive profiling that are helping them to better understand their drug development programs and to provide new biomarkers for tracking patient response in clinical trials.  We are strongly positioned to deliver more comprehensive analysis of proteins and cellular pathways across other areas of disease and in particular to extend the use of SysQuant  with other leading cancer research groups in liver and other cancers.  Proteome Sciences has also expanded its offering in personalised medicine through the use of its TMTcalibrator  technology to uniquely identify protein biomarkers that reveal active cancer and other disease processes in body fluid samples. The importance of these  mechanistic  biomarkers is that they are essential to monitor that drugs are being effective and that they can be used as early biomarkers of disease recurrence. Using SysQuant  and TMTcalibrator , Proteome Sciences can deliver more comprehensive analysis and provide unparalleled levels of sensitivity and breadth of coverage of the proteome, enabling faster, more efficient drug development and more accurate disease diagnosis.","Published: April 6, 2016"

As part of the three-year agreement, FEI will provide sample preparation and data collection services on a Titan Krios  cryo-transmission electron microscope (cryo-EM)to the consortium companies for early-stage drug discovery research. The five companies involved in the consortium will share access to the microscope with colleagues from the MRC-LMB and the University of Cambridge in return for expert guidance on the use of cryo-EM technology. FEI s Titan Krios will be installed at the Nanoscience Centre in May. Richard Henderson, pioneer in the field of cryo-EM at MRC-LMB, states, ""It is delightful to know that the development of cryo-EM, which many people have worked on for many years, has now reached mainstream structural biology. It is particularly satisfying that pharmaceutical companies are keen to evaluate the approach for drug development."" Prof. Sir Mark Welland, director of the Nanoscience Centre, said,  This is a great opportunity for researchers across the University to access a microscope.  Cryo-EM has quickly become one of the most important techniques used by structural biologists to obtain molecular-scale three-dimensional(3D) information about protein structures. When combined with traditional methods for structure determination, such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the resulting models can reveal the structure of complex, dynamic molecular assemblies down to the scale of individual atoms. The consortium s Titan Krios will use the Relion software package, developed by Sjors Scheres at MRC-LMB, to process the image data into a visual 3D model that helps researchers see and understand the structure and function of the protein.  Cryo-EM 3D models allow us to see and understand the workings of protein-based molecular machines that we could not analyze before because they were too large and complex or were resistant to the preparations required for other techniques,  states Peter Fruhstorfer, vice president and general manager of the Life Sciences business, FEI.  The technique was rapidly adopted by leading academic researchers and is now finding its way into early stage discovery and development in the pharmaceutical industry.  Fruhstorfer adds,  In addition to installing the Titan Krios cryo-EM system, our contribution to the consortium includes providing an application scientist that will work with the participating companies to ensure a smooth workflow throughout, from sample preparation to data collection and data processing, with a special focus on creating a standardized and robust single-particle analysis workflow.

SymCel s novel technology and calorimetry approach, has seen its application extended beyond academic and preclinical research in recent years, with the company now also taking the initiative to enter the sphere of medical diagnostics research. calScreener makes it possible to measure which antibiotics are most effective in real-time   making the technology a highly useful asset for the monitoring of existing medication. Magnus Jannson, SymCel s Chief Scientific Officer commented:  We have taken this great opportunity to focus extra hard on the medical diagnostics market and to sell our measurement technologies and novel products for use as effective tools for developing new antibiotics and clinical research for the medical follow-up of existing treatments in the antibiotics field. By example, this year alone, SymCel has applied its methodology and its leading product, calScreener, in clinical research both for the development of new treatments and the specific medical follow-up treatment of microbial infections   including tuberculosis (TB), bone necrosis and urinary tract infection.   Magnus Jansson added:  Our technology is truly unique because it is more time and cost efficient than traditional methods. It ensures that the correct antibiotic is made use of as a treatment. Indeed, SymCel s method for cell-based measurements are based on isothermal microcalorimetry.  The main competitive advantage of calScreener over other approaches is that the technology can measure with accuracy where no other techniques can be applied. We like to call the approach  Beyond Pasteur  to emphasize the need for novel technologies in antibiotics research. Christer Wallin, CEO of Symcel remarked:  Our innovative method brings with it the clear industry advantage of being able to measure bacterial infections in solid samples and tissues. It can also measure the effect of antibiotics on bacteria that form biofilms with high sensitivity, something that is extremely difficult for competing approaches to achieve .","Published: April 6, 2016"

For the past decade, various groups have claimed that their cognitive training programs do everything from staving off neurodegenerative disease to enhancing education and improving daily functioning. Absent from many of these claims has been neuroscientific evidence. Cognitive neuroscientists are now rigorously testing the potential benefits of such ""brain training"" tools. New work, being showcased today (April 5) at the Cognitive Neuroscience Society's (CNS) annual conference in New York, on working memory tasks in children and on pairing noninvasive brain stimulation with cognitive training in adults is showing promising results. Researchers are identifying who may benefit from cognitive training and the new methods most likely to result in long-lasting, positive effects on cognition. See Also: Systematic review shows 'smart drug' modafinil does enhance cognition ""We hope that by better understanding how and why cognitive abilities are altered by training, we can better harness its wider benefits,"" says Duncan Astle of the Medical Research Council in the UK, who is chairing the symposium on brain training. While more testing is required to apply these techniques to real-world training interventions, the studies are providing a baseline of neuroscientific evidence for developing tools that yield wider benefits. Working memory sits at the heart of many of the brain training studies. The ability to hold information in mind for brief periods of time is central to our daily lives. And, Astle says, ""we know that differences in working memory during childhood are incredibly strong predictors of educational progress."" As a cognitive neuroscientist long interested in how the brain develops working memory capabilities in childhood, Astle has set out with colleagues to test if it is possible to train a child's memory. In work recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience and also new, yet-unpublished work that Astle will present at the CNS conference, his team investigated tasks in 8- to 11-year-olds to boost working memory. They found that the training tasks yielded improvements in working memory capacity that were also reflected in measurements taken from magnetoencephalography (MEG, which uses magnetic fields to image the brain), showing increased strength of neural connectivity when the brain was at rest. The children performed 20 training sessions, each around 30 minutes and with 8 games, from their home computers. The games required children to remember spatial or verbal information for brief periods of time and to use this information in an ongoing task. For example, one game involved remembering the locations and order of asteroids that flashed up in sequence as they swirled across the screen. At the end of each trial, children had to click on the asteroids in order. In the experimental group, the games became more difficult as the children got better; ""the children were always being worked at the limits of their current capabilities,"" Astle says. In the control group, the difficulty of the games remained the same. The MEG data showed significant changes to connectivity between frontoparietal networks and the lateral occipital complex and inferior temporal cortex in those in the experimental group. ""We think that the training enhances an attentional process that children are able to use strategically on similarly structured but untrained tasks,"" Astle says. ""But it is important to note that we have not demonstrated the wider benefits of this training."" The 8 to 11 age range is ""very good because the children are able to handle pretty complex tasks, and yet are still far from adult levels of performance - i.e. there is still plenty of development left to happen,"" Astle says. ""We think that this is a really important age range in which to understand working memory and training effects. However, there is a great need to understand these processes better across the lifespan, so we are always exploring the literature more widely to see how our findings fit in with other groups that study other age ranges."" Among the tools scientists are using for trying to boost cognition is tDCS (transcranial direct-current stimulation) - a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that involves passing a very weak direct current through the brain. ""While it is not immediately clear how the current affects neural activity, the prevailing opinion is that it makes neurons either more susceptible to firing, or less susceptible, depending on which electrode is placed where,"" says John Jonides of the University of Michigan. Related: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning In new work Jonides in presenting at the CNS conference, he and colleagues have found that tDCS has a robust effect on working memory, with enhancements lasting over a course of months. ""Previous research has been equivocal about whether tDCS enhances training, and there have been no long-term investigations of how long that training effect lasts,"" Jonides says. In the new study, 62 participants randomly received tDCS stimulation to either the right or left prefrontal cortex or received sham stimulation while performing a visuospatial working memory task. After 7 training sessions, those who received the tDCS stimulation had increased working memory capabilities, even several months after completing their training. They also found that those who receive stimulation on the right prefrontal cortex had selective ability to transfer the working memory to non-trained tasks. ""The long-lasting effect of the training was completely unexpected,"" Jonides says. ""We investigated this largely on a lark, not expecting to find much, but the fact that the training effect lasts as long as months is both surprising and very provocative because it opens up the use of tDCS for long-term learning enhancement."" Jonides says that his study is just one data point in understanding these techniques, noting that it is still the early days of studying brain stimulation. Replication and generalization to other training and transfer tasks are necessary to continue testing the long-term impacts and best targets for stimulation. ""We need high-level, rigorous validation that focuses on understanding the mechanism of action, transfer of benefits, and sustainability of the effects in diverse populations,"" says Adam Gazzaley of the University of California, San Francisco, who will be presenting work to develop and validate ""closed-loop"" video games as cognitive enhancement tools. The closed loop approach enables scientists to intervene, record the impact of the intervention, and then reuse that data to iterate and optimize the process cyclically. Learn More: Specific gene linked to adult growth of brain cells, learning and memory His team is using tDCS and tACS (with alternative current) to boost plasticity in the underlying brain cortex. ""The goal is to accelerate the learning process that occurs during game play, especially for those individuals with damage,"" Gazzaley says. ""There is great promise and reason for excitement in this approach, but we are still in our infancy and have much to learn both on the development and validation side,"" Gazzaley says. ""Behind strong claims we need strong scientific evidence,"" Astle says. ""Sadly the hype surrounding the field has lost touch with its scientific foundations. As a result, it is tempting to ditch the whole endeavor. On the contrary, I think that this needs to spur scientists to invest in high-quality training studies.""

In an animal model, the researchers show that disturbances in circadian rhythm that exist before Parkinson's onset dramatically worsen motor and learning deficits brought on by the disease. The new work, led by Domenico Pratic , MD, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology and the Center for Translational Medicine at LKSOM, is the first to demonstrate that an environmental factor chronic daily exposure to long periods of light with brief exposure to dark, which alters circadian rhythm can exacerbate Parkinson's symptoms and pathology. The findings appear online in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. See Also: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity Patients with Parkinson's disease often suffer from recurrent sleep disorders and disturbances in circadian rhythm, the roughly 24-hour biological cycle of humans. But whether those disturbances impact the development and progression of Parkinson's has been unclear. ""Many think that sleep disturbances are secondary to Parkinson's disease,"" Dr. Pratic  explained. ""But circadian rhythm disturbances are increasingly reported before the onset of Parkinson's, suggesting that they could be risk factors."" After age 60, the majority of Parkinson's disease cases are idiopathic, their cause unknown. According to Pratic , it is probable that in those cases, the disease arises as a result of interactions between genes and environmental risk factors. The latter include chronic stress, sleep disorders, and circadian disturbances, all of which affect the function of the central nervous system, potentially contributing to the pathology that characterizes Parkinson's disease. Pratic  and colleagues investigated the role of altered circadian rhythm using a well-established mouse model of Parkinson's disease, in which treatment with MPTP, a neurotoxin, reproduces aspects of the disease in mice. The researchers divided animals into two groups. Learn More: MRI brain scans detect people with early Parkinson's The first, the control group, was maintained on a regular circadian schedule, being exposed to 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of dark each day. In the second group, circadian rhythm was altered through daily exposure to 20 hours of light followed by just four hours of dark. After 60 days, some animals from each group were treated with MPTP. Assessments of movement and behavior showed that all mice treated with MPTP developed Parkinson's disease, but animals with altered circadian rhythm experienced significant learning impairments. They also exhibited severe motor deficits, with drastic reductions in motor coordination and motor learning skills - far worse than the deficits observed in MPTP-treated mice with normal circadian rhythm. To understand why circadian rhythm disturbance worsens Parkinson's disease, Pratic  and his team examined the brains of affected mice. In a region known as the substantia nigra, they observed significant reductions in neurons that produce dopamine, the loss of which is a major molecular feature of Parkinson's disease. ""The substantia nigra is the epicenter of Parkinson's disease,"" Pratic  said. ""Cells normally die in that region of the brain, but our study shows that circadian rhythm disturbance accelerates cell death there."" In addition, cells known as microglia, which normally protect neurons, were superactive in circadian-disrupted MPTP-treated mice. The overactivation of microglia can actually worsen neuroinflammation and potentially speed the progression of Parkinson's disease. Related: Stem cell study reveals how Parkinson's spreads The next challenge is to see if the findings can be replicated in other animal models. ""If those studies are successful, we'll then try to reestablish normal circadian rhythm in circadian-disrupted animals to explore the possibility of reversing brain inflammation and cell death,"" Pratic  said. The outcomes of those studies could have important implications for the prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease in persons with chronic sleep disorders.

Specifically, neurons are activated by excitation mechanisms tightly regulated by inhibition processes. For certain functions, the neuronal network needs to be synchronized. This causes high-frequency oscillations that make behavior and information-processing possible. This synchronization depends on the excitation/inhibition balance that is affected in a significant number of disorders that involve cognitive dysfunction. See Also: Astroglial 'support cells' in brain play important role in Down syndrome In an article published in the Journal of Neuroscience, scientists from the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), led by Dr. Mara Dierssen, and the laboratory of Dr. Mavi S nchez Vives, at the Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), describe altered oscillations and synchronization in the cerebral cortex for a Down syndrome candidate gene in a mouse model. Such alterations have been linked to problems with functions as relevant as decision-making, impulsiveness, working memory or attention. ""Changes in the cellular architecture of neurons in the cerebral cortex, in Down syndrome animal models had already been detected in the past. We observed that the neurons had a different structure. Now we have taken another step, studying the physiology, or the function of this cerebral cortex, and found that those cellular alterations and slight changes in inhibitory connectivity translate into a deficit of activation of this region and of its neuronal activity rhythm and synchronization,"" states Dr. Mara Dierssen, head of the Cellular and Systems Neurobiology group and Co-Principal Investigator of this study. ""One of the main problems with mental impairment is that we don't understand how the alterations that we detect at the cellular level trigger changes in the cerebral circuits and alterations in cognitive function. The study that we've published explains some of these cellular alterations and offers for the first time an in vivo study of the physiology of the cerebral cortex, a key structure in executive functions such as concentration, learning or problem-solving."" she adds. The researchers focused on one of the genes related with Down syndrome. Using experiments on animal models that overexpress the candidate gene, the researchers have shown that an excess of this gene causes very subtle changes in the excitation/inhibition balance, and these lead to a significant diminishment of the activity and synchronization of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex. In other words, when this gene is over-expressed, it reduces the discharge level of the neurons and alters the oscillation of high-frequency waves in the cerebral cortex. Not only that, they observed that the problem originates in neurons responsible for controlling inhibition. In short, if there is less activity and an imbalance in the frequencies of the cerebral waves in Down syndrome it could be due to changes in the connectivity of neurons that should control them.

Results of the study are published online in the journal Radiology. Primary insomnia, in which individuals have difficulty falling or staying asleep for a month or longer, is associated with daytime fatigue, mood disruption and cognitive impairment. Insomnia can also lead to depression and anxiety disorders.

""White matter tracts are bundles of axons that connect one part of the brain to another,"" Li said. ""If white matter tracts are impaired, communication between brain regions is disrupted."" The study included 23 patients with primary insomnia and 30 healthy control volunteers. To evaluate mental status and sleep patterns, all participants completed questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and the Self-Rating Depression Scale.

Until now, researchers have lacked the tools to examine -- in a single cell --the exact readout from each genome to make RNA. Using a new technology that allows researchers to do just that, an interdisciplinary University of Pennsylvania team examined a rare disease in which these two genomes are expressed differently throughout the body, even sometimes in the same organ. They found that at the single-cell level gene expression was highly variable and quite different than expected, which is now shedding light on the molecular causes of rare diseases and perhaps the complex nature of tumors.  This is a great example of cross-school collaboration,  said co-senior author Marisa Bartolomei, PhD, a professor of Cell and Developmental Biology in the Perelman School of Medicine. Her colleagues are co-first author Jennifer M. Kalish, MD, PhD, an expert in rare growth disorders from The Children s Hospital of Philadelphia, and co-first author Paul Ginart, an MD/PhD candidate, and co-senior author Arjun Raj, PhD, both from the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Penn, who devised the technology to image single genes in individual cells.   With this new technique, we can now see which cells express which genome,  Bartolomei said. Silence of the Genes For most genes, people inherit two copies, one maternal and one paternal. However, in the case of a phenomenon called imprinting, offspring inherit only one working copy of a gene, and depending on its parental origin, expression of the gene is controlled by an added methyl group during egg or sperm formation to physically tighten DNA so it cannot be read to make RNA and ultimately protein. A small number of genes are imprinted but are critical to normal development. Imprinted genes are normally turned on from either the maternal chromosome or the paternal chromosome, but not both. In human imprinting disorders, imprinted genes are either abnormally turned on for both the maternal and paternal genomes, or abnormally turned off from both genomes. Abnormal expression can be linked to genetic mutations and mistakes in the placement of the methyl group (a function of epigenetics).  Variability from cell to cell in which genes are expressed in the same organ may help explain why many diseases show a  mosaic  pattern, with different parts of the body exhibiting different degrees of disease. This hodge-podge can happen because of errors in imprinting. Defects in imprinting can lead to inappropriate expression of the normally silenced version of the gene, but it remains unclear whether every cell in a given organ expresses the abnormal version.  If this were the case, it would have profound implications for human imprinting disorders,  Kalish said. Help from the Rare Imprinting disorders are rare. Kalish works with two: Russell-Silver syndrome, an under growth disorder occurring in approximately 1 out of 50,000 to out of 100,000 births, with symptoms of small stature and limb, body, or facial asymmetry. The syndrome involves under-methylation of two genes, H19 and IGF2.H19 encodes a non-coding RNA that limits growth whereas IGF2 is a growth factor. In 50 percent of cases, Russell-Silver syndrome is associated with an imprinting error on chromosome 11 in which the person receives two copies of the imprinting mark from the mother rather than one from each parent. Russell-Silver children have too much of the do-not-grow signal (H19) and too little of the grow signal (IGF2). The other imprinting disorder is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and such congenital features as a large tongue, large birth weight, and limb, body, organ, and facial asymmetry. These syndromes display a range of symptoms, which happens because some cells in a given organ express maternal genes while others express paternal genes.  But the mom genes are the ones that limit growth of cells,  Kalish said.  This means that the mosaic pattern is really a mix of normal cells and abnormal cells -- with a disrupted balance between mom s do-not-grow signals and dad s grow signals, in the same tissue. This is what accounts for an enlarged or too-small organ in the same person.  In some cases, patients may even have differently sized pairs of kidneys. Using mice, the team compared cell genomes in normal mice versus Russell-Silver syndrome mice. At the cell population level, they asked which individual cells have correct maternal imprinting and which cells have abnormal maternal imprinting for the H19 gene. In Russell-Silver mice both maternal and paternal H19 is expressed. Using Raj s new technology, they developed a molecular probe to detect a single nucleotide change in the RNA expressed in mom s versus dad s genomes to show which is expressed cell by cell. This method measured gene-variant specific expression in single cells. In the mouse model of Russell-Silver syndrome, they found that some cells had RNA from both the maternal and paternal version (abnormal as seen in Russell-Silver patients) while other cells had only the maternal RNA (normal).  We showed that mutant mouse embryo fibroblast cells are comprised of two subpopulations: those expressing both maternal and paternal H19 versions [abnormal] and those expressing only the maternal copy [normal],  Bartolomei said.  Only in the latter normal cell population is Igf2 expression detected.  In the Russell-Silver mice, all cells had the same genetic change but not all cells had the same DNA methylation pattern, explaining the mosaic arrangement of gene expression by epigenetics -- the normal silencing of a version of a gene by the added methyl group during egg or sperm formation.   The two mutant subpopulations of cells exhibited distinct methylation patterns at the imprinting control region of their respective genomes. The cells that expressed H19 from just the maternal genome had the correct DNA methylation pattern while the cells that expressed H19 from both maternal and parental genomes exhibited a loss of H19 DNA methylation. Importantly, they also observed the same two subpopulations are also present within mouse heart tissue, showing the same defect in a living whole mouse.  This is the first time that epigenetic mosaicism has been demonstrated at a single cell level,  Bartolomei said.  What this means is that epigenetics -- the balance of tightening or loosening of DNA to control which genes are expressed when -- is the driver of mosaicism at the cell population level. Our results establish that imprinting disorders can display striking single-cell heterogeneity and suggest that such heterogeneity may underlie epigenetic mosaicism in human imprinting disorders,  Bartolomei said.  The epigenetic mosaicism shown in this work explains the spectrum of clinical features we see in our patients -- it all makes sense,  Kalish said.  Now we know what is going on.

A group of European researchers has now joined forces under the leadership of the Goethe University, with the goal of sparing affected people from lifelong insulin therapy. They plan to develop three-dimensional cellular structures of insulin-producing cells (organoids) in the laboratory and to work with pharmaceutical industry partners to develop a process for their mass production. The European Union is providing over five million Euro over the next four years to support the project. The first clinical studies on transplantation of organoids are planned after that. Patients with type 1 diabetes are unable to produce insulin due to a genetic defect or an autoimmune disorder. They could be cured by transplanting a functional pancreas, but there are not nearly enough donor organs available. This is why researchers had the idea of growing intact insulin-producing cells from donor organs in the laboratory to form organoids, which they would then transplant into the pancreas of diabetes patients. ""The method has already been shown to work in mice"", explains Dr Francesco Pampaloni, who coordinated the first project together with Prof. Ernst Stelzer at the Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences at the Goethe University. Researchers have only recently discovered how to produce organoids. Adult stem cells, which develop into cells for wound healing or tissue regeneration in the body, are the starting point. These cells can be grown in the laboratory through cell division and then allowed to differentiate into the desired cell type. The key is now to embed them in a matrix so that they grow into three-dimensional structures. The organoids are typically spherical, hollow on the inside and have a diameter of approx. 20 micrometres   about half as thick as the diameter of a human hair   to hundreds of micrometres. ""If the structure were compact, then there would be a risk of the inner cells dying off after transplantation because they wouldn't be supplied by the host organ's cellular tissue"", Pampaloni explains. The task of the Frankfurt group under Stelzer and Pampaloni is to control the growth and differentiation of the filigree organoids under a microscope. To do so, they use a light microscopy method developed by Stelzer with which the growth of biological objects can be followed cell for cell in three dimensions. The project is called LSFM4Life, because light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) plays a key role in the project. The Frankfurt group is also responsible for developing quality assurance protocols, because of the cooperation with industrial partners in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the original goal of the project is the large-scale production of organoids in accordance with good manufacturing practices for pharmaceuticals. Two research groups in Cambridge specialise in isolating insulin-producing cells from donor organs and growing organoids, while a group of clinicians in Milan is developing methods for transplanting organoids. As is the case for all organ transplants, care will have to be taken with organoids as well so that rejection responses by the recipient's immune system are avoided. However, over time the researchers plan to build cell banks from which immunologically compatible cell types can be selected for every recipient.","Published: April 5, 2016"

This work opens a path to creating functional skin transplants for burn and other patients who require new skin. Research into bioengineered tissues has led to important achievements in recent years with a number of different tissue types being created but there are still obstacles to be overcome. In the area of skin tissue, epithelial cells have been successfully grown into implantable sheets, but they did not have the proper appendages the oil-secreting and sweat glands that would allow them to function as normal tissue. To perform the work, published in Science Advances, the researchers took cells from mouse gums and used chemicals to transform them into stem cell-like iPS cells. In culture, the cells properly developed into what is called an embryoid body (EB) a three-dimensional clump of cells that partially resembles the developing embryo in an actual body. The researchers created EBs from iPS cells using Wnt10b signaling and then implanted multiple EBs into immune-deficient mice, where they gradually changed into differentiated tissue, following the pattern of an actual embryo. Once the tissue had differentiated, the scientists transplanted them out of those mice and into the skin tissue of other mice, where the tissues developed normally as integumentary tissue the tissue between the outer and inner skin that is responsible for much of the function of the skin in terms of hair shaft eruption and fat excretion. Critically, they also found that the implanted tissues made normal connections with the surrounding nerve and muscle tissues, allowing it to function normally. One important key to the development was that treatment with Wnt10b, a signaling molecule, resulted in a larger number of hair follicles, making the bioengineered tissue closer to natural tissue. According to Takashi Tsuji of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, who led the study,  Up until now, artificial skin development has been hampered by the fact that the skin lacked the important organs, such as hair follicles and exocrine glands, which allow the skin to play its important role in regulation. With this new technique, we have successfully grown skin that replicates the function of normal tissue.

It is made using melamine sponges, an ultra-low-weight, porous material found in various products including household cleaning pads and insulation materials. The researchers modified the melamine sponge by dipping it into a solution containing a small amount of silicone rubber called PDMS and the solvent hexane, resulting in an extremely thin coating that repels water while allowing oil to be absorbed into the sponge. ""The reason we're excited about this is that it is manufactured using a very inexpensive one-step process to coat the melamine sponges, and the material can be reused many times,"" said Suresh V. Garimella, Purdue University's executive vice president for research and partnerships and the Goodson Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering. ""We believe this can be readily adopted for the cleanup of oil spills and industrial chemical leaks."" Findings are detailed in a paper that appeared online in March in the American Chemical Society's journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research. The paper was authored by postdoctoral research associate Xuemei Chen, research assistant professor of mechanical engineering Justin A. Weibel and Garimella. Chen made the discovery while working in the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park. The researchers have demonstrated that the new material can remove oils and organic chemical pollutants that are immiscible with water such as hydrocarbons, coolants and insulating fluid from electrical transformers, carcinogenic compounds called PCBs and certain pesticides. ""The target is any pollutant that is immiscible with water and that has a low surface tension,"" Weibel said. By contrast, water has a high surface tension, causing it to be repelled by the sponge. ""You need this contrast in surface tension for the sponge material to remove the contaminant,"" Garimella said. Other technologies under development that incorporate superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties are either expensive, difficult to scale up, or require the use of exotic materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. ""Oil spillage from industrial sources has caused severe damage to the environment,"" Chen said. ""The conventional methods used to clean up oils and organic pollutants are slow and energy-intensive. The development of absorbent materials with high selectivity for oils is of great ecological importance for removing pollutants from contaminated water sources."" Findings show the sponge material has an absorption capacity of 45-75 times its own weight, which is comparable to other more exotic materials under development. ""There are two ways to use this sponge,"" Garimella said. ""You can just drag it over the surface of the water to absorb the contaminant or apply suction so that it continuously draws out the oil and leaves the water behind.""","Published: April 5, 2016"

The Nimbus Apollo program includes the lead candidate NDI-010976, an ACC inhibitor, and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other diseases. NDI-010976 was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2016 and Phase 1 data for the compound will be presented next month during an oral session at The International Liver Congress 2016, the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). NASH is a serious liver disease resulting from metabolic dysfunction associated with steatosis (fat within the liver) that can lead to inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Affecting up to 15 million people in the United States, NASH is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020. ACC inhibitors target a central cause of the disease   reducing aberrant lipid-derived signaling that can result in steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis.  The acquisition of Nimbus  ACC-inhibitor program represents a timely and important opportunity to accelerate Gilead s ongoing efforts to address unmet needs in NASH,  said Norbert Bischofberger, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, Gilead Sciences.

It s a fascinating process,  said Gary Patti, associate professor of chemistry in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis.  Imagine creating two copies of yourself every few days, instead of just maintaining the one you have. In the past 15 or 20 years, people have become really interested in how a cell does that.  For more than 80 years, the reigning idea has been that cancer cells fuel their explosive growth by soaking up glucose from the blood, using its energy and atoms to crank out duplicate sets of cellular components. One of the reasons so much glucose is taken up is to make the lipids, or fats, that are assembled into cell membranes, the thin veils that separate the contents of a cell from its environment. In 1970s and  80s, scientists working with radioactively tagged glucose showed that practically all the lipids inside tumor cells were made from glucose the cells took up from the extracellular environment, a finding that seemingly corroborated the  glucose hypothesis.  The hypothesis makes sense, but like many other things that make sense, it may not be right. While pursuing other work, the Patti lab discovered that proliferating fibroblasts make most of their lipids from glucose only if they are grown in standard cell-culture medium, which is nutrient-rich but lipid-poor. When the scientists spiked the culture medium with lipids, raising concentrations to those typical of blood, the cells preferred to scavenge lipids from the medium rather than synthesizing them. And under these conditions, rapidly dividing cells took up no more glucose than cells that weren t dividing. This effect was discovered in cultures of fibroblasts, which divide until they touch one another and then stop, giving scientists a chance to compare the metabolism of proliferating and quiescent cells. But intrigued by the  lipid effect,  the scientists checked for it in two cancer-cell lines, the famous HeLa cells and a lung cancer cell line called H460. These cell lines responded less strongly but similarly to lipid concentrations. The startling result, published online in the March 31, 2016, issue of Cell Chemical Biology, calls into question  aspects of cancer research and treatment founded on the glucose hypothesis. Patti is the senior author on the paper, whose first author is graduate student Cong-Hui Yao, a McDonnell scholar.  It has only been possible to think about glucose metabolism at the systems level for the past few years,  Patti said, referring to the new discipline of metabolomics.  Before that, the technology to follow glucose through all the possible metabolic pathways just didn t exist.  Are glucose-uptake images accurate?  The idea that increased glucose uptake is a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells is deeply embedded in our thinking,  Patti said.  It s the basis for how we diagnose cancer and manage its treatment in the clinic.  In diagnostic FDG-PET scans, patients are injected with a small amount of a glucose analog that includes a radioactive atom, and are then scanned to create images of glucose uptake by various organs. Bright spots on these images indicate potential cancer.  Our study raises questions about the sensitivity of these scans,  Patti said.  Perhaps cancer cells can live off fats floating in the blood rather than making them all out of glucose, particularly in the case of obese or diabetic patients whose blood lipid concentrations can be higher than  normal.  Could this allow cancer cells to fly under the radar, leading to false negatives? Should cancer drugs target glucose metabolism? Because of the glucose hypothesis, scientists have devoted a lot of attention to developing cancer therapies that inhibit either glucose metabolism or lipid synthesis. But if the assumption is wrong, would blocking glucose metabolism slow cell growth? Wouldn t the cells just scavenge lipids from their surroundings? To test this possibility, the scientists tried dosing their cell lines with 2DG, a glucose molecule with a hydrogen atom substituted for a hydroxyl (OH ) group that gets stuck in the pathway that breaks down glucose. They found that if they spiked the cultures with lipids as well, 2DG was much less effective in slowing the growth of cancer cells.  This finding challenges the reasoning behind one strategy for killing cancer cells,  Patti said. 2DG is now in clinical trials. What about targeting lipid uptake? If the work in the Patti lab suggests that cancer cells might not respond as hoped to drugs that block the glucose uptake, it also suggests blocking lipid uptake might be effective. The scientists tested this idea by dosing their cultures with a drug called SSO that irreversibly binds to a lipid transporter in the cell membrane, inhibiting lipid uptake. When they did this, all three cells lines were slower to grow and divide.  Perhaps we should be thinking more about inhibiting lipid uptake,  Patti said. Cells in culture are artifacts  The last point,  Patti said,  and I think most people accept this, is that cell cultures are highly artificial systems that often give misleading results. Whether cell culture findings translate to animal models or patients is really questionable; it s hard to place a lot of trust in them.  In this case, the standard cell culture media that everyone uses has such low lipid concentrations that it really skews what the cells in culture are doing.  Even though we all do the same cell culture in the same way it is dangerous to assume the results apply to the clinic,  he said.","Published: April 5, 2016"

They also show that the process starts before telltale plaques accumulate in the brain. Their work, published online March 31 in Science, suggests new therapeutic targets to preserve cognitive function early in Alzheimer s disease. Led by senior author Beth Stevens, HMS assistant professor of neurology in the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children s, and first author Soyon Hong, HMS research fellow in neurology at Boston Children s, the researchers show in multiple mouse models of Alzheimer s that mechanisms similar to those used to prune excess synapses in the healthy developing brain are wrongly activated later in life. By blocking these mechanisms, the researchers were able to reduce synapse loss in the mice. Currently, there are five FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer s, but these only boost cognition temporarily and do not address the root causes of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer s. Many newer drugs in the pipeline seek to eliminate amyloid plaque deposits or reduce inflammation in the brain, but the new study suggests that Alzheimer s could be targeted much earlier, before these pathologic changes occur.  Synapse loss is a strong correlate of cognitive decline,  said Stevens, who recently received a MacArthur  genius  award.  We re trying to go back to the very beginning and see how synapse loss starts.  The young brain informing the old Stevens, Hong and colleagues looked at Alzheimer s through an unusual lens: normal brain development in infancy and childhood. Through years of research, the Stevens lab has shown that normal developing brains have a process to prune synapses that aren t needed as they build their circuitry.  Understanding a normal developmental process deeply has provided us with novel insight into how to protect synapses in Alzheimer s and potentially a host of other diseases,  said Stevens, noting that synapse loss also occurs in frontotemporal dementia, Huntington s disease, schizophrenia, glaucoma and other conditions. In the Alzheimer s mouse models, the team showed that synapse loss requires the activation of a protein called C1q, which tags synapses for elimination. Immune cells in the brain called microglia then  eat  the synapses similar to what occurs during normal brain development. In the mice, C1q became more abundant around vulnerable synapses before amyloid plaque deposits could be observed. Therapeutic potential When Stevens and colleagues blocked C1q, a downstream protein called C3, or the C3 receptor on microglia, synapse loss did not occur.  Microglia and complement are already known to be involved in Alzheimer s disease, but they have been largely regarded as a secondary event related to plaque-related neuroinflammation, a prominent feature in progressed stages of Alzheimer s,  said Hong.  Our study challenges this view and provides evidence that complement and microglia are involved much earlier in the disease process, when synapses are already vulnerable, and could potentially be targeted to preserve synaptic health.  A human form of the antibody Stevens and Hong used to block C1q, known as ANX-005, is in early therapeutic development with Annexon Biosciences (San Francisco) and is being advanced into the clinic. The researchers believe it has potential to be used someday to protect against synapse loss in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Annexon co-founders Ben Barres and Arnon Rosenthal are coauthors on the paper. Barres, Rosenthal and Stevens are minor shareholders of Annexon LLC and Stevens is a member of its scientific advisory board.  One of the things this study highlights is the need to look for biomarkers for synapse loss and dysfunction,  said Hong.  As in cancer, if you treat people at a later stage of Alzheimer s, it may already be too late.  Complement, microglia and beta-amyloid Together with co-author Dennis Selkoe, the HMS Vincent and Stella Coates Professor of Neurologic Diseases in the Department of Neurology at Brigham and Women s Hospital, the researchers also found that that beta-amyloid protein, C1q and microglia work together to cause synapse loss in the early stages of Alzheimer s. The oligomeric form of beta-amyloid (multiple units of beta-amyloid strung together) was already known to be toxic to synapses even before it forms plaque deposits, but the study showed that C1q is necessary for this effect. The converse was also true: Microglia engulfed synapses only when oligomeric beta-amyloid was present.","Published: April 4, 2016"

But in some applications, such as cartilage repair, the exact geometry of an implant cannot be precisely known prior to surgery. This makes it extremely difficult to pre-prepare an artificial cartilage implant. The Biopen special is held in the surgeon s hands, allowing the surgeon unprecedented control in treating defects by filling them with bespoke scaffolds. Professor Peter Choong, Director of Orthopaedics at St Vincent s Hospital Melbourne, developed the concept with ACES Director Professor Gordon Wallace.  The development of this type of technology is only possible with interactions between scientists and clinicians - clinicians to identify the problem and scientists to develop a solution,  Professor Choong said.

Researchers genetically engineered mice with a mutation in PIK3CA, a gene linked to cancer, and these mice unexpectedly developed venous malformations (VMs). VMs are characterized by deformed, swollen blood vessels. These vessels may appear just under the skin, causing pain and disfigurement, or deep in the body, leading to various health issues. One in 5,000 people are born with VM and there is no effective cure. To verify the model, the teams genetically tested VM patient samples from 13 children participating in skin genetics research conducted by Dr Veronica Kinsler (UCL Institute of Child Health), and 32 patients from MSK and Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona). This revealed that around a quarter of them had the same type of PIK3CA mutation as was engineered in the mice used in the study. Researchers then tested different drugs on these mice in search of an effective treatment.  Rapamycin is a drug that blocks a signalling process that happens downstream of PIK3CA, so it stops one of PIK3CA s effects but does not block it at source,  explains lead author Dr Sandra Castillo (UCL Cancer Institute).  When we gave rapamycin to the mice, it showed clinical benefit, but in patients it can have serious side-effects and compromise the immune system. Our colleagues at MSK then tested drugs on the mice that directly inhibit PIK3CA, developed to treat cancer. These drugs worked well and significantly reduced the size of the malformations, not only when given through the bloodstream but also when applied directly to the skin as a cream.  Although PIK3CA inhibitors are more specific than many cancer drugs, they still could have unpleasant side effects inside the body. A topical cream could provide a more targeted approach to treat VMs as it would not enter the bloodstream, but more research is needed before this approach can be tried in patients.  It is incredibly exciting to have stumbled across new treatment options for these blood vessel disorders, essentially by accident,  says senior author Professor Bart Vanhaesebroeck (UCL Cancer Institute).  We originally set out to investigate cancer by inducing PIK3CA mutations in mice, with no idea that they might be linked to other diseases. When we showed samples from the mice to Professor Neil Sebire in Histopathology at Great Ormond Street Hospital, we were all shocked when he said the samples looked exactly the same as those from patients with VM. It s still not clear why this mutation causes VM instead of cancer in these patients, so further research in this area could offer valuable insights into how to stop tissue from becoming cancerous.  The study s co-senior author is Dr Mariona Graupera from IDIBELL in Barcelona, who first discovered the importance of PIK3CA in blood vessel formation.  This paper supports the theory that blood vessels are much more sensitive to PIK3CA than other cells,  says Dr Graupera.  We have previously looked at what happens when PIK3CA is inactivated, but here we saw that an activating mutation in this gene can lead to a dramatic overgrowth of blood vessels. In cancer, tumours need to form new blood vessels so that they can survive and spread. Drugs to stop these processes and starve the tumours are currently in clinical trials, and we now hope that such drugs may also have a role to play in treating VM.  The patient research was made possible by collaboration between three National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) with researchers from the University College London Hospitals BRC, the Great Ormond Street BRC and the Cambridge BRC working together to collect and genetically analyse the patient samples needed to verify the model.","Published: April 4, 2016"

Eculizumab, sold under the name Soliris, is currently the only therapeutic available for treating life threatening blood disorders, Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical haemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS). In these diseases, the immune system attacks and destroys blood cells. Soliris works by shutting down part of our immune system. When ticks bite an unsuspecting victim they inject substances that inhibit the same part of the immune system that Solaris targets. These substances allow the insect to stay attached and feed on people for up to ten days without the immune system recognising and destroying them. The Oxford and Monash research team set out to understand how these insects can shut down an immune reaction. The team used a combination of X-ray crystallography and powerful microscopes within the Ramaciotti Centre for Cryo-electron microscopy at Monash University to look into the molecular structures of both the tick proteins and Soliris in complex with the immune proteins they bind. If you have PNH or aHUS your immune system attacks your blood cells. And the consequences of these diseases are devastating and systemic.  Soliris is also one of the most expensive drugs in the world, costing up to $500,000 per patient per year,  says Associate Professor Hans Elmlund, Imaging CoE and co-lead author of the paper.  Using three-dimensional electron microscopy and computer modelling we could determine exactly where Soliris binds and understand how it inhibits this part of the immune system. Knowing this, and knowing how ticks defend themselves will provide novel inhibitors."" Professor Susan Lea, Oxford University and visiting academic at Monash University explains that the tick proteins are much smaller and easier to make than the antibodies in Soliris and may result in much cheaper therapies for a range of different immune disorders.  The tick proteins act at the same point in the cascade as Soliris but they differ in molecular detail, and therefore may provide routes to treatment of patients with PNH who have become resistant to Soliris,  says Susan. She adds:  Blood poisoning, or Sepsis, kills over six million people a year. Affected individuals often die because of a powerful, but ultimately catastrophic, immune over-reaction called  cytokine storm . Our team hope that the tick-related proteins may one day be of use in controlling cytokine storm in order to lessen mortality in conditions such as sepsis. ","Published: April 4, 2016"

Prof. Peter Vandenabeele (VIB/UGent):  In our research group we investigate the molecular mechanisms of different types of cell death. This is very fundamental research. Recently, more and more evidence is emerging that cell death plays an essential role in cancer and other diseases. This research perfectly illustrates this. It gives a good feeling that a better understanding of mechanisms of cell death on the long run may lead to more efficient cancer immunotherapy . Immunogenic cell death   a novel approach to kill cancer cells Every second, one million cells die by programmed cell death in a healthy human body. Immune cells efficiently clear the body from these dying cells without eliciting an inflammatory response. Elimination of cancer cells by induction of cell death is also one of the main goals in anti-cancer therapy, resulting in the reduction of tumour mass. In the past decade, a number of anti-cancer drugs have been described to not only kill the cancer cells, but also to elicit an immune response in the patient   a phenomenon referred to as immunogenic cell death. Dr. Dmitri V. Krysko (VIB/UGent):  The great power of immunogenic cell death is that the body s immune system becomes activated to specifically eliminate the cancer cells. Antigen-presenting cells phagocytize the necroptotic cancer cells and instruct the immune system to trace, recognize and kill any living tumour cells.  Necroptosis as a new target in cancer therapy To date, this type of immunogenic cell death has been described only for programmed cell death elicited by a number of cancer drugs. Tania L ve Aaes and Dmitri V. Krysko under the guidance of Peter Vandenabeele, show that another type of regulated cell death program termed necroptosis is also highly immunogenic. PhD student Tania L ve Aaes (VIB/UGent):  In our research, we developed a system that can elicit necroptosis in cancer cells. We administered these killed cancer cells in mice and found that they have a clear protective effect against tumour growth. We are now studying the findings in other relevant tumour models.  Prof. Peter Vandenabeele (VIB/UGent):  Many cancer cells develop resistance to the induction of cell death by apoptotic pathways. With this research we hope to provide an alternative way to kill cancer cells by inducing another type of immunogenic cell death, that is necroptosis, to kill cancer cells and to elicit a specific anti-cancer immune response. These results could pave the way for necroptosis as a novel target in cancer immunotherapy.","Published: April 4, 2016"

Exactly how such genome scrambling impacts RNA, particularly the vast and mysterious world of non-coding RNA, has been largely unexplored.  Now, a team led by investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) offers some early answers by studying an intriguing class of non-coding RNAs known as circular RNAs. Published in the March 31 advance online issue of Cell, their findings reveal that circular RNAs   like their protein counterparts   are also affected by genomic rearrangements in cancer, resulting in abnormal fusions. Moreover, these fusion-circular RNAs are not mere bystanders; they appear to promote tumor growth and progression, underscoring their role in the disease.  Cancer is essentially a disease of mutated or broken genes, so that motivated us to examine whether circular RNAs, like proteins, can be affected by these chromosomal breaks,  said senior author Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, PhD, Director of the Cancer Center at BIDMC and George C. Reisman Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Our work paves the way to discovering many more of these unusual RNAs and how they contribute to cancer, which could reveal new mechanisms and druggable pathways involved in tumor progression.  When it comes to RNA, scientists  worldview is in the midst of a significant shift. Long dismissed as a mere messenger, RNA is perhaps best known for its role ferrying instructions from the genome, which is cloistered in the nucleus, to more far-flung parts of the cell, where it is made into protein. Yet only 2 percent of the genome is copied (or  transcribed ) from DNA into RNA and then translated into protein. Scientists now recognize that much, if not all, of the remaining 98 percent   which had previously been deemed non-functioning  is in fact transcribed into RNA. The roles this vast swath of so-called  non-coding RNA  might play in human biology and disease now signify an area of intense research.  Curious about the possibility of circular RNAs contributing to cancer, Pandolfi and his colleagues set out to see if they could detect relevant changes in tumors known to harbor distinct fusion proteins, which result when different chromosomes abnormally join together, melding two separate genes into a new centaur-like gene. These chromosomal translocations are common in various types of leukemia, so the researchers examined two types: acute promyelocytic leukemia, which often carries a translocation between the PML and RAR  genes; and acute myeloid leukemia, which can harbor a translocation between the MLL and AF9 genes.  The researchers found abnormal fusion-circular RNAs (f-circRNAs), corresponding to different exons associated with the PML-RAR  gene fusion as well as the MLL-AF9 gene fusion. (Normally, multiple circular RNAs can be generated from a single gene, so it is not entirely surprising to find different f-circRNAs emerging from the same fusion gene.)  Remarkably, Pandolfi and his colleagues uncovered f-circRNAs in solid tumors, too   in samples from Ewing sarcoma, a form of soft tissue cancer, and lung cancer. Moreover, the team identified them using two distinct methods, PCR-based amplification as well as sequencing-based approaches, underscoring f-circRNAs as bona fide biological entities, rather than experimental artifacts.   Our ability to readily detect these fusion-circular RNAs   and their normal, non-fused counterparts   will be enhanced by advances in sequencing technology and analytic methods,  said first author Jlenia Guarnerio, PhD, also of BIDMC.  Indeed, as we look ahead to cataloguing them comprehensively across all cancers and to deeply understanding their mechanisms of action, we will need to propel these new methodologies even further.  To determine whether f-circRNAs play a functional role in cancer, the researchers introduced them experimentally into cells, causing the cells to increase their proliferation and tendency to overgrow   features shared by tumor cells. On the other hand, when the researchers blocked f-circRNA activity, the cells  normal behaviors were restored.  The researchers also conducted experiments using a mouse model of leukemia. They focused on a specific f-circRNA associated with the MLL-AF9 fusion gene, called f-circM9. Although insufficient on its own to trigger leukemia, f-circM9 appears to work together with other cancer-promoting signals (such as the MLL-AF9 fusion protein) to cause disease. Additional studies suggest that f-circM9 may also help tumor cells persist in the face of anti-cancer drugs.  These results are particularly exciting because they suggest that drugs directed at fusion-circular RNAs could be a powerful strategy to pursue for future therapeutic development in cancer,  said Pandolfi.  Circular RNAs were first identified more than three decades ago and largely dismissed as a rare cellular oddity. But a study published in 2012 by Patrick Brown s group at Stanford University showed that they are present at high levels in diverse cell types, igniting scientists  efforts to study and understand them. Surprisingly, circular RNAs   are among the most abundant non-coding RNAs in cells, driven in part by the molecules  unusual chemical stability. Unlike linear RNAs, circular RNAs are not susceptible to RNA-degrading enzymes. This ability to persist makes them not only an interesting therapeutic target, but also a potential molecular beacon or biomarker that can facilitate the diagnosis of disease.  Our knowledge of circular RNAs is really in its infancy,  explained Pandolfi.  We know that normally, they can bind proteins as well as DNA and microRNAs, but much more needs to be done to understand how fusion-circular RNAs work. We have only scratched the surface of these RNAs and their roles in cancer and other diseases. ","Published: April 4, 2016"

Any regions within the virus structure unique to Zika have the potential to explain differences in how a virus is transmitted and how it manifests as a disease, said Richard Kuhn, director of the Purdue Institute for Inflammation, Immunology and Infectious Diseases (PI4D) who led the research team with Michael Rossmann, Purdue s Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences.  The structure of the virus provides a map that shows potential regions of the virus that could be targeted by a therapeutic treatment, used to create an effective vaccine or to improve our ability to diagnose and distinguish Zika infection from that of other related viruses,  said Kuhn, who also is head of Purdue s Department of Biological Sciences.  Determining the structure greatly advances our understanding of Zika - a virus about which little is known. It illuminates the most promising areas for further testing and research to combat infection.  The Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease, has recently been associated with a birth defect called microcephaly that causes brain damage and an abnormally small head in babies born to mothers infected during pregnancy. It also has been associated with the autoimmune disease Guillain-Barr  syndrome, which can lead to temporary paralysis. In the majority of infected individuals symptoms are mild and include fever, skin rashes and flulike illness, according to the World Health Organization. Zika virus transmission has been reported in 33 countries. Of the countries where Zika virus is circulating 12 have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr  syndrome, and Brazil and French Polynesia have reported an increase in microcephaly, according to WHO. In February WHO declared the Zika virus to be  a public health emergency of international concern.   This breakthrough illustrates not only the importance of basic research to the betterment of human health, but also its nimbleness in quickly addressing a pressing global concern,  said Purdue President Mitch Daniels.  This talented team of researchers solved a very difficult puzzle in a remarkably short period of time, and have provided those working on developing vaccines and treatments to stop this virus a map to guide their way.  Rossmann and Kuhn collaborated with Theodore Pierson, chief of the viral pathogenesis section of the Laboratory of Viral Diseases at the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Additional research team members include Purdue graduate student Devika Sirohi and postdoctoral research associates Zhenguo Chen, Lei Sun and Thomas Klose. The team s paper marks the first published success of the new Purdue Institute for Inflammation, Immunology and Infectious Diseases in Purdue s Discovery Park. The university s recently announced $250 million investment in the life sciences funded the purchase of advanced equipment that allowed the team to do in a couple of months what otherwise would have taken years, Rossmann said.  We were able to determine through cryo-electron microscopy the virus structure at a resolution that previously would only have been possible through X-ray crystallography,  he said.  Since the 1950s X-ray crystallography has been the standard method for determining the structure of viruses, but it requires a relatively large amount of virus, which isn t always available; it can be very difficult to do, especially for viruses like Zika that have a lipid membrane and don t organize accurately in a crystal; and it takes a long time. Now, we can do it through electron microscopy and view the virus in a more native state. This was unthinkable only a few years ago.  The team studied a strain of Zika virus isolated from a patient infected during the French Polynesia epidemic and determined the structure to 3.8 . At this near-atomic resolution key features of the virus structure can be seen and groups of atoms that form specific chemical entities, such as those that represent one of 20 naturally occurring amino acids, can be recognized, Rossmann said. The team found the structure to be very similar to that of other flaviviruses with an RNA genome surrounded by a lipid, or fatty, membrane inside an icosahedral protein shell. The strong similarity with other flaviviruses was not surprising and is perhaps reassuring in terms of vaccine development already underway, but the subtle structural differences are possibly key, Sirohi said.  Most viruses don t invade the nervous system or the developing fetus due to blood-brain and placental barriers, but the association with improper brain development in fetuses suggest Zika does,  Sirohi said.  It is not clear how Zika gains access to these cells and infects them, but these areas of structural difference may be involved. These unique areas may be crucial and warrant further investigation.  The team found that all of the known flavivirus structures differ in the amino acids that surround a glycosylation site in the virus shell. The shell is made up of 180 copies of two different proteins. These, like all proteins, are long chains of amino acids folded into particular structures to create a protein molecule, Rossmann said. The glycosylation site where Zika virus differs from other flaviviruses protrudes from the surface of the virus. A carbohydrate molecule consisting of various sugars is attached to the viral protein surface at this site. In many other viruses it has been shown that as the virus projects a glycosylation site outward, an attachment receptor molecule on the surface of a human cell recognizes the sugars and binds to them, Kuhn said. The virus is like a menacing stranger luring an unsuspecting victim with the offer of sweet candy. The human cell gladly reaches out for the treat and then is caught by the virus, which, once attached, may initiate infection of that cell. The glycosylation site and surrounding residues on Zika virus may also be involved in attachment to human cells, and the differences in the amino acids between different flaviviruses could signify differences in the kinds of molecules to which the virus can attach and the different human cells it can infect, Rossmann said.  If this site functions as it does in dengue and is involved in attachment to human cells, it could be a good spot to target an antiviral compound,  Rossmann said.  If this is the case, perhaps an inhibitor could be designed to block this function and keep the virus from attaching to and infecting human cells.  The team plans to pursue further testing to evaluate the different regions as targets for treatment and to develop potential therapeutic molecules, Kuhn said. Kuhn and Rossmann have studied flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika belongs, for more than 14 years. They were the first to map the structure of any flavivirus when they determined the dengue virus structure in 2002. In 2003 they were first to determine the structure of West Nile virus and now they are the first to do so with the Zika virus.","Published: April 4, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/pharmacy-on-demand-205227,Pharmacy on Demand New  portable system can be configured to produce different drugs  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. MIT researchers have developed a compact, portable pharmaceutical manufacturing system that can be reconfigured to produce a variety of drugs on demand. Just as an emergency generator supplies electricity to handle a power outage, this system could be rapidly deployed to produce drugs needed to handle an unexpected disease outbreak, or to prevent a drug shortage caused by a manufacturing plant shutdown, the researchers say.  Think of this as the emergency backup for pharmaceutical manufacturing,  says Allan Myerson, an MIT professor of the practice in the Department of Chemical Engineering.  The purpose is not to replace traditional manufacturing; it s to provide an alternative for these special situations.  Such a system could also be used to produce small quantities of drugs needed for clinical trials or to treat rare diseases, says Klavs Jensen, the Warren K. Lewis Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT.  The goal of this project was to build a small-scale, portable unit that was completely integrated, so you could imagine being able to ship it anywhere. And as long as you had the right chemicals, you could make pharmaceuticals,  Jensen says. Jensen, Myerson, and Timothy Jamison, the head of MIT s Department of Chemistry, are the senior authors of a paper describing the new system in the March 31 online edition of Science. The lead author is MIT research associate Andrea Adamo. More flexibility Traditional drug manufacturing, also known as  batch processing,  can take weeks or months. Active pharmaceutical ingredients are synthesized in chemical manufacturing plants and then shipped to other sites to be converted into a form that can be given to patients, such as tablets, drug solutions, or suspensions. This system offers little flexibility to respond to surges in demand and is susceptible to severe disruption if one of the plants has to shut down. Many pharmaceutical companies are now looking into developing an alternative approach known as flow processing   a continuous process that is done all in one location. Five years ago, an MIT team that included Jamison, Jensen, and Myerson demonstrated a larger prototype (24 by 8 by 8 feet) for the continuous integrated manufacturing of drugs from chemical synthesis to tablets. That project has ended, but the continuous manufacturing initiative, funded by Novartis, is still underway as the researchers develop new methods for synthesis, purification, and formulation.   In the new endeavor, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the MIT researchers built on what they learned from the Novartis-funded project to create a much smaller, transportable device. Their new system can produce four drugs formulated as solutions or suspensions   Benadryl, lidocaine, Valium, and Prozac. Using this apparatus, the researchers can manufacture about 1,000 doses of a given drug in 24 hours. Key to the continuous system is the development of chemical reactions that can take place as the reactants flow through relatively small tubes as opposed to the huge vats in which most pharmaceutical reactions now take place. Traditional batch processing is limited by the difficulty of cooling these vats, but the flow system allows reactions that produce a great deal of heat to be run safely.  In many cases we were developing syntheses of targets that had never been done in a continuous flow platform,  Jamison says.  That presents a lot of challenges even if there is a good precedent from the batch perspective. We also recognized it as an opportunity where, because of some of the phenomena that one can leverage in [a flow-based system], you can make molecules differently.  The chemical reactions required to synthesize each drug take place in the first of two modules. The reactions were designed so that they can take place at temperatures up to 250 degrees Celsius and pressures up to 17 atmospheres. By swapping in different module components, the researchers can easily reconfigure the system to produce different drugs.  Within a few hours we could change from one compound to the other,  Jensen says. In the second module, the crude drug solution is purified by crystallization, filtered, and dried to remove solvent, then dissolved or suspended in water as the final dosage form. The researchers also incorporated an ultrasound monitoring system that ensures the formulated drug solution is at the correct concentration. Small-scale manufacturing John Lewin, the division director of critical care and surgery pharmacy at Johns Hopkins Hospital, says this type of manufacturing could bring down production costs and help patients get better access to the drugs they need.  This sets the foundation for a new paradigm in terms of the way we manufacture pharmaceuticals and distribute them to patients,  says Lewin, who was not involved in the study.  Such a device could really meet a lot of the supply chain challenges here in the U.S. and around the world.  One of the advantages of this small-scale system is that it could be used to make small amounts of drugs that would be prohibitively expensive to make in a large-scale plant. This would be useful for so-called  orphan drugs    drugs needed by a small number of patients.  Sometimes it s very difficult to get those drugs, because economically it makes no sense to have a huge production operation for those,  Jensen says. It could also be useful in regions with few pharmaceutical storage facilities, because drugs can be produced on demand, eliminating the need for long-term storage.  The idea here is you make what you need, and you make a simple dosage form, because they re going to be taken on demand. The dosages don t have to have long-term stability,  Myerson says.  People line up, you make it, and they take it.  The researchers are now working on the second phase of the project, which includes making the system about 40 percent smaller and producing drugs whose chemical syntheses are more complex. They are also working on producing tablets, which are more complicated to manufacture than liquid drugs.","Published: April 4, 2016"

The discovery is unusual because the enzymes do not bear a resemblance in their structures or amino-acid sequences to any known class of enzymes. The team of scientists nevertheless identified them as  outlier  members of the serine/threonine hydrolase class, using newer techniques that detect biochemical activity.  A huge fraction of the human  proteome  remains uncharacterized, and this paper shows how chemical approaches can be used to uncover proteins of a given functionality that have eluded classification based on sequence or predicted structure,  said co-senior author Benjamin F. Cravatt, chair of TSRI s Department of Chemical Physiology.  In this study, we found two genes that control levels of lipids with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activity, suggesting exciting targets for diabetes and inflammatory diseases,  said co-senior author Alan Saghatelian, who holds the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at the Salk Institute. The study, which appeared as a Nature Chemical Biology Advance Online Publication on March 28, 2016, began as an effort in the Cravatt laboratory to discover and characterize new serine/threonine hydrolases using fluorophosphonate (FP) probes molecules that selectively bind and, in effect, label the active sites of these enzymes. Pulling FP-binding proteins out of the entire proteome of test cells and identifying them using mass spectrometry techniques, the team matched nearly all to known hydrolases. The major outlier was a protein called androgen-induced gene 1 protein (AIG1). The only other one was a distant cousin in terms of sequence, a protein called ADTRP.  Neither of these proteins had been characterized as an enzyme; in fact, there had been little functional characterization of them at all,  said William H. Parsons, a research associate in the Cravatt laboratory who was co-first author of the study. Experiments on AIG1 and ADTRP revealed that they do their enzymatic work in a unique way.  It looks like they have an active site that is novel it had never been described in the literature,  said Parsons. Initial tests with panels of different enzyme inhibitors showed that AIG1 and ADTRP are moderately inhibited by inhibitors of lipases enzymes that break down fats and other lipids. But on what specific lipids do these newly discovered outlier enzymes normally work? At the Salk Institute, the Saghatelian laboratory was investigating a class of lipids it had discovered in 2014. Known as fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), these molecules showed strong therapeutic potential. Saghatelian and his colleagues had found that boosting the levels of one key FAHFA lipid normalizes glucose levels in diabetic mice and also reduces inflammation.  [Ben Cravatt s] lab was screening panels of lipids to find the ones that their new enzymes work on,  said Saghatelian, who is a former research associate in the Cravatt laboratory.  We suggested they throw FAHFAs in there and these turned out to be very good substrates.  The Cravatt laboratory soon developed powerful inhibitors of the newly discovered enzymes, and the two labs began working together, using the inhibitors and genetic techniques to explore the enzymes  functions in vitro and in cultured cells. Co-first author Matthew J. Kolar, an MD-PhD student, performed most of the experiments in the Saghatelian lab. The team concluded that AIG1 and ADTRP, at least in the cell types tested, appear to work mainly to break down FAHFAs and not any other major class of lipid. In principle, inhibitors of AIG1 and ADTRP could be developed into FAHFA-boosting therapies.  Our prediction,  said Saghatelian,  is that if FAHFAs do what we think they re doing, then using an enzyme inhibitor to block their degradation would make FAHFA levels go up and should thus reduce inflammation as well as improve glucose levels and insulin sensitivity.  The two labs are now collaborating on further studies of the new enzymes and the potential benefits of inhibiting them in mouse models of diabetes, inflammation and autoimmune disease.  One of the neat things this study shows,  said Cravatt,  is that even for enzyme classes as well studied as the hydrolases, there may still be hidden members that, presumably by convergent evolution, arrived at that basic enzyme mechanism despite sharing no sequence or structural homology.  Other co-authors of the study,  AIG1 and ADTRP are atypical integral membrane hydrolases that degrade bioactive FAHFAs,  were Siddhesh S. Kamat, Armand B. Cognetta III, Jonathan J.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/key-regulatory-role-mysterious-olfaction-molecule-omp-284146,Key regulatory role for mysterious olfaction molecule OMP  Less  noise  means more accurate odor information gets to the brain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Less 'noise' means more accurate odor information gets to the brain -New research from the Monell Center reveals that olfactory marker protein (OMP), a molecule found in the cells that detect odor molecules, plays a key role in regulating the speed and transmission of odor information to the brain. The findings solve a 30-year-old mystery regarding the function of OMP and increases understanding of how the olfactory system integrates information to transmit accurate data about odors and the messages they contain. See Also: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells ""At any one time, thousands of different odor molecules arrive at the smell receptors in our noses to provide detailed information about the surrounding world. OMP helps the smell receptor cells filter this vast amount of information so that animals can respond appropriately,"" said Monell cellular physiologist Johannes Reisert, PhD, the study's senior author. The sensory cells that detect odors and transmit this information to the brain are nerve cells known as olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Each ORN contains one specific type of olfactory receptor (OR) that determines which kind of odor molecule can activate the ORN. Humans have approximately 400 different types of ORs while mice have about 1000. The number of odor molecules arriving in the nose at any one time is influenced both by a given odor's strength (concentration) and by how frequently the animal breathes, or sniffs the air. The ORNs interpret and integrate the repetitively arriving information from odor molecules to send electrical signals called action potentials to the brain. The overall number of action potentials and the rate at which they are fired tells the brain that an odor is present and how strong that odor is. The process of converting the chemical information from an odor molecule into an electrical signal is mediated by a complex sequence of molecular events within the ORN called olfactory transduction. Scientists knew that OMP has a role in this process, but the exact nature of this role was unclear. Learn More: Can autism be measured in a sniff? In the current study, published as a featured article in the Journal of Neuroscience, the Monell researchers used mice engineered to be missing OMP, called OMP knockout mice, to identify how OMP controls the ORNs' responses to odors. The findings revealed that OMP regulates odor processing by filtering 'noisy' signals so that incoming odor information is transmitted accurately. When an odor is detected, the levels of a key molecule inside the ORN need to rise to a critical threshold before the ORN can fire an action potential. This molecule, called cyclic AMP (cAMP), then needs to return to baseline levels before the ORN can send another signal. Reisert previously had found that each type of OR dictates a specific baseline level of cAMP activity in the related ORN. In the current study, the Monell scientists combined pharmacological and electrophysiological techniques to investigate OMP's role in setting these different levels of cAMP. The results revealed that ORNs from the OMP knockout mice had similar high levels of cAMP independent of which OR was expressed. This contrasted with the varied cAMP levels observed in ORNs from normal mice. ""What this tells us is that OMP dampens cAMP 'noise' to allow the olfactory system to differentiate between ORs and to allow faithful transmission of odor information to the brain,"" said Reisert. Other findings revealed that ORNs from the OMP knockout mice were less able to integrate odor information over time, and specifically were less responsive to odors present for shorter amounts of time. ""Mice normally sniff 10 times every second, so need to be able to integrate odor information arriving in short intervals or they will miss valuable odor information. OMP speeds up the transduction process so that more signals can contribute to generating action potentials,"" said Reisert.

The researchers, who will present their study results today (April 1) at The Endocrine Society's 98th annual meeting in Boston, suggest these chemicals, which are added to indwelling medical devices such as plastic tubes and catheters, seep into the child's bloodstream. ""Phthalates have been banned from children's toys because of their potential toxic and hormone-disrupting effects, but they are still used to soften medical devices,"" said lead researcher S ren Verstraete, MD, a PhD student at KU (Katholieke Universiteit) Leuven in Leuven, Belgium.

Most of the PICU patients were recovering from heart surgery, but some had sustained accidental injuries or had severe infections. The researchers measured blood levels of DEHP metabolites, or byproducts. Initially they performed the blood tests in the healthy children and 228 of the patients while they were in the PICU. Patients had one to 12 medical tubes in the PICU and ranged in age from newborn to 16 years. The investigators found that DEHP metabolite levels were not detectable in the blood samples of healthy children. However, at admission to the PICU, the critically ill children, already connected to catheters, had levels that Verstraete called ""sky-high."" Although the DEHP levels decreased rapidly, they remained 18 times higher until discharge from the PICU compared with those of healthy children, he said. Related: MRI shows disrupted connections in the brains of young people with ADHD Then the researchers conducted statistical analyses that adjusted for the patients' initial risk factors that could influence the neurocognitive outcome as well as length of stay, complications and treatments in the PICU. A high exposure to DEHP during the PICU stay, according to Verstraete, was strongly associated with attention deficit found at neurocognitive testing four years after discharge. They validated this finding in a different group of 221 PICU patients. ""This phthalate exposure explained half of the attention deficit in former PICU patients,"" he said, adding that other factors may account for the other half.

Scientists know how proteins are structured, but folding   how they are built   still holds many mysteries. New research conducted at Michigan State University (MSU) and published in Nature Chemical Biology, features a chemistry approach that s solving some of the riddles of the complex protein-building process of folding. When it goes right, strings of amino acids become well-ordered, three-dimensional proteins in a split second. When it goes awry, though, it s the first step of many serious diseases. See Also: Protein clusters targeted by medications for neurodegenerative diseases actually serve to protect brain cells When errors happen in folding, proteins clump together, form plaques such as those found in Parkinson s disease and cystic fibrosis, and cause cells to degenerate. Understanding folding could lead to medicinal advances to treat these and other diseases at their earliest stage.  Our novel tool set can potentially be applied to analyze how disease mutations impact the structural and functional integrity of pathologically important membrane proteins,  said Heedeok Hong, MSU chemist and study co-author.  This knowledge will ultimately help in designing treatments that can stabilize defective membrane proteins for their optimal function.  The team focused on membrane proteins because roughly 30 percent of all proteins reside in this oily layer that encapsulates cells. Membrane proteins carry out many life functions, including the uptake of nutrients, secretion of wastes, maintaining ion balance and transmitting nerve signals. Learn More: Parkinson s disease: New insights into a traveling protein  Despite their importance, we know little about how membrane proteins fold because studying membrane protein folding has been formidable, due to the lack of adequate methods,  Hong said. To tackle the membrane mysteries, the team developed a new method called  steric trapping.  First, scientists attached two small molecular tags to a protein in its folded form. Next, they added bulky objects that bind the tags. The large attachments, by their sheer size alone, unravel the protein to its unfolded state. This simple yet eloquent procedure can test the stability of membrane proteins, show what unfolded membrane proteins look like and reveal how individual amino acids that are building a protein work together to maintain its folded shape.

Recent research from Japan has found that epileptic seizures can be more easily predicted by using an electrocardiogram to measure fluctuations in the heart rate than by measuring brain activity, because the monitoring device is easier to wear. By making more accurate predictions, it is possible to prevent injury or accident that may result from an epileptic seizure. This is a significant contribution toward the realization of a society where epileptic patients can live without worrying about sustaining injury from an unexpected seizure. This finding comes from the combined research of Kumamoto University, Kyoto University and Tokyo Medical and Dental University. See Also: Marijuana derivative reduces seizures in people with treatment-resistant epilepsy Seventy percent of all epileptic patients are able to go through their daily lives without any problems due to the suppression of seizures through anti-epileptic drugs. However, some patients have drug resistant epilepsy where their seizures cannot be controlled by medication, and they live in a constant state of fear that an epileptic seizure may occur at any moment. For this reason, development of a method to predict epileptic seizures has been strongly desired. Previous attempts at predicting epileptic seizures by heart rate did not have very high accuracy. It was difficult to determine the difference between the normal heart rate and the heart rate just before the onset of an attack. Additionally, differences among individuals was large, and there were many false positives. Practical application was therefore considered to be difficult. Related: Researchers use network science to help pinpoint source of seizures ""We analyzed heart rate fluctuations in the electrocardiographic data of 14 patients who had been hospitalized for long-term EEG video monitoring using a novel technique,"" said Dr. Toshitaka Yamakawa, Assistant Professor at Kumamoto University. The researchers used a multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) to analyze the heart rate variability. The results produced accurate predictions (91%) for epileptic seizures. Furthermore, predictions could be made an average of 8 minutes before seizure onset. The difference between normal and preictal (before-seizure) heart rates was made very clear, and there were few false-positives (0.7 times/hour). These result shows that it is possible to make accurate predictions of epileptic seizures.

They intrude at the quietest moments, and don t seem to have an off switch. But a new study in veterans with PTSD shows the promise of mindfulness training for enhancing the ability to manage those thoughts if they come up, and not get  stuck .  Even more surprising, it actually shows the veterans  brains changed in ways that may help them find their own off switch for that endless loop. See Also: Neurobiological changes explain how mindfulness meditation improves health The findings, published in Depression and Anxiety by a team from the University of Michigan (U-M) Medical School and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, come from a study of 23 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. All of them got some form of group therapy. After four months of weekly sessions, many reported that their PTSD symptoms eased up. But only in those who got mindfulness training a mind-body technique that focuses on in-the-moment attention and awareness did the researchers see the brain changes that surprised even them. The changes showed up on functional MRI (fMRI) brain scans that can visualize brain activity as different areas of the brain  talk  to one another through networks of connections between brain cells. Before the mindfulness training, when the veterans were resting quietly, their brains had extra activity in regions involved in responding to threats or other outside problems. This is a sign of that endless loop of hypervigilance often seen in PTSD. But after learning mindfulness, they developed stronger connections between two other brain networks: the one involved in our inner, sometimes meandering, thoughts, and the one involved in shifting and directing attention.  The brain findings suggest that mindfulness training may have helped the veterans develop more capacity to shift their attention and get themselves out of being  stuck  in painful cycles of thoughts,  says Anthony King, PhD, a  U-M Department of Psychiatry researcher who led the new study in collaboration with VA psychologists. Learn More: How the brain works during meditation  We re hopeful that this brain signature shows the potential of mindfulness to be helpful for managing PTSD for people who might initially decline therapy involving trauma processing,  he adds.  We hope it may provide emotional regulation skills to help bring them to a place where they feel better able to process their traumas.                    King, who has experience providing individual and group therapy for veterans from many conflicts, worked with a team of brain-imaging experts and PTSD specialists including senior author Israel Liberzon, MD. They used an fMRI scanner at the VA Ann Arbor that s dedicated to research. In all, 14 of the veterans finished the mindfulness sessions and completed follow-up fMRI scans, and 9 finished the comparison sessions and had scans. The small size of the group means the new results are only the start of an exploration of this issue, King says. Before they launched the study, the researchers weren t sure that they could find enough veterans to try mindfulness-based training. After all, it has a reputation as an  alternative  approach and has a relationship to traditionally East and South Asian practices like meditation and yoga But in fact, more of the initial group of veterans stuck with mindfulness-based therapy sessions held each week for two hours with a trained mindfulness teacher and psychotherapist than made it all the way through the comparison psychotherapy group that didn t get mindfulness training.  Once we explained the rationale behind mindfulness, which aims to ground and calm a person while also addressing mental phenomena, they were very interested and engaged   more than we expected,  says King.  The approach we took included standard elements of exposure therapy as well as mindfulness, to help lead veterans to be able to process the trauma itself.  The comparison group received a VA-developed intervention that was designed for  control group  use. It included problem-solving and group support but not mindfulness or exposure therapy. Veterans with PTSD who didn t receive mindfulness training didn t have many changes in brain connections (left brain scan). But those who got mindfulness training did see changes in key areas, shown in yellow (right). Credit: U-M/VA Ann Arbor  He emphasizes that people with PTSD should not see mindfulness alone as a potential solution for their symptoms, and that they should seek out providers trained specifically in PTSD care.The mindfulness group saw improvement in PTSD symptoms, in the form of decreased scores on a standard scale of PTSD severity, that was statistically significant and considered clinically meaningful, whereas the control group did not. However, the between-group effects in this small study were not considered statistically significant, and therefore King wants to explore the trend further in larger groups, and in civilians. That s because mindfulness sessions can sometimes actually trigger symptoms such as intrusive thoughts to flare up. So, it is very important for people with PTSD to have help from a trained counselor to use mindfulness as part of their therapy for PTSD.  Mindfulness can help people cope with and manage their trauma memories, explore their patterns of avoidance when confronting reminders of their trauma, and better understand their reactions to their symptoms,  says King.  It helps them feel more grounded, and to notice that even very painful memories have a beginning, a middle and an end that they can become manageable and feel safer. It s hard work, but it can pay off.  Related: Forever young(er): Meditation might slow the age-related loss of gray matter in the brain At the start of the study, and in previous U-M/VA work, the fMRI scans of veterans with PTSD showed unusual activity. Even when they were asked to rest quietly and let their minds wander freely, they had high levels of activity in brain networks that govern reactions to salient, or meaningful, external signals such as threats or dangers. Meanwhile, the default mode network, involved in inwardly focused thinking and when the mind is wandering, was not as active in them.  But at the end of the mindfulness course, the default mode area was more active and showed increased connections to areas of the brain known as the executive network. This area gets involved in what scientists call volitional attentional shifting purposefully moving your attention to think about or act upon something. Those with the greatest easing of symptoms had the largest increases in connections.  We were surprised by the findings, because there is thinking that segregation between the default mode network and the salience network is good,  says King.  But now we are hopeful that this brain signature of increased connection to areas associated with volitional attention shifting at rest may be helpful for managing PTSD, and may help patients have more capacity to help themselves get out of being stuck in painful ruts of trauma memories and rumination.

The research suggests that there is not one sole mechanism in the brain that governs how much our senses work together to process information. Among the implications of the study: It might not be as easy as many people had assumed to categorize the way in which we perceive and learn. See Also: Study helps fill in gaps in our visual perception ""We should be cautious not to make blanket statements about how we process information, like 'I'm a visual learner,'"" said Ladan Shams, an associate professor of psychology in the UCLA College and senior author of the research. ""That's not necessarily true across the board. For example, your brain may combine sights and sounds a lot in one task watching TV, for example but only a little in another task such as playing the piano."" The researchers found that people's vision frequently influenced their hearing when they tried to identify the specific location of sounds and flashes of light, and that their hearing influenced vision when they counted the sounds and flashes. In one part of the study, 59 participants, mostly UCLA undergraduates, were seated in front of a computer monitor with speakers on either side and asked to count the number of flashes of light on the screen and beeps played on the speakers. Sometimes they only saw flashes, sometimes they only heard beeps and sometimes they both saw flashes and heard beeps in which case the numbers could vary, up to four of each. The researchers presented 360 combinations of beeps and flashes in a one-hour period. ""When people have to process different numbers of beeps and flashes, it's really hard the senses blend together,"" said Brian Odegaard, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar who was the study's lead author. ""Most people, when presented with two beeps and one flash, mistakenly said they saw two flashes, while a few participants could accurately tease apart lights and sounds."" Shams explained that most people are pretty good at identifying visual stimuli if no other senses are involved, but in the experiment, what participants saw was typically affected by what they heard. ""When there's sound, many people get fooled into thinking that there are fewer or more flashes,"" she said. Learn More: Perception: Brain integrates features directly to patterns In the second part of the study, subjects were asked to sit facing a black screen, behind which were five speakers. A projector mounted overhead was used to flash bursts of light onto the screen, at the same spots where the speakers were located. The researchers played brief bursts of sound and triggered flashes of light, in various combinations, and asked participants to identify where they originated. The participants used a computer mouse to point at the part of the screen where they thought the sounds and flashes occurred; each was presented with 525 trials. When the flash and sound occurred in different locations from each other, most participants struggled to correctly identify where the sound occurred. The effect was similar to what happens when people watch a ventriloquist with a puppet or a magician using misdirection to pull off an illusion, Odegaard said. Given that the two tasks both involved brief sights and sounds, the researchers figured that the people who were fooled less on one task would be fooled less on the other as well, but the researchers were surprised to find no correlation in how much subjects combined the two senses on the two tasks. A week later, the participants were given both of the same tasks again. The results were the same although they performed consistently on each individual task, their abilities to bind the two senses in the two different tests showed no correlation.3 Related: Taste perception is influenced by extreme noise conditions People vary in how much their hearing and vision interact, Shams explained. For example, some find it easier to understand someone who is speaking when they are looking at the speaker. Some are better able, when driving, to estimate how fast other vehicles are traveling using both visual and aural cues. ""This finding suggests that if you find a strategy of combining your senses that helps you perform a given task, stick with it,"" she said. This study was the first to test the same group of people in both a spatial task and counting task. In future research, Shams and Odegaard hope to discover whether we can learn to modify how our brain combines sounds and sights, and if so, how.

All the tiny pieces of bone were recovered from a key archaeological site, Denisova Cave in Russia, with the remaining fragments found to be from animal species like mammoths, woolly rhino, wolf and reindeer. It is the first time that researchers have identified traces of an extinct human from an archaeological site using a technique called 'Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry' or ZooMS. From just a microscopic sample of bone, their analysis revealed the collagen peptide sequences in the bone that mark out one species from another. Their paper, which appears in the journal Scientific Reports, suggests that ZooMS has huge potential to increase our understanding of human evolution, including the amount of interbreeding that went on between our closely related cousins and modern humans. The international research team was led by Professor Thomas Higham and his student Sam Brown of the University of Oxford, with the developer of the ZooMS method, Dr Michael Buckley from the University of Manchester; the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig; Cranfield University; and the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, Russia. The sequences of collagen peptides in bone differ in tiny ways between different animal species. The team profiled the sequences using microscopic samples from 2,300 unidentified bone fragments from the site. They then compared the sequences obtained against a reference library of peptides from known animal species. On discovering that one 2.5 cm-long piece of bone had a clear human fingerprint, Sam Brown said: 'When the ZooMS results showed that there was a human fingerprint among the bones I was extremely excited. After a lot of hard work, finding this tiny bone which yields so much information about our human past was just fantastic. The bone itself is not exceptional in any way and would otherwise be missed by anyone looking for possible human bones amongst the dozens of fragments that we have from the site.' Study co-author Professor Svante P bo and his group from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig found that the bone belonged to a Neanderthal on the basis of its mitochrondrial genome. The results suggest that this Neanderthal was most closely related to other Neanderthals in the Altai region and more distantly related to those further to the west. The Neanderthal bone was also radiocarbon dated and shown to be more than 50,000 years old, as expected based on its deep position in the site. Acid etching on the surface of the bone also shows that it probably passed through the stomach of a hyaena for a short time before it was deposited in the cave sediments, says the paper. Denisova Cave in the Russian Altai region is a key site for archaeologists wanting to understand the nature of evolution over the last 100,000 years. Its cold climate means that bones from the cave are often exceptionally well-preserved in their DNA and collagen, which is ideal for genetics and radiocarbon dating. In 2010, P bo and his team discovered a new species of human, the so-called 'Denisovans' at the site, using state-of-the-art genetic methods. His team have also found that Denisovans, Neanderthals and modern humans interbred periodically with one another in Eurasia and Europe. During the Ice Age, there were periods when the cave was also occupied by carnivores such as hyaenas and wolves that crunched the bones into tiny pieces. This is why more than 95% of the bone fragments excavated were difficult to identify. Professor Thomas Higham said: 'This is a real breakthrough, showing that we can now use bioarchaeological methods like ZooMS to search the archaeological record and find even tiny fossil remains, where there are proteins that survive. In the Palaeolithic period, where we have Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans, this is potentially very important because if the fragments that we recover are big enough then we can date and analyse the DNA from the same bone. One of the big challenges is in understanding what happened when modern humans and Neanderthals met. We want to know over what period of time and where this happened. Fossils are the key, but for modern humans they are extremely rare in archaeological sites. We hope that more work like this will yield more human bone remains.' ","Published: April 1, 2016"

The corticospinal projection is the most important motor system in humans,  said senior study author Mark Tuszynski, MD, PhD, professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Neurosciences and director of the UC San Diego Translational Neuroscience Institute.  It has not been successfully regenerated before. Many have tried, many have failed   including us, in previous efforts.   The new thing here was that we used neural stem cells for the first time to determine whether they, unlike any other cell type tested, would support regeneration. And to our surprise, they did.  Specifically, the researchers grafted multipotent neural progenitor cells into sites of spinal cord injury in rats. The stem cells were directed to specifically develop as a spinal cord, and they did so robustly, forming functional synapses that improved forelimb movements in the rats. The feat upends an existing belief that corticospinal neurons lacked internal mechanisms needed for regeneration. Previous studies have reported functional recovery in rats following various therapies for spinal cord injury, but none had involved regeneration of corticospinal axons. In humans, the corticospinal tract extends from the cerebral cortex in the upper brain down into the spinal cord.  We humans use corticospinal axons for voluntary movement,  said Tuszynski.  In the absence of regeneration of this system in previous studies, I was doubtful that most therapies taken to humans would improve function. Now that we can regenerate the most important motor system for humans, I think that the potential for translation is more promising.  Nonetheless, the road to testing and treatment in people remains long and uncertain.  There is more work to do prior to moving to humans,  Tuszynski said. We must establish long-term safety and long-term functional benefit in animals. We must devise methods for transferring this technology to humans in larger animal models. And we must identify the best type of human neural stem cell to bring to the clinic.

The results are published in Nature Communications.  This could motivate a person at risk to change their lifestyle , says Karl Bacos, researcher in epigenetics at Lund University. Predicting the onset of diabetes is already possible by measuring the blood glucose level average, HbA1C, over time. However, the predictive potential of this method is modest and new methods are needed. The discoveries made by the research group at Lund University have now made it possible to measure the presence of so-called DNA methylations in four specific genes, and thereby predict who is at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, long before the disease occurs. Methylations are chemical changes that control gene activity, that is, whether they are active or not.  The hope is that this will be developed into a better way to predict the disease , says Karl Bacos, first author of the study. The researchers started by studying insulin-producing beta cells from deceased persons. They found that the DNA methylations in the four genes in question increased, depending on the donor s age. This in turn affected the activity of the genes. When these changes were copied in cultured beta cells, they proved to have a positive effect on insulin secretion.  We could then see the same DNA methylation changes in the blood which was really cool , says Karl Bacos. The blood samples from the participants of two separate research projects   one Danish and one Finnish   were then studied and compared with blood samples taken from the same participants ten years later. The Finnish participants, who had exhibited higher levels of DNA methylation in their first sample, had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes ten years later. In the Danish participants, higher DNA methylation in their first sample was associated with higher insulin secretion ten years later. All of the Danish participants were healthy on both occasions, whereas approximately one-third of the Finnish participants had developed type 2 diabetes.  Increased insulin secretion actually protects against type 2 diabetes. It could be the body s way of protecting itself when other tissue becomes resistant to insulin, which often happens as we get older , says professor and research project manager Charlotte Ling. The studies were based on a relatively small number of participants, and a selection of genes. The researchers therefore now want to continue with finding markers with a stronger predictive potential by implementing so-called epigenetic whole-genome sequencing when analysing a person s entire genetic make-up and all the DNA methylations that come with it, in a larger population group. The research group has previously shown that age, diet and exercise affect the so-called epigenetic risk of type 2 diabetes.  You cannot change your genes and the risks that they entail, but epigenetics means that you can affect the DNA methylations, and thereby gene activity, through lifestyle choices , says Charlotte Ling.","Published: April 1, 2016"

Researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust designed the new test, which works by sequencing 81 different cancer genes, with funding from UK charity Christopher s Smile. Testing will begin from 2016 and take about two years, with initial funding for the testing programme from the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at The Royal Marsden and The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). Tests will first be offered to children treated at The Royal Marsden, and then to patients at any of the other 20 hospitals in the UK which form part of the Children s Cancer and Leukaemia Group. The initial aim will be to assess the reliability and usefulness of the test in a research setting. If testing is successful, the aim is to move testing more routinely into the clinic, to allow treating doctors to formally incorporate the results in their decisions about how patients can be most effectively treated. The ambition is to offer children the same opportunities for personalised cancer treatment that are already increasingly becoming available for adults   to improve survival rates and reduce the level of side-effects. The testing programme will establish which mutations occur most often in children s tumours, and identify those that could be targeted by existing drugs for adult cancers. Doctors will aim where possible to use the test results to match children to clinical trials of targeted cancer drugs   although maximising this potential will require more clinical trials of targeted treatments to be set up for children. Targeted drugs can be highly effective at specifically attacking cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone, and are likely to have fewer side-effects than standard cancer treatments. But many of these drugs are not yet routinely available for children, in part because of difficulties in setting up clinical trials. The new initiative will be open to children under the age of 14 with solid tumours. It will not initially include children diagnosed with blood cancers such as leukaemia unless they suffer a relapse, because these cancers respond very well to the current treatments. Nor will it include older teenagers or young adults as they experience a different spectrum of tumours to children. Study leader Professor Louis Chesler, Professor of Paediatric Cancer Biology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:  Children deserve the very best, modern treatments for cancer, but for too long there have been delays in applying the latest molecular techniques to personalise their treatment.  A more comprehensive and structured approach to genetic testing to match children with cancer to specific targeted treatments could be an incredibly important step towards increasing survival. It s exciting to be testing out this new approach to genetic testing in several hundred children with cancer, in what I hope will be a staging post towards routine use of genomic information for the care of all children with cancer in the UK.  We still face major barriers in obtaining targeted cancer drugs for children and using them in robustly designed clinical trials. But my hope is that through this and other initiatives like it, we can help to drive forward the use of targeted drugs in children, and make the case very clearly that they should be more widely available, as they have been for adults.  Dr David Gonzalez de Castro, Head of Molecular Diagnostics of the NIHR Centre for Molecular Pathology at The Royal Marsden and the ICR, and developer of the genetic technology used in this study, said:  We have been using genetic profiling in adult cancers for many years in the NHS, allowing successful treatment stratification based on the biology of the tumour. We now need to bring these advances to childhood cancers and be able to design novel trials and tailor treatments using genomic medicine.  Karen Capel, founder and trustee of UK children s cancer charity Christopher s Smile who funded the development of the test, said:  There is an urgent unmet need to provide new treatments for those children diagnosed with the most aggressive and hard to treat cancers. We believe this gene sequencing test is the key  foundation stone  in enabling personalised medicine for children. It will help to bring new treatments for children a step closer. We believe that children should be given access to the same tests and treatments currently available to adults.   Christopher s Smile has not only committed over  300,000 specifically for paediatric molecular pathology but we also campaign tirelessly at national and European levels to give children better access to the latest drugs.   When our son died in 2008 there was no biological information available to clinicians about individual children s tumours. This test is a first for children. Our aim is that it will change the landscape for children and open doors to potential new trials with new treatments, benefitting those children who receive the worst prognosis.

The images detail the flexible structure of the DNA segments, which appear as nanoscale jump ropes. This unique imaging capability, pioneered by Berkeley Lab scientists, could aid in the use of DNA segments as building blocks for molecular devices that function as nanoscale drug-delivery systems, markers for biological research, and components for computer memory and electronic devices. It could also lead to images of important disease-relevant proteins that have proven elusive for other imaging techniques, and of the assembly process that forms DNA from separate, individual strands. The shapes of the coiled DNA strands, which were sandwiched between polygon-shaped gold nanoparticles, were reconstructed in 3-D using a cutting-edge electron microscope technique coupled with a protein-staining process and sophisticated software that provided structural details to the scale of about 2 nanometers, or two billionths of a meter.  We had no idea about what the double-strand DNA would look like between the nanogold particles,  said Gang  Gary  Ren, a Berkeley Lab scientist who led the research.  This is the first time for directly visualizing an individual double-strand DNA segment in 3-D,  he said.  The method developed by this team, called individual-particle electron tomography (IPET), had earlier captured the 3-D structure of a single protein that plays a key role in human cholesterol metabolism. By grabbing 2-D images of the same object from different angles, the technique allows researchers to assemble a 3-D image of that object. The team has also used the technique to uncover the fluctuation of another well-known flexible protein, human immunoglobulin 1, which plays a role in our immune system. For this latest study of DNA nanostructures, Ren used an electron-beam study technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to examine frozen DNA-nanogold samples, and used IPET to reconstruct 3-D images from samples stained with heavy metal salts. The team also used molecular simulation tools to test the natural shape variations, called  conformations,  in the samples, and compared these simulated shapes with observations. Ren explained that the naturally flexible dynamics of samples, like a man waving his arms, cannot be fully detailed by any method that uses an average of many observations. A popular way to view the nanoscale structural details of delicate biological samples is to form them into crystals and zap them with X-rays, though this does not preserve their natural shape and the DNA-nanogold samples in this study are incredibly challenging to crystallize. Other common research techniques may require a collection of thousands near-identical objects, viewed with an electron microscope, to compile a single, averaged 3-D structure. But this 3-D image may not adequately show the natural shape fluctuations of a given object. The samples in the latest experiment were formed from individual polygon gold nanostructures, measuring about 5 nanometers across, connected to single DNA-segment strands with 84 base pairs. Base pairs are basic chemical building blocks that give DNA its structure. Each individual DNA segment and gold nanoparticle naturally zipped together with a partner to form the double-stranded DNA segment with a gold particle at either end. These views compare the various shape fluctuations obtained from different samples of the same type of double-helix DNA segment (DNA renderings in green, 3-D reconstructions in purple) connected to gold nanoparticles (yellow). (Credit: Berkeley Lab) The samples were flash-frozen to preserve their structure for study with cryo-EM imaging, and the distance between the two gold particles in individual samples varied from 20-30 nanometers based on different shapes observed in the DNA segments. Researchers used a cryo-electron microscope at Berkeley Lab s Molecular Foundry for this study. They collected a series of tilted images of the stained objects, and reconstructed 14 electron-density maps that detailed the structure of individual samples using the IPET technique. They gathered a dozen conformations for the samples and found the DNA shape variations were consistent with those measured in the flash-frozen cryo-EM samples. The shapes were also consistent with samples studied using other electron-based imaging and X-ray scattering methods, and with computer simulations. While the 3-D reconstructions show the basic nanoscale structure of the samples, Ren said that the next step will be to work to improve the resolution to the sub-nanometer scale.  Even in this current state we begin to see 3-D structures at 1- to 2-nanometer resolution,  he said.  Through better instrumentation and improved computational algorithms, it would be promising to push the resolution to that visualizing a single DNA helix within an individual protein.  The technique, he said, has already excited interest among some prominent pharmaceutical companies and nanotechnology researchers, and his science team already has dozens of related research projects in the pipeline. In future studies, researchers could attempt to improve the imaging resolution for complex structures that incorporate more DNA segments as a sort of  DNA origami,  Ren said. Researchers hope to build and better characterize nanoscale molecular devices using DNA segments that can, for example, store and deliver drugs to targeted areas in the body.  DNA is easy to program, synthesize and replicate, so it can be used as a special material to quickly self-assemble into nanostructures and to guide the operation of molecular-scale devices,  he said.  Our current study is just a proof of concept for imaging these kinds of molecular devices  structures. ","Published: April 1, 2016"

But development of these tools requires researchers to identify the protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) that unlock each system s functionality. A new set of techniques expedites PAM identification   and early testing finds that many CRISPR-Cas systems actually have multiple PAMs of varying strength. CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash proteins that chop up the invader s DNA, preventing it from replicating. However, the first step in the process isn t comparing the RNA to target DNA. The first step involves PAM recognition and binding. PAMs are short genetic sequences adjacent to the target DNA in viruses or other invaders. When the protein in a CRISPR-Cas system identifies a PAM, that identification tells the protein to bind to that DNA and begin comparing the adjacent DNA sequence to the CRISPR RNA. If the DNA and RNA match, then the protein cleaves the target DNA.  For researchers to make use of a CRISPR-Cas system for gene editing, gene regulation, or other techniques, you first need to identify the relevant PAM sequences that trigger that specific CRISPR-protein combination,  says Chase Beisel, an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at NC State University and a senior author of a paper describing the work.  For example, the CRISPR-Cas9 tool derived from Streptococcus pyogenes has a different PAM than the CRISPR-Cas9 tool derived from Staphylococcus aureus,  Beisel says.  There are thousands of potential CRISPR tools out there; to make use of them we need an efficient way to identify their PAMs. And we think we ve developed tools to do that.  PAM identification is tricky because it is difficult to predict which genetic sequences function as PAMs for a given CRISPR-Cas system. And the genetic sequences that function as PAMs vary widely, even between closely related CRISPR-Cas systems. For example, the PAM that triggers the Cas9 protein from S. pyogenes consists of only three nucleotides, but the PAM that triggers the Cas9 protein from S. aureus contains six nucleotides   none of which overlap with those from S. pyogenes.  To address this challenge, we developed a tool called PAM-SCANR,  says Ryan Leenay, a graduate student in Beisel s lab and lead author on the paper.  PAM-SCANR allows us to identify PAM sequences for any given CRISPR-protein combination.  Here s how PAM-SCANR works. First, researchers start with a CRISPR-Cas system they want to find the PAM for. The relevant CRISPR-protein pair is then used as the reactive agent in a high-throughput screen that exposes the CRISPR-protein pair to many different gene sequences simultaneously. The gene sequences are part of a genetic construct engineered to light up   they literally fluoresce   when the CRISPR-protein pair binds to them. And that can only happen if a functional PAM is present.  One thing that makes this tool unique is that it could be used to screen and identify PAMs across a wide range of CRISPR-Cas systems,  Leenay says. The researchers tested PAM-SCANR in five CRISPR-Cas systems across three of the four CRISPR types that are known to rely on PAMs to function. Different CRISPR types use different proteins and rely on different mechanisms of action. The researchers also developed a tool called a PAM wheel that helps researchers visualize the output of PAM-SCANR screens. It also allows researchers to see if some PAMs are better than others and by how much. This is important because, in testing PAM-SCANR, the researchers found that there can be multiple PAMs for a given CRISPR-Cas system   which was a surprise   and that some PAMs trigger a much stronger response than others.  When we first discovered PAMs nearly a decade ago, we initially thought that only one PAM worked,  says Rodolphe Barrangou, an associate professor in NC State s Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences and a senior author on the manuscript.  However, our tools revealed there can be multiple PAMs for a single CRISPR-Cas system, and some PAMs clearly performed better than others as part of CRISPR recognizing its target DNA.  The researchers are already using PAM-SCANR to identify PAMs for CRISPR-Cas systems that may be the next generation of CRISPR tools. They re also working to determine how different PAMs for a specific CRISPR-Cas system may affect that system s effectiveness in any given application.  For example, we want to know if the variability among PAMs has implications for genome editing and our ability to predict off-target sites   places a CRISPR-Cas system might attack other than the target DNA,  Beisel says.","Published: April 1, 2016"

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/an-alternative-route-to-inflammation-186410,An Alternative Route to Inflammation Using a combination of newly developed methods  researchers led by LMU immunologist Veit Hornung have defined a previously unknown pathway that triggers inflammation  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The immune system in vertebrates is capable of distinguishing  self  from  non-self  components, which enables recognition and destruction of invasive pathogens and aberrant cell types such as tumor cells. Adaptive immune reactions, e.g. based on antibodies, are powerful and highly specific, yet require tedious and time-consuming gene rearrangements. For effective immediate defense, intruders must be detected rapidly, and this task is performed by the so-called innate immune system. Innate immune cells express a relatively small set of receptors on their surfaces, which recognize molecular structures that are uniquely associated with pathogens. Binding of these structures triggers an inflammatory response that kills the pathogen or the infected cell. In order to analyze the signal pathways that mediate these processes, researchers led by Veit Hornung, who holds the Chair of Immunobiochemistry at LMU s Gene Center, combined two different methodologies. They first utilized a novel cell culture system that mimics the function of monocytes, a class of immune cells involved in regulating inflammation. Then they systematically deleted single genes to determine their role in initiation of the inflammatory response   and uncovered a previously unknown signaling pathway.  Hornung and his group began their study of a protein complex called the NLRP3 inflammasome at Bonn University Hospital before he moved to the LMU in October 2015. This complex is found in monocytes, and plays a key role in inducing inflammation, as well as being implicated in diseases associated with chronic inflammatory reactions, such as gout, Type 2 diabetes and arteriosclerosis. However, our knowledge of its mode of action is primarily based on studies carried out in mouse cells. In mouse monocytes, two stimuli are required to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome to trigger secretion of the pro-inflammatory signal protein interleukin 1beta (IL-1), while freshly isolated human monocytes were found to produce IL-1 in response to a single signal, which acts via a receptor called TLR4. However, no established human monocyte-like cell lines react to this signal. This is why Hornung and his colleagues had to employ the new human monocyte-like cell line in order to understand the basis for the species difference.  We developed a procedure which allowed us to specifically delete single genes in cultured human immune cells that closely resemble human monocytes. Using this system, we were able to identify, at the genetic level, the components responsible for signal transmission to, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,  explains Moritz Gaidt, a doctoral student in Hornung s group and first author of the new study. In this way, the team was able to analyze the secretion of IL-1 by human monocytes in unprecedented detail   and to define the mechanism that enables human NLRP3 to be activated in response to a single signal. The researchers activated the TLR4 receptor by exposing their monocytes to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)   a complex molecule made up of sugars and fats, which is found on the surface of many pathogenic bacteria. They then showed that binding of LPS triggers the secretion of IL-1 via a previously unrecognized signal relay.  The activation of this new pathway explains why human monocytes do not need a second signal to secrete IL-1. Conversely, in mouse monocytes this particular pathway is not activated, so a second stimulus is required,  Veit Hornung explains. Moreover, while inflammasome activation in the mouse induces programmed inflammatory cell death, the pathway used in human monocytes does not.  We refer to this signal pathway as the alternative inflammasome, in order to distinguish it from previously described pathways,  says Hornung.  We believe that this signal pathway plays a critical role in inflammatory processes in humans. ","Published: April 1, 2016"

While the disorder is caused by a mutation in a single gene, the range and severity of clinical abnormalities vary widely, making the impact of NF1 on children and adults difficult to predict and treat. But new research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis may help doctors determine which issues are likely to manifest in patients with NF1. The findings indicate that varying mutations in theNF1 gene may lead to different clinical outcomes.  This discovery could enable us to better predict how NF1 will affect specific individuals, showing us what problems are likely to develop and how best to address them,  said senior author David H. Gutmann, MD, PhD, the Donald O. Schnuck Family Professor of Neurology.  These early-phase findings bring us one step closer to being able to individually tailor how we monitor and treat people with NF1.  While all individuals with the disorder are born with a mutation in theNF1 gene, there are thousands of different NF1 gene mutations. To determine whether specific mutations of the gene increase the risk of developing optic gliomas, one of the most common brain tumors affecting children with NF1, the researchers used mice genetically engineered with patient-specific NF1 gene mutations. Surprisingly, Gutmann and his colleagues found that mice harboring one specific patient-derived NF1 gene mutation developed optic gliomas, while mice with another patient-derived NF1 gene mutation did not. The mice with optic gliomas also had greater eye dysfunction. Optic gliomas are known causes of vision loss in children with NF1. To determine why the specific mutation had such a dramatic effect on optic glioma formation and vision, Joseph Toonen, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow, built upon previous research in the Gutmann laboratory that demonstrated a critical role for microglia   immune cells in the central nervous system that defend against invaders   in mouse brain tumor growth. Toonen discovered that the number and activity of microglia were affected differently by each mutation. There were more microglia in mice with one patient-derived mutation, leading to greater tumor growth and increased optic nerve injury. In striking contrast, these findings were not observed with the other patient-derived mutation. The scientists now are researching how microglia promote optic glioma growth and vision loss.  Based on these exciting results, we can now envision using a mini-clinic of mice with different NF1 gene mutations,  said Gutmann, who also directs the Washington University NF Center.  This would offer us a valuable representation of the spectrum of clinical variability in this very heterogeneous disorder.  Moreover, should specific gene mutations play a major role in determining brain tumor development, families could be better informed about the risk that their children may develop such tumors,  Gutmann said. For this reason, the researchers are incorporating the mice into preclinical drug-discovery and evaluation efforts as a means of developing precision medicine strategies for children and adults with the disorder.","Published: April 1, 2016"

The findings point to a possible new risk factor for celiac disease. The study was the result of a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary collaboration between the Celiac Disease Center and researchers at Columbia University s department of Microbiology and Immunology.  Celiac disease is an autoimmune digestive disorder in which genetically predisposed individuals develop an immune response to gluten, a protein found in cereal grains, wheat, rye and barley. An estimated 40 percent of the population has the gene variants associated with celiac disease, but only 1 percent of people with these genes go on to develop intestinal inflammation and damage the hallmarks of the disease after ingesting gluten.  We don t know why only a fraction of individuals with genetic risk factors for celiac disease actually become gluten intolerant,  said Peter Green, MD, the Phyllis and Ivan Seidenberg Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), director of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University, gastroenterologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia and a lead author of the paper.  Through the dedicated work of translational scientists, we are beginning to uncover the mechanisms that unleash the symptoms of celiac disease and identify potential therapeutic targets.  Previous studies have identified a number of risk genes responsible for making proteins that are associated with the disease. Recently, researchers have focused on the ability of noncoding RNA, the portion of our genome that does not contribute to the production of proteins, to regulate a variety of biological processes. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which contains more than 200 nucleotides, are thought to play a role in autoimmune diseases and cancers by interacting with other RNA, DNA and proteins. Through a variety of experiments, the researchers demonstrated that lnc13 dampens the expression of celiac-associated genes by binding to a common family of proteins. They then discovered that patients with celiac disease had unusually low levels of lnc13 in their intestines, suggesting that reduced levels of this RNA may contribute to the inflammation seen in celiac disease by turning off the normal regulatory pathway.  These findings add an important detail to our understanding about how celiac disease develops,  said Sankar Ghosh, PhD, the Silverstein and Hutt Family Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at CUMC and another lead author.  Given that the majority of the population consumes these grains, understanding the triggers for the development of celiac disease will have a broad impact. In future studies, we hope to investigate factors that lead to suppression of lnc13, which may cause gluten intolerance in people who were previously able to tolerate gluten.

In animal studies, the technique more effectively targeted melanoma than other immunotherapy treatments. According to the CDC, more than 67,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanoma in 2012 alone   the most recent year for which data are available. If caught early, melanoma patients have a 5-year survival rate of more than 98 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute. That number dips to 16.6 percent if the cancer has metastasized before diagnosis and treatment. Melanoma treatments range from surgery to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A promising new field of cancer treatment is cancer immunotherapy, which helps the body s own immune system fight off cancer. In the immune system, T cells are supposed to identify and kill cancer cells. To do their job, T cells use specialized receptors to differentiate healthy cells from cancer cells. But cancer cells can trick T cells. One way cancer cells do this is by expressing a protein ligand that binds to a receptor on the T cells to prevent the T cell from recognizing and attacking the cancer cell. Recently, cancer immunotherapy research has focused on using  anti-PD-1  (or programmed cell death) antibodies to prevent cancer cells from tricking T cells.  However, this poses several challenges,  says Chao Wang, co-lead author of a paper on the microneedle research and a postdoctoral researcher in the joint biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC-Chapel Hill.  First, the anti-PD-1 antibodies are usually injected into the bloodstream, so they cannot target the tumor site effectively. Second, the overdose of antibodies can cause side effects such as an autoimmune disorder.  To address these challenges, the researchers developed a patch that uses microneedles to deliver anti-PD-1 antibodies locally to the skin tumor. The microneedles are made from hyaluronic acid, a biocompatible material. The anti-PD-1 antibodies are embedded in nanoparticles, along with glucose oxidase   an enzyme that produces acid when it comes into contact with glucose. These nanoparticles are then loaded into microneedles, which are arrayed on the surface of a patch. When the patch is applied to a melanoma, blood enters the microneedles. The glucose in the blood makes the glucose oxidase produce acid, which slowly breaks down the nanoparticles. As the nanoparticles degrade, the anti-PD-1 antibodies are released into the tumor.  This technique creates a steady, sustained release of antibodies directly into the tumor site; it is an efficient approach with enhanced retention of anti-PD-1 antibodies in the tumor microenvironment,  says Zhen Gu, an assistant professor in the biomedical engineering program and senior author of the paper. The researchers tested the technique against melanoma in a mouse model. The microneedle patch loaded with anti-PD-1 nanoparticles was compared to treatment by injecting anti-PD-1 antibodies directly into the bloodstream and to injecting anti-PD-1 nanoparticles directly into the tumor.  After 40 days, 40 percent of the mice who were treated using the microneedle patch survived and had no detectable remaining melanoma   compared to a zero percent survival rate for the control groups,  says Yanqi Ye, a Ph.D. student in Gu s lab and co-lead author of the paper. The researchers also created a drug cocktail, consisting of anti-PD-1 antibodies and another antibody called anti-CTLA-4   which also helps T cells attack the cancer cells.  Using a combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 in the microneedle patch, 70 percent of the mice survived and had no detectable melanoma after 40 days,  Wang says.  Because of the sustained and localized release manner, mediated by microneedles, we are able to achieve desirable therapeutic effects with a relatively low dosage, which reduces the risk of auto-immune disorders,  Gu says.  We re excited about this technique, and are seeking funding to pursue further studies and potential clinical translation,  Gu adds.

Over the past eight years, the company has taken steps in a number of areas including tiered pricing, healthcare infrastructure building, data-sharing and innovative partnerships. GSK recognises that improving access around the world requires a flexible and multi-faceted approach to intellectual property (IP) protection. While IP stimulates and underpins continued investment in research and development, GSK believes being flexible with its IP can help address pressing health challenges in developing countries. Building on this perspective, GSK is evolving its graduated approach to filing and enforcing patents so that IP protection reflects a country s economic maturity. For Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Low Income Countries (LICs), GSK will not file patents for its medicines, so as to give clarity and confidence to generic companies seeking to manufacture and supply generic versions of GSK medicines in those countries. For Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) generally, GSK will file for patents but will seek to offer and agree licences to allow supplies of generic versions of its medicines for 10 years. GSK intends to seek a small royalty on sales in those countries. This offer will apply even for those countries that move out of LMIC status due to increased economic growth during this period. For High Income Countries, Upper Middle Income Countries and G20 countries, GSK will continue to seek full patent protection. Any GSK medicines on the WHO s list of essential medicines will be included in these changes. Additionally, GSK outlined its intent to commit its future portfolio of cancer treatments to patent pooling and will explore the concept with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to help address the increasing burden of cancer in developing countries. GSK would be the first company to take this step. Since it was established in 2010, the MPP has been successful in accelerating access to HIV, TB and hepatitis C medicines in Low Income and Middle Income Countries through voluntary licensing arrangements. Expanding this approach to oncology would enable generic versions of GSK s next generation immuno-oncology and epigenetic therapies, currently in clinical development, to be made available in LDCs, LICs and certain middle income countries, if and when they receive regulatory approval. GSK will also work towards making information about its current and future patent portfolio freely available. Sir Andrew Witty, CEO of GSK said:  Intellectual property protection is a vital part of healthcare innovation, providing necessary incentives for investment in research to create new treatments which can help people around the world.  In itself, IP is not a barrier to access to medicines. However, we recognise that the global healthcare challenge requires us to be flexible in our approach and responsive to different needs, particularly as the disease burden shifts from infectious to non-communicable diseases. We continuously look at ways that GSK can further contribute to increasing access to medicines.  The experience GSK has with the Medicines Patent Pool for Tivicay   our newest HIV medicine and one of our most commercially successful products   gives us confidence that increasing access, incentivising innovation appropriately and achieving business success can go hand in hand.  The changes we are setting out aim to make it as clear and simple as possible for generic manufacturers to make and supply versions of GSK medicines in LDCs, LICs and most LMICs.  Changes to patents and IP systems will not solve the multi-faceted challenges of improving healthcare in developing countries. In cancer for example, improving outcomes in developing countries requires better funding, improved screening and diagnosis, more cancer doctors and better hospital services as well as access to treatments. However, we believe the measures outlined today add to the wider contribution GSK makes to improve access to effective healthcare around the world.  Implementation of these proposals will be subject to local laws. GSK will now consult with its licensing and co-development partners on these changes. The UN High Level Panel on Access to Medicines, convened by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, brings together experts from the across the healthcare industry, public health, human rights and legal sectors to consider a broad range of approaches to promote innovation and access to healthcare around the world.","Published: April 1, 2016"

In the Feed the Future South Asia Eggplant Improvement Partnership, Cornell will protect eggplant farmers from yield losses and improve their livelihoods in partnership with the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) and the University of the Philippines at Los Ba os. Eggplant, or brinjal, is a staple crop that is an important source of income and nutrition for farmers and consumers in South Asia.  Because of infestation by the fruit and shoot borer, or FSB, as much as 70 percent of the eggplant crop in South Asia never makes it to market,  said Anthony Shelton, international professor of entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell, who will direct the project.  Farmers in Asia spray hazardous insecticides as often as every other day to control FSB.  Genetically engineered eggplant, or Bt brinjal, has been developed over the last 11 years and uses a gene from a naturally occurring soil bacterium to produce a protein that causes borers to stop feeding.  Bt, or bacillus thuringiensis, is a biological pesticide that organic growers have used for decades,  said Shelton.  Bt brinjal increases food security and reduces the use of insecticides that negatively affects human health and the environment.   Bangladesh faces food shortages, increasing population and decreasing amounts of arable land,  said Dr. Md. Rafiqul Islam Mondal, director general of BARI.  Genetically engineered crops developed under the Feed the Future South Asia Eggplant Improvement Partnership will enhance the quality of life for Bangladeshis by increasing income, improving nutrition and health, and fostering a safer environment.  Over the past decade, Cornell has led the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project II (ABSPII), also funded by USAID, that prompted a consortium of institutions in Asia and Africa to use the tools of modern biotechnology, particularly genetic engineering, to improve crops to address major production constraints for which conventional plant breeding tools have not been effective. According to Shelton, ABSPII s most significant achievement was working with BARI and the Bangladesh government to achieve product authorization of eggplant varieties in that country.  The Feed the Future South Asia Eggplant Improvement Partnership award will help realize the full impact of USAID s preceding years  investment in research and technology development, to facilitate the late-stage development, deregulation, commercialization and dissemination of Bt eggplant to farmers,  said Joe Huesing, USAID senior biotechnology adviser.  The goal is to increase food security and improve environmental quality through supporting the national partners in their efforts to commercialize and adopt genetically engineered eggplant.  In October 2013, Bangladesh became the first country in South Asia to approve commercial cultivation of a genetically engineered food crop. In February 2014, the Bangladesh minister of agriculture released four varieties of Bt brinjal to 20 farmers. With the establishment of the 20 Bt brinjal demonstration plots in 2014 and 104 more in 2015, BARI reported a noticeable decrease in fruit and shoot borer infestation, increased yields, decreased use of pesticide and improved income for farmers.  The performance of Bt brinjal was better than non-Bt brinjal in all districts,  said Mondal. Five additional Bt eggplant varieties are in the pipeline for release in Bangladesh. The Feed the Future South Asia Eggplant Improvement Partnership addresses and integrates all elements of the commercialization process   including technology development, regulation, marketing, seed distribution and product stewardship. It also provides strong platforms for policy development, capacity building, gender equality, outreach and communication.","Published: April 1, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/eating-green-could-be-in-your-genes-193100,Eating Green Could be in Your Genes Genetic variation uncovered that has evolved in populations that have historically favored vegetarian diets  such as in India  Africa and parts of East Asia  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A different version of this gene (called an allele) adapted to a marine diet was discovered among the Inuit in Greenland, who mainly consume seafood. The vegetarian allele evolved in populations that have eaten a plant-based diet over hundreds of generations. The adaptation allows these people to efficiently process omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and convert them into compounds essential for early brain development and controlling inflammation. In populations that live on plant-based diets, this genetic variation provided an advantage and was positively selected in those groups. In Inuit populations of Greenland, the researchers uncovered that a previously identified adaptation is opposite to the one found in long-standing vegetarian populations: While the vegetarian allele has an insertion of 22 bases (a base is a building block of DNA) within the gene, this insertion was found to be deleted in the seafood allele.  The opposite allele is likely driving adaptation in Inuit,  said Kaixiong Ye, co-lead author of the paper appearing March 29 in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. Ye is a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Alon Keinan, associate professor of biological statistics and computational biology, and the paper s co-senior author.  Our study is the first to connect an insertion allele with vegetarian diets, and the deletion allele with a marine diet,  Ye said.  It is the most interesting example of local adaptation that I have been fortunate to help study,  said Keinan.  Several studies have pointed to adaptation in this region of the genome. Our analyses combine to show that the adaptation is driven by an insertion of a small piece of DNA that we know its function. Moreover, when it reached the Greenlandic Inuit, with their marine-based diet rich in omega-3, it might have become detrimental.  FADS1 and FADS2 are enzymes that are essential for converting omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids into downstream products needed for brain development and controlling inflammation. Meat and seafood eaters have less need for increased FADS1 and FADS2 enzymes to get proper nutrition because their omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid conversion process is simpler and requires fewer steps.  This study is based on previous work by co-senior author Tom Brenna, professor of human nutrition and of chemistry, who showed the insertion can regulate the expression of FADS1 and FADS2 and hypothesized it could be an adaptation in vegetarian populations. Ye, Keinan and colleagues analyzed frequencies of the vegetarian allele in 234 primarily vegetarian Indians and 311 U.S. individuals and found the vegetarian allele in 68 percent of the Indians and in just 18 percent of Americans. Analysis using data from the 1,000 Genomes Project similarly found the vegetarian allele in 70 percent of South Asians, 53 percent of Africans, 29 percent of East Asians and 17 percent of Europeans.  Northern Europeans have a long history of drinking milk and they absorbed enough end products from milk for long-chain fatty acid metabolism so they don t have to increase capacity to synthesize those fatty acids from precursors,  said Ye.  One implication from our study is that we can use this genomic information to try to tailor our diet so it is matched to our genome, which is called personalized nutrition,  he added. The researchers are not sure yet when the adaptation first occurred, as analyses of chimpanzee or orangutan genomes did not uncover the vegetarian allele. But there is evidence for the allele in early hominid Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes.  It is possible that in the history of human evolution, when people migrated to different environments, sometimes they ate a plant-based diet and sometimes they ate a marine-based diet, and in different time periods these different alleles were adaptive,  meaning the alleles have a tendency to evolve under dietary pressures, Ye said.","Published: April 1, 2016"

The research, which was led by scientists from Imperial College London, involved the World Health Organization and over 700 researchers across the globe, incorporated measurements of weight and height from nearly 20 million adults in most of the world s countries. The research team has also created interactive maps and other visuals that show the data for each country, and how they compare to each other. The study, published in the journal The Lancet, calculated and compared BMI among adult men and women from 1975 to 2014. BMI is a measure of a person s weight for their height, and indicates whether their weight is healthy. The data revealed that in four decades global obesity among men has tripled - from 3.2% in 1975 to 10.8%. Obesity among women meanwhile has more than doubled, from 6.4 % in 1975 to 14.9% in 2014. This translates as 266 million obese men and 375 million obese women in the world in 2014. It also means the world s population has become heavier by around 1.5kg in each subsequent decade since 1975. In addition, 2.3% of the world s men, and 5% of the world s women are now classed as severely obese, which is defined as having a BMI of over 35 kg/m2. This places an individual at significantly increased risk of conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Analysis of the findings showed more obese men and women now live in China and the USA than in any other country.   However the USA still has the highest number of severely obese men and women in the world. The team predicted if these global trends continue, by 2025 18% of the world s men and 21% of women will be obese. Furthermore, the probability of reaching the World Health Organization global obesity target (which aims for no rise in obesity above 2010 levels by 2025) will be close to zero. Professor Majid Ezzati, the senior author of the study from the School of Public Health at Imperial, said:  The number of people across the globe whose weight poses a serious threat to their health is greater than ever before. And this epidemic of severe obesity is too extensive to be tackled with medications such as blood pressure lowering drugs or diabetes treatments alone, or with a few extra bike lanes. We need coordinated global initiatives   such as looking at the price of healthy food compared to unhealthy food, or taxing high sugar and highly processed foods - to tackle this crisis.  The team also examined the number of people who are underweight in different countries. The results revealed levels have decreased from 14% to 9% in men, and 15% to 10% in women. The percentage of underweight individuals was nonetheless still quite high in countries such as India and Bangladesh, where nearly a quarter of adults are underweight. Professor Ezzati added:  Our research has shown that over 40 years we have transitioned from a world in which underweight prevalence was more than double that of obesity, to one in which more people are obese than underweight. Although it is reassuring that the number of underweight individuals has decreased over the last four decades, global obesity has reached crisis point.  We hope these findings create an imperative to shift responsibility from the individual to Governments, and to develop and implement policies to address obesity. For instance, unless we make healthy food options like fresh fruits and vegetables affordable for everyone, and increase the price of unhealthy processed foods, the situation is unlikely to change.  The findings also showed that:         Japanese men and women had the lowest BMI in the high-income world. Average BMI was higher in English-speaking high-income countries than in non-English speaking high-income countries, with American men and women having the highest BMI of any high-income country.         The lowest BMIs in Europe were among Swiss women and Bosnian men. Men in the UK had the 10th highest BMI in Europe and women the 3rd highest in Europe. Globally, the UK ranked with the 42nd highest BMI for men and 67th highest for women.         The country with the highest average BMI was American Samoa (average BMI of 35 kg/m2 for women and 32 kg/m2 for men), where the average individual is classed as obese.         Morbid obesity, where a person s weight interferes with basic physical functions such as breathing and walking, now affects around 1 % of men in the world, and 2% of women.

In Cell Stem Cell, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco show that the AXL surface receptor, normally involved in cell division, is highly abundant on the surface of neural stem cells, but not on neurons in the developing brain. The neural stem cells that express AXL are only present during the second trimester of pregnancy. These cells, called radial glial cells, give rise to the variety of cell types (e.g., neurons and astrocytes) that help build the cerebral cortex. The researchers also found AXL expressed by the stem cells of the retina. Disruption of this range of cell types is consistent with the multiple symptoms associated with Zika infection in the developing fetus including microcephaly, a brain lacking in folds, and eye lesions. See Also: Fetal cells influence mom's health during pregnancy and long after ""While by no means a full explanation, we believe that the expression of AXL by these cell types is an important clue for how the Zika virus is able to produce such devastating cases of microcephaly, and it fits very nicely with the evidence that's available,"" says senior study author Arnold Kriegstein, director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research. ""AXL isn't the only receptor that's been linked with Zika infection, so next we need to move from 'guilt by association' and demonstrate that blocking this specific receptor can prevent infection."" A developing human brain section. Radial glia are in red, neurons in blue, AXL receptors in green. Credit: Tomasz Nowakowski  Kriegstein's lab has a long-time interest in brain development. When the Zika outbreak hit, first authors Tomasz Nowakowski and Alex Pollen realized from previous studies that viruses similar to Zika such as Dengue virus seem to use AXL as an entry point to infection. They then used gene expression analysis (single-cell RNA sequencing) to look for AXL's presence across different cell types in mouse brain, ferret brain, human stem cell-derived brain organoids, and developing brain tissue in humans. Each of the models showed expression of AXL by the radial glial cells. The researchers then used antibody trackers (immunohistochemistry) in the developing tissues and organoids to find out where the AXL receptor was most likely to be found on the neural stem cells. They found that AXL aggregates toward areas where the neural progenitors come into contact with either cerebrospinal fluid or blood vessels. This unique position would give a virus such as Zika an easy way to reach a vulnerable population of host cells. Learn More: High-normal thyroid hormone level in pregnancy may affect fetal brain development ""We still don't understand why Zika in particular is so virulent to the developing brain,"" Kriegstein says. ""It could be that the virus travels more easily though the placental-fetal barrier or that the virus enters cells more readily than related infections."" Pending confirmation that Zika is using AXL for neural stem cell entry, the Kriegstein group is interested in exploring if the receptor could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Since the protein is important for neural stem cell proliferation, it is unlikely that blocking AXL will be an option in the fetal brain. But perhaps there's a way to treat women at risk with an AXL inhibitor to stop Zika getting into the developing fetus in the first place. Cell PressNowakowski TJ et al.

Tiny devices that enable scientists to observe cell activity and deliver drugs to individual cells promise to revolutionize precision medicine for treatment of diseases such as cancer. One obstacle to fulfilling nanomedicine s promise is the inability to observe cell-to-cell interactions in an environment that closely simulates the dynamic environment inside the body. A micro-fluid environment that mimics blood flow is key to learning how cells become damaged by disease and how they might respond to treatment.   Now a team of researchers at Lehigh and the University of Pennsylvania has developed a technique that uses antibody-coated nanoparticles as imaging probes to watch cell-to-cell interactions under micro-fluid conditions. The researchers have successfully applied the technique to the study of blood vessel inflammation, a condition that sets the stage for heart disease, the number one cause of death in the U.S. and globally. The group published its findings in Biomicrofluidics, a journal of the American Institute of Physics, in an article titled  Biomimetic channel modeling local vascular dynamics of pro-inflammatory endothelial changes.   We have shown that our technique can be successfully applied to the study of inflammation and are working on a way to similarly observe and intervene in the repair of tumor cells,  said Yaling Liu, associate professor of mechanical engineering and mechanics and of bioengineering at Lehigh and a co-author on the study. Mimicking the dynamic transfer process Chronic, low-grade inflammation is strongly associated with dysfunctional endothelial cells, which form the inner lining of blood vessels and are critical in regulating cell-to-cell interaction as part of the body s immune system response. The appearance of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of endothelial cells is a sure sign that inflammation and disease are present. Therefore, observing the activation of endothelial cells under disease conditions is essential to understanding how heart disease develops and how to stop it. The best way to observe these changes is inside the body, but this is difficult. Monitoring the disease in a static cell culture by removing and growing cells in an artificial environment such as a petri dish is limited in its ability to accurately portray the dynamic interactions under blood flow conditions. In addition to Liu, the team from Lehigh includes Linda Lowe-Krentz, professor of biological sciences; H. Daniel Ou-Yang, professor of physics; and Antony Thomas, a Ph.D. candidate in bioengineering. They collaborated with Vladimir R. Muzykantov, professor of pharmacology at Penn, to develop a blood vessel on a chip to study the dynamics of ICAM-1 on the surface of endothelial cells activated under disease conditions.  We were able to mimic and observe the dynamic transfer process that moment when the ICAM-1 antibody-coated nanoparticles bind to the cell signaling inflammation upregulation by endothelial cells on a chip. We were also able to precisely control the flow of fluid,  said Liu.  This reliable and relatively simple method simulates the conditions under which endothelial cells exist in the body, making it possible to observe cellular pathology in real time, and to analyze differences in cells  responses to treatment.  An ideal drug-testing environment Because this new technology creates a platform to focus on a specific diseased region, Liu and his colleagues believe it is ideally suited to testing new disease treatments. Healthy cells exist on the same chip as diseased cells, which allows for more localized control to test a particular drug. This, combined with the simulated blood flow environment, also allows researchers to gather a much more robust data set than they could by using a static culture. The team s use of antibody-coated nanoparticles as imaging probes to assess the characteristics of cells is another key benefit of the new technology. Using the nanoparticle probes eliminates the need to employ radioisotope-labeled ICAM-1 antibodies to track cellular interactions a technique that is fraught with regulatory and safety challenges and is also very expensive.  Our system provides a safer, less cost-prohibitive way to test a new drug in a setting that closely approximates a diseased region s environment,  said Liu. Reducing the risk and cost of trials The team s innovative platform also provides a crucial early look into a new drug s effectiveness and safety a particularly important step considering the risk and expense associated with human clinical trials. A 2012 study submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services detailed the costs of clinical drug trials. The authors of  Examination of Clinical Trial Costs and Barriers for Drug Development  estimated the cost of completing clinical trials for a new drug at $50 to $115 million depending on the therapeutic area with respiratory system and oncology among the most expensive. The study also identified clinical trial costs as a possible reason behind a slowdown in applications for new drug approvals. Between 2003 and 2012, the number of FDA approvals of new drugs per year fell from the previous decade s average of 30 to 25.7. The average yearly number of filings also fell slightly over the same period.  A reduction in the drug application pipeline,  the researchers wrote in Biomicrofluidics,  means fewer novel therapies in future years.  The technology developed by the Lehigh-Penn team gives pharmaceutical companies an early look at the efficacy and safety profile of a new treatment before committing to clinical trials, thus incurring less risk and lower costs. Liu says this early look could act as a  bridge  between the development of a drug and human trials. Ultimately this  bridge  could result in the development of more novel disease treatments that reach consumers more quickly. By directly culturing patient cells in their biomimetic chip and testing under similar conditions observed in vivo, it may provide insights for precision medicine that is tailored to a specific patient under a patient specific environment. Liu and his colleagues have received an NSF Innovation Corps grant and are working with Lehigh s Office of Technology Transfer to commercialize the technology under the company name PharmaFlux. Ira Weisberg, the group s industry mentor and the CEO of Amherst Pharmaceuticals, and Christopher Uhl, a Ph.D. candidate in bioengineering at Lehigh, are helping lead that effort.  As we continue to develop the platform beyond the study of inflammation,  Liu says,  we hope to make a significant contribution to the acceleration of targeted drug delivery and help usher in a new age of better medicine.

Whole exome sequencing is becoming more available to patients and this tool will help them distill the sequencing data to candidate genes and link them with therapies,  says Aik Choon Tan, PhD, investigator at the CU Cancer Center, associate professor of Bioinformatics at the CU School of Medicine, and the paper s senior author. The tool, called Integrating Molecular Profiles with Actionable Therapeutics, or IMPACT, starts with the data generated by whole-exome sequencing   a string of A, T, C and G hundreds of millions of letters long. IMPACT then maps this string onto the human genome to partition the raw data into segments that correspond to the body s approximately 20,000 genes. The tool then compares the code of these genes to  normal  gene patterns to discover which genes differ in ways that could guide the development of cancer. (In a second step, IMPACT also counts the number of gene repeats, which when adjusted higher or lower can also drive the growth of cancer.)  Now we have a list of candidate genes,  Tan says.  The next step is to link candidate genes with therapeutics.  IMPACT does this by mining publicly available data including that of the NCI-MATCH clinical trial and the database at MyCancerGenome.org to discover which FDA-approved therapies target these candidate genes. The Tan lab tested the tool by inputting whole-exome sequencing data for patients known to have EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Sure enough, IMPACT successfully identified the gene EGFR as a driving mutation and recommended FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors. In collaboration with the laboratory of CU Cancer Center investigator William A. Robinson, MD, PhD, Tan and colleagues then used the tool to retrospectively analyze a series of exome-sequences from patients diagnosed with melanoma, validating the tool s ability to discover a patient s activating mutation and pair it with useful treatment.  For example, a patient was found to have a BRAF mutation and was put on a clinical trial of the drug vemurafenib, which targets BRAF alterations,  Tan says. The drug controlled the patient s tumor. However, two years later the tumor relapsed. At this point, the group resequenced the tumor and found that in addition to BRAF mutation, the patient had developed NRAS mutation.  Taking tumor samples over time, we could see the cancer cell figuring out how to become resistant,  Tan says. However, drugs also exist to disrupt cells that depend on NRAS mutation. The combination of dabrafenib (for BRAF) and trametinib (for NRAS) controlled the patient s melanoma for another two years. When the cancer relapsed, it was again resequenced and evaluated using IMPACT. Analysis showed loss of the gene CDKN2a, a known tumor suppressor gene that keeps in check cells that have learned to speed through the process of replication. Currently there are no inhibitors of the CDK family of genes approved by the FDA to treat melanoma. However, the drug palbocicilib recently earned FDA approval to treat a subset of breast cancers.  We are trying to see if we can treat this melanoma with a CDK inhibitor. Will this drug overcome the cancer s resistance to the previous combination?  Tan says. The IMPACT tool works in four steps: 1) identify possible cancer-causing mutations; 2) identify possible cancer-causing gene copy number alterations; 3) match cancer s genetic causes with the most likely therapeutic controls; 4) evaluate the ongoing evolution of cancer to continue matching controls with emerging causes.  We hope that IMPACT proves to be an important tool in empowering the shift toward precision medicine,  Tan says.","Published: March 31, 2016"

""One of the problems with current influenza vaccines is that we have to make predictions about which virus strains will be most prevalent every year and build our vaccines around those predictions,"" said Ted Ross, director of UGA's Center for Vaccines and Immunology and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Infectious Diseases in the College of Veterinary Medicine. ""What we have developed is a vaccine that protects against multiple different strains of H1N1 virus at once, so we might be able to one day replace the current standard of care with this more broadly cross-protective vaccine."" The H1N1 influenza virus caused a worldwide pandemic in 2009. When it was first detected, it was called swine flu because the virus was similar to those found in pigs, but the virus now circulates as a seasonal form of influenza. Using a technique called Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen, or COBRA, UGA researchers Donald Carter, Christopher Darby and Bradford Lefoley, along with Ross, created nine prototype synthetic compound vaccines constructed using genetic sequences from multiple influenza virus strains. The COBRA vaccines were designed to recognize H1N1 viruses isolated within the last 100 years, but many of the experimental vaccines produced immunity against influenza strains not included in the design. This means that scientists may be able to produce a vaccine that not only protects against recognized seasonal and pandemic influenza strains, but also strains that have yet to be discovered. Because this vaccine is generated from the genetic sequences of multiple flu viruses, it may protect against many strains over several years, Ross said. That would also allow for year-round manufacturing of the vaccine, since scientists would not have to halt production every year to identify the most prevalent strains. This research is part of a broader effort to create a universal influenza vaccine, which would protect against all strains of the virus. ""We still have some work to do before we get a truly universal flu vaccine,"" Ross said. ""But the COBRA vaccine we've developed for H1N1 virus subtypes is a major step in the right direction.""","Published: March 31, 2016"

Their discovery has potential implications for muscular dystrophy treatment.  Key research group members include Professor TODA Tatsushi, Associate Professor KANAGAWA Motoi, and Associate Professor KOBAYASHI Kazuhiro from the Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine; Doctor ENDO Tamao, Vice-director from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology; and Doctor WADA Yoshinao, Director of the Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health. Muscular dystrophy is an incurable genetic condition marked by progressive weakening of the muscles. The condition is caused by mutations in the genes responsible for muscle structure and functions. Previous research had revealed three major genes involved in a certain family of muscular dystrophies: fukutin, fukutin-related proteins (FKRP), and isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD). When these three genes do not function correctly, abnormalities occur in the sugar molecules that bind to the dystroglycan protein on the surface of muscle cells. However, until now the exact composition of the sugar molecules and the role of these genes was unclear. Professor Toda s research group succeeded in creating a sugar molecule in a cell culture. Using mass spectrometric analysis, they calculated the mass of each component in the sugar molecule and identified an unusual sugar unit called  ribitol 5-phosphate . The group went on to discover that three causative genes of muscular dystrophy (ISPD, fukutin, and FKRP) are all involved in creating this sugar unit. In a patient cell model with each of these three genes removed, ribitol 5-phosphate was also absent, proving that the abnormal synthesis of ribitol 5-phosphate is a cause of the condition. When CDP-ribitol, one of the ingredients for ribitol 5-phosphate, was added to the cell model, the abnormalities in the sugar molecule were resolved. The sugar unit ribitol 5-phosphate was previously only confirmed in bacteria and some plants, so the researchers were surprised to discover that in mammals it functions as a component of sugar-protein interactions. They suggest that the sugar unit also has a key role in embryonic tissue development. Abnormalities in its combination with proteins could cause cancer metastasis and viral infection as well as muscular dystrophy.  Sugar molecules play a key role in many biological processes, but their composition is difficult to determine and research on them is still limited , said Professor Toda.  The decoding of this sugar molecule has implications for the field of life sciences, as well as being a step further in the treatment of muscular dystrophy .","Published: March 31, 2016"

Competition with low cost suppliers is challenging, yet, again, represents an opportunity for Western suppliers to continue to drive operational efficiency through continuous improvement activities within a controlled and regulated environment in order to be competitive,  commented Ian Muir, managing director of Aesica Pharmaceuticals.  Overall consolidation of contract partners expands capabilities, and allows for greater control of the supply chain,  he added. Some pharma ingredient manufacturers have observed a trend towards companies preferring to have ingredients manufactured at locations in the West, because of quality issues in some low cost markets recently and the rising costs of production there. This trend varies according to the phase of development.  When introducing new products to the market, companies tend to favour Western suppliers in order to mitigate risk. This trend differs in relation to compounds which are more advanced in the product life cycle such as generic compounds where there is more evidence of healthy competition between the East and the West,  Ian Muir remarked.

Childhood cancer is largely a genetic disease, although its pattern of inheritance is not always clearly defined. It is these genetic mechanisms of susceptibility that are the focus of research for the Cancer Genetics Program at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, Canada. Research within the Cancer Genetics Program is wide ranging. It includes identifying and studying genes associated with childhood cancer risk; analyzing molecular and cell biology pathways associated with development and progression of cancers; identifying molecules that might represent viable targets for novel drug therapies; and developing practical applications of genetic testing of children and families at risk. It receives more than 190 new referrals each year and to date has consulted on over 1200 families. Individuals with mutations in the TP53 gene, a condition known as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), are one particular focus of the Cancer Genetics Program. LFS sufferers are predisposed to a wide spectrum of cancers that often develop when they are children. TP53 mutations are also found in women who have developed breast cancer under age 30. Many people with LFS will be diagnosed with cancer two or more times during their lifetime. Nardin Samuel, an MD/PhD candidate at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto working at the Hospital for Sick Children, Genetics and Genome Biology, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, is using Qlucore s Omics Explorer in her PhD work focusing on the epigenetics of LFS cancers. Epigenetics is the study of the chemical reactions that activate and deactivate specific parts of living organism s the genome as it develops and the factors that influence these reactions. It provides insight into regulatory mechanisms that influence gene expression changes, affording the opportunity to study dynamic cellular processes beyond the genome. Epigenetic analysis of LFS provides a unique avenue to study this syndrome since the causative genetic aberration is well identified, according to Samuel. A wide range of data Samuel is studying a range of samples including DNA from patient blood, primary tissue from tumours, and patient cell lines. Cell lines are from lymphoid cells or blood-derived cells or fibroblast cell lines taken from skin biopsies. Various sequencing approaches are applied to understand how cells are primed to transform and become malignant and in particular, how they can be targeted therapeutically.  We are doing genetic sequencing, RNA and microRNA analysis, and also experiments in tissue culture in which we are manipulating various genes within the cells lines and analysing their properties,  explains Samuel. She and her colleagues are dealing with a variety of types and sizes of datasets. Omics Explorer is particularly useful for genome-wide differential methylation analyses, she says. Excellent visualization tools  The strength of the Qlucore software is being able to conduct and validate statistical analyses and also produce a variety of visualizations,  explains Samuel.  It has excellent visualization tools that can make very nice depictions of the data and heat maps.

Understanding the structure of this enzyme, separase, could lead to better treatments for cancer, which occurs when cells divide out of control, said Dr. Hongtao Yu, Professor of Pharmacology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator at UT Southwestern.  Chromosomes contain the genetic blueprint for life, and must be precisely duplicated and equally partitioned during each cell division. The cohesin complex forms a molecular ring to encircle the duplicated chromosomes and tether them together until the moment of chromosome separation,  said Dr. Yu, senior author of the study published online in Nature.  In organisms from fungi to humans, separase   an enzyme that breaks down proteins   cleaves and opens the cohesin ring to allow chromosome separation and subsequent partition into the two new daughter cells.  Despite its central role in cell biology, the atomic structure of separase has eluded scientists since its discovery nearly two decades ago. This situation left a void in the understanding of the enzyme s mechanism and regulation, the researchers said.  We determined the atomic structure of separase from a fungus that can grow at high temperatures. The structure reveals how separase recognizes and cleaves the cohesin ring, allowing the chromosomes to separate,  said Dr. Yu, a Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Medical Research and member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern.  This particular protein is very unstable in species that grow at normal temperature, such as human body temperature, but was more stable in the high-temperature fungus that we studied.  Because of the enzyme s role in cell division, chemical inhibitors of separase are expected to block cell proliferation and therefore may have therapeutic value in treating cancer.  The fungal separase that we studied is very similar to human separase. For that reason, we believe our structure will aid in the design of such inhibitors,  he said,  because once you have the shape of the structure, you can computationally look for molecules that will bind to it.  Study co-authors included Dr. Zhonghui Lin, a research specialist at the HHMI and in the Department of Pharmacology, and Dr. Xuelian  Sue  Luo, Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Biophysics. This study was supported by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), the National Institutes of Health, and the Welch Foundation. The Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Texas and one of just 45 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation.

Could your mind be playing tricks on you? The ""tricks"" might be your brain reacting to feedback between neurons in different parts of the visual system, according to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience by Carnegie Mellon University Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences Sandra J. Kuhlman and colleagues. See Also:  Brain balances perception and action when caught in an illusion Understanding this feedback system could provide new insight into the visual system's neuronal circuitry and could have further implications for understanding how the brain interprets and understands sensory stimuli. Many optical illusions make you see something that's not there. Take the Kanizsa triangle: when you place three Pac-Man-like wedges in the right spot, you see a triangle, even though the edges of the triangle aren't drawn. ""We see with both our brain and our eyes. Your brain is making inferences that allow you to see the triangle. It's connecting the dots between the corners of the wedges,"" said Kuhlman, who is a member of Carnegie Mellon's BrainHub neuroscience initiative and the joint Carnegie Mellon/University of Pittsburgh Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. ""Optical illusions illustrate some of the amazing things our visual system can do."" When we look at an object, information about what we see travels through circuits of neurons beginning in the retina, through the thalamus and into the brain's visual cortex. In the visual cortex, the information gets processed in multiple stages and is ultimately sent to the prefrontal cortex the area of the brain that makes decisions, including how to respond to a given stimulus. Related: Brain scan reveals out-of-body illusion However, not all information stays on this forward moving path. At the secondary stage of processing in the visual cortex some neurons reverse course and send information back to the first stage of processing. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon wondered if this feedback could change how the neurons in the visual cortex respond to a stimulus and alter the messages being sent to the prefrontal cortex. While there has been a good deal of research studying how information moves forward through the visual system, less has been done to study the impact of the information that moves backward. To find out if the information traveling from the secondary stage of processing back to the first stage impacted how information is encoded in the visual system, the researchers needed to quantify the magnitude of information that was being sent from the second stage back to the first stage. Using a mouse model, they recorded normal neuronal firing in the first stage of the visual cortex as the mouse looked at moving patterns that represented edges. They then silenced the neurons in the second stage using modified optogenetic technology. This halted the feedback of information from the second stage back to the first stage, and allowed the researchers to determine how much of the neuronal activity in the first stage of visual processing was the result of feedback. Learn More: Scientists create the sensation of invisibility Twenty percent of the neuronal activity in the visual cortex was the result of feedback, a concept Kuhlman calls reciprocal connectivity. This indicates that some of the information coming from the visual cortex is not a direct response to a visual stimuli, but is a response to how the stimuli was perceived by higher cortical areas. The feedback, she says, might be what causes our brain to complete the undrawn lines in the Kanizsa triangle. But more importantly, it signifies that studying neuronal feedback is important to our understanding of how the brain works to process stimuli. ""This represents a new way to study visual perception and neural computation. If we want to truly understand the visual pathway, and cortical function in general, we have to understand these reciprocal connection,"" Kuhlman said.

Now, a team from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania has discovered the molecular mechanism that underlies this common cerebrovascular disease. They published their results this week online ahead of print in Nature. See Also: Compounded outcomes associated with comorbid Alzheimer's disease & cerebrovascular disease CCM disease, which occurs in about one in 100 to 200 people, can present in two forms. One is sporadic, accounting for 80 percent of cases, and is most frequent in older individuals. The remaining 20 percent are familial, inherited cases. These patients present with a large number of lesions and more severe symptoms that arise in much younger individuals. CCM disease is a progressive disorder, and the standard of care remains surgical removal of the most dangerous lesions and symptom management. When CCM was first identified as a genetic disease, mutations in one of two copies of three genes were identified in human patients. The proteins encoded by these genes were found to bind each other in a single complex, but this complex lacks intrinsic enzyme activity and how its loss results in vascular disease and why this vascular disease arises so specifically in the brain has remained unknown.  Despite all we know about CCMs, how loss of the CCM complex causes disease remains controversial, with numerous downstream signaling pathways and processes proposed to play roles,  said senior author Mark Kahn, MD, the Edward S. Cooper, MD/Norman Roosevelt and Elizabeth Meriwether McLure Professor in the department of Medicine. An important clue to disease pathogenesis was discovered while studying vertebrate heart development, when the Kahn lab found that CCM proteins in endothelial cells control the activity of the enzyme MEKK3 and a downstream gene expression program that is essential for the embryonic heart to properly develop. For the Nature study, the Kahn lab investigated whether a conserved mechanism might also underlie the formation of CCM lesions in the postnatal brain. Using a neonatal mouse model of CCM disease, they found that expression of MEKK3 target genes, KLF2 and KLF4, was increased in the cells of newly formed CCM lesions.  From there we were able to demonstrate that partial, endothelial-specific loss of the genes for MEKK3, KLF2, or KLF4 completely rescues lesion formation and prevents the mice from dying due to CCM disease,  Kahn said. Consistent with these findings in mice discovered by co-first author and doctoral student Zinan Zhou, the team also demonstrated that expression of KLF2 and KLF4 is elevated in vessel-lining cells from human familial and sporadic CCM lesions. Studies by co-first author Alan Tang, an MD-PhD student, also in the Kahn lab, further revealed that a previously identified disease-causing human CCM2 mutation confers the disease by preventing the CCM protein complex from interacting with its signaling target MEKK3.  Our studies conclusively identify that increased MEKK3 signaling and over-expression of KLF2 and KLF4 transcription factors are the molecular basis for CCM,  Kahn said. Because the KLFs are MEKK3 targets, higher MEKK3 activity means higher KLF gene expression. Analysis of single endothelial cells in lesions removed from the brains of patients with familial CCM revealed the presence of a  second hit,  indicating that CCM lesions arise when endothelial cells become deficient in a CCM protein. Sporadic CCM has been thought to be the same disease as familial CCM because the brain lesions appear similar, but molecular and genetic data to support this idea have been sparse. Using antibodies that stain for KLF2 and KLF4, the Kahn lab also demonstrated that familial and sporadic CCM lesions arise due to the same molecular pathology, and therefore should be amenable to the same therapeutic strategies. Learn More: Study examines association between small-vessel disease, Alzheimer pathology The pathology of CCM disease pertains to an adaptor protein complex, which bring proteins together in the right place at the right time to transmit a molecular signal.  Its job is as a go between,  Kahn said.  It s a tool to make two other tools work, so it has been difficult to pinpoint its exact function and virtually impossible to design a therapeutic strategy to prevent CCM formation in patients.  The discovery that familial and sporadic CCMs both arise due to endothelial gain of MEKK3-KLF2/4 signaling may open the door for new therapies designed to block the activity of these proteins. In addition, the Kahn lab is actively investigating which KLF2/4 target genes may be responsible for creating CCM lesions. Parallel studies in the developing heart identified a critical role for ADAMTS enzyme, which degrade versican, a related CCM disease substance that is also highly expressed in the brain.  The present study demonstrates versican degradation surrounding the earliest CCM lesions, suggesting that this may also be a critical step in CCM pathogenesis and an important future therapeutic target,  Kahn said.

The study, reported in the journal Neuroscience, found that amphetamine leads to changes in dopamine signaling. Dopamine plays a role in memory, attention, learning and feelings of pleasure. See Also: What drives an adolescent to abuse alcohol? ""The dopamine system, which continues to develop throughout adolescence and young adulthood, is a primary target of psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine,"" said University of Illinois psychology professor Joshua Gulley, who led the new research. ""Changes in dopamine function in response to repeated drug exposure are likely to contribute to the behavioral consequences addiction and relapse, for example that abusers experience."" Parallels between rat and human development make rats a worthy model for the study of human drug addiction, which often begins in adolescence, Gulley said. ""Rats exhibit many of the characteristics that human adolescents do. They tend to be more impulsive than adult rats; they tend to make more risky decisions,"" he said. They also can engage in ""addiction-like behaviors,"" he said. ""They show increased drug use in response to stress,"" Gulley said. ""And, just as in humans, there is evidence that animals that start using drugs in adolescence are more likely to relapse than animals that start in adulthood."" A limitation of the new study was that, unlike humans, who generally choose whether or not to partake in drug use, ""the rats had no say in whether they got amphetamine,"" Gulley said. A previous study from Gulley and his colleagues looked at the effects of amphetamine abuse on working memory the ability to retain information just long enough to use it in young and adult rats. Related: How kids' brain structures grow as memory develops ""In that study, we found that animals that were exposed to the drug during adolescence had much more significant deficits in working memory than those exposed during adulthood,"" Gulley said. The researchers hypothesized that drug exposure during adolescence, a time of vast changes in the brain, ""somehow influences the normal developmental trajectory,"" Gulley said. ""But how?"" To get at this question, the team focused on the prefrontal cortex, a brain region behind the forehead that is among the last to fully develop during adolescence. The researchers found that repeated exposure to amphetamine beginning in adulthood or in adolescence reduced the ability of key cells in the rats' prefrontal cortex to respond to dopamine. In this part of the brain, dopamine influences ""inhibitory tone,"" telling cells to stop responding to a stimulus, Gulley said. ""Inhibition in the nervous system is just as important as activation,"" he said. ""You need cells that are firing and communicating with one another, but you also need cells to stop communicating with one another at certain times and become quiet. ""Our research suggests that a subtype of dopamine receptor, the D1 receptor, is altered following amphetamine exposure,"" Gulley said. ""It's either not responding to dopamine or there are not as many of these receptors after exposure as there used to be."" Learn More: Substance abuse reduces brain volume in women but not men This change in dopamine signaling persisted for 14 weeks after exposure to amphetamine in the adolescent-exposed rats, he said. ""That's akin to a change in humans that persists from adolescence until sometime in their 30s, long after drug use stopped,"" he said. ""Along with other studies, this shows pretty clear evidence that drug use during adolescence, a time when the brain is still developing, has extremely long-lasting consequences that go far beyond the last drug exposure,"" Gulley said.

Their discovery has potential implications for muscular dystrophy treatment. Key research group members include Professor TODA Tatsushi, Associate Professor KANAGAWA Motoi, and Associate Professor KOBAYASHI Kazuhiro from the Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine; Doctor ENDO Tamao, Vice-director from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology; and Doctor WADA Yoshinao, Director of the Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health. Muscular dystrophy is an incurable genetic condition marked by progressive weakening of the muscles. The condition is caused by mutations in the genes responsible for muscle structure and functions. Previous research had revealed three major genes involved in a certain family of muscular dystrophies: fukutin, fukutin-related proteins (FKRP), and isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD). When these three genes do not function correctly, abnormalities occur in the sugar molecules that bind to the dystroglycan protein on the surface of muscle cells. However, until now the exact composition of the sugar molecules and the role of these genes was unclear. Professor Toda s research group succeeded in creating a sugar molecule in a cell culture. Using mass spectrometric analysis, they calculated the mass of each component in the sugar molecule and identified an unusual sugar unit called  ribitol 5-phosphate . The group went on to discover that three causative genes of muscular dystrophy (ISPD, fukutin, and FKRP) are all involved in creating this sugar unit. In a patient cell model with each of these three genes removed, ribitol 5-phosphate was also absent, proving that the abnormal synthesis of ribitol 5-phosphate is a cause of the condition. When CDP-ribitol, one of the ingredients for ribitol 5-phosphate, was added to the cell model, the abnormalities in the sugar molecule were resolved. The sugar unit ribitol 5-phosphate was previously only confirmed in bacteria and some plants, so the researchers were surprised to discover that in mammals it functions as a component of sugar-protein interactions. They suggest that the sugar unit also has a key role in embryonic tissue development. Abnormalities in its combination with proteins could cause cancer metastasis and viral infection as well as muscular dystrophy.  Sugar molecules play a key role in many biological processes, but their composition is difficult to determine and research on them is still limited , said Professor Toda.  The decoding of this sugar molecule has implications for the field of life sciences, as well as being a step further in the treatment of muscular dystrophy .","Published: March 30, 2016"

The dual web/desktop user interface provides the level of flexibility needed to accommodate most requirements. The well-established enterprise deployment model sees the software installed on the customer s own server, for a one-off perpetual licence fee with data also held on the customer s server(s), usually behind a corporate-wide firewall for maximum data security. This is particularly popular in highly data-sensitive industries such as medical diagnostics and pharmaceuticals, where the potential cost of data loss would be immeasurable. For customers who prefer to spread the purchase costs using an operational budget rather than the one-off fee capital expenditure, there has been a lot of interest in Cloud-based LIMS, with data also being stored on Cloud-based servers. To meet this requirement, Autoscribe can arrange for Matrix Gemini to be hosted on tried and tested specialist third party servers, typically spreading the cost with a quarterly on-going licence fee.  Autoscribe Informatics Managing Director, John Boother, commented:  The latter model has the benefit of reducing the upfront costs for the software, and if data is also stored in the Cloud, there are no in-house LIMS-related costs associated with IT infrastructure and support.

The study helps researchers understand how the brain controls our appetite for salt, and how it impacts on blood pressure levels. The findings suggest it could soon be possible to offer heart disease patients a medicine that helps them manage their salt intake and curb the adverse effects of high blood pressure. Genetic drive for salt Scientists modified mice to remove a gene in a small number of cells in the mouse brain.

When the saltwater was removed their blood pressure returned to normal.

Seed dormancy gives way to germination; the young plant emerges and grows; and finally in the climax of flowering, a new generation of seeds is produced. It s remarkably predictable, but the genetics that coordinates these changes with environmental cues has not been well understood. In a recent study of lettuce and the model plant Arabidopsis, researchers at the UC Davis Seed Biotechnology Center and in China show for the first time that a gene known to direct the depth of seed dormancy and the timing of germination also influences flowering. The study further suggests that the gene does this by influencing production of certain microRNAs   tiny snippets of genetic material that govern transition from one phase of the plant s life cycle to another. The findings, which have important implications for the $1.9 billion annual U.S. lettuce crop, will be reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  It appears that the  Delay of Germination 1,  or DOG1, gene is an environmental sensor, detecting environmental changes and enabling the plant to not only keep the seed dormant but to also delay flowering,  said study co-author Kent Bradford, a plant scientist and director of the Seed Biotechnology Center.  This gene could be a particularly valuable tool as climate change shifts our growing seasons and we are forced to develop plants that can adapt to those environmental changes,  Bradford said. Germination and flowering Annual flowering plants match their life cycles    especially seed germination and flowering   to the appropriate season. If a flowering plant germinates too early, the seedling might appear before temperatures are warm enough for the plant to survive. Such coordination of life cycles and environmental conditions is equally important for cultivated crops. An entire lettuce crop can be lost if the plants respond to early warm temperatures and  bolt,  producing flowers and seeds before marketable heads of lettuce have formed. In the new study, the researchers found that suppressing the DOG1 gene in lettuce or Arabidopsis decreased the levels of one microRNA and increased levels of another. As a result, seeds germinated at higher temperatures, and the plants flowered earlier than normal.  This provides evidence of a molecular genetic mechanism that is at work, coordinating adaptation of seed dormancy and flowering traits in the plants to accommodate environmental conditions,  said study co-author Heqiang  Alfred  Huo, a postdoctoral researcher in the Bradford lab.  Our results also suggest that the period between seed dormancy and seed germination is a distinct phase in the plant s lifecycle and that this phase appears to be influenced by the same microRNA systems that govern the plant s maturation and flowering stages,  Huo said.","Published: March 30, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/frackings-impact-on-drinking-water-sources-194915,Fracking s Impact on Drinking Water Sources A case study of a small Wyoming town reveals that practices common in the fracking industry may have widespread impacts on drinking water resources  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Only one industry is allowed to inject toxic chemicals into underground sources of drinking water   hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" Concerns about this practice have riled the U.S. political landscape and communities around the country, perhaps nowhere more so than in Pavillion, Wyoming, population 231. A new study by Stanford finds for the first time that fracking operations near Pavillion have had clear impact to underground sources of drinking water. The research paints a picture of unsafe practices including the dumping of drilling and production fluids containing diesel fuel, high chemical concentrations in unlined pits and a lack of adequate cement barriers to protect groundwater. The well field has gone through several corporate hands since the 1960s, but various fracking operators have used acid and hydraulic fracturing treatments at the same depths as water wells in the area. ""This is a wake-up call,"" said lead author Dominic DiGiulio, a visiting scholar at Stanford School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences. ""It's perfectly legal to inject stimulation fluids into underground drinking water resources. This may be causing widespread impacts on drinking water resources."" ""Decades of activities at Pavillion put people at risk. These are not best practices for most drillers,"" said co-authorRob Jackson, the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor at the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences. As part of the so-called frackwater they inject into the ground, drilling companies use proprietary blends that can include potentially dangerous chemicals such as benzene and xylene. When the wastewater comes back up after use, it often includes those and a range of potentially dangerous natural chemicals. ""There are no rules that would stop a company from doing this anywhere else,"" said Jackson, who is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and at the Precourt Institute for Energy. The study, based on publically available records and documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, is part of Jackson's ongoing research on shallow fracking and its impact on groundwater. He and his colleagues have done various studies across the United States and in the Pavillion Field, an area of Wyoming's Wind River Basin pocked by more than 180 oil and gas wells, some of them plugged and abandoned. Back in 2008, the residents of Pavillion complained of a foul taste and odor in their drinking water and questioned whether it was related to physical ailments. In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a preliminary report putting the tiny town at the center of a growing fracking debate. The EPA report, which linked shallow fracking to toxic compounds in aquifers, was met with heavy criticism from the drilling industry as well as state oil and gas regulators. Three years later, having never finalized its findings, EPA turned its investigation over to Wyoming. The state released a series of reports without firm conclusions, and, as of last month, has said it has no firm plans to take further action. In the meantime, the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has advised area residents to avoid bathing, cooking or drinking with water from their taps. The new Stanford study goes a step beyond the 2011 EPA report to document not only the occurrence of fracking chemicals in underground sources of drinking water but also their impact on that water that is making it unsafe for use. The ripple effect goes well beyond Pavillion. ""Geologic and groundwater conditions at Pavillion are not unique in the Rocky Mountain region,"" said DiGiulio. ""This suggests there may be widespread impact to underground sources of drinking water as a result of unconventional oil and gas extraction."" To avoid what happened in Pavillion, Jackson and DiGiulio suggest further investigation and regulations to limit shallow fracking and require deeper protective casings. Wyoming does not require the cementing of surface casings, and only two U.S. states, Colorado and Texas, have special requirements for shallow hydraulic fracturing. Safeguards mean little, however, if they are not enforced   something the EPA has done a mixed job with, according to Jackson.

Bloomberg and more than a dozen additional supporters of this initiative. Embracing the vice president s  moonshot  initiative to cure cancer, the new Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy was founded with gifts from Michael R. Bloomberg, philanthropist, entrepreneur and three-term mayor of New York City, and Jones Apparel Group founder Sidney Kimmel, who each contributed $50 million. An additional $25 million for the center is thanks to more than a dozen additional supporters.  Immunotherapy is a central element of the Obama administration s new moonshot to cure cancer. It has the potential to cure and end all forms of cancer, which makes it one of the most promising avenues of cancer research today. Currently the most rapidly advancing approach to cancer treatment, immunotherapy seeks to redirect patients  highly individual immune systems to target, detect and destroy cancer cells.  The institute will further strengthen Johns Hopkins  world-class program in cancer immunology, uniting the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center experts with the immunology, genetics, microbiology and biomedical engineering experts throughout Johns Hopkins in a concentrated effort involving over 100 scientists and clinicians.    We are at the forefront of an emerging and promising field of cancer research and treatment,  said Paul Rothman, M.D., dean and CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine.  We are grateful for these tremendous gifts which will help us accelerate the already rapid pace of discoveries in immunotherapy.  How Funds Will Be Used While funds for the new institute will primarily support research, they also will be used to recruit additional scientists; provide additional infrastructure for engineering cellular products related to immunotherapy research; enhance partnerships with the private sector, including biotech and pharma; and invest in critical technology development, such as new ways to profile the immune response inside the tumor. Research at the institute will focus particularly on melanoma, colon, pancreatic, urologic, lung, breast and ovarian cancers.   According to Drew Pardoll, M.D., Ph.D., the institute s inaugural director,  We believe the focused and collaborative research made possible through the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy will advance immunotherapies to the point where the immune system will ultimately be able to beat 100 percent of cancers. The potential to control or cure even the most advanced, treatment-resistant cancers has been elusive until now.  Bloomberg and Kimmel: A History of Support for Health Funding  Sidney Kimmel and Michael Bloomberg each have a long history of support for Johns Hopkins.  Bloomberg, a 1964 alumnus of The Johns Hopkins University and chairman of its board of trustees from 1996 to 2002, has given more than $1.2 billion to the university and the Johns Hopkins Health System since graduating. Funding from Bloomberg has contributed to a physics building, a school of public health, a children s hospital, a stem cell research institute, a malaria institute and a library wing. He has also financed 20 percent of all need-based financial aid grants to undergraduates, with over 2,000 scholarships committed over the next several years. Announced in January 2013, Bloomberg committed an additional $250 million to recruit 50 faculty members as Bloomberg Distinguished Professors. The majority of this gift is dedicated to creating 50 new interdisciplinary professorships, galvanizing people, resources, research and educational opportunities to address major world problems.    Ending all cancer would rank among humanity s greatest achievements, and immunotherapy is bringing that dream within reach. This new institute will build on the pioneering work that doctors and researchers at Johns Hopkins have done in immunotherapy and help fuel new advances and discoveries. It s an honor to join Vice President Biden in the moonshot effort he s leading to end cancer and also to partner with Sidney Kimmel, whose generous and committed support for cancer research is saving lives,  says Bloomberg. Since 2001, Kimmel has contributed $157 million; in recognition of that generosity, Johns Hopkins named its cancer center after him. Kimmel also has given an additional $2.4 million to support 12 young cancer scientists at Johns Hopkins as part of his national Kimmel Scholars Program.  I could not be more honored to partner with Mike Bloomberg and capture the opportunity to advance immunotherapy research at this critical moment,  Kimmel says.  Having been committed to cancer research for more than 20 years, it simply thrills me to know that the scientists at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center see a new light at the end of the tunnel.     Michael Bloomberg and Sidney Kimmel are visionaries,  says Ronald J. Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University.  Their philanthropy has already fostered remarkable innovation throughout Johns Hopkins, transforming the landscape of public health and cancer research. The new Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute builds on that legacy, giving us the latitude to dream big as we accelerate our efforts to end all forms of cancer.  The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, based in Baltimore, Maryland, is one of 45 centers designated by the National Cancer Institute as a comprehensive center.

RIX is a significant clinical problem for which there is no effective current treatment. The trial is a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, single centre, parallel group study. Patients will be randomised to receive Visco-ease or placebo, both of which will be delivered via a spray device specially developed for use in the oncology setting. The study expects to recruit 35 patients. The primary end-point of the study is to quantify the effectiveness of Visco-ease when compared to placebo in ameliorating dry mouth as assessed by the Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia questionnaire (GRIX). The secondary endpoints of the study focus on the safety of Visco-ease. The results of the study are expected to be reported in H2 2016. The study is sponsored by the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board as part of NHS Scotland. An ex vivo study, also conducted at the Beatson, which was published in the journal of Supportive Care in Cancer, showed that Visco-ease was able to restore the functional properties of RIX saliva taken from patients undergoing radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer. Chief Investigator, Dr Claire Paterson of the Beatson, said:  We are extremely pleased and excited to start this study. There is a clear need for a new effective treatment for RIX, which has a very significant impact on the health and quality of life of patients undergoing radiotherapy. The positive results we achieved with Visco-ease in the ex vivo study we undertook last year, makes us hopeful that this novel product could be a major breakthrough in the treatment of RIX, something that we and other cancer centres around the world have been looking for.  Alec McLean, the CEO of Lamellar Biomedical, said:  We would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Beatson Cancer Centre and NHS Scotland for their encouragement and support in starting our first ever clinical study with Visco-ease. I am looking forward to the results of the study as we develop Visco?ease as an important advance in the treatment of RIX paving the way for its commercial launch in 2016. The results of this clinical trial are expected to lead to Visco-ease gaining CE Mark approval in the second half of 2016, allowing the product to be commercialised in Europe .","Published: March 30, 2016"

Plasticell has used its proprietary Combinatorial Cell Culture  (CombiCult ) platform to develop inexpensive, high-efficiency gene transduction protocols as alternatives to costly commercial transfection reagents currently used in gene therapy trials. Sphere Fluidics has developed high throughput single cell manipulation and screening technology in picoliter volumes. The two partners aim to combine their technologies to develop quantitatively accurate gene transduction systems with improved efficiency, safety and cost savings. Plasticell s CombiCult  technology has long been established as the industry-leading screening technology for stem cell differentiation, but has also found numerous applications throughout the biopharma value chain. Examples in which Plasticell is collaborating with partners to improve manufacturing of therapeutic products include in cell bioprocessing, cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy.  A leading gene therapy approach involves the insertion of therapeutic genes into the genome of cells outside the body, followed by the administration of these cells into the patients to deliver the therapeutic gene product,  said Dr Aaron Chuang, Plasticell s CSO.  The efficiency, safety and cost of this process need to be optimized to ensure therapeutic efficacy, to mitigate potential adverse events such as insertional mutagenesis and to improve the cost-effectiveness of gene therapies.   Sphere Fluidics  technology can potentially improve the current way of cell transduction andtransfection. Our well controlled high-throughput approach can address some of the bottlenecks and risks of the cell manufacturing workflows. We are very keen to collaborate with Plasticell to investigate those issues, to optimize gene insertion processes and ultimately to improve the cell therapy efficacy,  added Dr Marian Rehak, Sphere Fluidics  Director of R&D.","Published: March 30, 2016"

Attempts to fend off viruses causing even the common cold or flu have failed, and new viral outbreaks such as dengue, Ebola or Zika continue to elude drugs. Given these challenges, a group at Stanford is tackling the problem from a different angle: boosting the human body's ability to resist the virus rather than taking on the virus directly. This approach has paid off with a drug that, in cells in a lab dish at least, helps fight two disease-causing viruses and potentially many more.  Chaitan Khosla, a professor of chemistry and of chemical engineering who was one of the senior authors on the paper, said the way the drug works suggests that it could be broadly effective against viruses that use RNA rather than DNA as their genetic material. ""Most of the really nasty viruses use RNA,"" Khosla said, including Ebola, dengue, Zika and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), a mosquito-borne virus that infects horses but can also kill people. Khosla cautioned that at this stage the team has only shown that the drug is effective in a lab dish and on certain viruses. They plan to test their strategy in animals next to learn whether it is safe and to understand which viral diseases it is most effective against. A new strategy This project came about when Jeffrey Glenn, an associate professor of medicine and of microbiology and immunology, founded the ViRX@Stanford center through a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in collaboration with Stanford ChEM-H, which Khosla directs. The center's goal is to develop antiviral strategies targeting human cells rather than the virus. Scientists typically take a ""one drug, one bug"" approach to fighting viruses. Glenn's center, however, has a goal of ""one drug, multiple bugs."" The team had known about a drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline that appeared to work along these lines, helping human cells fight viruses. However, after a few initial publications the drug got shelved. Khosla thought that with the help of collaborations formed through Glenn's new center, it might be possible to understand the drug's mechanism and possibly improve upon it, resurrecting the drug from the shelves and delivering it to patients. Chemistry graduate student Richard Deans started testing that drug on human cells in a lab dish and found that it enabled the cells to fight off viruses that cause either dengue or VEEV, both of which normally kill the cells. These viruses were chosen because they represent a serious threat to human health, and also represent two different classes of RNA viruses and would test the drug's breadth, according to Jan Carette, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology and an author on the paper. Although the drug was effective at fighting the viruses, Deans found that over time the drug also caused the human cells to stop dividing. Unexpected insights As a first step to improving on the drug, Deans needed to figure out how it worked. For that, he turned to Michael Bassik, assistant professor of genetics and a senior author on the paper. Bassik, who is also member of Stanford Bio-X and ChEM-H, had developed a powerful new way of screening every gene in a cell to identify which proteins those genes produce to carry out a particular behavior, like responding to a drug. From this screen, the team learned that the drug interferes with a protein that is crucial for making the individual building blocks of RNA, the genetic code for the virus. Without RNA the virus can't make more of itself, which explains why the drug was so effective. However, because of the way the screen was designed, it also revealed two important additional details that the team wouldn't have otherwise known: why the drug doesn't work perfectly and why it causes cells to stop dividing. That information gave the team a way of reducing the drug's side effects and also suggested a way of making it more effective. ""The genome-wide screen carried out in the Bassik lab was really powerful, because it gave us insights into future research strategies,"" said Deans, who was lead author on the paper. ""I think going forward his strategy will be much more heavily used."" Cells also need RNA, and can get RNA building blocks in two ways   by making them or by importing them from the bloodstream. The drug blocked the cell's ability to make the RNA building blocks but left intact the cell's ability to import them. Without disrupting both pathways, some RNA precursors made it into the cell and were available to the virus. Ays e  kesli, a joint postdoctoral fellow in the Bassik and Khosla labs, said the team is now testing their drug along with another one that is known to block the import pathway to see if the combination is more effective than one drug alone, and to be sure human cells aren't damaged by the absence of RNA building blocks. Less toxic Knowing how the drug worked also explained why it caused the body's normal, healthy cells to stop dividing. The same building blocks needed for RNA synthesis are also needed to make DNA, the cell's genetic code that it replicates with each division to carry out business as usual. When a cell runs out of DNA building blocks, it can no longer divide. Knowing the problem, the team could devise a solution. They fed the cells a slightly different building block that can only be used to generate DNA, not RNA. With that added to the mix, the cells successfully fought off both dengue and VEEV and were able to keep dividing normally. This knowledge could help make the drug less toxic in animals and eventually people. Khosla said they plan to test the drug combination against many different RNA viruses to learn which it fights most effectively. If the drug combination is successful in animals, they hope it might become among the first broad antiviral strategies for human disease.","Published: March 30, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-the-bat-got-its-wings-197264,How The Bat Got Its Wings Finding may provide clues to human limb development and malformations  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.An international team of scientists, including groups from UC San Francisco, Gladstone Institutes, and the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa, have for the first time identified genes and gene regulatory elements that are essential in wing development in the Natal long-fingered bat (Miniopterus natalensis), a species widely distributed in eastern and southern Africa. The new research   presented in Nature Genetics and PLoS Genetics   revealed regulatory switches that turn bat genes on and off at crucial times during limb development, and has implications for understanding how differences in the size, shape and structure of limbs are generated in mammals in general, including humans, the researchers said.  This gives us our first detailed picture of the genomics behind bat wing development,  said co-senior investigator Nadav Ahituv, PhD, a UCSF associate professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences in the UCSF School of Pharmacy and member of the UCSF Institute for Human Genetics, whose lab also studies the genetics of human limb malformations.  While some attempts have been made to identify the molecular events that led to the evolution of the bat wing, these have been primarily done on a  gene by gene  basis. In contrast, this work lays out a genome-wide blueprint for the causes that led to the development of the bat wing, a key evolutionary innovation that contributed to bats becoming the second most diverse order of mammals.  Bats are the only mammals capable of powered flight   an innovation that is thought to have occurred about 50 million years ago. Biologists since Charles Darwin have used the structure of the bat wing as an example of both evolutionary novelty   the appearance of a new trait   and vertebrate homology, or shared ancestry between two seemingly different structures   in this case, the wing of the bat and the forelimb of other mammals. But the path of bats  unique evolution is unclear, noted Nicola Illing, PhD, co-senior investigator in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at UCT.  The fossil record does not show the transition from tree-climbing mammals with short, free digits to ones that have elongated fingers supporting a wing,  Illing said.  Until now, scientists knew very little about how genes are turned on and off during bat embryonic development to transform a mammalian forelimb into a wing.  Bat Embryos Reveal Thousands of Wing Development Genes In the Nature Genetics paper, the scientists, including co-lead authors Walter L. Eckalbar, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Ahituv s laboratory at UCSF, and PhD student Stephen Schlebusch of UCT, first sequenced the entire genome of the Natal long-fingered bat. They then performed detailed molecular genomic analysis on bat embryos collected by Illing and her research group at the de Hoop Nature Reserve in South Africa. The researchers identified over 7,000 genes that are expressed differently in forelimbs compared with hindlimbs at three key stages of bat wing development. They found that many signaling pathways are activated differentially as well, including pathways important in limb formation, digit growth, long bone development and cell death. Also expressed differently are many proteins associated with ribosomes   molecular machines found in all cells that are responsible for protein production during limb development.  It took bats millions of years to evolve wings,  said Eckalbar.  Our work shows that they did this through thousands of genetic alterations, involving both genes used by all animals during limb development and genes whose usage in limb development may be unique to bats.  In addition, the scientists found thousands of genetic switches, called enhancers, which regulate the timing and levels of gene expression and show differences in activity between forelimbs and hindlimbs at these key stages of wing development.  Importantly, this work identified not just which genes are expressed at what stage of growth, but the genetic switches in the genome that are responsible for turning those genes on and off,  Ahituv said. Researchers Map Bat Wings  Unique Evolutionary Origins In the study published in PLoS Genetics, the research team, including co-lead authors Betty M. Booker, PhD, a post-doctoral fellow in Ahituv s laboratory, and Tara Friedrich, a PhD student at UCSF and Gladstone Institutes, searched for the evolutionary origin of the bat wing.  We identified genomic sequences that have not changed in most vertebrates, but experienced rapid changes in the common ancestor of today s bats,  explained Friedrich, a member of the laboratory of co-senior investigator Katherine S. Pollard, PhD, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes, a UCSF professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, and a member of the UCSF Institute for Human Genetics. The team mapped these so-called  bat accelerated regions  (BARs) onto areas that were predicted to be important switches that turn genes on during limb development, and found 166 BARs with the potential to influence bat wing development. The researchers tested the effects of five of these BARs in genetically modified mouse embryos and found that all five bat sequences were capable of switching on a reporter gene in the developing mouse forelimb. They noted that one region, BAR116, is located near the HoxD genes, which are known to be involved in limb patterning and skeletal growth. Previously, Mandy Mason, a PhD student at UCT, had shown that two of the HoxD genes   Hoxd10 and Hoxd11   are far more active in bat wings compared to bat legs during their embryonic development. Following up these lines of evidence, the researchers showed that the bat BAR116 sequence appears to function as a genetic switch that is active in developing limbs, in particular the forelimbs, while the equivalent mouse sequence did not show any activity.  Our computational method enabled identification of DNA sequences that changed dramatically during the emergence of bats,  said Pollard.  It is exciting to see that this evolutionary signature pointed us to parts of the mammalian genome that control limb development.  In addition to unveiling new fundamental details of the evolutionary and developmental origins of powered flight in bats, the new research may provide broader insights into the biological processes that control how mammalian limbs develop in general, Ahituv said.  Importantly, this work will increase our understanding of how alterations in limb development could lead to limb malformations in humans,  he said.  Potentially, it could eventually help contribute to the development of tools and techniques to prevent such malformations.

Most of the antibiotics we use were discovered by scientists in the mid-20th century, but as the threat of drug resistant infections increases, the race is on to find new microbes that make new drugs. Scientists have only identified a tiny fraction of the microbes living on Earth and are looking for useful new ones in wildly different locations, known as  bioprospecting . Here we ve listed just a few of the places that researchers have looked for new drug-making microbes. 1. Fungus-farming leafcutter ants South American leafcutter ants are possibly the oldest farmers on Earth, beating humans by a cool 10 million years. The ants chop down swathes of rainforest canopy, which they carry back to their nest to feed to a fungus called Leucoagaricus gongylophorus that the ants themselves eat. The fungus benefits from the deal because the ants feed it and give it a safe, warm and humid place to live. The ants also use antibiotics, made by bacteria that they grow on their bodies, to protect their fungus against disease. Some of the bacterial strains and the antibiotics they make are new to science and Dr Matt Hutchings and his team at the University of East Anglia hope they might one day be useful in the clinic. 2. Marine sediment In 1989, researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography identified a new species of bacterialiving in marine sediment, just off the coast of the Bahamas. Later to be known as Salinispora, strains of this genus have been found in tropical and subtropical seas around the world and have been found at depths of over 5,000 metres. These bacteria are well adapted to their environment and only grow in the presence of seawater. Salinispora bacteria produce a compound called Salinosporamide A, which shows anticancer properties and is currently being tested in phase I clinical trials to test its effectiveness against two types of cancer cells. 3. Marine sponges Although they lack any obvious organs or limbs, marine sponges are some of the oldest animals on Earth. Sponges have been the source of anticancer drugs since the 1950s and thousands of other compounds have been derived from them. A great number of these potential drugs appear to be made by bacteria that live in mutually beneficial relationships with sponges across the world, including Salinispora and marine Streptomyces species. In the absence of an immune system it is thought that these primitive animals use the antibiotic-producing bacteria to protect themselves against disease. 4. The Atacama Desert The Atacama might be the world s oldest desert and is perhaps the driest place on Earth, with some areas receiving an average of 1mm of rain a year (although when it does rain the results arespectacular). Although it was believed nothing could survive there, the desert has been shown to be home to new species of Streptomyces bacteria, including Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii, which produces new compounds called chaxamycins that have potent antibacterial properties. 5. Soil Far removed from the deserts of South America, common or garden soil remains an untapped source of potential new drugs. The majority of antibiotics in use today are made by members of the soil-dwelling Streptomyces genus of bacteria and many scientists believed there weren t any left to find. However, the discovery in 2015 of the new antibiotic compound teixobactin   isolated from bacteria living in a grassy field   shows there might be more to find. Lots of projects, including the Microbiology Society s Small World Initiative, are getting the public involved to look for more useful soil microbes. They ve taken this search to UK forests, the Blue Peter Garden and even the Prime Minister s garden at 10 Downing Street - and the results are currently being analysed here at UEA. 6. Golf courses Ivermectin is a drug that is used to treat a number of parasitic worm infections and has saved millions of lives. It cures diseases like river blindness, which disproportionally affect the poorest people on Earth. Ivermectin was derived from another compound called avermectin, produced by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. The Japanese scientist Dr Satoshi  mura isolated this species on the fringes of a golf course in Kawana, near Tokyo. As a result of his discovery,  mura was co-awarded the 2015Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. 7. The places and things around you right now  In addition to looking for new antibiotic-producing microbes in exotic places around the world, some are looking closer to home. Dr Adam Roberts from University College London has been running a project called Swab and Send, which sees members of the public swab a surface and send it to him to analyse for the presence of new antibiotic-producing bacteria. People have swabbed a huge range of places, and interesting microbial species have been found living on banknotes, train station ticket machines, a cat s nose, the side of a fridge, and even men s beards. The project is still in its early stages, but Dr Roberts hopes that the next antibiotic could be found right under our noses ","Published: March 30, 2016"

However, conventional detection methods   such as PET scans, CT and MRI   usually cannot detect whether a tumor is shrinking until a patient has received multiple cycles of therapy. A new technique developed in pre-clinical models by investigators at Brigham and Women s Hospital (BWH) offers a new approach and a read out on the effectiveness of chemotherapy in as few as eight hours after treatment. The technology can also be used for monitoring the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Using a nanoparticle that delivers a drug and then fluoresces green when cancer cells begin dying, researchers were able to visualize whether a tumor is resistant or susceptible to a particular treatment much sooner than currently available clinical methods. The team s findings are published online in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Using this approach, the cells light up the moment a cancer drug starts working. We can determine if a cancer therapy is effective within hours of treatment,  said co-corresponding author Shiladitya Sengupta, PhD, a principal investigator in BWH s Division of Bioengineering.  Our long-term goal is to find a way to monitor outcomes very early so that we don t give a chemotherapy drug to patients who are not responding to it.  The new technique takes advantage of the fact that when cells die, a particular enzyme known as caspase is activated. The researchers designed a  reporter element  that, when in the presence of activated caspase, glows green. The team then tested whether they could use the reporter nanoparticles to distinguish between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors. Using nanoparticles loaded with anti-cancer drugs, the team tested a common chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, in a pre-clinical model of prostate cancer and, separately, an immunotherapy that targets PD-L 1 in a pre-clinical model of melanoma. In the tumors that were sensitive to paclitaxel, the team saw an approximately 400 percent increase in fluorescence compared to tumors that were not sensitive to the drug. The team also saw a significant increase in the fluorescent signal in tumors treated with the anti-PD-L1 nanoparticles after five days.  We ve demonstrated that this technique can help us directly visualize and measure the responsiveness of tumors to both types of drugs,  said co-corresponding author Ashish Kulkarni, an instructor in the Division of Biomedical Engineering at BWH.  Current techniques, which rely on measurements of the size or metabolic state of the tumor, are sometimes unable to detect the effectiveness of an immunotherapeutic agent as the volume of the tumor may actually increase as immune cells begin to flood in to attack the tumor. Reporter nanoparticles, however, can give us an accurate read out of whether or not cancer cells are dying.  Researchers now plan to focus on the design of radiotracers that can be used in humans, and tests of both safety and efficacy will be necessary before the current technique can be translated into clinical applications. Sengupta, Kulkarni and their colleagues are actively working on these steps in order to further the lab s goal of improving the management and treatment of cancer using nanotechnology.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/viewing-tb-bacteria-213653,Viewing TB Bacteria New method developed that will help quickly determine the effectiveness of a TB treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Although tuberculosis (TB) is commonly thought of as being a disease that mainly affects nineteenth century poets and Victor Hugo characters, it is still the second-most common cause of mortality from an infectious disease in the world, killing nearly three people every minute. Every March 24, on World TB Day, the global health community recognizes the work of Robert Koch, who announced on that date in 1882 his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB. TB is generally a curable disease but first it must be diagnosed, and that has been one of the biggest barriers in its elimination. M. tuberculosis grows very slowly, so traditional methods of diagnostic testing take a very long time. A team from the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine has been working on a new approach. The work is led by Jeffrey Cirillo, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology. Cirillo s previous research, which has been supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, has focused on developing a rapid yet inexpensive test for tuberculosis. He and his team have nearly perfected the technology and are in the process of bringing the test to market. The slow growth of M. tuberculosis also makes development of new therapeutics difficult because it takes so long to determine if the treatment is working. Now, Cirillo and his team have developed a method, which they reported recently in the journal PLoS ONE, of detecting whether a potential treatment is working as early as a day after it is given.  Since M. tuberculosis takes about a month to quantify using traditional approaches, any method that allows direct determination of the amount of bacteria present is very valuable and speeds progress, saving months every time an experiment is done,  Cirillo said.  Our methods allow this.  Using optical imaging technology, the researchers can observe the bacteria in real time, in living animals, without harming them. This way, it is easy to determine if a proposed treatment is working and the number of bacteria is decreasing.  There have never been sensitive enough systems to measure the bacteria directly in animals,  Cirillo said.  This is a completely new technology and has nearly limitless applications to microbiological research, particularly in animals, but it increases sensitivity in any experimental system.  Drug-resistant TB, now present everywhere in the world, is hampering efforts to fight the disease because the usual drugs used to treat it are no longer effective. Therefore, new, more effective treatments need to be developed.","Published: March 30, 2016"

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which cells in the pancreas that make insulin are killed by the immune system. The new therapy, MultiPepT1De, will use fragments of proteins, known as peptides, in an effort to stop this process by  switching off  the specific autoimmune attack, and hopefully preventing further destruction of the pancreatic cells. In laboratory testing, MultiPepT1De is more powerful than the first generation treatment trialled last year and is designed to benefit a higher proportion of those with Type 1 diabetes than its predecessor. MultiPepT1De was developed with funding from the Wellcome Trust by researchers at King s College London working in the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at Guy s and St Thomas  and King s College London. MultiPepT1De will be trialled on 24 people with Type 1 diabetes by autumn 2016 and the study team is hopeful of positive results that build upon their previous findings showing that the first generation of MultiPepT1De, called MonoPepT1De, is safe and well tolerated, with some evidence of positive effects in T1D patients. Professor Mark Peakman, Principal Investigator at the BRC and Head of the Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences at King's, said:  We are really looking forward to seeing the results from this new trial. What we are doing is a big step forward in precision medicine, taking a set of patients with a particular disease and genetic background and giving them an immunotherapy designed in the laboratory specifically for them. Obviously we will need to wait until we have the full results of the trial before we know if it is successful but at this stage we are hopeful.  Dr Stephen Caddick, Director of Innovations at the Wellcome Trust, said:  Type 1 diabetes is a very serious condition that normally requires lifelong treatment with insulin therapy, but this promising new form of  immunotherapy  could be set to change that. By retraining the immune system to prevent it from attacking insulin-producing cells, it may be possible to slow progression of the disease or even stop it in its tracks. If this approach is proved successful in larger studies it has the potential to transform the lives of people with Type 1 diabetes.  In the last decade, the number of people in the UK with diabetes has risen by around 65 per cent to 4m, according to Diabetes UK, with around 400,000 adults and children now suffering from Type 1 diabetes. Treating diabetes is estimated to cost the NHS around  10 billion per year. MultiPepT1De is based on an area of study called peptide immunotherapy, which is currently being applied to a number of other diseases, including allergies and multiple sclerosis. Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Health, said:  This exciting new treatment has the potential to transform the lives of thousands of patients across the UK living with Type 1 diabetes. Thanks to our strong economy we invest over  1 billion every year in health research, helping us to lead the world in medical innovation and give NHS patients the latest cutting-edge treatments.

An emerging vaccine strategy involves immunizing people with a series of different engineered HIV proteins as immunogens to teach the immune system to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. This strategy depends on the ability of the first immunogen to bind and activate special cells, known as broadly neutralizing antibody precursor B cells, which have the potential to develop into broadly neutralizing antibody-producing B cells. A research team has now found that the right precursor ( germline ) cells for one kind of HIV broadly neutralizing antibody are present in most people, and has described the design of an HIV vaccine germline-targeting immunogen capable of binding those B cells. The findings by scientists from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology were published in Science on March 25.  We found that almost everybody has these broadly neutralizing antibody precursors, and that a precisely engineered protein can bind to these cells that have potential to develop into HIV broadly neutralizing antibody-producing cells, even in the presence of competition from other immune cells,  said the study s lead author, William Schief, TSRI professor and director, Vaccine Design of the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center at TSRI, in whose lab the engineered HIV vaccine protein was developed. The body s immune system contains a large pool of different precursor B cells so it can respond to a wide variety of pathogens. But that also means that precursor B cells able to recognize a specific feature on a virus surface are exceedingly rare within the total pool of B cells.  The challenge for vaccine developers is to determine if an immunogen can present a particular viral surface in a way that distinct B cells can be activated, proliferate and be useful,  said study co-author Shane Crotty, professor at the La Jolla Institute.  Using a new technique, we were able to show well in advance of clinical trials that most humans actually have the right B cells that will bind to this vaccine candidate. It is remarkable that protein design can be so specific as to  find  one in a million cells, demonstrating the feasibility of this new vaccine strategy.  The work offers encouraging insights for a planned Phase 1 clinical trial to test a nanoparticle version of the engineered HIV vaccine protein, the  eOD-GT8 60mer.   The goal of the clinical study will be to test safety and the ability of this engineered protein to elicit the desired immune response in humans that would look like the start of broadly neutralizing antibody development,  Schief said.  Data from this new study was also important for designing the clinical trial, including the size and the methods of analysis."" In June, scientists from TSRI, IAVI and The Rockefeller University reported that the eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody responses in mice that showed some of the traits necessary to recognize and inhibit HIV. If the eOD-GT8 60mer performs similarly in humans, additional boost immunogens are thought to be needed to ultimately induce broadly neutralizing antibodies that can block HIV. The new work also provides a method for researchers to assess whether other new vaccine proteins can bind their intended precursor B cells. This method is a valuable tool in the design of more targeted and effective vaccines against AIDS, providing the ability to vet germline-targeting immunogens before testing them in large, time-consuming and costly clinical trials. Looking at blood donated by healthy volunteers, the scientists found B cells that were capable of creating  VRC01-class  antibodies that recognized a critical surface patch, or epitope, of HIV. VRC01-class broadly neutralizing antibodies are a group of antibodies isolated from different individuals that appear to have developed in a very similar way, and it has been hypothesized that the starting VRC01-class B cells were very similar in the different people. The eOD-GT8 60mer is designed to engage these precursor B cells to initiate HIV broadly neutralizing antibody development.","Published: March 30, 2016"

However, despite the recent revolution of optical imaging technologies that has enabled the distinction of molecular targets residing less than 200 nm apart from each other, modern super-resolution techniques still face the challenge to accurately and precisely count the number of biomolecules at cellular locations. A new analytical tool developed by a team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering solves this problem. The team led by Peng Yin, Ph.D., a Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute and Professor of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School, has forged ahead with its previously developed DNA-PAINT and Exchange-PAINT super-resolution microscopy platform to now count different molecular species in biological samples with high accuracy and precision. DNA-PAINT affords higher resolution than costly super-resolution microscopes and Exchange-PAINT can survey multiple different molecules in the same biological sample.  ""We now have enhanced our DNA-powered super-resolution microscopy methods with a highly quantitative analytical tool kit. qPAINT, as we named it, can accurately count the actual numbers of specific molecules at specific locations inside the cell,"" said Yin. ""Introducing this quantitative power has crucially extended the spectrum of imaging capabilities of this comprehensive and inexpensive technology so that it can be applied in many areas of biological and clinical research."" Key to the DNA-driven imaging technology is the transient interaction of two short strands of DNA, one called the ""docking strand"" that is attached to the molecular target to be visualized and the other, called the ""imager strand"", which carries a light-emitting dye. ""We can precisely program the time interval for which the two complementary DNA strands transiently interact with each other so that when the pair of strands goes through binding and dissociation, the dye will blink at a specific frequency. From an increase of this frequency, we can then deduce with qPAINT analysis how many targets exactly are located at a specific cellular location without spatially resolving each target,"" said Ralf Jungmann, Ph.D., one of the two co-first authors of the study, a former Postdoctoral Fellow in Yin s lab and now a Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. Applying this kind of binding analysis to DNA-PAINT and Exchange-PAINT allows the Wyss team to disregard common problems that fluorescent dyes pose for achieving truly quantitative potential in super-resolution microscopy, like their hard-to-model photophysical properties and tendency to wane under the influence of light, a phenomenon known as photobleaching. In earlier proof-of-principle studies, the team integrated DNA-powered super resolution microscopy with highly specific and broadly available detection reagents, for example, by attaching docking strands to antibodies that specifically bind molecules in various cellular structures and complexes or to DNA probes that bind to specific messenger RNA molecules shuttling genetic information inside cells. ""With qPAINT, we counted the numbers of proteins targeted by antibodies at sites such as a cell surface, or the membrane that surrounds the cell nucleus, and even at the nerve endings that stimulate muscles to twitch. The technology can be integrated with a large array of detection reagents to eventually count diverse molecules of interest at the cellular sites where they perform their tasks,"" said Maier Avenda o, Ph.D., the work s other co-first author and Postdoctoral Fellow in Yin s team. ""qPAINT adds a powerful new tool to this simple super-resolution microscopy platform, which now gives researchers the extraordinary capability to quantify how changes in molecule numbers at specific locations influence cell signaling and function. And what is most amazing is that they do this without requiring a highly expensive microscope, and so it should be useable by virtually any biological or clinical laboratory,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

These may include investigating a new class of immune system stimulants called cyclic di-nucleotides, which have shown promise in shrinking tumors and bolstering vaccines against tuberculosis, and research that could help re-arm the immune system s natural killer cells, which normally attack cancer cells and virus-infected cells, to better fight tumors.  We re increasingly finding that immune stimulants associated with disease-causing microbes work as cancer therapies, and conversely, that immunotherapies for cancer may have application in fighting infectious disease,  said IVRI director David Raulet, a professor and co-chair of the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology.  Bringing infectious disease and cancer researchers together in a synergistic research effort at UC Berkeley and Aduro Biotech is an exciting and unique idea, and could be where the next generation of therapies will come from.  Aduro already uses some of UC Berkeley s technology, including attenuated Listeria monocytogenes mutants and methods to engineer these bacteria to stimulate the immune system as vaccines for immunotherapy. This technology, pioneered by Dan Portnoy, a UC Berkeley professor who has joint appointments in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and the infectious diseases and vaccinology division of the School of Public Health, has been further refined by Aduro scientists and is now being employed in Phase IIB clinical trials for vaccines against pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma.  Through this unique collaboration, there is tremendous opportunity to improve our understanding of the immune system s potential to serve as an important weapon in treating cancer and infectious disease,  said Stephen T. Isaacs, chairman, president and CEO of Aduro Biotech.  By combining UC Berkeley s leading research and academic resources with innovative technology platforms, such as those developed by Aduro, we are confident that this initiative will lead to an improved understanding of, and potential treatments for, some of the most devastating diseases.  The initiative was officially launched at an evening reception on March 24, the eve of aone-day symposium at UC Berkeley titled  Harnessing the Immune System to Fight Cancer and Infectious Diseases.

According to the CDC, more than 67,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanoma in 2012 alone   the most recent year for which data are available. If caught early, melanoma patients have a 5-year survival rate of more than 98 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute. That number dips to 16.6 percent if the cancer has metastasized before diagnosis and treatment. Melanoma treatments range from surgery to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A promising new field of cancer treatment is cancer immunotherapy, which helps the body s own immune system fight off cancer. In the immune system, T cells are supposed to identify and kill cancer cells. To do their job, T cells use specialized receptors to differentiate healthy cells from cancer cells. But cancer cells can trick T cells. One way cancer cells do this is by expressing a protein ligand that binds to a receptor on the T cells to prevent the T cell from recognizing and attacking the cancer cell. Recently, cancer immunotherapy research has focused on using  anti-PD-1  (or programmed cell death) antibodies to prevent cancer cells from tricking T cells.  However, this poses several challenges,  says Chao Wang, co-lead author of a paper on the microneedle research and a postdoctoral researcher in the joint biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC-Chapel Hill.  First, the anti-PD-1 antibodies are usually injected into the bloodstream, so they cannot target the tumor site effectively. Second, the overdose of antibodies can cause side effects such as an autoimmune disorder.  To address these challenges, the researchers developed a patch that uses microneedles to deliver anti-PD-1 antibodies locally to the skin tumor. The microneedles are made from hyaluronic acid, a biocompatible material. The anti-PD-1 antibodies are embedded in nanoparticles, along with glucose oxidase   an enzyme that produces acid when it comes into contact with glucose. These nanoparticles are then loaded into microneedles, which are arrayed on the surface of a patch. When the patch is applied to a melanoma, blood enters the microneedles. The glucose in the blood makes the glucose oxidase produce acid, which slowly breaks down the nanoparticles. As the nanoparticles degrade, the anti-PD-1 antibodies are released into the tumor.  This technique creates a steady, sustained release of antibodies directly into the tumor site; it is an efficient approach with enhanced retention of anti-PD-1 antibodies in the tumor microenvironment,  says Zhen Gu, an assistant professor in the biomedical engineering program and senior author of the paper. The researchers tested the technique against melanoma in a mouse model. The microneedle patch loaded with anti-PD-1 nanoparticles was compared to treatment by injecting anti-PD-1 antibodies directly into the bloodstream and to injecting anti-PD-1 nanoparticles directly into the tumor.  After 40 days, 40 percent of the mice who were treated using the microneedle patch survived and had no detectable remaining melanoma   compared to a zero percent survival rate for the control groups,  says Yanqi Ye, a Ph.D. student in Gu s lab and co-lead author of the paper. The researchers also created a drug cocktail, consisting of anti-PD-1 antibodies and another antibody called anti-CTLA-4   which also helps T cells attack the cancer cells.  Using a combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 in the microneedle patch, 70 percent of the mice survived and had no detectable melanoma after 40 days,  Wang says.  Because of the sustained and localized release manner, mediated by microneedles, we are able to achieve desirable therapeutic effects with a relatively low dosage, which reduces the risk of auto-immune disorders,  Gu says.  We re excited about this technique, and are seeking funding to pursue further studies and potential clinical translation,  Gu adds.","Published: March 30, 2016"

Indeed, our oceans, soils and potentially even our bodies would be overrun with bacteria were it not for bacteria-eating viruses, called bacteriophages, that keep the microbial balance of ecological niches in check. Now, a new study at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis suggests that bacteriophages made of RNA   a close chemical cousin of DNA   likely play a much larger role in shaping the bacterial makeup of worldwide habitats than previously recognized. The research has identified 122 new types of RNA bacteriophages in diverse ecological niches, providing an opportunity for scientists to define their contributions to ecology and potentially to exploit them as novel tools to fight bacterial infections, particularly those that are resistant to antibiotics.  Lots of DNA bacteriophages have been identified, but there s an incredible lack of understanding about RNA bacteriophages,  explained senior author David Wang, associate professor of molecular microbiology.  They have been largely ignored   relatively few were known to exist, and for the most part, scientists haven t bothered to look for them. This study puts RNA bacteriophages on the map and opens many new avenues of exploration.  Wang estimates that of the more than 1,500 bacteriophages that have been identified, 99 percent of them have DNA genomes. The advent of large-scale genome sequencing has helped scientists identify DNA bacteriophages in the human gut, skin and blood as well as in the environment, but few researchers have looked for RNA bacteriophages in those samples (doing so requires that RNA be isolated from the samples and then converted back to DNA before sequencing). As part of the new study, first author and graduate student Siddharth Krishnamurthy, and the team, including Dan Barouch, MD, PhD, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, identified RNA bacteriophages by analyzing data from samples taken from the environment, such as oceans, sewage and soils, and from aquatic invertebrates including crabs, sponges and barnacles, as well as insects, mice and rhesus macaques. RNA bacteriophages have been shown to infect gram-negative bacteria, which have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics and are the source of many infections in health-care settings. But the researchers also showed for the first time that these bacteriophages also may infect gram-positive bacteria, which are responsible for strep and staph infections as well as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).  What we know about RNA bacteriophages in any environment is limited,  Wang said.  But you can think of bacteriophages and bacteria as having a predator-prey relationship. We need to understand the dynamics of that relationship. Eventually, we d like to manipulate that dynamic to use phages to selectively kill particular bacteria. ","Published: March 30, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/experimental-vaccine-protects-against-dengue-virus-194147,Experimental Vaccine Protects Against Dengue Virus An experimental dengue vaccine protected all the volunteers who received it from infection with a live dengue virus  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Dengue fever is common throughout the tropics and subtropics. Four related viruses can cause dengue fever: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. All are spread by Aedes mosquitoes, which also spread Zika virus. Most of the estimated 390 million people infected with dengue virus each year develop mild symptoms or none at all. However, some people develop serious or life-threatening illness. Large outbreaks can cause millions to seek care, severely straining health care infrastructure in affected countries. An experimental dengue vaccine called TV003 was developed by a research team led by Dr. Stephen Whitehead of NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The vaccine was made from a mixture of 4 live, weakened (attenuated) viruses targeted to each of the 4 dengue virus serotypes. In previous work, the team showed that the vaccine safely produced an immune response against all 4 virus serotypes. To directly test whether the vaccine could protect against infection, the researchers enrolled 48 healthy adult volunteers at the University of Vermont College of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The participants had never been infected by dengue or any related viruses. They were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of the candidate vaccine or a placebo injection. The trial was double blind neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received which injection. Six months after vaccination, 41 of the participants returned for a live virus challenge. They were given a genetically modified version of a DENV-2 strain isolated during an outbreak in the Kingdom of Tonga in 1974 that caused only mild illness. The researchers had carefully established a virus dose that would cause recipients to develop viremia the presence of virus in the blood and most to develop a mild rash. Results were published on March 16, 2016, in Science Translational Medicine. After the challenge, all 20 placebo recipients developed viremia, 16 (80%) developed mild rash, and 4 (20%) had a temporary drop in white blood cell count. In contrast, none of the 21 TV003 vaccine recipients developed viremia or any other sign of infection after the challenge.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that this candidate vaccine provided complete protection in everyone who received it,  says Dr. Anna Durbin, who led the trial at Johns Hopkins.  The findings from this trial are very encouraging to those of us who have spent many years working on vaccine candidates to protect against dengue, a disease that is a significant burden in much of the world and is now endemic in Puerto Rico,  Whitehead says.  In fact, these results informed the recent decision by officials at Brazil s Butantan Institute to advance the TV003 vaccine into a large phase 3 efficacy trial.  Whitehead s team is currently developing a similar human challenge model using a modified DENV-3 strain. The team is also using their dengue vaccine experience to develop a vaccine against Zika, which is in the same virus family.","Published: March 30, 2016"

Proliferation of such cells, which tend to resist chemotherapy and help tumors spread, are considered a major roadblock to successful cancer treatment. The new research, suggesting that low-oxygen conditions spur growth through the same chain of biochemical events in both embryonic stem cells and breast cancer stem cells, could offer a path through that roadblock, the investigators say.  There are still many questions left to answer but we now know that oxygen poor environments, like those often found in advanced human breast cancers serve as nurseries for the birth of cancer stem cells,  says Gregg Semenza, M.D., Ph.D., the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Medicine and a member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.  That gives us a few more possible targets for drugs that diminish their threat in human cancer.  A summary of the findings was published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Semenza says scientists have long known that low oxygen environments affect tumor growth, but, in the case of advanced tumors, there was a paradox.  Aggressive cancers contain regions where the cancer cells are starved for oxygen and die off, yet patients with these tumors generally have the worst outcome. Our new findings tell us that low oxygen conditions actually encourage certain cancer stem cells to multiply through the same mechanism used by embryonic stem cells.  All stem cells are immature cells known for their ability to multiply indefinitely and give rise to progenitor cells that mature into specific cell types that populate the body s tissues during embryonic development. They also replenish tissues throughout the life of an organism. But stem cells found in tumors use those same attributes and twist them to maintain and enhance the survival of cancers. According to Semenza,  Chemotherapy may kill more than 99 percent of the cancer cells in a tumor but fail to kill a small population of cancer stem cells that are responsible for subsequent cancer relapse and metastasis.     The search has been intense to find these cells  Achilles  heel. If we could get cancer stem cells to abandon their stem cell state, they would no longer have the power to keep repopulating tumors,  says Semenza, who also directs the Vascular Biology Research Program at the Institute for Cell Engineering. Aiding their new research, Semenza says, was the knowledge that whereas the air we breathe is 21 percent oxygen, oxygen levels average around 9 percent in healthy human breast tissue but only 1.4 percent in breast tumors. Recent studies showed that low oxygen conditions increase levels of a family of proteins known as HIFs, or hypoxia-inducible factors, that turn on hundreds of genes, including one called NANOG that instructs cells to become stem cells. Studies of embryonic stem cells revealed that NANOG protein levels can be lowered by a chemical process known as methylation, which involves putting a methyl group chemical tag on a protein s messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor. Semenza says methylation leads to the destruction of NANOG s mRNA so that no protein is made, which in turn causes the embryonic stem cells to abandon their stem cell state and mature into different cell types. To see whether cancer stem cell renewal involves a chain of events similar to that used by embryonic stem cells, and whether the process was affected by oxygen levels, Semenza and graduate student Chuanzhao Zhang focused their studies on two human breast cancer cell lines that responded to low oxygen by ramping up production of the protein ALKBH5, which removes methyl groups from mRNAs. (Breast cancer is categorized and treated based on the presence or absence of three hormone receptors displayed on the outer membranes of cells. One human cell line they studied displays the receptors for estrogen and progesterone, and one, known as triple negative, displays none.) Zeroing in on NANOG, the scientists found that low oxygen conditions increased NANOG s mRNA levels through the action of HIF proteins, which turned on the gene for ALKBH5, which decreased the methylation and subsequent destruction of NANOG s mRNA. When they prevented the cells from making ALKBH5, NANOG levels and the number of cancer stem cells decreased. When the researchers manipulated the cell s genetics to increase levels of ALKBH5 without exposing them to low oxygen, they found this also decreased methylation of NANOG mRNA and increased the numbers of breast cancer stem cells. Finally, using live mice, the scientists injected 1,000 triple-negative breast cancer cells into their mammary fat pads, where the mouse version of breast cancer forms. Unaltered cells created tumors in all seven mice injected with such cells, but when cells missing ALKBH5 were used, they caused tumors in only 43 percent (six out of 14) of mice.  That confirmed for us that ALKBH5 helps preserve cancer stem cells and their tumor-forming abilities,  Semenza says. Semenza says his team will continue its mouse studies to see if metastasis   the spread of cancer from the original tumor   is affected by the low oxygen/ALKBH5/NANOG relationship too. The researchers also want to see what other proteins and mRNAs are involved in the relationship, and why some cancer cell lines they tested did not show the same increased ALKBH5 levels in response to low oxygen levels.

Cushing syndrome results from high levels of the hormone cortisol. Long-term complications of the syndrome include obesity, diabetes, bone fractures, high blood pressure, kidney stones and serious infections. Cushing s syndrome may be caused by tumors of the adrenal glands or other parts of the body that produce excess cortisol. It also may be caused by a pituitary tumor that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce high cortisol levels. Treatment usually involves stopping excess cortisol production by removing the tumor.  Our results indicate that physicians who care for young people with Cushing syndrome should screen their patients for depression-related mental illness after the underlying disease has been successfully treated,  said the study s senior author, Constantine Stratakis, M.D., director of the Division of Intramural Research at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  Patients may not tell their doctors that they re feeling depressed, so it s a good idea for physicians to screen their patients proactively for depression and related conditions.  Cushing syndrome may affect both adults and children. A recent study estimated that in the United States, there are eight cases of Cushing syndrome per 1 million people per year. The researchers published their findings in the journal Pediatrics. They reviewed the case histories of all children and youth treated for Cushing syndrome at NIH from 2003 to 2014, a total of 149 patients. The researchers found that, months after treatment, nine children (roughly 6 percent) had thoughts of suicide and experienced outbursts of anger and rage, depression, irritability and anxiety. Of these, seven experienced symptoms within seven months of their treatment. Two others began experiencing symptoms at least 48 months after treatment. The authors noted that children with Cushing syndrome often develop compulsive behaviors and tend to become over-achievers in school. After treatment, however, they then become depressed and anxious. This is in direct contrast to adults with Cushing syndrome, who tend to become depressed and anxious before treatment and gradually overcome these symptoms after treatment. The authors stated that health care providers might try to prepare children with Cushing syndrome before they undergo treatment, letting them know that their mood may change after surgery and may not improve for months or years. Similarly, providers should consider screening their patients periodically for suicide risk in the years following their treatment.","Published: March 30, 2016"

Studies on survivors of traumatic events have suggested that exposure to stress may indeed have lasting effects on subsequent generations. But how exactly are these genetic ""memories"" passed on? See Also: Epigenetic tie to neuropsychiatric disorders found A new Tel Aviv University study pinpoints the precise mechanism that turns the inheritance of environmental influences ""on"" and ""off."" The research, published last week in Cell and led by Dr. Oded Rechavi and his group from Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Life Sciences and Sagol School of Neuroscience, reveals the rules that dictate which epigenetic responses will be inherited, and for how long. ""Until now, it has been assumed that a passive dilution or decay governs the inheritance of epigenetic responses,"" Dr. Rechavi said. ""But we showed that there is an active process that regulates epigenetic inheritance down through generations."" Researchers have been preoccupied with how the effects of stress, trauma, and other environmental exposures are passed from one generation to the next for years. Small RNA molecules short sequences of RNA that regulate the expression of genes are among the key factors involved in mediating this kind of inheritance. Dr. Rechavi and his team had previously identified a ""small RNA inheritance"" mechanism through which RNA molecules produced a response to the needs of specific cells and how they were regulated between generations. ""We previously showed that worms inherited small RNAs following the starvation and viral infections of their parents. These small RNAs helped prepare their offspring for similar hardships,"" Dr. Rechavi said. ""We also identified a mechanism that amplified heritable small RNAs across generations, so the response was not diluted. We found that enzymes called RdRPs are required for re-creating new small RNAs to keep the response going in subsequent generations."" Most inheritable epigenetic responses in C.elegans worms were found to persist for only a few generations. This created the assumption that epigenetic effects simply ""petered out"" over time, through a process of dilution or decay. ""But this assumption ignored the possibility that this process doesn't simply die out but is regulated instead,"" said Dr. Rechavi, who in this study treated C.elegans worms with small RNAs that target the reporter gene GFP (green fluorescent protein). ""By following heritable small RNAs that regulated GFP that 'silenced' its expression we revealed an active, tuneable inheritance mechanism that can be turned 'on' or 'off.'"" The scientists discovered that specific genes, which they named ""MOTEK"" (Modified Transgenerational Epigenetic Kinetics), were involved in turning on and off epigenetic transmissions. ""We discovered how to manipulate the transgenerational duration of epigenetic inheritance in worms by switching 'on' and 'off' the small RNAs that worms use to regulate genes,"" said Dr. Rechavi. ""These switches are controlled by a feedback interaction between gene-regulating small RNAs, which are inheritable, and the MOTEK genes that are required to produce and transmit these small RNAs across generations. Learn More: Nature and nurture--Human brains evolved to be more responsive to environmental influences ""The feedback determines whether epigenetic memory will continue to the progeny or not, and how long each epigenetic response will last.""

This finding can help mitigate stroke which is the second leading cause of death worldwide. In the study, published in Nature Medicine, mice received a combination of antibiotics. Two weeks later, the researcher team which included collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center induced the most common type of stroke, called ischemic stroke, in which an obstructed blood vessel prevents blood from reaching the brain. Mice treated with antibiotics experienced a stroke that was about 60 percent smaller than rodents that did not receive the medication. The microbial environment in the gut directed the immune cells there to protect the brain, the investigators said, shielding it from the stroke's full force. See Also: Connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease established ""Our experiment shows a new relationship between the brain and the intestine,"" said Dr. Josef Anrather, the Finbar and Marianne Kenny Research Scholar in Neurology and an associate professor of neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine. ""The intestinal microbiota shape stroke outcome, which will impact how the medical community views stroke and defines stroke risk."" The findings suggest that modifying the microbiotic makeup of the gut can become an innovative method to prevent stroke. This could be especially useful to high-risk patients, like those undergoing cardiac surgery or those who have multiple obstructed blood vessels in the brain. Further investigation is needed to understand exactly which bacterial components elicited their protective message. However, the researchers do know that the bacteria did not interact with the brain chemically, but rather influenced neural survival by modifying the behavior of immune cells. Immune cells from the gut made their way to the outer coverings of the brain, called the meninges, where they organized and directed a response to the stroke. ""One of the most surprising findings was that the immune system made strokes smaller by orchestrating the response from outside the brain, like a conductor who doesn't play an instrument himself but instructs the others, which ultimately creates music,"" said Dr. Costantino Iadecola, director of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and the Anne Parrish Titzell Professor of Neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine.

An emerging vaccine strategy involves immunizing people with a series of different engineered HIV proteins as immunogens to teach the immune system to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. This strategy depends on the ability of the first immunogen to bind and activate special cells, known as broadly neutralizing antibody precursor B cells, which have the potential to develop into broadly neutralizing antibody-producing B cells. A research team has now found that the right precursor ( germline ) cells for one kind of HIV broadly neutralizing antibody are present in most people, and has described the design of an HIV vaccine germline-targeting immunogen capable of binding those B cells. The findings by scientists from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology were published in Science.  We found that almost everybody has these broadly neutralizing antibody precursors, and that a precisely engineered protein can bind to these cells that have potential to develop into HIV broadly neutralizing antibody-producing cells, even in the presence of competition from other immune cells,  said the study s lead author, William Schief, TSRI professor and director, Vaccine Design of the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center at TSRI, in whose lab the engineered HIV vaccine protein was developed. The body s immune system contains a large pool of different precursor B cells so it can respond to a wide variety of pathogens. But that also means that precursor B cells able to recognize a specific feature on a virus surface are exceedingly rare within the total pool of B cells.  The challenge for vaccine developers is to determine if an immunogen can present a particular viral surface in a way that distinct B cells can be activated, proliferate and be useful,  said study co-author Shane Crotty, professor at the La Jolla Institute.  Using a new technique, we were able to show well in advance of clinical trials that most humans actually have the right B cells that will bind to this vaccine candidate. It is remarkable that protein design can be so specific as to  find  one in a million cells, demonstrating the feasibility of this new vaccine strategy.  The work offers encouraging insights for a planned Phase 1 clinical trial to test a nanoparticle version of the engineered HIV vaccine protein, the  eOD-GT8 60mer.   The goal of the clinical study will be to test safety and the ability of this engineered protein to elicit the desired immune response in humans that would look like the start of broadly neutralizing antibody development,  Schief said.  Data from this new study was also important for designing the clinical trial, including the size and the methods of analysis."" In June, scientists from TSRI, IAVI and The Rockefeller University reported that the eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody responses in mice that showed some of the traits necessary to recognize and inhibit HIV. If the eOD-GT8 60mer performs similarly in humans, additional boost immunogens are thought to be needed to ultimately induce broadly neutralizing antibodies that can block HIV. The new work also provides a method for researchers to assess whether other new vaccine proteins can bind their intended precursor B cells. This method is a valuable tool in the design of more targeted and effective vaccines against AIDS, providing the ability to vet germline-targeting immunogens before testing them in large, time-consuming and costly clinical trials. Looking at blood donated by healthy volunteers, the scientists found B cells that were capable of creating  VRC01-class  antibodies that recognized a critical surface patch, or epitope, of HIV. VRC01-class broadly neutralizing antibodies are a group of antibodies isolated from different individuals that appear to have developed in a very similar way, and it has been hypothesized that the starting VRC01-class B cells were very similar in the different people. The eOD-GT8 60mer is designed to engage these precursor B cells to initiate HIV broadly neutralizing antibody development.","Published: March 29, 2016"

The discovery is unusual because the enzymes do not bear a resemblance in their structures or amino-acid sequences to any known class of enzymes. The team of scientists nevertheless identified them as  outlier  members of the serine/threonine hydrolase class, using newer techniques that detect biochemical activity.  A huge fraction of the human  proteome  remains uncharacterized, and this paper shows how chemical approaches can be used to uncover proteins of a given functionality that have eluded classification based on sequence or predicted structure,  said co-senior author Benjamin F. Cravatt, chair of TSRI s Department of Chemical Physiology.  In this study, we found two genes that control levels of lipids with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activity, suggesting exciting targets for diabetes and inflammatory diseases,  said co-senior author Alan Saghatelian, who holds the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at the Salk Institute. Into the Unknown The study, which appeared as a Nature Chemical Biology Advance Online Publication on March 28, 2016, began as an effort in the Cravatt laboratory to discover and characterize new serine/threonine hydrolases using fluorophosphonate (FP) probes molecules that selectively bind and, in effect, label the active sites of these enzymes. Pulling FP-binding proteins out of the entire proteome of test cells and identifying them using mass spectrometry techniques, the team matched nearly all to known hydrolases. The major outlier was a protein called androgen-induced gene 1 protein (AIG1). The only other one was a distant cousin in terms of sequence, a protein called ADTRP.  Neither of these proteins had been characterized as an enzyme; in fact, there had been little functional characterization of them at all,  said William H. Parsons, a research associate in the Cravatt laboratory who was co-first author of the study. Experiments on AIG1 and ADTRP revealed that they do their enzymatic work in a unique way.  It looks like they have an active site that is novel it had never been described in the literature,  said Parsons. Initial tests with panels of different enzyme inhibitors showed that AIG1 and ADTRP are moderately inhibited by inhibitors of lipases enzymes that break down fats and other lipids. But on what specific lipids do these newly discovered outlier enzymes normally work? Regulators of FAHFAs At the Salk Institute, the Saghatelian laboratory was investigating a class of lipids it had discovered in 2014. Known as fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), these molecules showed strong therapeutic potential. Saghatelian and his colleagues had found that boosting the levels of one key FAHFA lipid normalizes glucose levels in diabetic mice and also reduces inflammation.  [Ben Cravatt s] lab was screening panels of lipids to find the ones that their new enzymes work on,  said Saghatelian, who is a former research associate in the Cravatt laboratory.  We suggested they throw FAHFAs in there and these turned out to be very good substrates.  The Cravatt laboratory soon developed powerful inhibitors of the newly discovered enzymes, and the two labs began working together, using the inhibitors and genetic techniques to explore the enzymes  functions in vitro and in cultured cells. Co-first author Matthew J. Kolar, an MD-PhD student, performed most of the experiments in the Saghatelian lab. The team concluded that AIG1 and ADTRP, at least in the cell types tested, appear to work mainly to break down FAHFAs and not any other major class of lipid. In principle, inhibitors of AIG1 and ADTRP could be developed into FAHFA-boosting therapies.  Our prediction,  said Saghatelian,  is that if FAHFAs do what we think they re doing, then using an enzyme inhibitor to block their degradation would make FAHFA levels go up and should thus reduce inflammation as well as improve glucose levels and insulin sensitivity.  The two labs are now collaborating on further studies of the new enzymes and the potential benefits of inhibiting them in mouse models of diabetes, inflammation and autoimmune disease.  One of the neat things this study shows,  said Cravatt,  is that even for enzyme classes as well studied as the hydrolases, there may still be hidden members that, presumably by convergent evolution, arrived at that basic enzyme mechanism despite sharing no sequence or structural homology.

Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) and Synthetic Genomics, Inc. (SGI) have announced the design and construction of the first minimal synthetic bacterial cell, JCVI-syn3.0.Using the first synthetic cell, Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0 (created by this same team in 2010), JCVI-syn3.0 was developed through a design, build, and test process using genes from JCVI-syn1.0. The new minimal synthetic cell contains 531,560 base pairs and just 473 genes, making it the smallest genome of any organism that can be grown in laboratory media. Of these genes 149 are of unknown biological function. By comparison the first synthetic cell, M. mycoides JCVI-syn1.0 has 1.08 million base pairs and 901 genes. A paper describing this research is being published in the March 25th print version of the journal Science by lead authors Clyde A. Hutchison, III, Ph.D. and Ray-Yuan Chuang, Ph.D., senior author J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., and senior team of Hamilton O. Smith, MD, Daniel G. Gibson, Ph.D., and John I. Glass, Ph.D.  Our attempt to design and create a new species, while ultimately successful, revealed that 32% of the genes essential for life in this cell are of unknown function, and showed that many are highly conserved in numerous species. All the bioinformatics studies over the past 20 years have underestimated the number of essential genes by focusing only on the known world. This is an important observation that we are carrying forward into the study of the human genome,  said Dr. Venter, Founder, Executive Chairman, and CEO, JCVI. The research to construct the first minimal synthetic cell at JCVI was the culmination of 20 years of research that began in 1995 after the genome sequencing of the first free-living organism, Haemophilus influenza, followed by the sequencing of Mycoplasma genitalium. A comparison of these two genomes revealed a common set of 256 genes which the team thought could be a minimal set of genes needed for viability. In 1999 Dr. Hutchison led a team who published a paper describing the use of global transposon mutagenesis techniques to identify the nonessential genes in M. genitalium. Over the last 50 years more than 2,000 publications have contemplated minimal cells and their use in elucidating first principals of biology. From the start, the goal of the JCVI team was similar build a minimal operating system of a cell to understand biology but to also have a desirable chassis for use in industrial applications. The creation of the first synthetic cell in 2010 did not inform new genome design principles since the M. mycoides genome was mostly recapitulated as in nature. Rather, it established a work flow for building and testing whole genome designs, including a minimal cell, from the bottom up starting from a genome sequence. To create JCVI-syn3.0, the team used an approach of whole genome design and chemical synthesis followed by genome transplantation to test if the cell was viable. Their first attempt to minimize the genome began with a simple approach using information in the biochemical literature and some limited transposon mutagenesis work, but this did not result in a viable genome. After improving transposon methods, they discovered a set of quasi-essential genes that are necessary for robust growth which explained the failure of their first attempt. To facilitate debugging of non-functional reduced genome segments, the team built the genome in eight segments at a time so that each could be tested separately before combining them to generate a minimal genome. The team also explored gene order and how that affects cell growth and viability, noting that gene content was more critical to cell viability than gene order. They went through three cycles of designing, building, and testing ensuring that the quasi-essential genes remained, which in the end resulted in a viable, self-replicating minimal synthetic cell that contained just 473 genes, 35 of which are RNA-coding. In addition, the cell contains a unique 16S gene sequence. The team was able to assign biological function to the majority of the genes with 41% of them responsible for genome expression information, 18% related to cell membrane structure and function, 17% related to cytosolic metabolism, and 7% preservation of genome information. However, a surprising 149 genes could not be assigned a specific biological function despite intensive study. This remains an area of continued work for the researchers. ""This paper represents more than five years of work by an amazingly talented group of people. Our goal is to have a cell for which the precise biological function of every gene is known,"" said Dr. Hutchison, Distinguished Professor, JCVI. The team concludes that a major outcome of this minimal cell program are new tools and semi-automated processes for whole genome synthesis. Many of these synthetic biology tools and services are commercially available through SGI and SGI-DNA including a synthetic DNA construction service specializing in building large and complex DNA fragments including combinatorial gene libraries, Archetype  genomics software, Gibson Assembly  kits, and the BioXp , which is a benchtop instrument for producing accurate synthetic DNA fragments. ""This paper signifies a major step toward our ability to design and build synthetic organisms from the bottom up with predictable outcomes.

This allows doctors to target treatments specific to the patient s condition, and deliver the right treatment at the right time in the right dose.  This  precision medicine  approach improves safety and effectiveness as patients are treated on an individual basis.  The new partnership will use data from work on cancer and inflammatory disease biomarkers led by Professor Tony Whetton which is pioneering the application of  proteomics , the large-scale analysis of proteins using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry instruments. This enables the screening of patients for new protein diagnostic and disease markers and the segmentation of patient groups which can benefit from specific therapies and drug treatments. This approach can also help reduce the risk of patients receiving treatments that cause harmful side-effects. In one example of the potential of this work, Professor Whetton and colleagues recently discovered a new biomarker for risk of ovarian cancer. Professor Whetton said,  We are industrialising the approach to finding new biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis and responses to therapy in medicine.  This process will generate huge quantities of data and researchers from the University of Dundee will provide specialised software solutions for managing the big data involved in applying precision medicine.

It s the major component of natural gas and shale gas and, when burned, is an effective fuel. But it s also a major contributor to climate change, with 24 times greater potency as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. With a new method, a research team led by chemists at the University of Pennsylvania has demonstrated the potential to use methane not as a fossil fuel but as a versatile chemical building block with which to make more complex molecules, such as pharmaceuticals and other value-added substances. The reaction also offers a way of taking advantage of the properties of methane without releasing greenhouse gases.  Finding ways to use methane besides burning it as a fuel constitutes a practical approach to using this abundant gas,  said Daniel J. Mindiola, senior author on the paper and a Presidential Professor in Penn s Department of Chemistry in the School of Arts & Sciences.  Our method will hopefully provide inspiration to move away from burning our resources and instead using them more as a carbon building block to prepare more valuable materials.  Mindiola collaborated on the work with Kyle T. Smith, a graduate student in Mindiola s lab and the paper s lead author; Simon Berritt, director of Penn s High Throughput Screening Center based in the Department of Chemistry; Mariano Gonz lez-Moreiras, a visiting scholar; Seihwan Ahn and Mu-Hyun Baik of Korea s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Milton R. Smith III, a professor at Michigan State University who, together with Robert Maleczka, first discovered the chemical reaction known as carbon-hydrogen borylation upon which the current work builds. Methane is comprised of a carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. When it is burned, all four of the carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and water, both of which are greenhouse gases.  If only one or two hydrogen bonds could be broken efficiently, then it might be possible to connect carbon atoms from two or more methane molecules to make larger hydrocarbons,  said Michigan State s Smith.  For example, gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons containing between four and 12 carbon atoms. The polyethylene used to make garbage bags and milk jugs is composed of millions of carbon atoms.  Selectively controlling the carbon-hydrogen bonds has been difficult, however. Chemists have therefore considered methane relatively inert unless burned. In addition, because methane is a gas at ambient temperatures and pressures, it is not the easiest chemical to manipulate. But Mindiola had a brainstorm: what if he tried a borylation reaction using methane while varying pressure conditions? Carbon-hydrogen borylation is a process developed by Smith and colleagues in which a hydrocarbon reacts with a boron-containing compound, catalyzed by a metal. The reaction results in the replacement of a carbon-hydrogen bond on the hydrocarbon with a carbon-boron bond. This bond can then later be easily swapped to bond the carbon to any number of other chemical groups. Though borylation was discovered more than a decade ago, no one had tried it using methane, the simplest of hydrocarbons. The researchers decided to attempt this. Taking advantage of known conditions reported in the literature for other substrates, they determined the right combination of compounds and catalysts that might work, then used a computational approach to evaluate different conditions and reagents that might improve the reaction s efficiency. Finally, they used Penn s High Throughput Screening Center, one of only a handful of such facilities in the country, which allows for the testing of 96 different reactions at once, to identify the most efficient conditions for the reaction. The Penn facility is unique in that it allows for reactions to be done under high-pressure conditions, which permitted the team to use methane in a gaseous state as opposed to working under ambient conditions. The most favorable reaction, conducted under relatively mild conditions of 150 degrees Celsius and 500 pound per square inch of methane, using the metal iridium as a catalyst, resulted in yields as high as 52 percent borylated methane with high selectivity for the carbon-hydrogen borylation of one C-H bond as opposed to multiple bonds.  It turns out methane is not as inert as one would have expected,  Mindiola said.  We were able to borylate it using off-the-shelf reagents, which is very convenient.  The team is currently evaluating other reagents to do a similar reaction. For example, they are trying to find alternative catalysts because iridium, though commercially available, is relatively rare and expensive. Cobalt may offer a promising alternative. They are also testing silicon compounds as an alternative to those containing the rarer boron. Methane is currently so abundant that the petrochemical industry burns upwards of $50 million of methane each year in gas flares, in part due to a lack of storage capacity. And while some methane is used for steam reforming, a process that forms carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be used in fuel cells or to make ammonia for fertilizers, the researchers believe the borylation reaction can offer a meaningful alternative use for methane.  I think this work is going to inspire a lot of chemistry and get people thinking about methane in a different way,  Mindiola said.  That doesn t mean that the natural gas industry is going to borylate all the methane they re extracting   there is a lot out there and boron is rare   but it s another valuable option.  Mindiola noted that this work complements another paper, published in the same issue of Science, led by the University of Michigan s Melanie Sanford. That report identifies a way to perform borylation of methane s carbon-hydrogen bonds selectively, borylating either one or two bonds, and to expand this method to the second most abundant hydrocarbon, ethane. Implementing both reactions could make it more feasible for methane to be used by the pharmaceutical industry as well as many others to craft designer molecules with a plethora of uses.

Our new system could facilitate cheaper, safer and more efficient industrial reactions across a variety of sectors dependent on synthesis of organic compounds,  said Morteza Khaledi, dean of UTA s College of Science and co-investigator of the project.  Using water as a solvent is ideal as it is benign, plentiful, cheap and not harmful to the environment.  The new medium, 80-90 percent water with fluoroalcohol, supports the synthetic reaction of organic compounds and even produces considerably higher yields of product than pure organic solvents. The system also demonstrates the additional advantage that the mixture forms two separate phases during the reaction, which means that the resulting products can be easily separated and centrifuged out of the mixture.  Typically, additional organic solvents are used to facilitate the separation and extraction of product.  This is a clear step forward towards a  green  organic synthesis process and fits into UTA s strategic focus on Global Environmental Impact within the Strategic Plan 2020,  Dean Khaledi said.  The organic solvent can even be recycled after the reaction, which is an additional bonus for the environment.    These efficiencies are outlined by Dean Khaledi and his co-investigator, Nathaniel Weisner, a chemistry graduate student at North Carolina State University, in the Royal Society of Chemistry Green Chemistry paper,  Organic Synthesis in fluoroalcohol-water two-phase systems.  Co-investigator Nathaniel Weisner of North Carolina State University added  We stumbled onto this reaction when we were investigating a completely different project. However, this  serendipitous  research really opens up whole new opportunities to improve the environmental impact of the organic synthesis process that is the basis of so many of the products that surround us.  Dean Khaledi joined UTA in early 2015 as Dean of Science, after chairing the chemistry department at North Carolina State University.  He is an unquestioned leader in separation science, an important branch of analytical chemistry, who is particularly known for his studies of certain separation methods like micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography, a useful technique for analyzing a wide variety of small molecules. His current research is focused on a new class of coacervates, or tiny droplets of assorted organic molecules. The novel coacervates are effective for extracting and enriching a variety of chemicals from biological and environmental samples. They also help in characterization of the proteins within a cell, a process with applications in the areas of drug discovery, biology and biomedicine. Other areas of research include protein identification and characterization, portable biosensing and electrokinetic chromatography. ","Published: March 29, 2016"

The Company received notification of clearance from the FDA on March 25, 2016. This is Great Basin s first multiplex panel to receive FDA clearance, adding to the value and versatility of the company s analyzer, which is capable of performing low-plex, multiplex and direct-from-specimen assays. Great Basin s Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel is a sample-to-result, automated, DNA multiplex assay for simultaneous identification of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus species directly from positive blood cultures in about 2 hours. The panel also detects the mecA gene, a major drug resistance marker that confers resistance to methicillin and other beta-lactams and creates the superbug MRSA. The assay workflow maintains Great Basin s dedication to ease of use with less than one minute of hands-on time and no results interpretation due to the electronic results reporting. The multiplex panel is run on the Great Basin Analyzer, which also performs the company s commercially available low-plex tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS), as well as the company s stand-alone molecular test for Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) detection. Patients with a positive blood culture are generally treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control, 20 to 50 percent of all positive blood cultures are likely false positives due to contamination caused by Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), many of which   like S. epidermidis  are part of the normal flora of human skin and are not dangerous. The Great Basin Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel clearly identifies CoNS, giving care providers the data they need to quickly and more effectively manage patient treatment and reduce the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. A more complete diagnostic test drives disease-appropriate treatment that supports antimicrobial stewardship, saving this last line of defense in the battle against antibiotic resistance and also helping lower treatment cost to patients, the hospital, and the healthcare system.  Receiving FDA clearance for our Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel   our second FDA clearance this month   marks a major milestone in our growth as a Company,  said Ryan Ashton, cofounder and Chief Executive Officer of Great Basin Scientific.  This menu expansion to four products, along with the five tests we plan to bring to clinical trial in 2016, will add further value for our customers who rely on our analyzer system to perform a greater variety of tests. The customer feedback we ve received is that we are truly meeting the needs of the small and midsized hospital labs with our superior menu versatility, cost efficiency and customer service.  Great Basin expects to offer the panel at a significantly lower cost than other molecular blood panels on the market today, making fast, easy diagnosis of staph-caused blood sepsis affordable for the small to medium hospitals the Company serves.","Published: March 29, 2016"

Although new genomically-targeted therapies may have significant benefit for patients, studies have demonstrated that only two-thirds of NSCLC patients undergo appropriate EGFR molecular testing for mutations amenable to FDA approved targeted therapies. Fewer than one-third of these patients undergo guideline-recommended comprehensive genotyping beyond EGFR and ALK testing. Through the collaboration, the companies will explore testing rates, repeat biopsies and their resulting complications, delays in result reporting, costs of invasive tissue biopsies, and other factors that preclude routine application of genotyping which may significantly improve patient outcomes. The Guardant360  comprehensive next generation sequencing test permits identification of all guideline-recommended somatic genomic mutations from a simple blood draw, and may obviate the need for repeat invasive tissue biopsies in advanced cancer patients. This collaboration will also include cost-benefit and outcomes analysis to define the clinical utility of a blood-based genotyping approach for treatment selection in patients with advanced NSCLC, which is of interest to both medical oncologists and managed care organizations. Andrew Pecora M.D FACP CPE founder of COTA and inventor of the technology said,  In the era of personalized medicine, if we truly want to realize the dream of every patient receiving optimal care resulting in the best possible outcome at the best price, we must address the common, incomplete, up front diagnostic assessment of patients with cancer, including genomic profiling of their cancer.  This collaboration utilizes COTA s analytic expertise, proprietary technologies, and unique real-world data to evaluate current challenges in the diagnostic approach to patients with advanced NSCLC. COTA s close relationship with provider organizations also permits iterative educational processes to improve physician practices and clinical/economic outcomes. COTA has developed a breakthrough, patented system for classifying cancer patients, the COTA Nodal Addresses (CNA), which enables a sensitive and precise detection of variance in chosen treatments, clinical outcomes and costs. COTA has unparalleled depth in the economics of oncology, and has extensive involvement in enabling value-based reimbursement models with various payers across the country.  With the costs of cancer care rising every year, patients, health systems and payers are all demanding better care at lower costs,  said Helmy Eltoukhy, Guardant Health CEO.  New technologies should not only push the envelope in terms of clinical utility, they should also provide greater value. We re excited about this partnership with COTA to help demonstrate this with real-world data. ","Published: March 29, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mutation-that-causes-rare-disease-201766,Mutation That Causes Rare Disease A mutation has been discovered that causes a rare systemic disorder known as XLPDR and confirmed a role for nucleic acids in immune function  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers have discovered a mutation that causes a rare systemic disorder known as X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR) and, significantly, the unexpected cellular mechanism by which the mutation causes the disease. For Tom Vansyckle, who had sat with his sons in so many hospital rooms and read every word he could find about XLPDR for two decades, it was an emotional moment when Dr. Andrew Zinn, Dean of the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, told him that the genetic mutation linked to his sons  disorder had been found. The research appears in Nature Immunology.  It felt like a dream,  Mr. Vansyckle said.  I called Dr. Zinn the next morning and asked him,  Is this really real or did I dream that this happened?    Symptoms of XLPDR, a hereditary X chromosome-linked disease, include blotchy skin pigmentation, unusual facial features, inability to sweat, and recurrent bacterial lung infections. The condition also causes cornea scarring, leading to blindness in many patients. Currently, XLPDR patients are treated for their lung infections in the same manner as cystic fibrosis patients, with hospitalizations and weeklong courses of antibiotics. For vision loss, corneal transplantation has been tried in a few cases, with disappointing results. Although the study s findings do not translate into an immediate cure for patients such as the Vansyckles, they hold promise for development of therapies targeted at the now-known mutation that causes XLPDR: the POLA1 gene, a core enzyme involved in DNA replication. This gene long has been known to code for an essential component in an enzyme involved in DNA replication, DNA polymerase alpha, but the research revealed a surprising second role for the gene. Dr. Zinn, also a Professor of Internal Medicine and in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, began working to identify the genetic mutation that causes this disease after he met the Vansyckle family of Waco. Although Dr. Zinn narrowed the genetic location of the mutation, for years he was unable to pinpoint it precisely through standard techniques. Whole-genome sequencing brought the answer. The mutation, as it turned out, was not in an exon   a part of a gene that codes for proteins   but rather in a non-coding intron section of DNA.  Genes are like beads on a string, with the beads representing exons that are spliced together after the intervening pieces of string, or introns, are clipped out. Since the majority of known disease-causing mutations affect proteins, geneticists normally are focused on exons,  explained Dr. Zinn.  This intron mutation results in aberrant splicing, decreasing POLA1 protein expression.  In the next phase of the study, researchers attempted to understand how the genetic mutation led to the phenotype of this disease, including the immunodeficiency and spontaneous inflammation of various organs that occur. Dr. Ezra Burstein, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Biology, and Dr. Petro Starokadomskyy, research scientist, made a connection between POLA1 deficiency and an immune reaction in the cytoplasm, or fluid portion, of cells.  When you examine cells of XLPDR patients under the microscope, they look like they are constantly responding to a viral infection. But in reality, they are not infected with anything,  Dr. Starokadomskyy said.  Interestingly, these patients instead get repeated bacterial and fungal infections, particularly in the lungs. It s like their bodies are exhausted by constant antiviral alarms, and so they cannot respond to real threats.  The researchers pinpointed the cause of this unusual state as constant activation of the interferon pathway   the body s principal cellular system for fighting viral infections.  It s been known for 70 years that POLA1 plays a role in the copying of DNA during cell division in the nucleus of the cell, but now we have identified a second function for POLA1 in calming immune responses that take place in the cytoplasm of the cell,  Dr. Burstein said.  These patients are both inflamed and immunodeficient at the same time. They have a signature of autoinflammation that is very similar to diseases that involve mutations in enzymes of nucleic acid metabolism. Our research revealed a role for this replicative polymerase as a modulator of interferon activation through the generation of RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytoplasm of cells,  Dr. Burstein said. The main pathways to activate interferon production begin with the recognition of foreign nucleic acids, a process by which cells typically detect viruses. The research demonstrates that the generation of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids modulates the sensitivity of cellular sensors. When the levels of cytosolic RNA:DNA are reduced, as is the case in XLPDR, cells get spontaneously activated, setting in motion the first steps that lead to the disease. Worldwide, only 14 families are known to have XLPDR, though there could be others that have been misdiagnosed, as the Vansyckle brothers initially were, with cystic fibrosis. For years, UT Southwestern researchers have been gathering information about families with XLPDR from across the globe. Tyler Vansyckle, 25, who is a video game enthusiast, and his artsy brother Spencer Vansyckle, 20, who writes poetry, were both born with the disease, though it was some time before their condition was diagnosed. Because they suffered so many lung infections, doctors thought the boys had cystic fibrosis until a dermatologist, noting their unusual skin coloration, researched their  reverse freckles  and correctly diagnosed XLPDR. It was then that Dr. Zinn began working with the Vansyckle family, seeking the genetic cause of this exceedingly rare disease. Beyond finally revealing a disease cause, UT Southwestern s research suggests a potential treatment route.  Finding a way to block or slow the interferon pathway could someday help these patients,  Dr. Burstein said. Knowing that medical understanding about his sons  condition is advancing   and even just knowing that there are others in the world with this disease   is comforting for Tom Vansyckle.  For years, we thought we were the only ones in the world,  he said. Additionally, pinpointing the mutation means that girls in families with XLPDR can be screened to see if they are carriers.

The findings could help explain the origin of type 2 diabetes, particularly in children of obese mothers. This study reveals an unanticipated regulatory role of leptin on the parasympathetic nervous system during embryonic development, which may have important implications for understanding the early mechanisms that contribute to diabetes. The findings are published online by the journal Cell Reports in advance of print publication on April 5. See Also: Unexpected origin for important parts of the nervous system The autonomic nervous system, made up of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, is essential for the regulation of blood glucose levels by directly controlling insulin secretion by the pancreas. Insulin secretion and blood glucose levels are also regulated by hormonal factors, including leptin, and dysregulation of pancreatic function and insulin secretion is a hallmark of diabetes.  We showed that exposure of the embryonic mouse brain to leptin during a key developmental period resulted in permanent alternations in the growth of neurons from the brain stem to the pancreas, resulting in long-term disturbances to the balance of insulin levels in the adult mouse ,  said Sebastien G. Bouret, PhD, researcher in the developmental neuroscience program at CHLA. Looking at when autonomic innervation occurred creating direct connections between the brain and pancreatic   cells and the factors influencing it during embryonic development, the scientists found that leptin receptors are highly expressed in the brain stem.  When the scientists injected a single dose of leptin directly into the brain of mouse embryos during mid-gestation, it had a permanent effect of reducing connectivity between brain stem and pancreas.

This study reveals an unanticipated regulatory role for the leptin hormone known to be produced by fat cells.

The Phase 2 open-label study will be conducted in collaboration with the Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology and Hematology, and will enroll up to 24 donor/recipient pairs, aged 18-70. The trial is designed to evaluate the ability of BL-8040, as a single agent, to promote stem cell mobilization for allogeneic transplantation. On the donor side, the primary endpoint of the study is the ability of a single injection of BL-8040 to mobilize sufficient amounts of cells for transplantation following up to two leukapheresis collections. On the recipient side, the study aims to evaluate the functionality and engraftment following transplantation of the BL-8040 collected graft.

Davis, the Warren and Katharine Schlinger Professor of Chemical Engineering at Caltech. ""The ability to target tumors is one of the primary reasons for using nanoparticles as therapeutics to treat solid tumors."" The findings, published online the week of March 21 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrate that nanoparticle-based therapies can act as a ""precision medicine"" for targeting tumors while leaving healthy tissue intact. In the study, Davis and his colleagues examined gastric tumors from nine human patients both before and after infusion with a drug camptothecin that was chemically bound to nanoparticles about 30 nanometers in size. ""Our nanoparticles are so small that if one were to increase the size to that of a soccer ball, the increase in size would be on the same order as going from a soccer ball to the planet Earth,"" says Davis, who is also a member of the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, where the clinical trial was conducted. The team found that 24 to 48 hours after the nanoparticles were administered, they had localized in the tumor tissues and released their drug cargo, and the drug had the intended biological effects of inhibiting two proteins that are involved in the progression of the cancer. Equally important, both the nanoparticles and the drug were absent from healthy tissue adjacent to the tumors. The nanoparticles are designed to be flexible delivery vehicles. ""We can attach different drugs to the nanoparticles, and by changing the chemistry of the bond linking the drug to the nanoparticle, we can alter the release rate of the drug to be faster or slower,"" says Andrew Clark, a graduate student in Davis's lab and the study's first author. Davis says his team's findings suggest that a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is at work in humans. In the EPR effect, abnormal blood vessels that are ""leakier"" than normal blood vessels in healthy tissue allow nanoparticles to preferentially concentrate in tumors. Until now, the existence of the EPR effect has been conclusively proven only in animal models of human cancers. ""Our results don't prove the EPR effect in humans, but they are completely consistent with it,"" Davis says. The findings could also help pave the way toward more effective cancer drug cocktails that can be tailored to fight specific cancers and that leave patients with fewer side effects. ""Right now, if a doctor wants to use multiple drugs to treat a cancer, they often can't do it because the cumulative toxic effects of the drugs would not be tolerated by the patient,"" Davis says. ""With targeted nanoparticles, you have far fewer side effects, so it is anticipated that a drug combination can be selected based on the biology and medicine rather than the limitations of the drugs.""","Published: March 26, 2016"

This research gives us ideas about new ways to treat liver damage or chronic liver disease,  said senior author Dr. Hao Zhu, an Assistant Professor at CRI with joint appointments in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at UT Southwestern Medical Center. The study was published this week in the journal Cell Stem Cell. Tails in lizards and arms in starfish show an astounding ability to regrow, but mammals have partially lost the capacity to extensively regenerate body parts, Dr. Zhu said. The liver is unique among human solid organs in its robust regenerative capability. A healthy liver can regenerate up to 70 percent of its tissue after injury, he explained. However, when the liver has been repeatedly damaged   by chemical toxins or chronic disease   it loses its ability to regenerate. Following repeated injuries, cirrhosis or scar tissue forms, greatly increasing the risk of cancer, said Dr. Zhu, who also treats liver cancer patients at Parkland Memorial Hospital. The Zhu laboratory studies both regeneration, when cells proliferate to repair an organ, and cancer, when cells proliferate out of control. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reports that liver cancer deaths increased at the highest rate of all common cancers from 2003-2012. In addition to cirrhosis, risk factors for liver cancer include infections caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), liver damage from alcohol or other toxins, chronic liver disease, and certain rare genetic disorders. Dr. Zhu began his investigation by studying a mouse that lacked Arid1a, the mouse version of a gene associated with some human cancers.  In humans, the gene ARID1A is mutated in several cancers, including liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, the list goes on,  Dr. Zhu said.  It is not mutated in every type of cancer, but in a significant number. Those mutations are found in 10 to 20 percent of all cancers, and the mutations render the gene inactive.  Based on this association, the researchers hypothesized that mice lacking Arid1a would develop liver damage and, eventually, liver cancer. They were surprised when the opposite proved to be the case   no liver damage occurred. In fact, livers of the mice regenerated faster and appeared to function better, he added.  The livers were resistant to tissue damage and healed better, which are two good things   like playing offense and defense at the same time,  he said.  These results opened up a whole new avenue of investigation for us, and through that investigation we found a new function for this gene.  On observation, livers in the mice without the gene appeared healthier. Blood tests confirmed improved liver function. When researchers deleted the gene in mice with various liver injuries, they found that the livers replaced tissue mass quicker and showed reduced fibrosis in response to chemical injury. Also, other tissues such as wounded skin healed faster in Arid1a-deficient mice. No drugs are currently available to mimic a lack of this protein, although the researchers are using a grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) to search for one.  We want to identify small molecules that mimic the effect of these genetic findings. The ideal drug would be one that helps the liver heal while inhibiting the development of cancer. That would be the perfect drug for my patients,  said Dr. Zhu, a CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research. Dr. Zhu said loss of the gene and the protein it expresses may accelerate regeneration by reorganizing how genes are packaged in the genome so that the cells can more easily switch back and forth toward a more regenerative state, sort of like a toggle switch.  Somehow, loss of this gene seems to make it easier for the cell to go back and forth,  he said.  This study opens up new areas to investigate how to rejuvenate tissues without necessarily increasing cancer risk, although many more tests will have to be done to determine how the risk of all types of liver cancers are altered.

Similarly, women who drank more than two daily caffeinated beverages during the first seven weeks of pregnancy were also more likely to miscarry. However, women who took a daily multivitamin before conception and through early pregnancy were less likely to miscarry than women who did not. The study was published online in Fertility and Sterility.  Our findings provide useful information for couples who are planning a pregnancy and who would like to minimize their risk for early pregnancy loss,  said the study s first author, Germaine Buck Louis, Ph.D., director of the Division of Intramural Population Health Research at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The researchers analyzed data from the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) Study, which was established to examine the relationship between fertility, lifestyle and exposure to environmental chemicals. The LIFE Study enrolled 501 couples from four counties in Michigan and 12 counties in Texas, from 2005 to 2009. For the current study, researchers compared such lifestyle factors as cigarette use, caffeinated beverage consumption and multivitamin use among 344 couples with a singleton pregnancy from the weeks before they conceived through the seventh week of pregnancy. The researchers reported their results using a statistical concept known as a hazard ratio, which estimates the chances of a particular health outcome occurring during the study time frame. For example, the researchers evaluated caffeinated beverage consumption in terms of the daily likelihood of pregnancy loss over a given time period. A score greater than 1 indicates an increased risk for pregnancy loss each day following conception, and a score less than 1 indicates a reduced daily risk. Of the 344 pregnancies, 98 ended in miscarriage, or 28 percent. For the preconception period, miscarriage was associated with female age of 35 or above, for a hazard ratio of 1.96 (nearly twice the miscarriage risk of younger women). The study was not designed to conclusively prove cause and effect. The study authors cited possible explanations for the higher risk, including advanced age of sperm and egg in older couples or cumulative exposure to substances in the environment, which could be expected to increase as people age. Both male and female consumption of more than two caffeinated beverages a day also was associated with an increased hazard ratio: 1.74 for females and 1.73 for males. Earlier studies, the authors noted, have documented increased pregnancy loss associated with caffeine consumption in early pregnancy. However, those studies could not rule out whether caffeine consumption contributed to pregnancy loss or was a sign of an unhealthy pregnancy. It s possible, the authors wrote, that these earlier findings could have been the result of a healthy pregnancy, rather than caffeine consumption interfering with pregnancy. For example, the increase in food aversions and vomiting associated with a healthy pregnancy led the women to give up caffeinated beverages. Because their study found caffeine consumption before pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of miscarriage, it s more likely that caffeinated beverage consumption during this time directly contributes to pregnancy loss.  Our findings also indicate that the male partner matters, too,  Dr. Buck Louis said.  Male preconception consumption of caffeinated beverages was just as strongly associated with pregnancy loss as females .  Finally, the researchers saw a reduction in miscarriage risk for women who took a daily multivitamin. During the preconception period, researchers found a hazard ratio of 0.45   a 55-percent reduction in risk for pregnancy loss. Women who continued to take the vitamins through early pregnancy had a hazard ratio of 0.21, or a risk reduction of 79 percent. The authors cited other studies that found that vitamin B6 and folic acid   included in preconception and pregnancy vitamin formulations   can reduce miscarriage risk. Folic acid supplements are recommended for women of childbearing age, as their use in the weeks leading up to and following conception reduces the risk for having a child with a neural tube defect. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer information on the steps men and women of reproductive age can take to help ensure they have a healthy baby   whether they are planning pregnancy or not.","Published: March 25, 2016"

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/beating-the-backlog-in-criminal-investigations-187880,Beating the Backlog in Criminal Investigations Andrew Sheldon  Chief Technical Officer at UK Digital Forensics specialists Evidence Talks  says there is a way to beat the backlog in processing digital evidence  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In late 2015 the BBC s 5 Live Programme reported that more than 1800 cases of suspected child abuse were waiting to be processed by specialist high-tech police crime units. In one instance a case had been delayed by 21 months despite assurances from Home Office Minister Karen Bradley that the government has prioritised child sexual abuse as a national threat. The report went on to highlight the fact that more than 20 police forces responding to a freedom of information response (representing over 50% of the replies) admitted to delays of 3 months or more. Working on the very reasonable assumption that police forces place the highest priority on allegations of child abuse, the implied backlog of forensic analysis across all types of crime is a matter of real concern. The answer, however, may well not lie in the high-tech units themselves but in taking some of the work away from them. Sophisticated digital forensic technology is now available to police forces in the form of a USB3 thumb drive or Mac expansion card that turns suitable laptops into fully capable forensic intelligence devices which can be used by officers without the need for high-tech crime skills. Nothing frustrates Police, the Judiciary, Parliament and the public more than delays in bringing miscreants to trial, caused by backlogs in handling, processing and submission of evidence.In the field of Digital Forensics, however, the use of triage tools has the potential to short-circuit the lengthy process of seize   image   carve (recover)   index   review   report and potentially reduce backlogs and waiting time by a substantial amount. Two fundamental problems currently exist with digital evidence which contribute to the backlog problem. First, labs cannot economically scale their in-house forensic investigation or cope effectively with unforeseen and high priority incidents, for example, those likely to involve Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) and counter-terror response. In addition, opportunities for identifying data of potential intelligence value are generally limited to cell phone forensics which may be case specific and held locally. There is little capability or attempt to identify, capture and process material from much richer computer sources at local, regional or national level. With the rapid increase in availability and use of more and more powerful, affordable and mobile devices the problems, if not addressed, can only get worse. The Internet Advertising Bureau reported in 2014 that more than 1 in 4 British consumers owned a tablet and worldwide mobile device usership has outstripped desktop equivalents approaching a phenomenal 2,000 million users, according to Morgan Stanley Research. Research firm EMarketer reported in March 2015 that there would be 32.8 million British tablet users in that year. Add to this the fact that all types of devices have massively increased their storage capacity   a typical laptop drive now offers something in the region of 1Terabytes and it s getting bigger with the release in 2015 of a 16TB laptop drive. Putting this into context, 1 Gigabyte could hold the contents of about 10 yards of books on a shelf, 100 Gigabytes could hold an entire library floor of academic journals and one Terabyte is equivalent to 1000 Gigabytes. Using advanced technology is not something exclusively for criminals, however. Using standard removable USB devices as  collectors  of data, digital triage data acquisition and automated analysis is enabled simultaneously on multiple targets. Technology also exists to extend the triage stage to include both forensic imaging and automated anlaysis in one complete process. For hard-pressed front-line officers to reclaim their role in the processing of evidence, clearly traditional methods are not going to work. High-tech specialist units are understandably unwilling to clear backlogs of  everyday  crime such as burglary, bike theft and shoplifting while high profile work on child abuse, trafficking or even counter-terrorism are left in abeyance. Police forces that have tested systems such as Evidence Talks SPEKTOR include the City of London Police. They have some 40   50 officers trained in the use of these resources and have rolled out their own programme with providers on a  train the trainer  basis to control costs. In just one case, involving a complex series of unauthorised accesses to a professional institute s network, the force was able to get a rapid conviction under Section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act. In what might otherwise have been a very long drawn out investigation, arrest and seizure on day 1 was followed by interviews with evidence obtained from a laptop on day 2 and an early guilty plea entered on day 3. Not only is the system saving time through an efficient method of identifying and processing evidence, it often means that offenders, faced with compelling forensic evidence, are more likely to plead guilty, raising conviction rates and relieving the judicial system of time and cost.","Published: March 25, 2016"

Patent US 9,274,101 was issued on March 1, 2016. The new patent further expands Biolog s coverage of technology for metabolic and phenotypic profiling of human cells at a very high level of resolution. The claims in the patent cover methods for metabolically phenotyping animal cells, creating multiplexed metabolic profiles, and observing effects of chemicals on metabolic substrate utilization. Phenotype MicroArrays represent a fundamental platform technology that allows scientists to easily and efficiently test cellular metabolic traits. Performed in standard disposable 96-well plates, hundreds to thousands of tests can be assayed in parallel. The technology has broad applications in research, ranging from high resolution phenotypic profiling to high throughput screening of cells. Although PM technology is a metabolic assay platform, it differs substantially from mass spectrometry based approaches. Instead of measuring pools of metabolites, PM technology measures rates of metabolic pathways in intact viable cells using a colorimetric redox dye chemistry that couples pathway flux to production of energy (NADH) by cells. Cell energetics drives all cell functions and understanding energy pathways of cells is fundamental to the study of virtually all human disorders. This includes, for example, cancer, aging, neurodegenerative disorders, mitochondrial disorders, cell nutrition, obesity, stem cell differentiation, and immune cell activation. Energetics based metabolic assays also have direct applications in research and development of drugs by analyzing their actions on cells, in toxicology by analyzing off-target actions on cells, and in bioprocess development by optimizing conditions for production of vaccines, antibodies and other biologics. Furthermore, the PM technology provides a much needed complement to the exciting new CRISPR gene editing technology. CRISPR provides the means to create mutations and alter or remove genes, but a phenotypic or phenomic technology such as Biolog's PM technology is needed to assay the effects of the genetic changes on the cells. Such effects are often complex and not easily predicted. The Biolog technology provides the means of accomplishing the phenotyping part of Genotype-Phenotype studies. This approach has been proven over a decade and a half of studies using Biolog PM technology to determine the effects of genetic changes in microbial cells and it will be even more valuable as it becomes broadly applied to mammalian cells. Phenotype MicroArray technology was developed initially for basic research on microbial cells with SBIR funding from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Subsequently, the technology was extended to work on human and other animal cells with funding from the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Mental Health. The technology has now been commercialized and numerous applications have been developed for bacterial, fungal, and animal cells including human primary cells and established cell lines. More than 400 scientific publications have resulted from using PM technology. As such, it has become a new core technology in research and development.","Published: March 25, 2016"

Horvath shares the award with Jennifer Doudna, University of California, Berkeley; Emmanuelle Charpentier, Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin; Rodolphe Barrangou, North Carolina State University; and Feng Zhang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eighty-three of Gairdner Award recipients have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. Horvath, based at DuPont s site in Dang -Saint-Romain, France, is the first DuPont scientist to receive the Canada Gairdner International Award. Earlier this month, he was announced as a 2016 Warren Alpert Foundation Prize winner. He received the 2015 Massry Prize in October.Horvath s initial article, published in Science in 2007, (Barrangou et al., 2007, Science 315, pp. 1709-1712), provided the first biological evidence that CRISPR-Cas constitutes an immunity system against viruses in bacteria. Beginning in the early 2000s, Horvath and colleagues initially utilized CRISPR for bacterial identification, then for its ability to improve the resistance of starter culture strains against bacteriophage attack. The discoveries opened new research avenues, laying the groundwork and inspiring numerous scientists to pursue the CRISPR field.  Scientific discovery is the basis of innovation. It provides knowledge, enables new inventions and inspires learning in new directions that lead to solutions for the world s most difficult challenges,  said DuPont Senior Vice President and Chief Science & Technology Officer Douglas Muzyka.  Philippe s early discoveries were foundational to the potential for CRISPR-Cas to address challenges in a range of scientific fields. The magnitude of his contributions epitomizes what it means to innovate at DuPont, and we are very proud to be associated with his receiving the Gairdner Award.   I am honored to receive the Canada Gairdner International Award on behalf of DuPont and my colleagues,  said Horvath.  Our work has and will continue to have a significant impact, notably in the fight against viral infections during food fermentations. It is obvious that the biotechnological tools for genome editing, derived from the natural CRISPR-Cas system, provide the greatest opportunities in fields such as plant improvement and gene therapy.  DuPont is a leader in the CRISPR area, with about 60 patents and applications and more than 30 published scientific articles and book chapters. The company leverages CRISPR in at least two distinct ways: DuPont Nutrition & Health takes advantage of the native CRISPR-Cas system to select, through a fully natural process, bacteria that are immunized against bacteriophages. The natural immunization process does not involve gene editing technologies. The use of starter cultures containing such immunized bacteria ultimately improves the quality and safety of fermented dairy foods. DuPont Pioneer utilizes CRISPR-derived tools for genome editing applications, and recently announced collaborations with Caribou Biosciences, a leading developer of CRISPR-Cas technologies for genome editing, and Vilnius University, a research leader in the field. The genome editing technology is capable of making exact changes to the DNA of many organisms. In plants, this editing capability can be applied to promote drought tolerance and disease resistance to protect plant health and increase crop yields. It also can eliminate food allergens and improve the nutrient composition of plant-derived oils. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a feature naturally existing in bacteria, providing protection against viruses. DuPont scientists were among the first to understand how the CRISPR system works in bacteria. The RNA-guided Cas9 protein is one of several CRISPR-derived tools and differs from the natural CRISPR process used to identify and immunize bacteria. The Canada Gairdner Awards will be presented on Oct. 27, 2016, at the Royal Ontario Museum. The Canada Gairdner Awards were created in 1959 to recognize and reward the achievements of medical researchers whose work contributes significantly to improving the quality of human life. They are Canada s only globally known and respected international science awards, and Gairdner is the only national organization that consistently brings the world s best biomedical researchers to Canada to share their ideas and work with scientists across the country. In so doing, it enlarges networks and enhances Canada s international reputation, while providing a realistic and unbiased benchmark for Canada s leading scientists. All winners are chosen by an international adjudication committee and all choices are deemed final. DuPont (NYSE: DD) has been bringing world-class science and engineering to the global marketplace in the form of innovative products, materials, and services since 1802. The company believes that by collaborating with customers, governments, NGOs, and thought leaders we can help find solutions to such global challenges as providing enough healthy food for people everywhere, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and protecting life and the environment.","Published: March 25, 2016"

They all begin as stem cells, undifferentiated and with the potential to become any cell in the body. Until now, however, exactly how that happens has been somewhat of a scientific mystery. New research conducted by University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) neuroscientists has deciphered some of the earliest changes that occur before stems cells transform into neurons and other cell types. See Also: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells Working with human embryonic stems cells in petri dishes, postdoctoral fellow Jiwon Jang discovered a new pathway that plays a key role in cell differentiation. The findings appear in the journal Cell. ""Jiwon's discovery is very important because it gives us a fundamental understanding of the way stem cells work and the way they begin to undergo differentiation,"" said senior author Kenneth S. Kosik, the Harriman Professor of Neuroscience Research in UCSB's Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. ""It's a very fundamental piece of knowledge that had been missing in the field."" When stem cells begin to differentiate, they form precursors: neuroectoderms that have the potential to become brain cells, such as neurons; or mesendoderms, which ultimately become cells that comprise organs, muscles, blood and bone. Jang discovered a number of steps along what he and Kosik labeled the PAN (Primary cilium, Autophagy Nrf2) axis. This newly identified pathway appears to determine a stem cell's final form. ""The PAN axis is a very important player in cell fate decisions,"" explained Jang. ""G1 lengthening induces cilia protrusion and the longer those cellular antennae are exposed, the more signals they can pick up."" For some time, scientists have known about Gap 1 (G1), the first of four phases in the cell cycle, but they weren't clear about its role in stem cell differentiation. Jang's research demonstrates that in stem cells destined to become neurons, the lengthening phase of G1 triggers other actions that cause stem cells to morph into neuroectoderms. During this elongated G1 interval, cells develop primary cilia, antennalike protrusions capable of sensing their environment. The cilia activate the cells' trash disposal system in a process known as autophagy. Another important factor is Nrf2, which monitors cells for dangerous molecules such as free radicals a particularly important job for healthy cell formation. Learn More: Stem cells in the brain: limited self-renewal ""Nrf2 is like a guardian to the cell and makes sure the cell is functioning properly,"" said Kosik, co-director of the campus's Neuroscience Research Institute. ""Nrf2 levels are very high in stem cells because stem cells are the future. Without Nrf2 watching out for the integrity of the genome, future progeny are in trouble."" Jang's work showed that levels of Nrf2 begin to decline during the elongated G1 interval. This is significant, Kosik noted, because Nrf2 doesn't usually diminish until the cell has already started to differentiate. ""We thought that, under the same conditions if the cells are identical, that both would differentiate the same way, but that is not what we found,"" Jang said.

Its most common iteration, CMT1, comes in many forms, most of which have to date been linked to a small set of causative genes. New research from the department of Neurology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia recently spanned the globe to uncover a new genetic cause of CMT1. Their findings are published online in the journal Brain. Their findings expand the number of genes known to cause CMT1, further helping neurologists and patients find the genetic underpinnings of their neuropathy. See Also: New treatment for neuropathy? How cone snail venom minimizes pain Charcot-Marie Tooth Disease is a progressive debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that strikes in the second or third decade of life. This disease results in numbness and weakness in the hands and feet. There are two categories of CMT: those caused by the loss of axons in the peripheral nerves (CMT2) and those characterized by a malfunction in the Schwann cells that make up the myelin sheath, the protective coating that surrounds the nerve fibers and allows them to conduct nerve signals at high speeds (CMT1). Penn neurologists studied a father and son with CMT1 who were treated at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, respectively, and did not carry a mutation in any of the five genes known to cause CMT1. The father's parents did not have the disease, suggesting that a new random mutation occurred, not shared by either parent, which he then passed on to one of his three sons. Related: Potential therapy found for incurable Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Through complex genetic sequencing of the father's 20,000 genes, the team was able to identify 49 mutations that could be the cause of the pair's CMT. One mutation, a change in the peripheral myelin protein 2 gene (PMP2), emerged as the most likely culprit. PMP2 encodes a protein that transports fatty acids, which are the building blocks of the myelin sheath and known to be one of the most abundant proteins in peripheral nervous system myelin. Further testing of the father's living siblings, parents and two other sons showed that he and his one affected son were the only family members to carry this mutation. This was strong evidence that mutations in PMP2 cause CMT1, slowing nerve conduction and resulting in weakness and numbness in the hands and feet. ""Next-generation sequencing technology has allowed us to find new causes of genetic diseases in much smaller families,"" explained the study's lead author, William Motley, MD, PhD, a resident physician in Medicine. ""The fact that his parents did not have the disease allowed us to narrow the number of possible mutations, as so few arise between generations. We are fortunate to have these tools to help us provide genetic diagnoses to our patients, sometimes even in cases where the patients have no mutations in known causes of their disease. Traditional genetic techniques would never have allowed us to find the cause of this family's CMT."" Learn More: Possible answer to chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy found in multiple sclerosis drug To provide further evidence of an association between PMP2 mutation and CMT1, the Penn team reached out to an international consortium of CMT researchers to find patients with mutations in the same gene. Working with collaborators at the University of Antwerp, an additional 136 European families with CMT1 were screened for mutations in PMP2. These identified an Austrian family with several affected members who share a mutation in PMP2. Interestingly, the mutation was adjacent to the mutation in the family seen at Penn. ""This has been a highly fulfilling effort. We were able to track down the cause of this family's CMT, help another family, and find a new genetic cause of CMT in the process,"" said senior author, Steven S. Scherer, MD, PhD, the Ruth Wagner Van Meter and J. Ray Van Meter Professor of Neurology and Chief of the Neuromuscular division in the department of Neurology.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/anatomy-pain-284129,The anatomy of pain Emotions consist of general components that are also elicited by similar impressions and specific components  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Emotions consist of general components that are also elicited by similar impressions and specific components -Grimacing, we flinch when we see someone accidentally hit their thumb with a hammer. But is it really pain we feel? Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig and other institutions have now proposed a new theory that describes pain as a multi-layered gradual event which consists of specific pain components, such as a burning sensation in the hand, and more general components, such as negative emotions. A comparison of the brain activation patterns during both experiences could clarify which components the empathic response shares with real pain. See Also:  Pain sensing  gene discovery could help in development of new methods of pain relief Imagine you re driving a nail into a wall with a hammer and accidentally bang your finger. You would probably injure finger tissue, feel physical distress, focus all your attention on your injured finger and take care not to repeat the misfortune. All this describes physical and psychological manifestations of  pain    specifically, so-called nociceptive pain experienced by your body, which is caused by the stimulation of pain receptors. Now imagine that you see a friend injure him or herself in the same way. You would again literally wince and feel pain, empathetic pain in this case. Although you yourself have not sustained any injury, to some extent you would experience the same symptoms: You would feel anxiety; you may recoil to put distance between yourself and the source of the pain; and you would store information about the context of the experience in order to avoid pain in the future. Previous studies have shown that the same brain structures namely the anterior insula and the cingulate cortex are activated, irrespective of whether the pain is personally experienced or empathetic. However, despite this congruence in the underlying activated areas of the brain, the extent to which the two forms of pain really are similar remains a matter of considerable controversy. To help shed light on the matter, neuroscientists, including Tania Singer, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, have now proposed a new theory:  We need to get away from this either-or question, whether the pain is genuine or not.  Learn More: Study finds experience of pain relies on multiple brain pathways, not just one Instead, it should be seen as a complex interaction of multiple elements, which together form the complex experience we call  pain . The elements include sensory processes, which determine, for example, where the pain stimulus was triggered: in the hand or in the foot? In addition, emotional processes, such as the negative feeling experienced during pain, also come into play.  The decisive point is that the individual processes can also play a role in other experiences, albeit in a different activation pattern,  Singer explains   for example, if someone tickles your hand or foot, or you see images of people suffering on television. Other processes, such as the stimulation of pain receptors, are probably highly specific to pain. The neuroscientists therefore propose comparing the elements of direct and empathetic pain: Which elements are shared and which, by contrast, are specific and unique to the each form of pain? A study that was published almost simultaneously by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences and the University of Geneva has provided strong proof of this theory: They were able to demonstrate for the first time that during painful experiences the anterior insula region and the cingulate cortex process both general components, which also occur during other negative experiences such as disgust or indignation, and specific pain information   whether the pain is direct or empathic. The general components signal that an experience is in fact unpleasant and not joyful. The specific information, in turn, tells us that pain   not disgust or indignation   is involved, and whether the pain is being experienced by you or someone else.  Both the nonspecific and the specific information are processed in parallel in the brain structures responsible for pain. But the activation patterns are different,  says Anita Tusche, also a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig and one of the authors of the study. Related: New molecular mechanism of neuropathic pain in mice Thanks to the fact that our brain deals with these components in parallel, we can process various unpleasant experiences in a time-saving and energy-saving manner. At the same time, however, we are able register detailed information quickly, so that we know exactly what kind of unpleasant event has occurred and whether it affects us directly or vicariously.  The fact that our brain processes pain and other unpleasant events simultaneously for the most part, no matter if they are experienced by us or someone else, is very important for social interactions,  Tusche says,  because it helps to us understand what others are experiencing.

A research team at Lund University in Sweden has studied close to 15 000 of these genes alongside each other. The researchers have succeeded in identifying four key genes which, together, govern the growth and multiplication of the stem cells. Every day, over 100 billion new mature blood cells are generated in an adult human. This major production places high demands on the blood stem cells which must be capable both of maturing into specialised blood cells and of self-renewing and multiplying. In a bone marrow transplant (also referred to as a stem cell transplant), the blood stem cells are responsible for the formation of a new blood system. In order to make stem cell transplants safer and available to more patients with diseases such as leukemia or hereditary blood disorders, researchers in many parts of the world are studying how to expand   multiply   blood stem cells. Yet many of the fundamental mechanisms of the process are still unknown.  Clarifying what regulates the balance between multiplication and maturation of blood stem cells could provide the right keys to expanding them outside the body. In addition, it would enable the identification of new points of attack for the treatment of blood cancer, which is precisely a disruption of the balance between multiplication and maturation , explains Roman Galeev, a doctoral student at the Stem Cell Centre at Lund University s Department of Laboratory Medicine, and first author of the study. An important step on the way is to map which of the thousands of human genes affect the regulation of stem cell growth. Through RNA interference, a technique in which individual genes in the stem cells are selectively neutralized, the research team in Lund has succeeded in identifying the genes which affect the regulation of blood stem cells.  The research is unique as the study of so many genes alongside one another is unprecendented. In addition, we have used human blood stem cells, which is difficult in itself as it is requires the gathering of a large amount of material , says Jonas Larsson, Associate Professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine who supervised the study. Of the 15 000 genes that were tested, the research team found around 20 candidates with a strong capacity to affect the balance of growth in the blood stem cells. What was striking was that four of these 20 genes were physically connected through cooperation in a protein complex.  The discovery showed that this protein complex is crucial and has an overarching function in the growth of the blood stem cells , says Jonas Larsson. The protein complex, consisting of the four genes plus one further gene, is called cohesin and forms a sort of brace which holds different parts of the DNA strand together in the cell. The researchers believe that this allows the cohesin complex to control access to the  on/off switches  in the DNA, and to change the impulses the blood stem cells receive from various genes, thereby affecting cell division. The blood stem cell either multiplies or matures to become a specialised cell with other tasks. Independently of the Lund researchers  discovery, other research in the field of blood cancer has recently identified mutations in the exact same four genes in patients with various forms of blood cancer:  This is incredibly exciting! Together with the results from our study, this indicates that the cohesin genes are directly and crucially significant in the development of blood cancer. Our findings entail a new understanding of how the expansion of blood stem cells is controlled. Eventually, this can lead to new ways of affecting the process, either to prevent the development of cancer or to expand the stem cells for transplant , concludes Roman Galeev.","Published: March 24, 2016"

The acquisition will give Bristol-Myers Squibb full rights to Padlock s Protein/Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase (PAD) inhibitor discovery program focused on the development of potentially transformational treatment approaches for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Padlock s PAD discovery program may have additional utility in treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. PADs are a family of enzymes that produce autoantigens which play an active role in the development and progression of RA and other autoimmune diseases. Inhibiting PADs offers the potential to prevent progression of autoimmune diseases early in their evolution. In identifiable high risk patients with pre- and early-RA, PAD inhibition could lead to a paradigm shift in treatment by preventing disease development and resulting joint destruction. PAD4 inhibition in combination with current standard of care therapies may increase and maintain the durable remission rates in RA patients with rapidly progressive disease.  Targeting PAD enzymes has the potential to be one of the most innovative mechanisms for treating autoimmunity which both strengthens and accelerates our immunoscience pipeline,  said Francis Cuss, MB BChir, FRCP, executive vice president and chief scientific officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb.  By pursuing a treatment approach which may address disease progression earlier, we hope to transform the lives of patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases.   By targeting PADs, it may be possible to eliminate the antigens that drive autoimmunity with limited impact on the immune system, thereby creating breakthrough treatments,  said Michael Gilman, PhD, founder and chief executive officer, Padlock Therapeutics.  In Bristol-Myers Squibb, we found an excellent home for our program based on their deep commitment to science and developing transformational therapies. We are confident that Bristol-Myers Squibb can leverage the scientific foundation built by Padlock's founders, team, and advisors to help patients with serious autoimmune diseases.  Bristol-Myers Squibb is building on learnings from extensive clinical and patient experience in immunoscience to seek entirely new mechanisms that are both innovative and differentiated not only for RA, but other immune-system disorders where significant unmet medical need remains. The company has a strong early clinical and discovery immunoscience pipeline which includes several novel compounds that offer first-in-class and a best-in-disease opportunities targeting long-term remission.","Published: March 24, 2016"

Also authors compiled a list of the most promising compounds.  Researchers have identified 11 compounds of great promise. All these substances are currently tested in clinical trials. In other words, at the stage of preclinical studies they demonstrated the necessary qualities.  Sometimes researchers spend more than ten years before they can produce a new registered drug from a promising molecule. Initially, the scientists check the substance on cell culture   this gives them a chance to prove that the above substance can actually slow or stop tumor growth. After that, they conduct tests on animals   it is necessary to filter out substances which are effective only in ideal conditions of a test tube, but not in a real organism. Then they perform clinical trials, whereby at the first stage they are only checking the safety - not effectiveness, and whether or not the potential drug reaches the target.  Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Today, the majority of anti-cancer therapies are not selective enough and may have a detrimental effect not only on cancer cells, but on the healthy cells of the body as well. That is why it is so important to develop such drugs that would attack the cancer cells exclusively, which will increase the effectiveness of treatment and reduce the negative impact of therapy on the body as a whole. However, to ensure the drug selectivity, the scientists need some object which is present only in cancer cells - and not anywhere else: a cancer marker.  The well-known marker for prostate cancer is PSA (prostate specific antigen), which is already used in medicine for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, for a number of reasons, PSA is considered as an insufficiently precise target. A promising alternative for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer is PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen). In the case of cancer, prostate tissues contain almost 10 times as many of these markers as healthy tissues of the prostate gland. Also, diagnosis by means of this marker can detect the tiniest metastases (secondary distant tumors).  ""PSMA is one of the most promising biological targets for the development of new hybrids of selective PSMA ligands with antitumor medicinal substances or molecular diagnostic tools for their targeted delivery to the site of the disease -  particularly in the case of prostate cancer,""says Yan Andreevich Ivanenkov, Ph.D (biology), Head of the Laboratory of Medical Chemistry and Bioinformatics, a lecturer in MIPT.  Biocatalyst and target  PSMA, known in English language literature as a prostate specific membrane antigen, catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate into N-acetylaspartate and glutamate. This precise PSMA function was taken into account in order to compile a list of the most promising substances, which form the basis of drugs used for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Hydrolysis is the chemical breakdown of a compound of organic molecules into other compounds: for example, during hydrolysis of proteins, the latter are split into amino acids.  As the authors of the review article state, all molecules capable of binding to PSMA can be divided into three groups: antibodies, aptamers, and ligands.  Antibodies are proteins synthesized by the immune system. Aptamers are peptide molecules or fragments of DNA/RNA, capable of selectively binding to specific target molecules. Ligands are substances of a rather arbitrary nature which interact with the biocatalist, whereby, as a rule, we are talking about direct interaction with its active center: exactly with that part of the molecule which allows it to perform its main function.  Comparing all three groups, the researchers concluded that ligands are the most promising group. Ligands, in our case, are molecules the size and weight of which are most suitable for synthesizing. Besides, they also have good pharmacokinetic parameters.  Pharmacokinetics: This is a science of transformation of chemical substances in the organism. With regard to drugs, it describes what happens to them after they enter the blood vessels or stomach. Any drug that is accepted for clinical trials must neither break down into useless pieces prior to contact with the target, nor produce toxic effects.  From phosphorus to urea and its derivatives  Historically - and we should emphasize that scientists of the whole world have been searching for the ligands compatible with PSMA since the 1990s - phosphorus compounds were among the first ligands of PSMA, which showed high efficacy on cancer cells. However, their pharmacokinetic parameters were insufficient for the conduct of clinical trials.  Later, compounds with -SH groups have become alternatives to phosphorus-containing chemicals. They demonstrated high bioavailability when taking medication by mouth (oral administration), and also they better penetrated the cell membrane. However, these drugs had insufficient selectivity and metabolic stability. That is, they adversely affected not only cancer cells and, besides, they mutated in the course of biochemical reactions in the body.  New class of ligands needed to be free of the deficiencies of their predecessors. The next candidates for treating prostate cancer were the compounds formed on the basis of urea.  Currently, this is the most widely studied type of PSMA ligands.  Urea, also known as carbamide, is used by mammals for the excretion of nitrogen-containing waste from the organism. Apart from this, urea modifications   nitrosourea and similar compounds   have long been used for chemotherapy, thanks to their ability of blocking DNA replication (synthesis of new molecules) and, consequently, cell division.   It is impossible to give a precise answer to the question of how soon PSMA ligands will appear in the clinic. On average, the development of a new medication can take up to 10 years. Currently, these molecules (as potential drugs for the diagnosis of prostate cancer) are in the first and second phases of clinical trials. However, the fact that the PSMA-diagnostics allows the monitoring of tumor growth and development of metastasis, makes this an attractive target for future developments of drugs. The first results are already there, and they are very promising,  Anastasia Aladinskaya, an employee of the Laboratory of Medical Chemistry and Bioinformatics, concludes.","Published: March 24, 2016"

Think again. And a new discovery suggests it s even less human than scientists previously thought. Nineteen new pieces of DNA -- left by viruses that first infected our ancestors hundreds of thousands of years ago -- have just been found, lurking between our own genes. And one stretch of newfound DNA, found in about 50 of the 2,500 people studied, contains an intact, full genetic recipe for an entire virus, say the scientists who published their findings today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Whether or not it can replicate, or reproduce, it isn t yet known. But other studies of ancient virus DNA have shown it can affect the humans who carry it. In addition to finding these new stretches, the scientists also confirmed 17 other pieces of virus DNA found in human genomes by other scientists in recent years. The study looked at the entire span of DNA, or genome, from people from around the world, including a large number from Africa -- where the ancestors of modern humans originated before migrating around the world. The team used sophisticated techniques to compare key areas of each person s genome to the  reference  human genome. Working at Tufts University and the University of Michigan Medical School, the researchers made the findings with funding from the National Institutes of Health. HERV-enly find The findings add to what science already knows about human endogenous retroviruses, or HERVs. That s the name for the ancient infectious viruses that inserted a DNA-based copy of their own RNA genetic material into our ancestors  genomes. They re part of the same type of virus that includes the modern human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Over generations, the virus-generated DNA kept getting copied and handed down when humans reproduced. That s how it ended up in our DNA today. In fact, about 8 percent of what we think of as our  human  DNA actually came from viruses. In some cases, HERV sequences have been adopted by the human body to serve a useful purpose, such as one that helps pregnant women s bodies build a cell layer around a developing fetus to protect it from toxins in the mother s blood.   The new HERVs are part of the family called HERV-K. The intact whole viral genome, or provirus, just found was on the X chromosome; it s been dubbed Xq21. It s only the second intact provirus found to be hiding in human DNA. In the researchers  own words:  This one looks like it is capable of making infectious virus, which would be very exciting if true, as it would allow us to study a viral epidemic that took place long ago,  says senior author and virologist John Coffin, Ph.D. of the Tufts University School of Medicine.  This research provides important information necessary for understanding how retroviruses and humans have evolved together in relatively recent times.   Many studies have tried to link these endogenous viral elements to cancer and other diseases, but a major difficulty has been that we haven't actually found all of them yet,  says co-first author Zachary H. Williams, a Ph.D. student at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University in Boston.  A lot of the most interesting elements are only found in a small percentage of people, which means you have to screen a large number of people to find them.   This is a thrilling discovery,  says co-first author Julia Wildschutte, Ph.D., who began the work as a Ph.D. student in Coffin s lab at Tufts.  It will open up many doors to research. What s more, we have confirmed in this paper that we can use genomic data from multiple individuals compared to the reference human genome to detect new HERVs. But this has also shown us that some people carry insertions that we can t map back to the reference.    U-M genetics researcher Jeffrey Kidd, Ph.D., worked with Wildschutte when she was a member of his laboratory team.  These are remnants of ancient events that have not been fixed in the population as a whole, but rather happened in the ancestors of some people alive today,  Kidd says.  There have been a number of examples of other HERVs that insert themselves next to human genes or near them, and have impact on their expression. We re interested in applying these methods to find other types of viral or mobile element insertions.  Genetic teamwork The Michigan team used methods for characterizing repetitive DNA sequences that Kidd and his team had developed, while Coffin and Williams used complementary techniques. Wildschutte is now at Bowling Green State University. Many of the genomes they examined were from the 1000 Genomes Project, an international collaboration. Another set of genomes came from work Kidd and colleagues at Stanford University had done as part of the Human Genome Diversity Project, with a focus on DNA samples from African volunteers. These latter samples showed more signs of HERVs, in line with the high level of genetic diversity in African populations. That diversity stems from the longtime stability and intermixing of the continent s population   as opposed to other populations in Europe, Asia and the Americas that stem from specific out-migrations in ancient times. Cataloging all the HERV insertions in humans will require even more scanning of whole human genomes, which are becoming easier to come by as technology improves and becomes less expensive. And although intact proviruses lurking in our DNA may be rare, the impact of other HERV sequences on our health or disease is probably not.","Published: March 24, 2016"

To do so, researchers developed a line of transgenic mice whose brains expressed a green fluorescent protein that lights up active neurons. They then used a customized wide-field microscope with dual lenses to capture images of the brain similar to what fMRI does in humans. Combined, the technique allows them to visualize the activity across the brain's cortex.

Wekselblatt. They are two of the four co-authors on a paper, which is now in press with the Journal of Neurophysiology. Technique combining customized wide-field microscopy and two-photon imaging allowed University of Oregon scientists to capture both the neural circuitry that is active across a mouse cortex and the specific neurons (shown as dots lighting up) involved from sensory input to a resulting behavior. Courtesy: Joseph Wekselblatt  Large-scale brain imaging is currently possible in smaller species, such as zebrafish and nematodes, but they lack a cortex the top layer of mammalian brains where cognition, memory, language learning and motor behaviors occur. The visualization is possible because of the fluorescent protein, GCaMP6, which was developed by researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The protein contains a calcium sensor and lights up when neurons are activated. The mouse line with GCaMP6 generated at the UO is being distributed to scientists around the world through a repository at Jackson Laboratory in Maine. The transgenic mice can be followed throughout their lives, enabling the study of changes in brain function over extended periods of time, such as throughout the learning of a task. It also opens the possibility, Niell said, to explore brain issues associated with early development, adolescent behavior, schizophrenia and age-related deterioration of the brain. Human brain studies done with fMRI allows researchers to pinpoint specific regions of the brain that are active under certain conditions by measuring changes in the level of blood oxygen. It does not allow researchers to probe deeper to see specific neuronal circuitry occurring as tasks are performed. Learn More: New insights into underlying cellular mechanisms of information processing in the brain The final step of the new mouse-imaging system involves two-photon imaging, which allows researchers to zoom in and see individual neurons that are active. Using the combination of wide-field and two-photon imaging, the researchers can study activity from the brain-wide global scale down to the local scale of groups of individual neurons. ""We deliver sensory inputs moving images that trigger decision-making by the mouse,"" Niell said. ""As the inputs are registered and behavior begins, we can watch the flow of activity across the brain. You see it all in real time, and very quickly, nearly at the speed of thought."" ""Our approach is faster than fMRI, where monitoring response is often measured in seconds,"" Wekselblatt said. ""We see responses in a hundred milliseconds, and we can see the information flowing through cortex. You can't get that with fMRI. And then you can zoom in to see the circuitry behind the activation. ""In previous research, you'd have to use different animals at different times of their lives to get to information that you want,"" he said. ""Here we can study the same mice over time to observe how patterns change when they are exposed to different variables, such as stress or medications."" By publishing their approach in the innovative methodology section of the Journal of Neurophysiology, the authors expect it will allow other researchers to use the approach in a wide range of studies of brain function, from sensory processing to cognition.

There are many methods that do this, but they all have problems: too invasive, or too slow, or not precise enough. Now, a new method to control the activity of neurons in mice, devised by scientists at Rockefeller University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, avoids these downfalls by using magnetic forces to remotely control the flow of ions into specifically targeted cells. Jeffrey Friedman, Marilyn M. Simpson Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, and colleagues successfully employed this system to study the role of the central nervous system in glucose metabolism. Published online in Nature, the findings suggest a group of neurons in the hypothalamus play a vital role in maintaining blood glucose levels. See Also: Study gives new view on how cells control what comes in and out ""These results are exciting because they provide a broader view of how blood glucose is regulated--they emphasize how crucial the brain is in this process,"" says Friedman. ""And having a new means for controlling neural activity, one that doesn't require an implant and allows you to elicit rapid responses, fills a useful niche between the methods that are already available."" It may also be possible to adapt this method for clinical applications, says Jonathan Dordick of Rensselaer. ""Depending on the type of cell we target, and the activity we enhance or decrease within that cell, this approach holds potential in development of therapeutic modalities, for example, in metabolic and neurologic diseases."" Previous work led by Friedman and Dordick tested a similar method to turn on insulin production in diabetic mice. The system couples a natural iron storage particle, ferritin, and a fluorescent tag to an ion channel called TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin chili pepper receptor. Ferritin can be affected by forces such as radio waves or magnetic fields, and its presence tethered to TRPV1 can change the conformation of the ion channel. ""Normally radio waves or magnetic fields, at these strengths, will pass through tissue without having any effect,"" says first author Sarah Stanley (now Assistant Professor of Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). ""But when this modified ferritin is present, it responds and absorbs the energy of the radiofrequency or magnetic fields, producing motion. This motion opens the channel and allows ions into the cell. Depending on the ions flowing through the channel, this can either activate or inhibit the cells' activity."" This study is the first to turn neurons on and off remotely with radio waves and magnetic fields. TRPV1 normally allows positive ions such as calcium or sodium to flow in, which activates neurons and transmits neuronal signals. The researchers were also able to achieve the opposite effect, neuronal inhibition, by mutating the TRPV1 channel to only allow negative chloride ions to flow through. ""The modified TRPV1 channel was targeted specifically to glucose sensing neurons using a genetic technique known as Cre-dependent expression,"" says Stanley. ""To test whether a magnetic field could remotely modulate these neurons, we simply placed the mice near the electromagnetic coil of an MRI machine."" Learn More: When the neuron's doorman allows too much in Using this novel method, the researchers investigated the role these glucose sensing neurons play in blood glucose metabolism. Hormones released by the pancreas, including insulin, maintain stable levels of glucose in the blood. A region of the brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus was thought to play a role in regulating blood glucose, but it was not possible with previous methods to decipher which cells were actually involved. Friedman and colleagues found that when they switched these neurons on with magnetic forces, blood glucose increased, insulin levels decreased, and behaviorally, the mice ate more. When they inhibited the neurons, on the other hand, the opposite occurred, and blood glucose decreased. ""We tend to think about blood glucose being under the control of the pancreas, so it was surprising that the brain can affect blood glucose in either direction to the extent that it can,"" says Friedman. ""It's been clear for a while that blood glucose can increase if the brain senses that it's low, but the robustness of the decrease we saw when these neurons were inhibited was unexpected."" The researchers' system has several advantages that make it ideal for studies on other circuits in the brain, or elsewhere. It can be applied to any circuit, including dispersed cells like those involved in the immune system. It has a faster time scale than similar chemogenetic tools, and it doesn't require an implant as is the case with so-called optogenetic techniques. In addition to its utility as a research tool, the technique may also have clinical applications. ""Although it is a long ways off, this technique may offer an alternative to deep brain stimulation or trans-magnetic stimulation,"" says Friedman. ""We'd like to explore the possibility that this could provide some of the benefits of these without such an invasive procedure or cumbersome device.""

See Also: Following direction -- How neurons can tell top from bottom and front from back Studies have shown that animals do the same. They organize sequences of movements to migrate to preferred environments. Understanding how environmental information is converted to sensory information in the brain is vital for a deeper understanding of animal behavior and human perception. However, not much is known about this process. The movement of Caenorhabditis elegans or roundworm in response to temperature changes has been extensively studied. Deletion of a pair of sensory neurons, known as AFD, severely hindered the worms' ability to react to an increase or decrease in temperature, indicating that AFD plays a crucial role in such responses. Based on this knowledge, researchers from Nagoya University set out to investigate exactly how AFD converts the sequences of sensory inputs that are triggered by changing temperatures into neural activity. ""We used simultaneous calcium imaging and a tracking microscope for freely moving animals to characterize thermal response in C. elegans,"" first author of the study, Yuki Tsukada, explains. ""The worms were raised in different temperatures, but were all subjected to the same temperature range of between 17 C and 23 C during the test."" Learn More: Researchers provide first peek at how neurons multitask The researchers found that the responses in the worms were similar regardless of the conditions they were raised in. Interestingly, the adaptation and detection of an input signal was around 20 seconds, a timescale comparable to that of behavioral movements, such as turning. Using a mathematical model, the researchers were able to reconstruct the AFD activity from the observed temperature input and, conversely, the thermal environment from the observed AFD activity and the migration pattern of the worms. This verifies that the thermotaxis of C. elegans is an appropriate model for exploring the relationship between the environment and the response of the organism.

They are chemically programmed by their amino acid sequence to fold into highly organized conformations that underpin all of biological structure (e.g., hair, scales) and function (e.g., enzymes, antibodies). Understanding the sequence-structure-function relationship the  protein folding problem is one of the great, unsolved problems in physical chemistry, and is of inestimable scientific value in exposing the inner workings of life and the rational design of molecular machines.  This work lays the foundations to recover the protein folding landscapes directly from experimental data, providing a route to new understanding and rational design of proteins,  explained Andrew Ferguson, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  While we remain far from this goal, our understanding of protein folding was revolutionized by the  new view  that envisages molecular folding as a conformational search over a funneled free energy surface.  According to Ferguson, the single-molecule free energy surface encodes all of the thermodynamics and pathways of folding, dictating protein structure and dynamics. Each point on the landscape corresponds to an ensemble of similar protein conformations, and the height of the landscape prescribes their stability. It is a key goal of physical chemistry to determine molecular folding landscapes.  Molecular folding landscapes can be inferred from long computer simulations in which the positions of all atoms in the molecule are known,  said Jiang Wang, a graduate research assistant and first author of the paper.  Experimental techniques such as single molecule F rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can measure distances between covalently-grafted fluorescent dye molecules to track the size of the molecule as a function of time, but it has so far not been possible to reconstruct folding funnels from experimental measurements of single coarse-grained observables,"" Ferguson explained.  In this work, we have integrated nonlinear machine learning and statistical thermodynamics with Takens' Theorem from dynamical systems theory to demonstrate in computer simulations of a hydrophobic polymer chain that it is possible to determine molecular folding landscapes from time series of a single experimentally-accessible observable.   The information loss associated with its reconstruction from a single observable means that the topography of the reconstructed funnel may be perturbed   the heights and depths of the free energy peaks and valleys may be altered   but it faithfully preserves the topology of the true funnel   the locality, continuity, and connectivity of molecular configurations,"" Wang noted. ""This means that the folding funnel determined from a measurements of, in this case, the head-to-tail distance of the chain is geometrically and topologically identical and contains precisely the same molecular states and transition pathways as that computed from knowledge of all the atomic positions,"" Ferguson added. ""We are very excited by this idealized proof of principle for computer simulations of a polymer chain, and are currently working to extend our analyses to simulations of biologically realistic peptides and proteins, and partner with single molecule biophysicists to apply our technique to experimental measurements of real proteins,  Ferguson said.","Published: March 23, 2016"

""Our investment in the company underscores our confidence in the senior leadership team and we look forward to working together to advance the company's mission to develop clinically proven products that improve patient outcomes and save lives."" Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for more than 600,000 deaths each year. When diagnosed early, before cancer has spread, the relative five-year survival rate for CRC is 90 percent, but only about four out of 10 CRC cases are detected early. Among individuals undergoing surgical treatment for CRC, 30 to 40 percent of all cases recur, the majority of which present in the first two to three years following initial diagnosis and treatment. This early and concentrated pattern is relatively unusual among cancers, and offers the opportunity for structured surveillance to detect signs of recurrence. One element of the standard of care for post-surgical monitoring for CRC recurrence, quarterly or semi-annual blood-based testing to measure carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, has poor sensitivity and specificity (statistical measures that indicate the definitive presence or absence of cancer). To address the need for more accurate oncology monitoring tools, Clinical Genomics has developed a new blood test to detect tumor-specific methylated DNA biomarkers that leak from active lesions into the circulatory system. Current data suggest that a genomic test specific for these biomarkers is more sensitive than CEA testing and highly specific.","Published: March 23, 2016"

Fewer than two years later, the team has made further strides in its research by eliminating the virus from the genome of human T-cells using the specialized gene editing system they designed. The researchers have shown that the method can both effectively and safely eliminate the virus from the DNA of human cells grown in culture. How this research differs In previous work, the team led by Kamel Khalili, professor and chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Temple had demonstrated the ability of their technology to snip out HIV-1 DNA from normal human cells. The newest findings used that same technology to snip out the virus from latently and productively infected CD4+ T-cells, which host the virus in persons infected with HIV. In this round of research, the scientists used blood drawn from actual patients living with HIV. These ex vivo experiments allowed T-cells from patients infected with HIV to be grown in cell culture and treated with the gene editing system. Results showed that the treatment system can eliminate the virus and protect cells against reinfection. Another major component of the study addressed questions about potential side effects and toxicity. The researchers used the gold standard in genomic assessment known as ultra-deep whole-genome sequencing to analyze the genomes of HIV-1-eradicated cells for mutations in genes outside the region targeted by the process. Their analyses ruled out off-target effects on genes and showed that HIV-1-eradicated cells were growing and functioning normally. What the research means  The findings are important on multiple levels,  said Khalili, also director of the Center for Neurovirology and director of the Comprehensive NeuroAIDS Center at Temple.  They demonstrate the effectiveness of our gene editing system in eliminating HIV from the DNA of CD4+ T-cells and, by introducing mutations into the viral genome, permanently inactivate viral replication. Further, they show that the system can protect cells from reinfection and that the technology is safe for the cells, with no toxic effects.   These experiments had not been performed previously to this extent,  he added.  But the questions they address are critical, and the results allow us to move ahead with this technology.

This is the essence of precision medicine. Now, researchers at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) are showing how an even more detailed genetic analysis using RNA sequencing can vastly enhance that understanding, providing doctors and their patients with more precise tools to target the underlying causes of disease, and help recommend the best course of action. In their review, published today in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics, TGen scientists highlight the many advantages of using RNA-sequencing in the detection and management of everything from cancer to infectious diseases, such as Ebola and the rapidly spreading Zika virus. RNA's principal role is to act as a messenger carrying instructions from DNA for the synthesis of proteins. Building on the insights provided by DNA profiling, the analysis of RNA provides an even more precise look at how cells behave and how medicine can intervene when things go wrong. ""RNA is a dynamic and diverse biomolecule with an essential role in numerous biological processes,"" said Dr. Sara Byron, Research Assistant Professor in TGen's Center for Translational Innovation, and the review's lead author. ""From a molecular diagnostic standpoint, RNA-based measurements have the potential for broad application across diverse areas of human health, including disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic selection."" DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequencing spells out -in order- the billions of chemical letters that make up the genes that drive all of our biologic make up and functions, from hair and eye color to whether an individual may be predisposed to cancer or other diseases. RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequencing provides information on the genes that are actively being made into RNA in a cell and are important for cell function. While more complex, RNA holds the promise of more precise measurement of the human physical condition. There simply are more forms, or species, that RNA takes, explains Dr. Byron. ""RNA-sequencing provides an deeper view of a patient's genome, revealing detailed information on the diverse spectrum of RNAs being expressed."" One of the most promising aspects of RNA-based measurements is the potential of using extracellular RNA (exRNAs) as a non-invasive diagnostic indicator of disease. Monitoring exRNA simply takes a blood sample, as opposed to doing a tumor biopsy, which essentially is a minor surgery with greater risks and costs. ""The investigation of exRNAs in biofluids to monitor disease is an area of diagnostic research that is growing rapidly,"" said Dr. Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, TGen Associate Professor of Neurogenomics, Co-Director of TGen's Center for Noninvasive Diagnostics, and one of the review's authors. ""Measurement of exRNA is appealing as a non-invasive method for monitoring disease. With increased access to biofluids, more frequent sampling can occur over time."" The first test measuring exRNA was released earlier this year, the review said, for use measuring specific exRNAs in lung cancer patients. And, the potential for using RNA-seq in cancer is expanding rapidly. Commercial RNA-seq tests are now available, and provide the opportunity for clinicians to more comprehensively profile cancer and use this information to guide treatment selection for their patients, the review said. In addition, the authors reported on several recent applications for RNA-seq in the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases, such as monitoring for drug resistant populations during therapy and tracking the origin and spread of the Ebola virus. Using examples from discovery and clinical research, the authors also describe how RNA-seq can help guide interpretation of genomic DNA sequencing results. The utility of integrative sequencing strategies in research studies is growing across broad health applications, and points to the promise for incorporation of RNA-seq into clinical medicine, the review said.

Studying the whole genomes of more than 200 samples ofLeishmania donovani revealed that the addition of just two bases of DNA to a gene known as LdAQP1 stops the parasite from absorbing antimonial drugs. While antimonials are no longer the first-line treatment for the disease, the discovery does show that whole-genome sequencing of L. donovani parasites could be used to study and track the emergence of resistance to frontline drugs   alerting health workers to potential hot spots of resistance. Black Fever is the second most deadly parasitic disease after malaria, affecting nearly 300,000 people every year and killing up to 50,000. The parasite is mainly found in the Indian subcontinent, where up to 80 per cent of the disease occurs. To best understand how the parasite evolves and track the spread of drug resistance, researchers need a way to survey and monitor the parasite s population structure. Unfortunately standard techniques to do this have proved fruitless because the strains of L. donovaniparasite are so genetically similar. Dr James Cotton, senior author of the study from the Sanger Institute;   If you want to control visceral leishmaniasis, you need to understand what is going on at the geographic epicentre of the disease, and you need to be able to see changes at the level of individual DNA bases in the parasites  genomes. Until now studies have been limited to looking at small regions of the parasite s DNA or at what happens in the laboratory. To truly understand what is happening in the real world, we analysed the whole genomes of more than 200 samples from parasites captured in India, Nepal and Bangladesh over almost a decade.  Exploring the genetic landscape of L. donovani at such depth and breadth yielded new insights into the parasites  ability to develop drug resistance, and its evolutionary history. In particular, the researchers found that the insertion of just two bases of DNA into the genome of approximately 35,000,000 bases helped the parasite to overcome antimonial drugs. Dr Tim Downing, one of the paper s first authors from the Sanger Institute and National University of Ireland Galway;  We discovered that many of the parasites that were resistant to antimonial drug treatment had just two additional DNA bases in the gene LdAQP1, which produces an aquaglyceroporin protein. This insertion produces a scrambled version of this protein that can no longer move small molecules   including antimonials   across its cell membrane. These strains of L. donovani are likely to be resistant because they cannot take in the drugs.  Black Fever    kala azar  in Hindi   is second largest life-threatening parasitic disease after malaria. Spread through the bites of sandflies, the parasites enter the internal organs such as the liver, spleen and bone marrow, making them inflamed and swollen. The infection produces fever, weight loss, fatigue and anaemia and is fatal if left untreated. Professor Jean-Claude Dujardin of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp and the University of Antwerp, senior author of the study and leader of the consortium that ran the study;  This study perfectly illustrates the relevance of collaboration between large sequencing centres like the Sanger Institute and clinicians and scientists involved in the battle against the most neglected diseases.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/conflicting-views-on-breast-biopsies-191240,Conflicting Views on Breast Biopsies Initial indications of atypia and ductal carcinoma in situ are prone to disagreement among pathologists  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Every year, millions of women undergo an anxiety-fraught breast biopsy, usually obtained on the heels of a breast lump or uncertain mammogram. Their hope and expectation is that the tissue sample will clarify whether there s anything to worry about.  In many cases, however, biopsies have too much uncertainty for interpretation, according to a new study led by Dr. Joann Elmore, a University of Washington physician and nationally recognized expert on mammography and breast cancer. The study was published today in theAnnals of Internal Medicine. Elmore recommends women with a diagnosis of atypia and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) get a second opinion and get educated on these diagnoses. While it s relatively easy to identify benign breast tissue and, at the other extreme, invasive breast cancer, the diagnoses of atypia and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are prone to elicit differing opinions among pathologists, the study found.   We diagnose patients based on a tissue sample that is visually examined under a microscope by a pathologist,   said Dr. Joann Elmore, a University of Washington physician and nationally recognized expert on mammography and breast cancer.  This is a consultation with an element of subjectivity; we don t put the biopsy tissue into a machine and get an unquestionable answer. We re stuck with a diagnostic classification system that works well in the two extremes but less so in gray-area diagnoses of atypia and DCIS.  The National Cancer Institute defines atypia as  an abnormality in cells in tissue  and DCIS as  a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct [but] have not spread outside the duct.  Each year in the United States, more than 100,000 women are diagnosed with atypia and 60,000 women with DCIS, said Elmore. Research by Elmore's team has previously shown that breast biopsies can spur variable interpretations. This new study augments that by providing estimates of diagnostic disagreements at the U.S. population level. Elmore and colleagues enlisted three world-class experts in breast-cancer diagnosis to independently review biopsy samples from 240 patients. The experts established a reference diagnosis on each case. More than 100 study pathologists then participated in interpreting some of these biopsy cases and the results were merged with U.S. population-based screening data to provide estimates of the predictive value of an initial biopsy interpretation; in other words, in the United States, what is the likelihood that an initial diagnosis of atypia or DCIS would be verified if the same biopsy slide were reviewed by the three experts.  Samples initially identified as benign or invasive cancer generated high rates of concurrence with the experts   97 and 98 percent, respectively. Agreement with initial diagnoses of DCIS was lower, at 69 percent. The experts agreed with initial diagnoses of atypia only 37 percent of the time. What s more, when disagreement emerged, the experts said the initial diagnosis was more likely to be  overcalled  than  undercalled.  That is, the initial diagnosis identified risk that the experts did not find upon review.  Women who initially received the diagnosis of atypia   and more than 100,000 women a year get that diagnosis in the U.S.   the experts downgraded more than half of those to normal benign tissue without atypia,  Elmore said.    With DCIS, the experts downgraded 19 out of 100; that s 19 women who might have heard  atypia  instead of  carcinoma  in their diagnosis,  she added.  Elmore likened a diagnosis of DCIS to a Stage 0 cancer.  It can be a very scary diagnosis for women because of the word  carcinoma.  Women with this diagnosis often opt for the same treatment that women with Stage 1 cancer get, like lumpectomy with radiation or even mastectomy,"" she said. ""There is a growing concern that DCIS is being overdiagnosed and overtreated."" Elmore acknowledged that most second opinions in clinical practice do not have the benefit of world-class expertise. A second limitation of the study is that the pathologists gave interpretations based on only one slide per case, and lacked access to additional testing, an opinion from a professional colleague, or the patients  clinical histories.  Nevertheless, she said, the study reveals enough discordance about diagnoses of atypia and DCIS to encourage people to not jump to treatment based on an initial finding.  ""Undergoing a breast biopsy can be an anxiety provoking experience for women and their loved ones,""Elmore said. ""I encourage women who receive an initial diagnosis of either atypia or DCIS to realize that they do not need to act immediately on the results; they have time to obtain a second opinion to verify the diagnosis and to become educated about these diagnoses to make informed decisions.""","Published: March 23, 2016"

The collaboration seeks to optimise the manufacture and delivery of these personalised therapies using increased automation and leading edge processing technology. GSK is building a cell and gene therapy R&D platform to underpin development of novel therapies in oncology and rare diseases   two of its core research areas. This reflects the company s belief in cell and gene therapy s potential as an important treatment approach for tackling the underlying cause of serious disease. Through the collaboration, Miltenyi Biotec will engage with GSK to integrate greater automation and high-tech processing technology into GSK s current cell and gene therapy R&D manufacturing capabilities. The goal is to use this increased automation to further industrialise cell and gene therapy, overcoming the manufacturing and scale-up constraints associated with current, more manual cell and gene therapy processes. This could reduce the costs and geographical barriers associated with this treatment approach, speed development of therapies and support their potential beyond rare diseases and limited populations. The collaboration will also bring together the technology and expertise of both companies to advance the discovery of new CAR (chimeric antigen-receptor) T-cell based therapeutics -- cells that have been engineered to target and destroy cancer cells by strengthening a patient s natural T-cell response. GSK and Miltenyi Biotec will collaborate on defined CAR-T oncology targets and on the development of advancements in technologies in this space that may be further applied by both companies. This collaboration supplements GSK s existing CAR-T preclinical portfolio. Patrick Vallance, President Pharmaceuticals R&D at GSK, said  Cell based gene therapies are living treatments, unique to individual patients and complex to manufacture. We see tremendous potential for the cell and gene therapy platform we are building within GSK, however the complexity of current manufacturing processes limits their use to local treatment of small patient populations. Working with Miltenyi Biotec, our vision is to transform current technology so that we can expand the possibilities for cell and gene therapy treatment to wider patient populations with broader geographical reach.  Stefan Miltenyi, President and CEO at Miltenyi Biotec, said  For more than 20 years we have been developing and providing cell therapy solutions to patients worldwide. Working together with the global experts at GSK, we will accelerate innovation to broaden patient access to future personalised cell and gene therapy. ","Published: March 23, 2016"

Inovio will pay Bioject $5.5 million in cash and stock. Inovio will advance an integrated non-invasive delivery device combining Bioject s jet injection technology with Inovio s new needle-free, skin-surface electroporation (EP) technology. The company s goal is to facilitate preventive immunization using its DNA vaccines against critical infectious diseases with unmet needs in large populations. Bioject s needle-free devices, which use high pressure gas or springs to propel liquid medicine into skin, have demonstrated desirable utility, safety, and tolerability attributes in animals and humans. Under a prior research agreement, Inovio assessed this technology with its new EP delivery system and generated compelling antigen expression and immune responses in animals. Injecting DNA immunotherapies into tissue alone, irrespective of the injection method, has not generated potent immune responses in clinical studies - DNA immunotherapies must enter cells of the tissue to enable their immune-activating capabilities, which is limited using syringe or jet injection alone. One of two pillars in Inovio s success in achieving clinically relevant efficacy with induced immune responses is its proprietary EP technology enabling delivered DNA to be transported into the cells. Inovio s compelling data have to date been achieved using intramuscular needle-based injection and EP, which is well-suited for treating cancers and infectious diseases. Achieving preventive immunization using DNA vaccines against challenging infectious diseases in large populations will also require EP delivery. It would also benefit significantly from a combined jet injection/electroporation device capable of reducing administration inconsistency, pain, and disposables cost associated with needle-based injection in mass immunizations. Dr. J. Joseph Kim, Inovio s CEO, said,  Our current DNA delivery method is highly effective and already gets the job done. However, to fully realize the opportunity of mass immunization against challenging infectious diseases we believed we could create an additional advantage: that is non-invasive vaccine administration. Similar to our past acquisitions of Advisys and Inovio AS, this purchase of Bioject s superior jet injection technology and well-positioned patents is an investment in Inovio s future. Jet injection alone cannot achieve the utility of DNA vaccines. However, combined with our new needle-free skin-surface electroporation delivery technology we believe we can offer a compelling solution to protect against RSV, ever-changing influenza strains, and emerging infectious diseases like Zika.  Inovio s leadership in advancing DNA immunotherapies delivered using needle-based injection and electroporation led to the first reported generation of robust antigen-specific immune responses correlated to efficacy in a controlled clinical study. Its phase II data was published in September 2015 in The Lancet. This product, VGX-3100, for high-grade HPV-related cervical dysplasia, will advance into phase III in 2016. This approach is being used in multiple current and imminent clinical studies in cancer and therapeutic applications for chronic infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and HIV. With respect to needle-less vaccine administration, Inovio has an extensive vaccine pipeline to leverage this technique. It has ongoing clinical programs for flu, HIV, Ebola, and MERS; proof-of-principle human data has shown significant immune responses generated by its universal influenza and HIV DNA vaccines; and preclinical-stage DNA vaccines target important diseases such as Zika, dengue, Chikungunya and RSV. Supporting the goal of non-invasive administration, the U.S. Army Small Business Innovation Research program recently granted Inovio $500,000 to further support the development of a needle-free, non-invasive skin-surface electroporation device for DNA vaccine delivery. Inovio will pay Bioject $4.5 million in Inovio stock (price set by 20 day weighted average share price immediately prior to closing) and $1.0 million in cash. The closing of this transaction is subject to approval by Bioject s shareholders and is expected approximately 30 days from this announcement.","Published: March 23, 2016"

The first patient was dosed on March 18, 2016. The protocol for SANET-p is similar to SANET-ep, a Phase III registration trial in patients with extra-pancreatic NETs. SANET-p is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase III sulfatinib registration study to treat patients with low or intermediate grade advanced NET whose disease has progressed, locally advanced or distant metastasized and for whom there is no effective therapy. Patients are randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive either 300 milligrams of sulfatinib orally once per day, or placebo, on an every 28-day treatment cycle. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival of sulfatinib as compared to that of placebo, with secondary endpoints including objective response rate ( ORR ), disease control rate, time to response, duration of response, overall survival, safety and tolerability. Approximately 195 patients are expected to be enrolled in the SANET-p study from more than 20 centers across China, with top-line results expected in 2018.

Researchers from the Group Health Cooperative, Seattle, and the University of Washington, Seattle, conducted a study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, in which 342 participants aged 20 to 70 used one of the two mind and body approaches or sought usual care for one year. At 26 and 52 weeks, participants using MBSR and CBT had greater improvement in function and back pain compared to the group that remained in standard care. Though pain intensity and some mental health measures improved in both groups, those using CBT did not see improvement beyond 26 weeks. Those using MBSR, however, continued to see improvement at 52 weeks, leading researchers to conclude MBSR may be an effective treatment for chronic low-back pain. MBSR brings together elements of mindfulness meditation and yoga, whereas CBT is a form of psychotherapy that trains individuals to modify specific thoughts and behaviors. For the study, participants in the group using MBSR and the group using CBT attended a two-hour group session on their respective approach per week for eight weeks and supplemented their treatment with workbooks and CDs for practice at home. The study was led by Daniel Cherkin, Ph.D., a senior scientific investigator at the Group Health Research Institute, Seattle. It is vital that we identify effective non-pharmacological treatment options for 25 million people who suffer from daily pain in the United States,  said Josephine Briggs, M.D., director of NCCIH.  The results from this research affirm that non-drug/non-opioid therapies, such as meditation, can help manage chronic low-back pain. Physicians and their patients can use this information to inform treatment decisions.  The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health's mission is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health approaches and their roles in improving health and health care.","Published: March 23, 2016"

A new study by University of Illinois researchers reports that healthy brain metabolism corresponds with fluid intelligence a measure of one's ability to solve unusual or complex problems in young adults. The results are reported in the journal Cerebral Cortex. See Also: The social origins of intelligence in the brain ""Fluid intelligence is one of the most useful cognitive measures available,"" said PhD candidate Aki Nikolaidis, who led the research with Ryan Larsen, a research scientist at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and Beckman Institute director Arthur Kramer. ""This domain relates to an individual's job satisfaction and salary level, among other real-world outcomes,"" he said. The researchers measured concentrations of the molecule N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a known marker of metabolic activity in the brain, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nikolaidis then looked at the relationship between NAA concentrations in different regions of the brain and fluid intelligence. ""MR spectroscopy allows us to go beyond simply imaging the structures of the brain. It allows us to image the capacity of the brain to produce energy,"" Larsen said. Previous research relating MR spectroscopy data to cognition has been inconsistent. One explanation may be that researchers fail to account for all relevant factors that relate to cognition, including brain size, in their analyses, Nikolaidis said. One goal of the current study was to address these previous contradictions. ""We wanted to do a more definitive study with a large sample size and with a higher quality methodological approach of acquiring the data,"" Nikolaidis said. The researchers were able to create a more detailed map of NAA concentration in the brain than previous studies had, he said. Learn More: Children's drawings correlated with intelligence 10 years later The team found that NAA concentration in an area of the brain linked to motor abilities in the frontal and parietal cortices was specifically linked to fluid intelligence but not to other closely related cognitive abilities. The brain's motor regions have a role in planning and visualizing movements as well as carrying them out, Nikolaidis said. Mental visualization is a key element of fluid intelligence, he said. The researchers concluded that fluid intelligence depends on brain metabolism and health. While overall brain size is genetically determined and not readily changed, NAA levels and brain metabolism may respond to health interventions including diet, exercise or cognitive training, Nikolaidis said.

Although humans and mice have different stress triggers, this response is reminiscent of our physiological responses to fear and stress. Now, a study published online in the journal Nature has identified nerve cells and a region of the brain behind this innate fear response. With a technique that uses specially engineered viruses to uncover the nerve pathway involved, a research team led by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center neurobiologist and Nobel Prize winner Dr. Linda Buck has pinpointed a tiny area of the mouse brain responsible for this scent-induced reaction. It s known as the  amygdalo-piriform transition area,  or AmPir for short. The researchers were surprised to find that the fear response was so concentrated in this one small region of the olfactory cortex, a part of the brain responsible for perceiving odors. Although humans do not show instinctive fear to predator odors, studying how mice respond to predator cues can help us learn about our own innate emotions and responses, Buck said.  The stress hormone response is very reminiscent of human responses to fear and stress. And of course there are disorders in that, like PTSD,  she said.  Understanding the neural circuitry underlying fear and stress of various sorts is very important, not just to understand the basic biology and functions of the brain but also for potentially finding evolutionarily conserved neural circuits and genes that play an important role in humans."" Fear triggers both physiological changes (surges of the stress hormones in their blood) and behavior changes in mice. The animals freeze when smelling the predator odor so they won t be detected.  Increased stress hormone levels in the blood cause a faster heart rate, blood pressure and increased awareness it changes many things so the mice can survive and prepare for a coming threat,  said Fred Hutch postdoctoral research fellow Dr. Kunio Kondoh, also an author of the study. Learn More: EEG study findings reveal how fear is processed in the brain Researchers know which neurons cause the stress hormone increases but not which cells drive the freezing behavior, so the researchers set out to trace how the  danger  signal from the mouse s nose gets to those stress hormone-triggering cells. Kondoh and Dr. Zhonghua Lu, also a postdoctoral research fellow working on Buck s laboratory team and an author on the study, modified a research tool known as viral neuronal tracing. Their technique was built on the backbone of the pseudorabies virus, which can infect neurons and moves from neuron to neuron across cell synapses, the special cellular bridges that nerve cells use to send signals to their direct partners. This pseudorabies virus only travels in reverse in the brain, in the opposite direction of neuron signals like a salmon swimming upstream. The researchers modified the virus to light up its pathway, leaving a trail of fluorescent breadcrumbs as it traveled from the neurons in the mouse brain that induce stress hormones to the cells that send signals to those stress-response neurons. They saw multiple different areas of the brain where the viral tracer had blazed its backwards path. To pinpoint which of those areas was involved in the specific fear response to predator odors, Kondoh exposed mice in the lab to smells the aforementioned bobcat urine, purchased from a hunting supply store, or a chemical from fox feces and looked for olfactory neurons activated in response to those noxious scents. The researchers then looked at the cross-section of the two experiments those nerve cells that send signals to the stress-response cells of the brain and that also light up when mice smell traces of their predators and found them to be concentrated in one area of the olfactory cortex, the AmPir. The AmPir is a small region of the rodent brain and, like most parts of the brain involved in sensing and responding to odors, it s fairly mysterious, Buck said.  We had actually never even heard of the AmPir. It s a very tiny area and nothing was known about it,  she said.  We don t know whether it even exists in humans.  What is known about the AmPir is that it sits right next to the amygdala, a part of the brain that in humans and other animals plays a role in some emotions including fear. Kondoh also found that stimulating the AmPir directly boosted stress hormone levels, and that blocking this brain region s activity blocked the hormone surge when animals were exposed to predator odors. (Animals with an inactive AmPir still froze when they smelled predator odors, though, suggesting to the researchers that the stress hormone response and behavior changes may be controlled by different parts of the brain.) Related: How the gut feeling shapes fear The next steps for the research team are to uncover the molecules involved in the neural circuits they found, Buck said. The researchers would like to identify genetic signatures in the neurons involved in fear responses.  If they find unique molecular signatures for those neurons and if those signatures occur in humans too, such discoveries could lead to a better understanding of stress disorders, such as PTSD and depression, Buck said   and perhaps even point to novel targets for therapeutics. There s also evidence suggesting that other scents, like rose oil, can block the fear response to predator odors. Buck s research team is currently working to uncover the neurons that could suppress stress hormones and the fear response in rodents.  We re just beginning to scratch the surface,  Buck said.  By pursuing these various connections, I think there is the potential to identify neural circuits that would be relevant to humans and to the treatment of human psychiatric disorders.

One prominent theory in neuroscience is that sleep is when the brain replays memories  offline  to better encode them ( memory consolidation ). A prominent and competing theory is that sleep is important for re-balancing activity in brain networks that have been perturbed during learning while awake. Such  rebalancing  of brain activity involves homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that were first discovered at Brandeis University, and have been thoroughly studied by a number of Brandeis labs including the Turrigiano lab. See Also: Sleep in a dish: Researchers isolate smallest unit of sleep to date Now, a study from the Turrigiano lab published in the journal Cell shows that these homeostatic mechanisms are indeed gated by sleep and wake, but in the opposite direction from that theorized previously: homeostatic brain rebalancing occurs exclusively when animals are awake, and is suppressed by sleep. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that different forms of brain plasticity for example those involved in memory consolidation and those involved in homeostatic rebalancing must be temporally segregated from each other to prevent interference. The requirement that neurons carefully maintain an average firing rate, much like the thermostat in a house senses and maintains temperature, has long been suggested by computational work. Without homeostatic ( thermostat-like ) control of firing rates, models of neural networks cannot learn and drift into states of epilepsy-like saturation or complete quiescence. Learn More: Study provides more evidence that sleep apnea is hurting the brain Much of the work in discovering and describing candidate mechanisms continues to be conducted at Brandeis. In 2013, the Turrigiano Lab provided the first  in vivo evidence for firing rate homeostasis in the mammalian brain: lab members recorded the activity of individual neurons in the visual cortex of freely behaving rat pups for 8h per day across a nine-day period during which vision through one eye was occluded. The activity of neurons initially dropped, but over the next 4 days, firing rates came back to basal levels despite the visual occlusion. In essence, these experiments confirmed what had long been suspected: the activity of neurons in intact brains is indeed homeostatically governed. Due to the unique opportunity to study a fundamental mechanism of brain plasticity in an unrestrained animal, the lab has been probing the possibility of an intersection between an animal s behavior and homeostatic plasticity. In order to truly evaluate possible circadian and behavioral influences on neuronal homeostasis, it was necessary to capture the entire 9-day experiment, rather than evaluate snapshots of each day. For this work, the Turrigiano Lab had to find creative computational solutions to recording many terabytes of data necessary to follow the activity of single neurons without interruption for more than 200 hours. Ultimately, these data revealed that the homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity in the cortex is gated by sleep and wake states. In a surprising and unpredicted twist, the homeostatic recovery of activity occurred almost exclusively during periods of activity and was inhibited during sleep. Prior predictions either assumed no role for behavioral state, or that sleeping would account for homeostasis. Finally, the lab established evidence for a causal role for active waking by artificially enhancing natural waking periods during the homeostatic rebound. When animals were kept awake, homeostatic plasticity was further enhanced.

The novel compounds, developed in the laboratory of Harvard scientist Matthew Shair, offer an innovative approach to cancer treatment, targeting enzymes that regulate transcription. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia, with an estimated 20,800 new cases in the United States in 2015. Moreover, AML accounts for the largest number of leukemia-related deaths, with a five-year overall survival rate of only approximately 26 percent. Shair, a professor in Harvard s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, has discovered a novel therapeutic strategy for treating AML, namely to inhibit enzymes that regulate the transcription of key genetic programs that are altered in AML and other cancers. With support from Harvard s Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator, Shair s laboratory has developed highly selective and potent small molecules, with favorable pharmaceutical properties, that are now poised for advancement toward clinical trials. Merck will take over development of the candidate therapeutics and will engage in a research collaboration with the Shair laboratory to further investigate the biology of transcriptional regulator enzymes.  Accelerator funding over the course of several years has enabled my laboratory to advance some of our experimental compounds to a relatively late stage of preclinical development,  said Shair.  It s gratifying to have discovered a new biological target in the fight against AML, but even more fulfilling to have created a promising weapon against it.  Under the terms of the license agreement, Merck will pay to Harvard an up-front fee of $20 million and will be responsible for development, including clinical development, and for worldwide commercialization of products. The University is also eligible to receive development and commercialization milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on any resulting products. The compensation, which acknowledges the value Harvard and the Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator have created, will support future groundbreaking research.  This recent agreement with the Shair laboratory is rooted in our belief that collaboration is the cornerstone for improving cancer care and driving innovation. It is the partnership among industry and academia that is truly critical to transforming cancer treatment and advancing the care for patients with difficult-to-treat blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia,  said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology early stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. The Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator, administered by Harvard s Office of Technology Development, supports the University s innovative, early-stage life science research to promote the development of important biomedical advances that will improve health care and benefit society.

While the complexity of understanding how neurons grow, connect and function has long been studied, it remains a mystery, one that graduate student Forrest Goodfellow in the University of Georgia Regenerative Bioscience Center is helping unravel. Goodfellow, a graduate student in the University of Georgia's Regenerative Bioscience Center, has developed a unique approach of marrying stem cell biology and 3-D imaging to track and label neural stem cells. His findings were published in the journal Advanced Functional Material. Using microscopic iron beads and a chicken egg, he and his colleagues were able to label neural stem cells and watch them for multiple days using magnetic resonance imaging without harming the cell. Very little is known about the unusual behavior of neural stem cells after experimental treatment. Understanding their whereabouts, keeping them safe from the body's own immune system and tracking the intended destination for repair in a noninvasive manner is the next important step in regenerative medicine therapy. ""The unknown is that big  black box' when people inject neural stem cells and have no idea where they go, or what they do-it's pretty invasive and inaccurate,"" said Steven Stice, a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar and director of the Regenerative Bioscience Center who is housed in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The question remains, he said, of whether injecting neural stem cells to restore damaged neurons and allowing the body to heal as it is meant to naturally really delay the onset of symptoms, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. To answer that question, Goodfellow painstakingly labeled neural stem cells with extremely small iron beads and then transplanted the cell into a chicken embryo. ""We went to great pains to prove and demonstrate that our labeling method does not harm the stem cells,"" said Goodfellow, who started as an undergraduate in Stice's lab while majoring in animal and dairy science in the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. ""If we are altering transplanted stem cells that we hope will be an effective treatment, then it's a moot point if we do it blindly."" Before proving that neural stem cells could be tracked with MRI, the RBC research collaboration, which included Qun Zhao, Luke Mortensen and Gregory Simchick, first had to determine if the iron beads were harmful to the neural stem cells. For 14 days, they tracked and compared live cells and evaluated the fate of derived cells based on their gene expression profile. ""We had to take it to the next level and be able to follow the process through for a period of time,"" Stice said. ""No one has really been able to follow neural cells at any great depth to the level of specificity that we were able to do."" The findings focus mainly on neural stem cells, but Goodfellow sees potential for their use with mesenchymal stem cells. ""One novel aspect of this iron nanoparticle is the iron center covered in synthetic polymers,"" Goodfellow said. ""The covering can be manipulated to show up in green, red or a spectrum of colors with fluorescent microscopy and MRI for a multitude of regenerative therapies-but the surface is what helps it to not harm the cells."" The dextran coating used around the nanoparticle increases the nanoparticles biocompatibility, allowing for a larger loading capacity and the protection of a stable environment, he said. In addition to developing a chick model and applications for toxicology testing in the near future, Goodfellow and his team hope that this project may finally shed some light on the uncertainty surrounding neural stem cells and the great therapeutic promise for healing patients after stroke, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. ""The hope is that this research will get stem cells to clinical applications faster, even if we are just doing rodent studies,"" he said. ""If we are able to see that the cells are surviving and integrating and not adversely affecting the animal, then the likelihood of us getting through clinical trials and onto a real therapy is a lot greater and a lot faster.""","Published: March 22, 2016"

Surgery has been the standard treatment for appendicitis for more than a century. Millions of appendectomies are performed annually in the world, more than 300,000 in the US alone. Studies have been carried out over the years to determine whether non-perforated appendicitis could be treated with antibiotics instead, but despite research results suggesting this, the choice of treatment remains largely unchanged. An international collaboration group, including researchers from the University of Helsinki and McMaster University, analysed five randomised controlled trials comparing the use of antibiotics and appendectomy to treat appendicitis. The trials included in the meta-analysis encompassed a total of 1,116 patients.  According to the meta-analysis, roughly the same number of serious complications were found in the two groups: in 5% of the cases in the antibiotics group and 8% in the appendectomy group (pooled risk difference: -3%).  In the antibiotics group, 8% of the patients underwent an appendectomy within one month, and appendicitis recurred in 23% of the cases during the twelve-month follow-up.  The studies did not provide a high quality evidence for complications, but according to best evidence available, using antibiotics as the primary treatment for mild appendicitis does not lead to more complications in the first twelve months of follow-up,  summarises consultant gastrointestinal surgeon Ville Sallinen.  Used as the primary treatment, antibiotics reduced the number of surgeries by 92% within the first month of diagnosis,  says adjunct professor Kari Tikkinen.  However, this choice of treatment meant that appendicitis recurred in 23 out of 100 patients within one year. Moreover, no long-term follow-up exists for now.  Tikkinen and Sallinen, both from Helsinki University Hospital (Finland), point out that antibiotics can be used as the first-stage treatment for mild appendicitis, but that it is unclear how many of those treated with antibiotiocs first avoid surgery in the long term. Sallinen also mentions the increasingly more common resistance to antibiotics:  Would a change in treatment preferences and an increased use of antibiotics further boost this negative trend?  To initiate antibiotics treatment, the diagnosis must be confirmed by a CT scan, which exposes the patient to radiation.  A diagnosis must always be made in emergency surgical care. The treatment must not be chosen based on suspicion alone,  Sallinen says. Based on available evidence, the choice between surgery and antibiotics as treatment for mild appendicitis is a value and preference sensitive decision. Do we primarily want to prevent the appendicitis from recurring or do we want to avoid surgery if it is not possibly necessary?  In medicine and surgery, treatment choices are increasingly based on shared decision-making, where patients and care providers make decisions together. I expect that this will also increasing apply to  treatment of mild appendicitis,  says Tikkinen.","Published: March 22, 2016"

Despite vaccines and efforts to eradicate the pesky insects, they continue to infect humans with feared diseases like Zika virus, malaria and West Nile virus.Gaining the upper hand on mosquitoes requires speed. Their life cycle is typically two weeks or less and they need only warm weather and standing water to breed. Robert Meagher, a chemical engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, has developed a simple technique for simultaneously detecting RNA from West Nile and chikungunya virus in samples from mosquitoes. He is now working to add the ability to screen for Zika virus.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an autonomous device to passively monitor for mosquito-borne diseases,  Meagher explained.  But first you need an assay that is more robust than the gold standard in a laboratory and that has a very low false-positive rate.  Brighter than the sun Meagher and Sandia colleagues Yooli Light, Chung-Yan Koh and postdoctoral researcher Cameron Ball describe the technique in a paper published online in Analytical Chemistry,  Quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters (QUASR) in RT-LAMP enables bright, single-step, closed-tube and multiplexed detection of RNA viruses.  They explored reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique used instead of the more common polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for low-cost or point-of-care diagnostics for infectious diseases. However, in its usual form, RT-LAMP requires too many manipulations or elaborate instrumentation to be suitable for field use or an autonomous device. RT-LAMP relies on primers, DNA fragment sequences, that bind to a target   the RNA of the virus of interest   and then generate a large amount of DNA. By fluorescently labeling the primer, the new DNA glows as it is produced. If the primer doesn t find the viral RNA, there is no glow. The Sandia researchers added a different DNA fragment sequence called a quench probe that complements a short stretch of primer. As the reaction takes place, the quench probe suppresses any unincorporated primer. This amplifies the positive signal up to 10 times brighter than a negative signal. Because the signal is so bright, QUASR can screen up to three different targets simultaneously, saving time and money.  We didn t expect a signal that bright, so we came up with the name QUASR, inspired by quasars, the extremely luminous celestial objects that can be a trillion times brighter than the sun,  Meagher said. QUASR is simple enough to be used in a field laboratory. The Sandia team is working to incorporate QUASR into a handheld device. QUASR enables rapid response Vector-control districts stand to benefit greatly from QUASR. Such districts are typically the part of public health agencies that monitors and controls disease-carrying insects locally. Currently, detecting disease-carrying mosquitoes is a complex and lengthy process. A field worker in a vector control district collects and prepares mosquito samples, which are then sent to a lab for testing using sophisticated PCR techniques. Using QUASR, either in a portable microfluidic device or simple field laboratory, a user can get a definitive yes or no result in about half an hour. More details like the amount of viral RNA present in the sample would still require laboratory PCR.  This would allow those in the field to make quick decisions on mosquito abatement that can prevent the spread of disease,  Meagher said. Discriminating Ebola from malaria QUASR also can be adapted to screen people for diseases such as the Zika virus or Ebola virus. This is a constantly changing landscape; a year ago, few people had even heard of Zika virus, which theWorld Health Organization recently declared an international health emergency.  Conceptually, it s not difficult to adapt the assay for a different virus,  said Meagher.  There is some trial and error involved in refinement as you are dealing with a different virus and human sample.  Meagher recently received a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to develop a field-deployable assay for differential diagnosis of malaria and viral febrile illnesses including Ebola. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is a partner in the grant. Because malaria and Ebola have similar symptoms   fever, chills, headache, diarrhea and vomiting   health officials worry that patients with malaria are being sent to Ebola quarantine wards.  A point-of-care device that can quickly discriminate Ebola from malaria in a blood sample would prevent dangerous misdiagnoses,  said Meagher. Lassa, dengue and other febrile illnesses are also targets for the NIH project. A bright future Meagher and his team set out to tackle the problem of false positives.  Even a marginal false positive rate would defeat the purpose of an autonomous monitoring device,  he said.  The signal amplification, the amazing brightness of the positive response, was not a goal but certainly a welcome result. While the human eye can only effectively discriminate three distinct colors, the team is developing imaging technology that could enable simultaneous screening of even more targets.  I m very excited about what this technique can do for field workers,  Meagher said.  The ability to make fast decisions about where to direct mosquito abatement resources or how to triage patients will help us stay ahead of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks.

Scientists have many tools at their disposal for looking at preserved tissue under a microscope in incredible detail, or peering into the living body at lower resolution. What they haven't had is a way to do both: create a three-dimensional real-time image of individual cells or even molecules in a living animal. Now, Stanford scientists have provided the first glimpse under the skin of a living animal, showing intricate real-time details in three dimensions of the lymph and blood vessels. The technique, called MOZART (for MOlecular imaging and characteriZation of tissue noninvasively At cellular ResoluTion), could one day allow scientists to detect tumors in the skin, colon or esophagus, or even to see the abnormal blood vessels that appear in the earliest stages of macular degeneration   a leading cause of blindness. ""We've been trying to look into the living body and see information at the level of the single cell,"" said Adam de la Zerda, an assistant professor of structural biology at Stanford and senior author on the paper. ""Until now there has been no way do that."" De la Zerda, who is also a member of Stanford Bio-X, said the technique could allow doctors to monitor how an otherwise invisible tumor under the skin is responding to treatment, or to understand how individual cells break free from a tumor and travel to distant sites. Going for gold A technique exists for peeking into a live tissue several millimeters under the skin, revealing a landscape of cells, tissues and vessels. But that technique, called optical coherence tomography, or OCT, isn't sensitive or specific enough to see the individual cells or the molecules that the cells are producing, which is what interests de la Zerda. A major issue has been finding a way of differentiating between cells or tissues; for example, picking out the cancerous cells beginning to multiply within an overall healthy tissue. In other forms of microscopy, scientists have created tags that latch onto molecules or structures of interest to illuminate those structures and provide a detailed view of where they are in the cell or body. No such beacons existed for OCT, though de la Zerda knew that tiny particles called gold nanorods had some of the properties he was looking for. The problem was that the commercially available nanorods didn't produce nearly enough signal to be detected in a tissue. What the team needed were nanorods, but big ones. Nanorods are analogous to organ pipes, said graduate student Elliott SoRelle, because longer pipes vibrate at lower frequencies, creating a deep, low sound. Likewise, longer nanorods vibrate at lower frequencies, or wavelengths, of light. Those vibrations scatter the light, which the microscope detects. If all the other tissues are vibrating in a white noise of higher frequencies, longer nanorods would stand out like low organ notes amidst a room of babble. SoRelle's challenge was to manufacture longer nanorods that were nontoxic, stable and very bright, which turned out to be a lot to ask. ""My background was biochemistry, and this turned out to be a problem of materials science and surface chemistry,"" said SoRelle, who was co-first author on the paper. He can now make nontoxic nanorods in various sizes that all vibrate at unique and identifiable frequencies. Eliminating noise The next challenge was filtering out the nanorods' frequency from the surrounding tissue. To do that, electrical engineering graduate student and Bowes Bio-X Fellow Orly Liba developed computer algorithms that could separate out the frequencies of light scattered by nanorods of various lengths and differentiate those from surrounding tissue. With SoRelle's large nanorods and Liba's sensitive algorithms, de la Zerda and his team had solved the initial problem of detecting specific structures in three-dimensional images of living tissues. The resulting three-dimensional, high-resolution images were so big   on the order of gigapixels   that the team needed to develop additional algorithms for analyzing and storing such large images. The team tested their technology in the ear of a living mouse, where they were able to watch as the nanorods were taken up into the lymph system and transported through a network of valves. They were able to distinguish between two different size nanorods that resonated at different wavelengths in separate lymph vessels, and they could distinguish between those two nanorods in the lymph system and the blood vessels. In one study, they could watch individual valves within the lymph vessels open and close to control the flow of fluid in a single direction. ""Nobody has shown that level of detail before,"" said Liba, who was co-first author on the paper. Impossible goal This detailed imaging was de la Zerda's initial goal when he started his lab in 2012, though he was frequently told it would be impossible. ""I'm in a small department, but with very accomplished faculty,"" he said. ""One faculty member told me his own life story of taking big risks and that encouraged me. I thought it would be really fun to see if we can make it work and see cells talking to each other in real time."" His gamble got off the ground primarily with a seed grant from Stanford Bio-X, which supports early-stage interdisciplinary research. ""That grant allowed us to take a big risk in a direction that was completely unproven,"" de la Zerda said. Having shown that the gold nanorods can be seen in living tissue, the next step is to show that those nanorods can bind to specific kinds of cells, like skin cancer or abnormal vessels in early stage macular degeneration. Then, the technique could be used to learn more about how those diseases progress at the molecular level and also evaluate treatments in individual patients, something that previously hadn't been possible.","Published: March 22, 2016"

They discovered that, in females, the immune system s lymphocytes, specifically T cells and B cells, lack the typical patterns of Xist, an RNA molecule essential for the inactivation process, as well as other markers of X chromosome inactivation, thus making X inactivation incomplete in these cells. That incomplete activation was present in lymphocytes in all females, but lupus patients also had unique expression patterns of key immunity-related genes and unusual patterns of Xist RNA localization, suggesting an underlying explanation for the disease condition.  There just seems to be something about lymphocytes,  Anguera said.  The silencing of the X chromosome doesn t seem to be as tight in them as it is in other cell types.  Anguera s coauthors on the paper were lead author Jianle Wang, Camille Syrett and Michael Atchison, all of Penn Vet; Marianne C. Kramer of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine; and Arindam Basu of Pennsylvania State University, formerly of Penn Vet. The study had its origins in Anguera s postdoctoral research, which focused on X inactivation in pluripotent stem cells. In particular she examined the role of Xist, a long non-coding RNA molecule that is known to initiate X inactivation and maintain it by residing with the inactivated X chromosome, which also acquires small-molecule tags called heterochromatic modifications, further repressing gene expression. Anguera s studies found that, in some cases, stem cells lose both Xist expression and the modifications that normally reside on the inactive X. As a result, the cells would start to become partially reactivated, growing rapidly and beginning to resemble cancer cells. She began to wonder whether certain diseases might arise from improper maintenance of X inactivation, notably autoimmune conditions such as lupus; 85 percent of lupus patients are women.  What caught my attention about autoimmunity and specifically lupus,  Anguera said,  was that there were genes on the X chromosome that were immunity related and that had been shown to have higher expression levels in lupus patients.  To address this question, the Penn researchers examined lymphocytes donated by healthy human females as well as  na ve,  or unstimulated T and B cells from female mice. They found that, unlike in other cell types where Xist is associated tightly with the inactive X chromosome, female lymphocytes lacked this Xist  cloud,  even though the cell still contained expected levels of Xist. This suggested that Xist was failing to properly migrate to the inactive X to silence it. When the research team activated the human T and B cells, simulating how these cells would respond when presented with a pathogen, the Xist clouds reappeared. The team observed similar results in mice. Yet the na ve and stimulated lymphocytes all had similar quantities of Xist.  What was really striking to us was that this wasn t due to a difference in the amount of Xist. There is a ton of Xist RNA in these cells,  Anguera said.  It s just not getting to the inactive X chromosome in the na ve lymphocytes.  Further examinations of the inactive X in lymphocytes found that it lacked the heterochromatic marks found on the inactive X in other cell types. The findings that even healthy females had such unusual maintenance of the inactive X in their lymphocytes was entirely unexpected.  Our hypothesis was that the lupus samples were going to be dysregulated and the healthy females would be fine,  Montserrat said.  So it was really shocking to us that lymphocytes in normal females lacked these markers of X inactivation as well.  To see if this lack of heterochromatic marks and Xist, both of which normally block gene expression on the inactive X, resulted in increased gene expression, the researchers looked at immunity-related genes on the X chromosome to see if there was one or two copies being expressed. They found that about 3 to 5 percent of female lymphocytes expressed two copies of these genes, as well as two copies of a gene unrelated to immunity. No male lymphocytes showed this same two-copy expression. Consistent with that result, the researchers found that certain regions of the X chromosome in human female B cells, including regions that contain immunity-related genes, were expressed at higher levels than male cells. Because Xist in the female lymphocytes was present but simply wasn t localizing to the proper place on the inactive X, the research team took a closer look at two proteins, YY1 and hnRNPU, that are known  to bind with Xist and possibly play a role in moving it back to the inactive X after lymphocytes are stimulated. Using human T cells in culture as well as mice lacking one of these genes, YY1, they found that, indeed, the two proteins did help move Xist back to the inactive X chromosome in activated lymphocytes. Though it was clear that female lymphocytes were different from males  in their patterns of Xist localization, the team wanted to know whether lupus patients had additional unusual features of X inactivation that might explain their disease. Using lymphocyte samples from both pediatric lupus patients and healthy children of similar ages, the team found more Xist mis-localization in lupus patients and some evidence that they were more likely than healthy people to have two copies of immunity-related genes. The researchers also noted that the region of the X chromosome containing Xist showed the biggest differences in expression when comparing lupus to healthy patients. One possibility, said Anguera, is that all females may have a subpopulation of lymphocytes with incomplete X inactivation; in healthy individuals, those lymphocytes stay in the minority, but that subpopulation may take over in patients with autoimmune conditions. To build on the work, Anguera s team is performing additional studies using primary samples from lupus patients as well as samples from a mouse model of lupus. While the current study was done on immortalized cells from lupus patients, Anguera is hopeful the researchers will obtain a clearer picture of how Xist patterns differ using primary cells. The team is also embarking on a study of another female-biased autoimmune disease, Sjogrens syndrome, which has an even more extreme female bias than lupus, to see if similar X inactivation patterns are present. If the findings hold up across different autoimmune diseases, it s possible that the characteristic patterns of Xist localization could be used as a disease biomarker, enabling earlier diagnoses and treatment.

The researchers studied whether there is a genetic relationship between ASD and the expression of ASD-related traits in populations not considered to have ASD. Their findings, published in Nature Genetics, suggest that genetic risk underlying ASD, including both inherited variants and de novo influences (not seen in an individual s parents), affects a range of behavioural and developmental traits across the population, with those diagnosed with ASD representing a severe presentation of those traits. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a class of neurodevelopmental conditions affecting about 1 in 100 children. They are characterised by social interaction difficulties, communication and language impairments, as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviour. These core symptoms are central to the definition of an ASD diagnosis but also occur, to varying degrees, in unaffected individuals and form an underlying behavioural continuum. With recent advances in genome sequencing and analysis, a picture of ASD s genetic landscape has started to take shape. Research has shown that most ASD risk is polygenic (stemming from the combined small effects of thousands of genetic differences, distributed across the genome). Some cases are also associated with rare genetic variants of large effect, which are usually de novo.  There has been a lot of strong but indirect evidence that has suggested these findings,  said Dr Mark Daly, co-director of the Broad Institute s Medical and Population Genetics (MPG) Program and senior author of the study.  Once we had measurable genetic signals in hand   both polygenic risk and specific de novo mutations known to contribute to ASD   we were able to make an incontrovertible case that the genetic risk contributing to autism is genetic risk that exists in all of us, and influences our behaviour and social communication.  Study co-first author Dr Elise Robinson, from MGH, said:  We can use behavioural and cognitive data in the general population to untangle the mechanisms through which different types of genetic risk are operating. We now have a better path forward in terms of expecting what types of disorders and traits are going to be associated with certain types of genetic risk.   Our study shows that collecting and using phenotypic and genetic data in typically developing children can be useful in terms of the design and interpretation of studies targeting complex neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders,"" said study co-first author Dr Beate St Pourcain, from the Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol and the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.  Based on the genetic link between population-based social-communication difficulties and clinical ASD, we may now gain further phenotypic insight into a defined set of genetically-influenced ASD symptoms. This may help us to identify and investigate biological processes in typically-developing children, which are disturbed in children with ASD.  The data on unaffected individuals came from a general population cohort (the Bristol-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) and a nuclear family cohort (the Simons Simplex Collection) of ASD cases and unaffected siblings; ASD collections included several large, international autism genetic studies: the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Autism group, the iPSYCH autism project in Denmark, the SSC, and the Autism Sequencing Consortium. Professor George Davey Smith, co-author and scientific director of ALSPAC, said:  Many traits that related to disease risk   like blood pressure or cholesterol levels   demonstrate a similar continuum of risk, with contributions from common and rare genetic variants, plus environmental and chance events. The present study demonstrates how this continuum applies to a condition generally thought of as either existing or not.  The researchers expect the approach to be used to explore the associations between genetic risk and behavioural traits in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia in the future.","Published: March 22, 2016"

The test is indicated for use with symptomatic individuals to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infections. The assay is not intended to be used for prenatal screening. The ARIES  HSV 1&2 Assay is indicated for use on the ARIES  System. About Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 (HSV 1&2) HSV-1 is a contagious infection, which is common and endemic throughout the world. The virus causes lifelong infection, and there is no cure, although treatment can reduce symptoms. It is mainly transmitted through oral-oral contact and causes ""cold sores."" HSV-2 infection is widespread and mainly sexually transmitted. It is estimated that up to 20 million people are newly infected with HSV-2 each year. HSV-2 causes genital herpes, characterized by the occasional appearance of painful genital ulcers. In addition, HSV 1&2 are common causes of viral meningitis and encephalitis, which are inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord or brain, respectively. Prescription antivirals to treat herpes simplex include acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir. Serious complications occur most often in unborn babies, newborns, and people who have a long-term illness such as cancer or HIV/AIDS, or have a weakened immune system.","Published: March 22, 2016"

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/know-thy-helicobacter-pylori-199205,Know Thy Helicobacter pylori Non invasive method for genotyping H pylori developed  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Approximately half of the world s population is infected with the gastric bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). While some cases of H. pylori infection can lead to gastric cancer, most infections remain either asymptomatic or can even be protective in esophageal cancer or asthma. A combination of environmental factors and genetics of both the host and pathogen contribute to disease outcome, so determining the strain characteristics of H. pylori present in infected individuals is an important goal of molecular epidemiology studies. However, current strategies for detecting and genotyping H. pylori require an endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract, which prevents sampling from asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective non-invasive methods for genotyping H. pylori. A new Fred Hutch study led by Dr. Sarah Talarico, an associate in Dr. Nina Salama s Laboratory (Public Health Sciences, Basic Sciences and Human Biology Divisions) and published in Helicobacter, accomplished just that by developing and validating a non-invasive, stool-based method for genotyping H. pylori. A key feature of the study was a recent development in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, named droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), that uses a water-oil emulsion system to partition a 20 microliter reaction into thousands of nanoliter-sized droplets. With this protocol, at most one DNA fragment is present in any droplet. The PCR reaction is carried out within each droplet and by determining the frequency of positive droplets, allows a quantitative readout. To develop the assay, the researchers obtained matched stool and serum from 50 volunteers from a Costa Rican cohort as well as stool samples from 29 individuals that had been admitted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for various medical reasons. To test the performance of the assay, the authors introduced known quantities of H. pylori DNA into a stool DNA sample form an H. pylori negative volunteer. These experiments revealed a clear separation between droplets positive for the 16S ribosomal gene (a gene that is specific for each bacterial species) and droplets that lacked the 16S gene (see figure). The presence of the cagA gene in H. pylori and its allelic variants is associated with increased risk of developing gastric cancer. For example, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on an amino acid motif, EPIYA, which can classify a strain as either having an EPIYA-C or an EPIYA-D motif, with the latter being linked to increased gastric cancer risk. ThecagA specific ddPCR correctly identified and determined the EPIYA type in 15 out of 16 strains tested (94%). Next, the researchers compared their ddPCR assay with other non-invasive assays such as the H. pylori serum antibody test. The ddPCR assay detected H. pylori in the stool of 27 out of 32 Costa Rican participants who were positive for serum antibodies and in 12 out of 12 that were positive in the stool antigen test from the Harborview participants. Intriguingly, there was considerable variation in the H. pylori load in both the Costa Rican and US samples, wherein samples that tested positive for CagA tended to have higher loads. Said Dr. Talarico ""The quantitative nature of the droplet digital PCR method revealed variation in H. pylori load in the stool. Those infected with an H. pylori strain having the cagA virulence gene had a significantly higher H. pylori load, a correlation that has also been observed in the stomach. We are conducting additional studies to better understand the relationship between H. pylori load in the stomach and in the stool. We are excited to continue adapting this new stool-based method for future molecular epidemiologic studies to look at other H. pylori genotypes, including antibiotic resistance alleles, other virulence genes, and to determine strain ancestry. Since this non-invasive assay can be used even for the majority of H. pylori-infected individuals who are asymptomatic, this opens up many more study design possibilities"". In summary, this study developed an assay to detect and genotype H. pylori that is both quantitative and non-invasive, and warrants further validation by using it with matched gastric biopsy samples from diverse populations.","Published: March 22, 2016"

NovAliX has integrated a cryo-EM workflow based on a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The collaboration combines application, training, and support with on-site personnel from FEI.  There is a growing demand for structural studies from the pharmaceutical industry, driven by the need for a deeper scientific understanding, and also because of stronger regulatory constraints. In the field of biologics, EM analysis has proven to be capable of delivering critical information for antibody selection, epitope mapping and formulation. As for small molecules research programs, cryo-EM can be uniquely valuable to obtain structural information on multi-protein complexes or membrane proteins, which is key to understanding the structure-function relationship,  said Denis Zeyer, CEO, NovAliX. TEM-based structural analysis has emerged as an important complementary technique to traditional methods, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Although TEM lacks the atomic-scale resolution of those techniques, it can look at a broader range of structures under conditions much closer to the native intracellular environment. Zeyer added,  During the latest NovAliX conference, we have witnessed the interest and the relevance of biophysical tools in drug discovery. So, this new offering will nicely complement our structural biology and biophysical platform that includes X-ray, NMR, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and native mass spectrometry (native MS). Now with cryo-EM available, NovAliX scientists are able to deliver critical insights into the biology of protein complexes. Indeed, we will be able to fit X-ray structural results of individual proteins with a global structural view of the complex obtained by cryo-EM, which is otherwise not easily accessible.  Peter Fruhstorfer, vice president and general manager of FEI s Life Sciences Business states,  We are extremely pleased to be able to work with a leading contract research organization like NovAliX. The power and value of cryo-EM based structural analysis is evident from the quality of recent publications by academic and industry researchers. This collaboration with NovAliX is an important step in the broader commercialization and industrialization of the technology. ","Published: March 22, 2016"

During tumour growth, cancer cells can break off and travel in the bloodstream or lymph system to other parts of the body, in a process called metastasis. Patients whose cancers spread tend to have a worse prognosis, explains Professor Justin Stebbing, senior author of the study from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial: ""The ability of a cancer to spread around the body has a large impact on a patient's survival. However, at the moment we are still in the dark about why some cancers spread around the body - while others stay in one place. This study has given important insights into this process."" The researchers were looking at breast and lung cancer cells and they found that a protein called MARK4 enables the cells to break free and move around to other parts of the body, such as the brain and liver. Although scientist are still unsure how it does this, one theory is it affects the cell's internal scaffolding, enabling it to move more easily around the body. The team found that a molecule called miR-515-5p helps to silence, or switch off, the gene that produces MARK4. In the study, the team used human breast cancer and lung cancer cells to show that the miR-515-5p molecule silences the gene MARK4. They then confirmed this in mouse models, which showed that increasing the amount of miR-515-5p prevents the spread of cancer cells. The findings also revealed that the silencer molecule was found in lower levels in human tumours that had spread around the body. The team then also established that patients with breast and lung cancers whose tumours had low amounts of these silencer molecules - or high amounts of MARK4 - had lower survival rates. Researchers are now investigating whether either the MARK4 gene or the silencer molecule could be targeted with drugs. They are also investigating whether these molecules could be used to develop a test to indicate whether a patient's cancer is likely to spread. Professor Stebbing said: ""In our work we have shown that this silencer molecule is important in the spread of cancer. This is very early stage research, so we now need more studies to find out more about this molecule, and if it is present in other types of cancer."" Dr Olivier Pardo, lead author of the paper, also from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial, added: ""Our work also identified that MARK4 enables breast and lung cancer cells to both divide and invade other parts of the body. These findings could have profound implications for treating breast and lung cancers, two of the biggest cancer killers worldwide.""

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/md-andersondeveloped-breast-cancer-staging-system-200399,MD Anderson Developed Breast Cancer Staging System Researchers at MD Anderson have developed breast cancer staging system emphasizes importance of tumor biology as prognostic indicator for pre surgical  therapy for breast cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new breast cancer staging system developed by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center finds that incorporating tumor biology is a critical prognostic indicator for women who undergo neoadjuvant, or pre-surgical, therapy for breast cancer. The Neo-Bioscore staging system, published in JAMA Oncology, incorporates HER2 status, thereby allowing for more precise prognostic stratification of all breast cancer subtypes. Understanding a patient s individual response to therapy could inform clinicians of which patients would benefit from additional therapy. Historically, breast cancer patients have been staged by the size of the primary tumor, metastasis or disease in the lymph nodes at the time of presentation. Yet, says Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor, Breast Surgical Oncology, this fails to take into account the biology of the tumor, which has shown to be critically important. These findings build on MD Anderson s earlier development of a breast cancer staging system, CPS+EG, which incorporates preclinical stage (CS), estrogen receptor status (E), grade (G) and post-treatment pathologic stage (PS). However, explains Mittendorf, the CPS+EG system predated the routine use of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the neoadjuvant setting, so the staging system was limited by its inability to provide prognostic information for HER2-positive patients.  Our initial study found that if we incorporate the clinical and pathologic stage, then we can have more refined stratification of patients  prognosis,  says Mittendorf, the study s corresponding author.  We also found that biological factors, such as estrogen receptor status and grade were important.   This new staging system, Neo-Bioscore, which adds HER2 status, is another piece of the puzzle showing that the biology of breast cancer, with respect to prognosis, is critically important,  says Kelly Hunt, M.D., professor and chair, ad interim, Breast Surgical Oncology, also a corresponding author on the study. For the retrospective study, the researchers evaluated 2,377 MD Anderson breast cancer patients from a prospectively maintained database; all were non-metastatic invasive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. None of the evaluated patients were included in the development or validation of the CPS+EG staging system. Clinicopathologic data and stage were determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging guidelines. All patients received either anthracycline and/or taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy; trastuzumab was administered for those with HER2-positive disease. The median age was 50 and the median follow-up time was 4.2 years. The five-year disease-specific survival rate was 89 percent. After neoadjuvant treatment, all patients underwent local therapy   either breast conserving surgery, axillary evaluation and whole breast radiation, or mastectomy with axillary evaluation, with or without post-operative radiation. A CPS+EG score was determined for each patient, with HER-2 status added to the model. The novel staging system, Neo-Bioscore, was constructed by adding a point to the CPS+EG score for HER2-negative tumors. The researchers determined that the cohort validated previous findings: CPS+EG score improved prognostication of patients. They also discovered that when the Neo-Bioscore was applied, there was a shift from the previous CPS+EG scoring, therefore, more refined stratification in 1,786 (or 75 percent) of patients. This shift reflects the number of HER2-negative tumors in the study. Also, when adding HER2, the improvement was highly significant. Mittendorf says that before this study, there was a paucity of data in the literature incorporating biology into breast cancer staging.  With this tool, I can give my patients the precise information they are looking for   a more refined prognosis. Also, with this data, we will know which patients are in greatest need of additional therapy,  says Mittendorf.  Hopefully these findings will result in more informed conversations between doctor and patient.  With this data, Mittendorf and Hunt hope that guidelines will be updated reflecting the importance of biology in staging and prognosis. In addition to Mittendorf and Hunt, other authors on the all-MD Anderson study include: Jose Vila, M.D., Breast Surgical Oncology; Susan L. Tucker, Ph.D., Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Mariana Chavez Mac Gregor, M.D., Breast Medical Oncology and Health Services Research; W. Fraser Symmans, M.D., and Aysegul A.

Under the terms of the CRADA, RareCyte and the NCI will collaborate over a 3- year period to investigate the use of RareCyte s technology to identify, characterize, capture and analyze rare immune cell populations as well as individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from preclinical and clinical studies conducted by the NCI. The specific goals of the CRADA include the detection, characterization, single cell retrieval, and analysis of rare circulating immune cells, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells and antigen-specific conventional T cells, and CTCs derived from preclinical and clinical studies conducted by the NCI and the development of assays showing response to immunotherapy and the extent of cancer progression. The study will be led by NCI principal investigator, Jay A. Berzofsky MD, PhD, chief of the Vaccine Branch of the NCI. He and Masaki Terabe, PhD, deputy section chief and head of the Cancer Immunology Unit, have deep expertise in T cell immunology and tumor immunology and translation of basic immunological research to strategies to develop vaccines. Joining them will be Lauren V. Wood MD, clinical director of the NCI Vaccine Branch, who has done extensive clinical research in cancer and HIV infection and clinical translation of therapeutic vaccine platforms into first-in-human trials. The group will also collaborate with Jane Trepel who heads the Preclinical Development Core within the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Branch, which focuses on drug development and currently participates in more than 50 clinical trials.  With advances in cancer immunotherapy, a significant challenge remains in identifying immunologic responses that correlate with beneficial clinical outcomes,  stated Eric Kaldjian, MD, chief medical officer of RareCyte and CRADA collaborator principal investigator.  The ability to characterize the immune response is an important aspect of personalized approaches for patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy. We believe that RareCyte s technology makes this possible.  RareCyte s integrated rare cell separation, identification and retrieval platform starts with the AccuCyte  blood separation system for comprehensive collection and transfer to slide of the nucleated cell fraction of a blood draw containing leukocytes and CTCs. Slides are then stained in the same manner as tissue sections or cytology preparations followed by high resolution microscopic scanning with the CyteFinder  instrument. Using up to 6-channel immunofluorescence staining and detection, rare immune cell subsets may be identified by the RareCyte platform. The method has a high recovery rate (>90%) and can detect a single cancer cell in a tube of blood containing 40-50 million leukocytes. Ultimately, individual cells can be captured for genomic analysis using the CytePicker  retrieval device incorporated in the CyteFinder instrument.","Published: March 22, 2016"

Leroy (Lee) Hood, MD, PhD, who was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Obama for his outstanding contributions to biology and medicine, will serve as senior vice president and chief science officer of Providence Health & Services, a five-state, not-for-profit health system, and continue as president of the Seattle-based ISB.  This is an exciting moment for our patients,  stated Rod Hochman, MD, president and CEO of Providence Health & Services.  With Lee s visionary leadership, ISB has transformed the global understanding of human diseases and pioneered the emerging sector of scientific wellness. Together, we will connect research and clinical expertise to shift health care delivery from a disease focus to a wellness focus.  Providence and ISB will establish a number of joint research projects in scientific wellness, employing the approach of dense, dynamic personalized data clouds. These include: following and understanding early transitions from wellness to disease; analyzing patient populations longitudinally that are at risk for Alzheimer s; helping breast cancer patients recover from illness following debilitating therapies; and utilizing novel approaches to successfully treat glioblastoma (brain cancer), which is currently an incurable disease. For example, the hope is that through systems-driven approaches, we will convert glioblastoma to a chronic disease in five years (like HIV/AIDS) and in 10 years we will have a cure. These approaches will lead to medicine that is vastly improved in quality and significantly less expensive.  Rod and his team are leading the way in driving the paradigm shift that is taking place in health care,  stated Hood.  This, combined with Providence s vast network of hospitals, outstanding clinicians, and the rich collection of data from the more than 3.3 million patients they serve will help accelerate discovery of powerful insights into scientific wellness and disease. Further, it will enable us for the first time ever to apply ISB-driven systems approaches for optimizing wellness and minimizing disease to patient care. ISB s goal is to develop metrics to quantify scientific wellness and identify the earliest markers of transition for all common diseases. It is focused on generating dense, dynamic and personalized clouds of billions of de-identified data points that will provide unique insights into the wellness and disease of each individual over time. This will enable the understanding of disease mechanisms and the ability to design diagnostic and therapeutic tools that will allow the early reversal of disease back to wellness   or even prevent the onset of the disease in the first place. This represents a bold new approach to preventive medicine. The affiliation will enable ISB to expand its research capacity during the next few years and recruit outstanding new faculty in the areas of systems biology, technology development, data and analytics and translational medicine. In addition, ISB will collaborate with the large pool of Providence affiliated clinicians and scientists in exciting new translational research initiatives that will build on the leading-edge programs in basic, translational and clinical research already underway at both institutions.  This affiliation is an important step forward in applying innovations in biomedical research for the direct benefit of patients,  stated Dave Sabey, chair of the ISB board of directors.  This partnership will bring about the next generation of health care throughout one of the largest health systems in the United States.  The ISB affiliation is through Western Health Connect, the secular (non-religious) organization formed to allow Providence to remain Catholic and secular organizations to remain secular. This is the same model successfully used for Providence s affiliations with Swedish Health Services, Pacific Medical Centers and Kadlec Regional Medical Center, all non-religious organizations. ISB will remain a separate legal entity with its own brand and identity and board of directors. ISB will continue to set its own research agenda and oversee its daily management and operations. Both Providence and ISB are committed to transferring knowledge to society through commercialization of tools and technologies that will advance personalized medicine. ISB has spun off eight companies in the 15 years of its existence, including: Accelerator Corporation, Arivale, Indi (Integrated Diagnostics) and NanoString Technologies (NASDAQ: NSTG). In 2014, Providence founded Providence Ventures, a fund designed to achieve venture class returns through direct investments in innovative health care companies that improve quality, convenience and health outcomes. Providence and ISB plan to increase synergy between investment and innovation.","Published: March 22, 2016"

Or are we fundamentally selfish brutes who need civilization to rein in our base impulses, as the 17th century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued? After exploring the areas of the brain that fuel our empathetic impulses and temporarily disabling other regions that oppose those impulses two University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) neuroscientists are coming down on the optimistic side of human nature. See Also: Empathy more common in animals than thought ""Our altruism may be more hard-wired than previously thought,"" said Leonardo Christov-Moore, a postdoctoral fellow at UCLA's Semel Institute of Neuroscience and Human Behavior. The findings, reported in two recent studies, also point to a possible way to make people behave in less selfish and more altruistic ways, said senior author Marco Iacoboni, a UCLA psychiatry professor. ""This is potentially groundbreaking,"" he said. For the first study, which was published in February in Human Brain Mapping, 20 people were shown a video of a hand being poked with a pin and then asked to imitate photographs of faces displaying a range of emotions happy, sad, angry and excited. Meanwhile, the researchers scanned participants' brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging, paying close attention to activity in several areas of the brain. One cluster they analyzed the amygdala, somatosensory cortex and anterior insula is associated with experiencing pain and emotion and with imitating others. Two other areas are in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for regulating behavior and controlling impulses. In a separate activity, participants played the dictator game, which economists and other social scientists often use to study decision-making. Participants are given a certain amount of money to either keep for themselves or share with a stranger. In the UCLA study, participants were given $10 per round for 24 rounds, and the recipients were actual Los Angeles residents whose names were changed for the game, but whose actual ages and income levels were used. After each participant had completed the game, researchers compared their payouts with brain scans. Participants with the most activity in the prefrontal cortex proved to be the stingiest, giving away an average of only $1 to $3 per round. But the one-third of the participants who had the strongest responses in the areas of the brain associated with perceiving pain and emotion and imitating others were the most generous: On average, subjects in that group gave away approximately 75 percent of their bounty. Researchers referred to this tendency as ""prosocial resonance"" or mirroring impulse, and they believe the impulse to be a primary driving force behind altruism. ""It's almost like these areas of the brain behave according to a neural Golden Rule,"" Christov-Moore said. ""The more we tend to vicariously experience the states of others, the more we appear to be inclined to treat them as we would ourselves."" In the second study, published earlier this month in Social Neuroscience, the researchers set out to determine whether the same portions of the prefrontal cortex might be blocking the altruistic mirroring impulse. In this study, 58 study participants were subjected to 40 seconds of a noninvasive procedure called theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation, which temporarily dampens activity in specific regions of the brain. In the 20 participants assigned to the control group, a portion of the brain that had to do with sight was weakened on the theory it would have no effect on generosity. But in the others, the researchers dampened either the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which combine to block impulses of all varieties. Christov-Moore said that if people really were inherently selfish, weakening those areas of the brain would free people to act more selfishly. In fact, though, study participants with disrupted activity in the brain's impulse control center were 50 percent more generous than members of the control group. ""Knocking out these areas appears to free your ability to feel for others,"" Christov-Moore said. Learn More: Training brain patterns of empathy using functional brain imaging The researchers also found that who people chose to give their money to changed depending on which part of the prefrontal cortex was dampened. Participants whose dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was dampened, meanwhile, tended to be more generous overall. But those whose dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was dampened tended to be more generous to recipients with higher incomes -- people who appeared to be less in need of a handout. ""Normally, participants would have been expected to give according to need, but with that area of the brain dampened, they temporarily lost the ability for social judgments to affect their behavior,"" Christov-Moore said. ""By dampening this area, we believe we laid bare how altruistic each study participant naturally was."" The findings of both studies suggest potential avenues for increasing empathy, which is especially critical in treating people who have experienced desensitizing situations like prison or war. ""The study is important proof of principle that with a noninvasive procedure you can make people behave in a more prosocial way,"" Iacoboni said.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/early-indicator-of-breast-cancer-193085,Early Indicator of Breast Cancer When mutated  a gene known for its ability to repair DNA  appears to instead cause breast cancer  scientists report  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The gene GT198, whether mutated by genetics and/or environmental factors, has strong potential as both as a way to diagnose breast cancer early and as a new treatment target, said Dr. Lan Ko, cancer biologist in the Department of Pathology at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and at the Georgia Cancer Center at AU. Mutations of the gene are known to be present in both early onset breast and ovarian cancer. Now scientists have shown that the stem, or progenitor cells, which should ultimately make healthy breast tissue, can also have GT198 mutations that prompt them to instead make a perfect bed for breast cancer. Their studies were done on an international sampling from 254 cases of breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. ""This gene mutation can be in both the blood and the tumor tissue of patients, and in the tissue, it's in high percentages,"" said Ko, the study's corresponding author. ""We believe that once this gene is mutated, it induces the tumor to grow."" GT198, which is also a coactivator of receptors for steroid hormones such as estrogen, is normally regulated by estrogen, Ko said. But once mutated, GT198 can enable tumor production without estrogen. ""Regardless of how much hormone you have, it's out-of-control growth,"" Ko said of the resulting classic, rapid growth of cancer. In a cancerous breast, scientists have seen the problems with the various components of breast tissue but could not fully explain why they happened. The tissue, called the stroma, includes fat cells, or adipocytes, that provide padding; fibroblasts, which make the framework for tissue; pericytes in blood vessels, which are contractile cells that help regulate blood pressure; as well as myoepithelial cells comprising the outer layer of the ductal system through which milk flows. The new study backs up a few steps and shows that mutated GT198 also directly affects stem cells found on blood vessels that make these various components of breast tissue. ""This puts it together,"" Ko said. ""It's a new target in cancer. It's very exciting,"" said Dr. Nita Maihle, MCG cancer biologist, associate center director for education at the university's Cancer Center and a study co-author. ""This tells you that all the different types of stromal cells in breast tissue are affected by the GT198 mutation because they all come from a common progenitor cell."" The net effect is a tumorigenic environment filled with what Ko calls inappropriate offspring. ""Here is a cause-consequence relationship,"" she said. Next steps include pursuing therapies, including antibodies and herb-derived treatments, that target the misguided progenitor cells, instead of only targeting the cancerous breast tissue they produce, Ko said. ""We think the way to treat breast cancer is to target the progenitor cells. We want to kill these cells that are feeding the tumor rather than just killing the tumor cells, which is less effective."" In a 2013 study in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Ko and her colleagues showed tumor cells containing mutated GT198 protein in the stroma in various types of ovarian cancer, indicating the gene could also be a source for ovarian cancer. Ko first cloned the human GT198 gene while a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, and subsequent studies by her and others have shown it has multiple roles that also include regulating stem cells, cell suicide and turning other genes off and on. All cells have the GT198 gene but most adult cells don't express it. In the breast, for example, it may be transiently expressed in a pregnant woman preparing for milk production and, potentially, in the case of breast injury. Males express it in the testes. Ductal breast cancer, which is in the ducts that carry milk, is the most common type of breast cancer and lobular carcinoma, which begins in the milk-producing glands, is the second most common. Most breast cancer comes from the cells that line those ducts, Maihle said. BRCA1 and 2, genes whose proteins are supposed to work as tumor suppressors and also repair DNA damage, were the first known risk factor genes for familial breast cancer as well as ovarian and other cancers. About 4 percent of familial breast cancers would include inherited mutations of GT198, which is also considered a causative gene in sporadic cases, Ko said.","Published: March 21, 2016"

Metrion, with partners Nanion Technologies ( Nanion , www.nanion.de) and the stem cell cardiomyocyte group at Leiden University Medical Center ( Leiden , www.lumc.nl), will use the funding to develop improved human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and screening platforms. The goal of the project is to develop innovative phenotypic cardiac safety assays enabling improved evaluation of the proarrhythmic risk of novel therapeutics. The project has received funding from the Eurostars-2 joint programme with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and from Innovate UK, the UK s innovation agency. Metrion will use Nanion s CardioExcyte96 platform, which enables simultaneous recording of cardiac cell electrical activity and contractility, to develop CiPA (Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmic Assay) compliant cardiac safety assays using human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes developed at Leiden. The resulting proprietary phenotypic assays will be commercialised by Metrion and offered to customers, alongside the Company s existing CiPA-approved human cardiac ion channel panel and manual patch clamp electrophysiology capabilities. The CiPA initiative is being sponsored by the FDA to improve the protocols for assessing proarrhythmic risk for novel therapeutics. The new initiative aims to combine screening of an expanded panel of in vitro human cardiac ion channel targets (including hERG) with computer modelling to assess the overall risk of new chemical entities to induce arrhythmia in human cardiac cells. The in vitro screening data and in silico predictions will be validated using translational assays employing human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. This approach should enhance the accuracy with which new drugs are evaluated for proarrhythmic risk and allow earlier detection of cardiac safety issues. The CiPA initiative may also prevent the exclusion of potentially useful therapeutics as well as enabling the repurposing of previous drug candidates sidelined solely as a result of their in vitro hERG liability. The more predictive evaluation of proarrhythmic risk may also mitigate the requirement to perform costly Thorough QT studies in the clinic. Dr Marc Rogers, CSO of Metrion Biosciences, commented:  We are delighted to be working alongside leading experts in stem cell cardiomyocytes and screening platform technologies to develop these new assay capabilities. This project supports Metrion s goal of becoming a leading CRO provider in the cardiac safety screening market, enabling customers to access all three CiPA-related services through one provider.

""We showed that all of the bacteria were killed pretty quickly . . . within 5 to 25 seconds. That's a very fast process,"" said corresponding author Wei-Chuan Shih, a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department, University of Houston, Texas. Scientists create gold nanoparticles in the lab by dissolving gold, reducing the metal into smaller and smaller disconnected pieces until the size must be measured in nanometers. One nanometer equals a billionth of a meter. A human hair is between 50,000 to 100,000 nanometers in diameter. Once miniaturized, the particles can be crafted into various shapes including rods, triangles or disks. Previous research shows that gold nanoparticles absorb light strongly, converting the photons quickly into heat and reaching temperatures hot enough to destroy various types of nearby cells   including cancer and bacterial cells. In 2013, Shih and his colleagues from the University of Houston created a new type of gold disk-like nanoparticle that measures to a few hundred nanometers in diameter. The disks are riddled with pores, lending the particles a sponge-like look that helps increase their heating efficiency while maintaining their stability, said Shih. In the new work, the researchers set out to test the antimicrobial properties of their new nanoparticles when activated by light. They grew bacteria in the lab including  E. coli and two types of heat-resistant bacteria that thrive in even the most scorching environments such as the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. Then, they placed the bacteria cells on surface of a single-layer coating of the tiny disks and shone near infrared light from a laser on them. Afterward, they used cell viability tests and SEM imaging to see what percentage of cells survived the procedure. Using a thermal imaging camera, the research team showed that the surface temperature of the particles reached temperatures up to 180 degrees Celsius nearly instantaneously, ""delivering thermal shocks"" into the surrounding array. As a result, all of the bacterial cells were killed within 25 seconds, the researchers report. E. coli proved most vulnerable to the treatment; all of its cells were dead after only five seconds of laser exposure. The other two types of bacteria required the full 25 seconds, but that's still much quicker than traditional sterilization methods such as boiling water or using dry-heat ovens, which can take minutes to an hour to work, said Shih. And it's ""considerably shorter"" than what other nanoparticle arrays have demonstrated in recent studies, the researchers write. The time needed to achieve similar levels of cell death in those studies ranges from 1 to 20 minutes. In control trials, the researchers found that neither the gold disks nor light from the laser alone killed nearly as many cells. The technique has important potential biomedical applications, said Shih. Currently, the researchers are investigating using the particles as a simple coating for catheters to help reduce the number of urinary tract infections in hospitals. ""Any sort of light activated procedure would be much easier to implement at the bedside of a patient,"" instead of removing and potentially replacing the catheter every time it needs to be cleaned, he said. Another potential application they're exploring is integrating the nanoparticles with filter membranes in small water filters, he said, to help improve water quality.","Published: March 21, 2016"

The Neo-Bioscore staging system incorporates HER2 status, thereby allowing for more precise prognostic stratification of all breast cancer subtypes. Understanding a patient s individual response to therapy could inform clinicians of which patients would benefit from additional therapy.  Historically, breast cancer patients have been staged by the size of the primary tumor, metastasis or disease in the lymph nodes at the time of presentation. Yet, says Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor, Breast Surgical Oncology, this fails to take into account the biology of the tumor, which has shown to be critically important. These findings build on MD Anderson s earlier development of a breast cancer staging system, CPS+EG, which incorporates preclinical stage (CS), estrogen receptor status (E), grade (G) and post-treatment pathologic stage (PS). However, explains Mittendorf, the CPS+EG system predated the routine use of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the neoadjuvant setting, so the staging system was limited by its inability to provide prognostic information for HER2-positive patients.   Our initial study found that if we incorporate the clinical and pathologic stage, then we can have more refined stratification of patients  prognosis,  says Mittendorf, the study s corresponding author.  We also found that biological factors, such as estrogen receptor status and grade were important.   This new staging system, Neo-Bioscore, which adds HER2 status, is another piece of the puzzle showing that the biology of breast cancer, with respect to prognosis, is critically important,  says Kelly Hunt, M.D., professor and chair, ad interim, Breast Surgical Oncology, also a corresponding author on the study. For the retrospective study, the researchers evaluated 2,377 MD Anderson breast cancer patients from a prospectively maintained database; all were non-metastatic invasive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. None of the evaluated patients were included in the development or validation of the CPS+EG staging system. Clinicopathologic data and stage were determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging guidelines. All patients received either anthracycline and/or taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy; trastuzumab was administered for those with HER2-positive disease. The median age was 50 and the median follow-up time was 4.2 years. The five-year disease-specific survival rate was 89 percent. After neoadjuvant treatment, all patients underwent local therapy   either breast conserving surgery, axillary evaluation and whole breast radiation, or mastectomy with axillary evaluation, with or without post-operative radiation. A CPS+EG score was determined for each patient, with HER-2 status added to the model. The novel staging system, Neo-Bioscore, was constructed by adding a point to the CPS+EG score for HER2-negative tumors. The researchers determined that the cohort validated previous findings: CPS+EG score improved prognostication of patients. They also discovered that when the Neo-Bioscore was applied, there was a shift from the previous CPS+EG scoring, therefore, more refined stratification in 1,786 (or 75 percent) of patients. This shift reflects the number of HER2-negative tumors in the study. Also, when adding HER2, the improvement was highly significant. Mittendorf says that before this study, there was a paucity of data in the literature incorporating biology into breast cancer staging.  With this tool, I can give my patients the precise information they are looking for   a more refined prognosis. Also, with this data, we will know which patients are in greatest need of additional therapy,  says Mittendorf.  Hopefully these findings will result in more informed conversations between doctor and patient.  With this data, Mittendorf and Hunt hope that guidelines will be updated reflecting the importance of biology in staging and prognosis.","Published: March 21, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/possible-drug-for-listeria-205678,Possible Drug for Listeria Chemical compounds discovered which are able to attenuate the virulence of the bacterial human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The dramatic increase of antibiotic resistance makes new antimicrobial strategies necessary. The researchers at Ume  University in Sweden are studying an alternative approach, to inhibit the disease capacity (virulence) of bacteria but not their viability. Compared with traditional antibiotics, which often kill the bacteria, the risk of resistance development in disarmed bacteria is lower, since their survival does not depend on resistance against the new drug. A Listeria infection can be very severe, particularly among patients such as elderly, infants, immunocompromised or pregnant women. Although disease occurrence is relatively low, Listeria s severe and sometimes fatal health consequences make it among the most serious foodborne infections, with a mortality of 30%. Listeria is found in unpasteurized dairy products and various ready-to-eat foods, and can grow at refrigeration temperatures. In Sweden, 60-90 people per year get infected and the statistics show that the number of outbreaks is increasing. The study involved several different Ume  University research groups with diverse specialties: Microbiology, Chemistry and Structural Biology. The group of J rgen Johansson, professor at the laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS) and the Department of Molecular Biology collaborated with the research groups of Elisabeth Sauer-Eriksson and Fredrik Almqvist, both professors at the Department of Chemistry. The researchers tested a large number of possible candidates, which could inhibit expression of the Listeria virulence factors. For the test, they screened Listeriainfection of human cells with a collection of ring-fused 2-pyridones. The scientists could prove that the ring-fused 2-pyridones could both attenuate the uptake of Listeria in the cell and the activity of the virulence regulator PrfA, which control the pathogenic abilities of Listeria. The researchers also identified the first crystal structure of PrfA together with an inhibitor. Binding of the inhibitor to PrfA blocked its ability to interact with DNA, thereby preventing expression of virulence factors. As a consequence, Listeria bacteria were not able to bind and infect the human cells.  This study means a lot for future development of  disarming compounds , not only inListeria. In fact, our study is the first example on a structural level of an inhibition of any virulence regulator in bacteria,  says J rgen Johansson about the impact of the findings.  The first results are very promising. We have been able to use the structural information to design and synthesize new improved candidates that are now being evaluated , added Fredrik Almqvist.  We now know that this class of compounds (2-pyridones) constitute a great platform for the development of virulence blocking compounds. We have developed methods that allow us to fine-tune the substitution pattern and compound properties in such a way that we can direct these compounds towards several different pathogens e.g. E. coli and Chlamydia.

But the treatment also comes with side effects, including the risk of ulcers and increased blood pressure. A major new study now gathers all research in the area. This shows that arthritis medicine is particularly dangerous for heart patients, and also that older types of arthritis medicine, which have not previously been in focus, also appear to be dangerous for the heart. ""It's been well-known for a number of years that newer types of NSAIDs - what are known as COX-2 inhibitors, increase the risk of heart attacks. For this reason, a number of these newer types of NSAIDs have been taken off the market again. We can now see that some of the older NSAID types, particularly Diclofenac, are also associated with an increased risk of heart attack and apparently to the same extent as several of the types that were taken off the market,"" says Morten Schmidt, MD and PhD from Aarhus University, who is in charge of the research project. He adds: ""This is worrying, because these older types of medicine are frequently used throughout the western world and in many countries available without prescription."" Each year, more than 15 per cent of the western countries collects a prescription for NSAIDs. This figure increases with age. Sixty per cent of the adult population in Denmark collects at least one prescription for an NSAID within a ten-year period. Heart patients are no exception and previous studies have shown that up to forty per cent of Danish patients with heart failure or previous heart attacks are prescribed NSAIDs. The study, which was carried out in collaboration between 14 European universities and hospitals, including a number of leading European heart specialists, is today being published in the most prestigious European journal of heart medicine, European Heart Journal. New guidelines In the study, the researchers have gathered all research on the use of NSAIDs in patients with heart disease. The survey means that the European Society of Cardiology has now for the first time formulated a number of recommendations about what doctors should consider before prescribing painkillers to their patients. ""When doctors issue prescriptions for NSAIDs, they must in each individual case carry out a thorough assessment of the risk of heart complications and bleeding. NSAIDs should only be sold over the counter when it comes with an adequate warning about the associated cardiovascular risks. In general, NSAIDs are not be used in patients who have or are at high-risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" says another of the authors, Professor in cardiology Christian Torp-Pedersen, Aalborg University, Denmark. Consumption should be reduced even more For a number of years, Danish researchers have made significant contributions in the field. One result of this work has been a reduction in the use of Diclofenac in Denmark. However, according to Morten Schmidt, there is still room for improvement: ""Many European countries consume more of these drugs than Denmark. But we can still do better and it's often the case that paracetamol, physiotherapy, mild opioids or other types of NSAIDs with less risk for the heart would be better for the patients. Of course, the recommendations that have been introduced following our study and its review of the heart-related risks are a big step in the right direction in relation to patient safety,"" says Morten Schmidt. FACTS about arthritis medicine (NSAID):   NSAIDs is an abbreviation for Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and is used to treat a wide range of diseases, in particular disorders in the muscular and bone system, where the drug counteracts swelling, pain and limitations in movement associated with inflammation.   NSAIDs are not antibiotics and therefore do not help to fight infections caused by bacteria.   NSAIDs are in Denmark sold both in low doses (Ibuprofen 200 mg/tablet) without a prescription and in higher doses and other types with a prescription.","Published: March 21, 2016"

Epidiolex has both Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare and debilitating type of epilepsy for which there are currently no treatments approved in the U.S. GW Pharmaceuticals announces the positive results of the first pivotal Phase 3 study of its investigational medicine Epidiolex  (cannabidiol or CBD) for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In this study, Epidiolex achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in convulsive seizures assessed over the entire treatment period compared with placebo (p=0.01). Epidiolex has both Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare and debilitating type of epilepsy for which there are currently no treatments approved in the U.S.  The results of this Epidiolex pivotal trial are important and exciting as they represent the first placebo-controlled evidence to support the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical cannabidiol in children with Dravet syndrome, one of the most severe and difficult-to-treat types of epilepsy,  said Orrin Devinsky, M.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center.  These data demonstrate that Epidiolex delivers clinically important reductions in seizure frequency together with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, providing the epilepsy community with the prospect of an appropriately standardized and tested pharmaceutical formulation of cannabidiol being made available by prescription in the future.   The positive outcome of this Phase 3 trial is a significant milestone in the development of Epidiolex as a potential new treatment for patients suffering with Dravet syndrome. We are excited about the potential for Epidiolex to become the first FDA approved treatment option specifically for Dravet syndrome patients and their families,  stated Justin Gover, GW s Chief Executive Officer.  In light of this positive data, we will now request a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed regulatory submission. We also look forward with excitement to the upcoming results from the two Phase 3 trials in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the second pivotal trial in Dravet syndrome.   Dravet syndrome is one of the most catastrophic types of epilepsy in children and safe and effective treatments are desperately needed. We are thrilled to learn of these positive results, which bring much needed hope to the children and families who have been living with these debilitating seizures,  said Mary Anne Meskis, Executive Director of the Dravet Syndrome Foundation. Study Overview The Phase 3 study randomized 120 patients into two arms, Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day (n=61) and placebo (n=59). Epidiolex or placebo was added to current anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment regimens. On average, patients were taking approximately 3 AEDs, having previously tried and failed an average of more than 4 other AEDs. The average age of trial participants was 10 years and 30 percent of patients were less than 6 years of age. The median baseline convulsive seizure frequency per month was 13. The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison between Epidiolex and placebo measuring the percentage change in the monthly frequency of convulsive seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week baseline observation period. In this study, patients taking Epidiolex achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of 39 percent compared with a reduction on placebo of 13 percent, which was highly statistically significant (p=0.01). A series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint confirmed the robustness of this result. The difference between Epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of treatment and was sustained during the entire treatment period. Results from secondary efficacy endpoints reinforced the overall effectiveness observed with Epidiolex.  Epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this study. The most common adverse events (occurring in greater than ten percent of Epidiolex-treated patients) were: somnolence, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, lethargy, upper respiratory tract infection and convulsion.  Of those patients on Epidiolex that reported an adverse event, 84 percent reported it to be mild or moderate. Ten patients on Epidiolex experienced a serious adverse event compared with three patients on placebo. Eight patients on Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with one patient on placebo. Further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings. In addition to this first Phase 3 trial, GW is conducting a second Phase 3 trial in Dravet syndrome which is recruiting 150 patients. GW Clinical Trial Programs in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex In addition to the Dravet syndrome trials, GW is conducting the largest global pivotal clinical trial program to date in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, another rare and severe form of epilepsy. The first Phase 3 trial is a placebo-controlled trial of Epidiolex (at a dose of 20 mg/kg) over a 14 week treatment period and has randomized 171 patients. This trial is expected to report top-line results in the second quarter of 2016. The second placebo-controlled trial has randomized a total of 225 patients and is expected to report top-line results mid-2016. The primary measure of efficacy in these two trials will be the comparison between Epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in number of monthly drop seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week baseline observation period. Based on the findings of the physician-led expanded access program, GW continues to identify additional development targets for Epidiolex within the field of pediatric epilepsy. A Phase 3 trial in a third pediatric epilepsy indication, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, is due to commence imminently and clinical development in a fourth indication is expected to commence in the second half of 2016.","Published: March 21, 2016"

Not an ordinary eraser, of course. More of a drug, really. But if you use it right, it can erase the tiny labels that tell cells where to start reading important chapters in DNA, their inner instruction manual. And if they can t read that manual, the cells regain their full stem cell power   the power to become any kind of cell in the body. In a surprising new finding,University of Michigan Medical School scientists have shown that a drug developed at U-M can achieve this   at least in mice. It s the first time that scientists have shown they can get stem cells to revert to their original state by erasing specific labels called epigenetic markers. The drug specifically targets markers on histones, the protein  spools  that DNA coils around to create structures called chromatin.  Magic  eraser The team reports that more than half of mouse epiblast stem cells treated with the drug reversed course within three days, and regained an embryonic  be anything  state, also called pluripotency. In addition to generating pluripotent stem cells, the team showed that mice bred using the cells grew up healthy.  We ve demonstrated that we don t have to manipulate the pluripotent genes to get to the ground state, but rather that we can block all other options of where the cell  wants  to go. Then the only option is going back to the ground, or na ve, pluripotent state,  says Yali Dou, Ph.D., senior author of the new paper and an associate professor of pathology and biological chemistry at U-M. The researchers used a relatively new compound called MM-401, which U-M scientists originally designed for use in treating leukemia. Now, they re working to see if the MM-401 eraser technique works with human stem cells that bear some resemblance to mouse epiblast stem cells. They will share the drug with any other researchers who want to try the technique. However, it s far too early to see the approach as a way to avoid the use of human embryos for research or potential treatments. Currently, embryos left over from infertility treatments are the only source of human embryonic stem cells. Other techniques can reprogram  adult  cells in the human body taken from skin, for example   but the cells still carry baggage from their previous state. Still, the new achievement shows the power of altering the epigenetic labels that dot the chromatin packaging, without altering the DNA itself. Past attempts by other teams to restore pluripotency to mouse cells from the epiblast stem cell state have yielded far lower amounts, or non-viable cells. And, they ve required cocktails of multiple drugs, given over the long term, to achieve it. The U-M team shows that using MM-401 for just a few days, and then stopping its use, is enough. The first author of the new paper is Hui Zhang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dou s laboratory. Epigenetic maneuvers Epigenetic labels signal to the cell s DNA-reading machinery where they should start uncoiling a chromosome in order to read it. The U-M-developed drug targets the labels that come from the activity of a gene called MLL1. MLL1 plays a key role in the uncontrolled explosion of white blood cells that s the hallmark of leukemia, which is why U-M researchers originally developed MM-401 to interfere with it. But it also plays a much more mundane role in regular cell development, and the formation of blood cells and the cells that form the spinal cord in later-stage embryos. It does this by placing tiny tags -- called methyl groups -- on histones. Without those labels, the cell s DNA-reading machinery doesn t know where to start reading. It s as if the invitation to open the instruction manual had vanished. Stem cells don t harness the power of MLL1 until they re older. So using MM-401 to block MLL1 s normal activity in cells that had started down the path to adulthood meant that histone marks were missing before the cell needed them. The cells couldn t continue on their journey to becoming different types of cells. But they could still function as healthy pluripotent stem cells.  People have been focused on other epigenetic changes that are more dramatic, but ignored methylation by the MLL family,  says Dou.  Deleting MLL1 entirely causes failure later in differentiation. But inhibiting it with a drug temporarily leaves no trace behind.  The U-M team that designed MM-401 is led by co-author Shaomeng Wang, Ph.D., the Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Professor at the Medical School who holds appointments in internal medicine and pharmacology, as well as an appointment in the U-M College of Pharmacy. The team also included Sundeep Kalantry, Ph.D., an assistant professor of human genetics at U-M who showed that female stem cells treated with MM-401 had un-silenced one of their X chromosomes. This step is crucial for showing that cells have returned to true pluripotency. Alexey Nesvizhskii, Ph.D., and his colleagues in Pathology and Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics contributed important analysis to show how changes in MLL1 expression affects other gene expression in cells.","Published: March 21, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/detecting-bacterial-growth-in-packaged-food-192233,Detecting Bacterial Growth in Packaged Food New technique enables fast  accurate and noninvasive measurement of bacteria levels  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It s important to know how microorganisms   particularly pathogenic microbes   grow under various conditions. Certain bacteria can cause food poisoning when eaten and bacterial growth in medical blood supplies, while rare, might necessitate discarding the blood. Now a group of researchers from Zhejiang Normal University in China and Ume  University in Sweden report a fast, accurate, and noninvasive technique for monitoring bacterial growth. They report the results in Applied Optics, a journal of The Optical Society (OSA). Microorganism growth is driven by many factors, which make it far from easy to accurately estimate the amount of bacteria within food containers or blood samples at any given time. To avoid the risk that any particular packaged food item will go bad and cause illness, it s given an unnecessarily short shelf life. In short, a better understanding of the growth process of microorganisms could reduce food waste and prevent people from being sickened by food poisoning   or both. Within the medical realm, it s critical to be able to assess the quality of blood samples quickly and accurately. Without this ability, samples might need to be discarded or, alternatively, result in or worsen illnesses. Although bacterial blood contamination is rare, it does occur and has led to deaths. A rapid screening method could mean that a larger percentage of blood could be directly tested for bacteria.  Microorganism growth is always associated with the production of carbon dioxide (CO2),  said Jie Shao, associate professor at the Institute of Information Optics, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China.  By assessing the level of CO2 within a given closed compartment   bottle or bag   it s possible to assess the microbial growth.  Several detection techniques are currently capable of rapid and accurate measurements of gas compositions. Those based on optical spectrometry are most appealing because they re noninvasive, boast high sensitivity, provide instant responses, and are potentially useful for assessment of bacterial growth.  A technique referred to as  tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy  (TDLAS) is particularly suitable because it combines all of these properties with an ease of use and low cost,  Shao said. So the group decided to develop an easy-to-use instrument based on TDLAS to assess bacterial growth of various types of samples under a variety of conditions. TDLAS is by far the most common laser-based absorption technique for quantitative assessments of species within a gas phase. It can be used to measure the concentration of specific gaseous species   carbon monoxide, CO2, water, or methane, to name a handful   within gaseous mixtures by using absorption spectrometry based on tunable diode lasers.  One major advantage TDLAS offers is its ability to achieve very low detection limits, on the order of parts per billion,  Shao said.  Apart from concentration, it s also possible to determine other properties of the gas under observation   temperature, pressure, velocity and mass flux.  The group s basic setup simply involves a tunable diode laser as the light source, beam shaping optics, a sample to be investigated, receiving optics, and one or more detectors.  The emission wavelength of the laser is tuned over a characteristic absorption line  transition   of the species within the gas being assessed,  Shao explained.  This causes a reduction of the measured signal intensity, which we can use to determine the gas concentration.  When the wavelength is rapidly tuned across the transition in a specific manner, it can be combined with a modulation technique called  wavelength modulation  (WM), which gives the TDLAS technique an enhanced sensitivity. It s referred to as  WM-TDLAS.  By applying the technique to transparent containers of organic substances such as food items or medical samples, bacterial growth can be quickly evaluated.  Although we anticipated that the WM-TDLAS technique would be suitable for assessing bacterial growth, we didn t expect this level of accuracy,  Shao noted. In contrast with conventional and more invasive techniques that require contact with the tested items, the WM-TDLAS method is truly noninvasive, making it ideal for monitoring the status of food and medical supplies, or as a tool to determine under which environmental conditions bacterial growth is expected to be severe.  It can provide real-time analysis,  Shao said. Next, the researchers plan to enhance the technique to  allow for assessments of microbial growth in a large variety of samples   expanding beyond food items and medical supplies,  Shao added.","Published: March 21, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-evolution-formed-the-nucleus-197227,How Evolution Formed the Nucleus Long before animals evolved from sponges  and before plants evolved out of algae  there was a pivotal event that allowed complex  multicellular organisms to arise  the development of the nucleus in single celled organisms   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Eukaryotes, one of the three main branches of living organisms, are defined by the presence of this nucleus and its surrounding membrane, which houses and protects our genetic material. All of the multitude of molecules that need to pass into or out of the nucleus do so via a channel-like structure embedded in this membrane the nuclear pore complex. Michael Rout, head of the Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology, and Brian Chait, head of the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, together with their colleagues, have been working to understand the nuclear pore complex for nearly two decades. They first isolated and described the components of the yeast nuclear pore complex in 2000 and then released a first draft of its structure in 2007. In yeast, as well as in humans, the nuclear pore complex is composed of an inner ring sandwiched between two outer rings: one facing in and one facing out. Attached to these outer rings are classes of proteins that are compatible with the unique chemistry of either the nucleus or cytoplasm found in the rest of the cell. This asymmetric distribution of nuclear pore components is important for helping to establish the directionality of transport through the pore. The complex is so fundamental that its architecture was thought to be shared by all eukaryotes. However, Samson Obado, a research associate in the Rout lab, has found a eukaryotic species that has pores with a structure unlike any that has yet been studied, a finding which implies that the pore s evolution is probably more involved than had previously been assumed.   We were driven by curiosity about the evolution of the nuclear pore complex,  says Obado. Almost everything we know about the complex is from yeast and humans, which although quite far apart in evolutionary terms are nevertheless closely related when compared to plants and many other single-celled eukaryotes.  But what did the original pores look like, and how have they developed in different eukaryotes?  Obado wondered. He was the perfect candidate to investigate this, as his graduate studies focused on trypanosomes; these parasites, responsible for serious diseases such as sleeping sickness and Chagas disease, diverged from the families that developed into yeast, humans, plants, and other eukaryotes roughly one and a half billion years ago close to the time of the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes.  Unusual and quirky   Compared with many other eukaryotes, trypanosomes have an unusual and quirky molecular biology. A key example is how they transcribe their genes into messenger RNAs for translation into proteins, which is very different from textbook models. Furthermore, because they are so divergent, you can t just search for gene sequences similar to those in yeast or humans,  Obado says. Rout, Chait, and colleagues worked together with Mark Field of Dundee University in Scotland to identify putative nuclear pore components from trypanosomes. To do so, the team walked protein by protein through the nuclear pore complex, purifying each one along with other proximal proteins. These other proteins, they figured, could be part of the nuclear pore complex as well. Obado then purified the new proteins to determine whether they were also part of the complex, along with their proximal proteins, and so on until he had a complete survey of all the proteins involved. Finally, they worked with the university s Electron Microscopy Resource Center to determine where key components are located with respect to each other. The result was a complete first picture of the entire trypanosome pore structure. The teams  results show that the architecture of the inner ring of the nuclear pore complex is fundamentally similar in trypanosomes, yeast, plants, and vertebrates, suggesting an ancient origin for this common feature. In contrast, the trypanosome nuclear pore complex possesses a unique mechanism tethering it to the surrounding nuclear envelope, and the outer ring is less well  conserved  by evolution, with additional never-before-seen components. However, the most notable difference between trypanosome nuclear pore complexes and others that have been examined to date, is that the trypanosome s nuclear pore complex exhibits a near-complete symmetry of its components, and lacks almost all the proteins in yeast and humans that are required to establish an asymmetric assembly within the pore. Instead, it seems that soluble proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm are responsible for setting transport s directionality in these parasites for both proteins and RNA. The fact that the trypanosome pore has such dissimilarities with the pore of humans may provide an opportunity, says Obado.  These differences may offer something we can target therapeutically without risking harm to our own transport mechanisms.  Evolutionary Implications These discoveries also lend further credence to an idea in evolutionary theory first suggested by Rout and his colleagues. The theory, known as the  protocoatomer hypothesis,  suggests that the nuclear pore and nuclear envelope share a common ancestor with structures that form coats on other membrane-bound structures in the cell, like those in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, the trypanosome nuclear pore components, despite their dissimilarities from other eukaryotes, still retain the kinds of structures and organization found in these other coats, the scientists say. Moreover, since the inner core of the trypanosome nuclear pore complex is structurally well preserved and similar to those from other eukaryotes, Rout and his team believe this core represents the original units of a simpler nuclear pore complex that predates the last ancestor of all eukaryotes, and thus may provide new clues as to how the nucleus originally evolved.","Published: March 21, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/bringing-the-lab-to-the-crime-scene-189279,Bringing the Lab to the Crime Scene Developing a miniature mass spectrometer to allow instant analysis of evidence   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. When Illinois State Chemistry Professor Christopher Mulligan hears someone say it ll be a week or two before test results come back from some faraway laboratory, unlike most people, he goes beyond just asking the hard question,  Why?  Finding the answer to the  why  of something, particularly as it pertains to technology used in crime scene investigations, has led him to hunker down in the Science Laboratory Building to find some answers.  Why can t you effectively take the crime lab with you to the crime scene?  Mulligan asked.  Can we develop a tool for testing evidence at the scene?  Mulligan has been happily wrestling with a project for the last several years that could answer those questions and make a major impact on the way crime scenes are investigated. In his lab, Mulligan has managed to miniaturize an existing instrument known as the mass spectrometer. This device could be used by law enforcement investigators to detect evidence, for example, by swabbing a table top or a suspect s hand looking for traces of cocaine or an explosive too small to be seen by the unaided eye.  Traditionally, mass spectrometers were the size of rooms,  Mulligan said.  Miniaturization of these instruments has had a similar lineage to computers once bulky and large, but now miniaturized with much more performance and capabilities.  Mulligan s mass spectrometer is about the size of a small copier and weighs less than 100 pounds. He thinks the device could easily become part of the standard equipment carried aboard a crime scene van. This technology could speed up the process of gathering credible evidence and be used by officers in the field.  Normally mass spectrometers are used by scientists who are extensively trained in analytical chemistry,  he said.  Part of our work is to take a complicated technology and make it simple enough to be used by nontechnical operators.  Mulligan is working with two other Illinois State professors Michael Gizzi, of the Department of Criminal Justice Sciences, and Jamie Wieland, of the Department of Technology to develop the device and bring it to market.  Simplistically, I am determining what the instrument can do,  Mulligan said.  Dr. Gizzi is determining whether what we can do is legal, and Dr. Wieland is determining whether it is affordable and financially reasonable.  The National Institute of Justice the research, development, and evaluation agency of the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded two grants and nearly $700,000 in funding for Mulligan s project. The second grant, awarded last year, supports the work of all three professors. Gizzi s role is to ensure that Mulligan s technology is used to gather evidence in such a way that passes constitutional muster, specifically in regard to the Fourth Amendment s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The legal implications of the device apply only to criminal investigations before an arrest or before there is probable cause to make an arrest, Gizzi said.  Once someone is arrested, the technology is merely a forensic tool to collect evidence from a crime scene,  he said.  The Fourth Amendment ceases to be an issue, and instead it is just questions about the admissibility of scientific evidence in court.  Mulligan s mass spectrometer could save overstretched forensic labs time and money, Wieland said.  Forensic labs are notoriously understaffed,  she said.  From an operations standpoint, if you streamline the front end of the forensic process enough, you wouldn t have to send everything back to the lab for testing. This is important, as ultimately, it s taxpayers  dollars that pay for forensic investigations.  Wieland is there to determine by utilizing her expertise in engineering, operations management, applied statistics, and simulation whether this technology, which could cost about $100,000 per unit, is cost-effective overall. Wieland compared trying to make this new technology attractive to a wider market to what s been done previously with technologies like full body scanners for airline passenger screening and traffic enforcement cameras. The device s selling points are that it is portable, simple, fast, and accurate. Mulligan designed his version of the mass spectrometer to be  ruggedized  in terms of operation, or ready for use in a harsh environment. Mulligan described how it works. First, the area where evidence might be present is swabbed. The swab is just a slip of paper, about the size of something you d pull out of a fortune cookie, except one end comes to a point. That pointed tip is where the sample of chemical or residue is applied and then read by the mass spectrometer. The mass part of the technology refers to weighing for the purpose of identifying a given sample. The spectrometer, the actual instrument, is a box-shaped apparatus where the analysis and identification of the samples occur. The swab is attached to the mass spectrometer via a metal clasp, which holds the pointed tip in place as solvent is applied to the swab to act as a conductor of electricity. When high voltage hits the swab, the solvent and voltage cause the chemical residue to be charged and migrate off of the swab where it can be sampled and identified by the mass spectrometer. Mulligan has used his portable technology to test actual evidence provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration, once agents were finished with their own analysis. This type of work bolsters his ongoing goal of doing  authentic experiments.  Mulligan said getting an accurate reading one time was not particularly significant, but repeating that reading accurately many times over was the goal:  If it reads cocaine on a swab one time, will it read cocaine on a swab 2,000 times? Reliability is key when it comes to forensic technologies.  Mulligan described this phase of the project as exciting but also crucial in determining if the technology is suitable to move forward into serious consideration for adoption. Gizzi is investigating the legal implications of the technology.  While the technology itself enables police to potentially gather significant evidence, there are legal issues that need to be considered,  Gizzi said.  For example, if someone s property is swabbed without a warrant or probable cause, that would be a search.  Gizzi said there are potential legal hurdles related to the admissibility of evidence gathered by the device before an arrest is made. Courts have ruled that specialized technology that is not in general public use, like this device, enhances law enforcement s senses and could be considered a search. Similarly, Gizzi said, another case held that the use of a GPS surveillance device was considered to be an intrusion constitutionally. The flip side is that the courts could take the view that mass spectrometers are no different than highly trained police dogs that find illegal drugs.  The narcotics dog is specially trained to only detect contraband,  Gizzi said.  And the court has ruled that no one has an expectation of privacy in possessing contraband. And this technology can be adapted to only detect contraband at a much higher rate of accuracy than a dog.  Gizzi credited Mulligan for inviting colleagues from across campus to be part of such a high-profile, cutting-edge project. Mulligan is aware of how essential that collaboration is to the success of his work.  I am particularly proud that this project has been moved forward by the hard work of undergraduate and master s level graduate students here at ISU Chemistry,  Mulligan said.  The rigor and scope of a project like this are typically relegated to large doctoral programs, which is a testament to the quality of our students and the richness of our research experiences.

Insulin injections provide painful and often imperfect substitutes. Transplants of normal beta cells carry the risk of rejection or side effects from immunosuppressive therapies. Now, researchers at the at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University have devised another option: a synthetic patch filled with natural beta cells that can secrete doses of insulin to control blood sugar levels on demand with no risk of inducing hypoglycemia. The proof-of-concept builds on an innovative technology, the  smart insulin patch,  reported last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Both patches are thin polymeric squares about the size of a quarter and covered in tiny needles, like a miniature bed of nails. But whereas the former approach filled these needles with manmade bubbles of insulin, this new  smart cell patch  integrates the needles with live beta cells. Tests of this painless patch in small animal models of type-1 diabetes demonstrated that it could quickly respond to skyrocketing blood sugar levels and significantly lower them for 10 hours at a time. The results were published in Advanced Materials.  This study provides a potential solution for the tough problem of rejection, which has long plagued studies on pancreatic cell transplants for diabetes,  said senior author Zhen Gu, PhD, assistant professor in the joint UNC/NC State department of biomedical engineering.  Plus it demonstrates that we can build a bridge between the physiological signals within the body and these therapeutic cells outside the body to keep glucose levels under control.  Beta cells typically reside in the pancreas, where they act as the body s natural insulin-producing factories. In healthy people, they produce, store, and release the hormone insulin to help process sugar that builds up in the bloodstream after a meal. But in people with diabetes, these cells are either damaged or unable to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels under control. Diabetes affects more than 387 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to grow to 500 million by the year 2030. Patients with type-1 and advanced type-2 diabetes must regularly monitor their blood sugar levels and inject themselves with varying amounts of insulin, a process that is painful and imprecise. Injecting the wrong amount of medication can lead to significant complications like blindness and limb amputations, or even more disastrous consequences such as diabetic comas and death. Since the 1970s, researchers have researched transplantation of insulin-producing cells as an alternative treatment for diabetes. The first successful transplant of human beta cells was performed in 1990, and since then hundreds of diabetic patients have undergone the procedure. Yet, only a fraction of treated patients achieved normal blood sugar levels. Most transplants are rejected, and many of the medications used to suppress the immune system wind up interfering with the activity of beta cells and insulin. More recently, researchers have been experimenting with ways to encapsulate beta cells into biocompatible polymeric cells that could be implanted in the body. Gu, who also holds appointments in the UNC School of Medicine, the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and the UNC Diabetes Care Center, decided to create a device that would put the blood-sugar buffering properties of beta cells out of reach of the patient s immune system. Lead author Yanqi Ye, a graduate student in Gu s lab, constructed the  smart cell patches  using natural materials commonly found in cosmetics and diagnostics. She stuffed the hundreds of microneedles, each about the size of an eyelash, with culture media and thousands of beta cells that were encapsulated into microcapsules made from biocompatible alginate. When applied to the skin, the patch s microneedles poked into the capillaries and blood vessels, forming a connection between the internal environment and the external cells of the patch. Ye also created  glucose-signal amplifiers,  which are synthetic nanovesicles filled with three chemicals to make sure the beta cells could  hear  the call from rising blood sugar levels and respond accordingly. Gu s group showed that blood sugar levels in diabetic mice quickly declined to normal levels. To assess whether the patch could regulate blood sugar without lowering it too much, the researchers administered a second patch to the mice. As they had hoped, repeated administration of the patch did not result in excess doses of insulin, and thus did not risk hypoglycemia. Instead, the second patch extended the life of the treatment to 20 hours. Further modifications, pre-clinical tests, and eventually clinical trials in humans will all be necessary before the patch can become a viable option for patients. But for now, the researchers believe their results provide a proof of principle for an alternative approach that could be safer and less cumbersome than current treatments.  Managing diabetes is tough for patients because they have to think about it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the rest of their lives,  said co-author John Buse, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine and director of the UNC Diabetes Care Center and the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute.  These smart insulin approaches are exciting because they hold the promise of giving patients some time off with regards to their diabetes self-care. It would not be a cure but a desperately needed vacation.  The research was funded by grants from NC TraCS, home of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award at UNC, the American Diabetes Association, and the National Science Foundation through the ASSIST Engineering Center at NC State. Study co-authors from UNC were Jicheng Yu, Chao Wang, Nhu-Y Nguyen, and Glenn M. Walker.","Published: March 19, 2016"

The study, published in Cancer Cell, is expected to lead to a clinical trial to confirm the benefits of the novel drug combination.  Our goal was to identify drugs with minimal toxicity that we can move quickly from the laboratory to the clinic, where new therapeutic options are desperately needed,  said Robert Wechsler-Reya, Ph.D., director of the Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program at SBP and senior author of the study.  Using high-throughput drug screening, we identified a compound that cooperates with a second drug to inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.  Medulloblastoma, a fast-growing cancer that arises in the cerebellum, is diagnosed in about 400 children annually in the U.S., making it the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Success rates for treating this cancer are improving, but lag behind those for other pediatric cancers. Of the four distinct forms of medulloblastoma, patients with Group 3 tumors have the worst prognosis   only 40 percent of these patients become long-term survivors, compared to 80 percent of other medulloblastoma patients. Most Group 3 medulloblastoma cancers have high levels of the MYC oncogene, which causes cells to divide uncontrollably and form tumors. Using mice with Group 3 medulloblastoma tumors, the research team demonstrated that the combination of two drugs, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3KIs), potently kill mouse and human medulloblastoma cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells.  Our initial screen identified several HDACIs that killed MYC-activated medulloblastoma cells without harming normal cells.  said Yanxin Pei, Ph.D., assistant professor at Children s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. and co-first author of the study.  The most potent of these compounds, panobinostat, is in clinical trials for other cancers but has not been tested for medulloblastoma,  he said.  Additional studies revealed that panobinostat works by promoting the activity of FOXO1, a gene that interferes with the MYC oncogene,  said Kun-Wei (Ken) Liu, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Wechsler-Reya s lab and co-lead author.  We figured that panobinostat and a PI3KI   also known to activate FOXO1   might synergize to block cancer cell survival. Indeed, the combination therapy significantly improved survival of mice with human MYC tumors compared to each drug on its own.   This study highlights the value of high-throughput drug screening to identify therapies that are effective for specific types of disease,  said Wechsler-Reya.  It also demonstrates how combinations of drugs can be much more effective than single agents.  In general, clinical trials for medulloblastoma are challenging because of the limited number of patients. Moreover, given the variability of the disease, most therapies will only work on a subset of patients. Figuring out which patients will respond to which therapies is a major goal of research in the field. If we can tailor therapies based on the genetic makeup of the tumor   a strategy commonly referred to as personalized medicine   this could have an enormous impact on patients with this disease,  according to Wechsler-Reya.","Published: March 19, 2016"

Precision medicine is an emerging field that aims to deliver highly personalized health care by understanding how individual differences in genetics, environment, and lifestyle impact health and disease. SLE, commonly called lupus, is a serious, potentially fatal autoimmune disease that the National Institutes of Health reports affects nine times more women than men, and is more likely to strike young African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. The disease often begins between the ages of 15 and 44.  SLE starts when the immune system attacks multiple organ systems in the body, which can result in a complex array of symptoms that are difficult to manage clinically and can lead to organ damage,  said Dr. Edward Wakeland, Chair of Immunology at UT Southwestern and co-senior author of the study posted online recently in the journal eLife.  Our findings support the potential of precision medicine to provide clinically relevant information about genetic susceptibility that may ultimately improve diagnosis and treatment.  The study also may have implications for other systemic autoimmune diseases, a category of diseases that affect multiple body systems and includes Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, he said. Dr. Wakeland and colleagues sequenced millions of DNA base pairs from more than 1,700 people, which allowed precise identification of the genetic variations contributing to SLE, he said. Specifically, the researchers identified 1,206 DNA variations located in 16 different regions of the human genome associated with increased susceptibility to SLE. They then showed that almost all of them (1,199) modify the level of expression of specific molecules that regulate immune responses, he said. In addition, the two-year study identified many of the specific regulatory variations that were changed in SLE patients and demonstrated that accurately identifying such so-called causal variants increased the accuracy of the genetic association of individual SLE risk genes with susceptibility to SLE.  Prior to our study, such a comprehensive sequence analysis had not been done and little was known about the exact genetic variations that modify the functions of the genes that cause SLE,  added Dr. Wakeland, who holds the Edwin L. Cox Distinguished Chair in Immunology and Genetics. The scientists began their comprehensive sequence analysis using the DNA samples of 1,349 American Europeans (773 with SLE disease and 576 without) from sample collections at UT Southwestern, the University of Southern California, UCLA, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, and the Universit  Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. They then determined the precise DNA sequences at SLE-associated genetic regions scattered throughout the genome. They found that SLE risk is associated with specific clusters of DNA variations, commonly called haplotypes, and that some haplotypes increased the risk for SLE while others provided protection from SLE. After identifying the sets of DNA variants that increased SLE susceptibility in Caucasians, they used multiple public databases, including the international 1000 Genomes Project (2,504 genomic samples from the global human population) to determine whether these haplotypes also were found in South American, South Asian, African, and East Asian populations. They discovered that the variants and haplotypes were distributed across subpopulations worldwide. Their findings indicate that many common haplotypes in the immune system are shared at different frequencies throughout the global population, suggesting that these variations in the immune system have ancient origins and persist in populations for long periods, Dr. Wakeland said.  We thank the many SLE patients and control participants whose sample contributions were essential for these studies,  the researchers wrote. Dr. Wakeland and colleagues plan to continue the research by obtaining more DNA samples and expanding their analysis to additional SLE risk genes with the goal of obtaining a data set that can be used to predict an individual s unique risk of SLE, as well as the likelihood of benefiting from specific treatments.  It is feasible that this same type of genetic analysis will allow the clustering of SLE patients into specific groups, based on their genetic predispositions, which would improve clinical management and potentially allow the development of more targeted therapies,  Dr. Wakeland said. Earlier this month, UT Southwestern announced that Dr. Wakeland, whose laboratory has long served as the institution s Genomics and Microarray Core Facility, will be leading a large DNA-sequencing initiative to address important clinical challenges. The new clinical sequencing facility, in collaboration with the Department of Pathology, will provide panel sequencing for cancer and other diagnoses, and eventually expand to whole-exome and whole-genome sequence analysis for a variety of patients. The laboratory will be established in the BioCenter on the East Campus. To commit full effort to this initiative, Dr. Wakeland will step down as Chair of Immunology, but will remain in this role until his successor is named.  This clinical sequencing core facility will generate laboratory data to be used for the evaluation of patient tumors. I hope we will someday expand to genotyping patients to identify potential susceptibility to autoimmune disease and many other conditions as the field of precision medicine develops,  Dr. Wakeland said. Co-lead authors of the eLife study from UT Southwestern were Dr. Prithvi Raj, Instructor of Immunology, and Dr. Ekta Rai, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Wakeland lab.

The initial focus will be on developing assessment and monitoring wearables for mental ill health. Mental ill health is the world s largest cause of disability and economic loss. In the UK alone, one in four adults experience at least one diagnosable mental health problem each year1. With an estimated half a billion people affected worldwide, the cost to global economies is on course to exceed $6 trillion per annum by 20302. Common mental health disorders such as dementia, depression and anxiety are characterised by symptoms that can fluctuate regularly. Until now this has created difficulties for researchers and healthcare professionals as infrequent assessments in medical settings are unable to reflect a patient s health between visits or in everyday life. By engaging with individuals through wearable and smart devices, the new technology will provide a richer and more natural profile of mental health to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders; helping people to lead fuller, more active lives and dramatically reduce global healthcare costs. Under the terms of the new partnership, digital health products are being designed and developed enabling near-user cognitive testing on wearable and smart devices. In broader healthcare populations, more meaningful cognitive data will enable practitioners to detect mental health risk factors early, reduce the likelihood of relapse and, by tracking daily activity, help individuals to better understand and manage their own cognitive health and wellbeing much like products such as Fitbit  have for physical health. For pharmaceutical companies, understanding the real world impact of interventions will support their clinical trials of drug development candidates and marketed treatments for chronic diseases. The new range of products will be licensed initially to pharmaceutical partners and healthcare providers through relationships established by both Cambridge Cognition and Ctrl Group in contracts won to enrich drug development and patient wellbeing. Chief Executive Officer of Cambridge Cognition, Dr Steven Powell commented:  We are excited to be advancing our healthcare technologies into product with partners with synergistic technical skills to meet the growing needs of our pharmaceutical customers and address large non-clinical markets. The move to near-user cognitive measures on consumer electronics marks a significant step for Cambridge Cognition in realising the Company s aim to become the world leader in cognitive healthcare technologies.  Co-founder of Ctrl Group, Ben Fehnert added:  We see a huge advantage in being able to understand cognition in daily life through wearable and smart technologies and Ctrl Group are delighted to be working with Cambridge Cognition to make this happen.

Jade s proprietary, cross-linked, bio-erodible hydrogel technology has demonstrated a variety of unique and beneficial characteristics, whether employed alone or as a sustained-release drug-delivery vehicle. In conjunction with the acquisition, EyeGate will gain a strong research and development team and the co-founders of Jade have been appointed to senior management or consulting roles within EyeGate. Barbara Wirostko, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of Jade has joined EyeGate as Chief Medical Officer and MaryJane Rafii, Ph.D., Co-founder and Chief Business Officer of Jade has joined in a consulting role to assist with ongoing business development activities.  The integration of Jade into EyeGate significantly strengthens our market position through the addition of a robust preclinical pipeline that complements EyeGate s ongoing efforts to develop novel treatments for diseases of the eye. The acquisition also meets our objective of expanding our development focus and building a diversified portfolio of ocular therapeutic assets led by EGP-437 and our iontophoretic delivery technology,  commented Stephen From, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eyegate Pharmaceuticals.  Our expanded pipeline now includes both preclinical and clinical assets that collectively address a large market opportunity. We are very excited about this opportunity and are confident that by combining the capabilities of both the companies, we can create value for our shareholders while developing products to potentially help patients suffering from eye disorders.  Jade s proprietary, cross-linked thiolated carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid (CMHA-S) is a modified form of the natural polymer hyaluronic acid (HA) which possesses unique physical and chemical properties such as viscoelasticity and water retention. The ability of CMHA-S to adhere longer to the ocular surface, resist degradation and protect the ocular surface makes it well suited for treating various ocular surface injuries. This novel cross-linked HA product has demonstrated global safety and efficacy in small animals in a real world setting, as it is already marketed as a highly efficacious veterinary product by BayerDVM under the Remend  brand to treat corneal wounds. EyeGate intends to initiate a clinical study for Jade s lead product candidate for corneal epithelial defects in late 2016. With the transaction, Jade has become a wholly owned subsidiary of EyeGate. EyeGate s acquisition of Jade has led to the creation of a premier ophthalmology company at the forefront of developing innovative therapies for patients with ocular diseases. Dr. Wirostko added,  I am thrilled to join EyeGate following this transaction. With a strong executive team and a deep ophthalmic pipeline, it became clear early in the process that EyeGate was the optimal company to continue the development of Jade s proprietary CMHA-S technology. We believe that CMHA-S has tremendous potential across multiple ophthalmic indications, and I look forward to working with the EyeGate team to advance the technology to clinical trials and, hopefully, to market.  Dr. Barbara Wirostko, Co-founder of Jade and newly-appointed EyeGate Chief Medical Officer, is a board certified ophthalmologist and holds appointments as a Clinical Adjunct Associate Professor in Ophthalmology, Moran Eye Center, and an Adjunct Associate Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Utah. She is a former Senior Medical Director and Development Lead at Pfizer, where she led a successful EU regulatory EMA filing for Xalatan in pediatric glaucoma and oversaw the development of Pfizer s glaucoma pipeline strategy as well as the Medical programs for the global product Xalabrands. At Pfizer, she had direct involvement with early drug development programs, clinical trials, and post marketing medical responsibilities in the areas of diabetes, AMD, dry eye, and glaucoma. Prior to joining Pfizer, Dr. Wirostko was Chief Ophthalmologist practicing as a clinician and specializing in glaucoma at the Huntington Medical Group PC, in Huntington, New York. During her 10 years in practice, she served as Principle Investigator for various pivotal glaucoma clinical trials for major pharmaceutical companies specialized in eye care. Under the terms of the agreement, in consideration for the outstanding equity interests in Jade, EyeGate will repay Jade liabilities of up to $300,000 and will issue 765,728 shares of EyeGate common stock, 90% of which were issued at the closing and 10% of which will be held back for 18 months to satisfy post-closing adjustments or indemnification obligations. The transaction also includes a cash earn-out provision calling for the additional payment of up to $2,164,451 contingent upon a Jade product receiving FDA marketing approval.","Published: March 19, 2016"

But new research suggests that while learning, the brain is actively trying to forget. The study, by scientists at EMBL and University Pablo Olavide in Sevilla, Spain, is published in Nature Communications.  This is the first time that a pathway in the brain has been linked to forgetting, to actively erasing memories,  says Cornelius Gross, who led the work at EMBL. At the simplest level, learning involves making associations, and remembering them. Working with mice, Gross and colleagues studied the hippocampus, a region of the brain that s long been known to help form memories. Information enters this part of the brain through three different routes. As memories are cemented, connections between neurons along the  main  route become stronger. When they blocked this main route, the scientists found that the mice were no longer capable of learning a Pavlovian response   associating a sound to a consequence, and anticipating that consequence. But if the mice had learned that association before the scientists stopped information flow in that main route, they could still retrieve that memory. This confirmed that this route is involved in forming memories, but isn t essential for recalling those memories. The latter probably involves the second route into the hippocampus, the scientists surmise. But blocking that main route had an unexpected consequence: the connections along it were weakened, meaning the memory was being erased.  Simply blocking this pathway shouldn t have an effect on its strength,  says Agn s Gruart from University Pablo Olavide.  When we investigated further, we discovered that activity in one of the other pathways was driving this weakening.  Interestingly, this active push for forgetting only happens in learning situations. When the scientists blocked the main route into the hippocampus under other circumstances, the strength of its connections remained unaltered.  One explanation for this is that there is limited space in the brain, so when you re learning, you have to weaken some connections to make room for others,  says Gross.  To learn new things, you have to forget things you ve learned before.  The findings were made using genetically engineered mice, but with help from Maja K hn s lab at EMBL the scientists demonstrated that it is possible to produce a drug that activates this  forgetting  route in the brain without the need for genetic engineering. This approach, they say, might be interesting to explore if one were looking for ways to help people forget traumatic experiences.","Published: March 19, 2016"

The cells under study came from the hippocampus, a memory-related structure that is the only place in a mammal's brain where new neurons can form throughout life. Since newly formed neurons were discovered in the hippocampus more than 20 years ago, scientists have identified the many roles they play in learning and memory. However, mystery continues to surround the genetic controls that regulate the formation of the delicate structures and the chemicals necessary for neural communication, Zhao says. See Also: Benefits of taking the natural pigment astaxanthin In the 1990s, Zhao worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Fred Gage at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California, site of groundbreaking discoveries on the formation of new neurons in the hippocampus. Until the discovery of this ""adult neurogenesis,"" scientists thought that the brain essentially had to make do with the supply of neurons it acquired at birth. The limited supply of new neurons that grows in the hippocampus throughout the lifespan has a role in memory, and perhaps in recovery from degenerative disease. The V-shaped blue structure is part of the adult hippocampus, where new neurons are produced throughout life in most mammals, including humans. Red: new, immature neurons. Green: mature neurons. Credit: Yu Gao, Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison  Zhao, now a professor of neuroscience at UW-Madison, has been probing the adult neurogenesis puzzle for most of her scientific career. ""While trying to understand the mechanism that regulates adult neurogenesis, I am also using adult neurogenesis as a model to study brain development and developmental diseases,"" she says. ""In lab animals, adult neurogenesis provides a source of cells that can show us how a neural stem cell develops into a fully-formed neuron."" As might be expected for an organ as fantastically complex as the brain, ""neurons come in many varieties,"" Zhao says, ""and their genetic activity changes as they mature. To really understand this process, we need to know which genes are active, and when."" Under study, a group of neurons might average out, which would mask key distinctions at different stages. ""When you look at individual cells you can see a lot more information than you can in groups,"" Zhao says. Imagine describing the monarch butterfly. Observing the larval stage, you would conclude it's a caterpillar. Watching the insect stage, you would call it a butterfly. But what would you conclude from looking at a mix of caterpillars and butterflies? The situation in developing neurons is even more confusing, Zhao says. ""There are so many different types of neurons, and the stage of development is also critical for understanding the development process."" The technology to leap this hurdle, which can isolate individual neurons so their genes can be extracted, was first used on neurons in 2014. Taking young neurons from the hippocampus of adult mice, postdoctoral fellows Yu Gao and Feifei Wang (now a member of the faculty at Fudan University in Shanghai) isolated 84 single neurons that had differentiated from neural stem cells at least three days before meaning they had started, but not completed, the transformation to a mature neuron. Once the data on gene activation was assembled, Brian Eisinger, another postdoctoral fellow with expertise in bioinformatics, performed intensive analysis on the rising and falling activity of thousands of genes. The gene activation profiles of individual cells revealed that the developing neurons go through four stages. But the results also revealed hints about the origin of common neurological conditions. Learn More: Specific gene linked to adult growth of brain cells, learning and memory First, the most active genes during the stem cell phase overlapped significantly with genes implicated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. ""It surprised us to see that genes associated with the stem cell life stage are highly represented in these neurodegenerative diseases,"" says Zhao. ""We do not know the significance, but it's possible that these conditions are more related to stem cell impairment than we thought."" Second, the gene exhibiting increased activity during neuron maturation overlapped with genes associated with autism. That picture is complex, Zhao acknowledges, as thousands of genes are affected in some way in autism. ""This was an exploratory analysis that may open a new window on understanding complex disorders like autism,"" Zhao says. ""Imagine if you unexpectedly saw a mountain lion's paw print in the forest. Now you would wonder if the lion explained a sudden shortfall of deer in the forest, but you would not know until you looked further."" Junior biochemistry student Laurel Kelnhofer and graduate student Emily Jobe also contributed to the study, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex. Although papers using single-cell analysis of mammalian neurons have begun to appear in the last year, they focused on large populations of neurons, Zhao says. ""Ours is the first single-cell analysis in adult-born new neurons. Our challenge was that these are scarce, so we had to work hard to optimize our cell isolation procedure."" The study could only be performed at a world-class research institution like UW-Madison, Zhao added. ""The Comprehensive Cancer Center provided the cell sorter we needed to get started. The Waisman Center, where I study mechanisms of brain development, had state-of-the-art confocal microscopes and an early model of the single-cell analyzer. The Biotechnology Center has the latest instruments for RNA quantification and ultra-fast RNA sequencing.

The technology   a major innovation   involves converting adult tissue-derived stem cells into human neurons on 3-D  scaffolds,  or tiny islands, of fibers, said Prabhas V. Moghe, a distinguished professor in the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at Rutgers University. See Also: Growing functioning brain tissue in 3D The scaffolds, loaded with healthy, beneficial neurons that can replace diseased cells, were injected into mouse brains.  If you can transplant cells in a way that mimics how these cells are already configured in the brain, then you re one step closer to getting the brain to communicate with the cells that you're now transplanting,  said Moghe, research director for the School of Engineering/Health Sciences Partnerships at Rutgers.  In this work, we ve done that by providing cues for neurons to rapidly network in 3-D. In their multidisciplinary study, published in Nature Communications, a dozen scientists from several Rutgers teams and Stanford discuss the 3-D scaffolds and their potentially widespread benefits. Moghe said a 3-D scaffold, developed by the scientists, consists of tiny polymer fibers. Hundreds of neurons attach to the fibers and branch out, sending their signals. Scaffolds are about 100 micrometers wide   roughly the width of a human hair.  We take a whole bunch of these islands and then we inject them into the brain of the mouse,  he said.  These neurons that are transplanted into the brain actually survived quite miraculously well. In fact, they survived so much better than the gold standard in the field.  Indeed, the scaffold technology results in a 100-fold increase in cell survival over other methods, Moghe said. And that may eventually help people suffering from Parkinson s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer s disease, spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries, and concussions, he said, as these diseases and conditions often arise from the loss of brain cells. Learn More: An accessible approach to making a mini-brain The next step would be to further improve the scaffold biomaterials, allowing scientists to increase the number of implanted neurons in the brain.  The more neurons we can transplant, the more therapeutic benefits you can bring to the disease,  Moghe said.  We want to try to stuff as many neurons as we can in as little space as we can.  The idea is to  create a very dense circuitry of neurons that is not only highly functioning but also better controlled,  he said, adding that testing of mice with Parkinson s disease is underway to see if they improve or recover from the illness. Eventually, with continued progress, the researchers could perform studies in people. Moghe estimated that it would take 10 to 20 years to test the technology in humans. Developing the scaffold technology and reprogramming the stem cells in the scaffolds was  very hard team work,  he said.  It took many years to get here, so there was a lot of sweat and toil.

This has motivated scientists to sequence the human genome and develop ways to alter the genetic code, but many diseases are linked to a different fundamental molecule: RNA. As the intermediary genetic material that carries the genetic code from the cell s nucleus, scientists have long sought an efficient method for targeting RNA in living cells. Researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have now achieved this by applying the popular DNA-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9 to RNA.  This work is the first example, to our knowledge, of targeting RNA in living cells with CRISPR-Cas9,  said senior author Gene Yeo, PhD, associate professor of cellular and molecular medicine.  Our current work focuses on tracking the movement of RNA inside the cell, but future developments could enable researchers to measure other RNA features or advance therapeutic approaches to correct disease-causing RNA behaviors.  RNA s location in a cell   and how and when it gets there   can influence whether proteins are produced in the right location and at the appropriate time. For instance, proteins important to neuronal connections in the brain, known as synapses, are produced from RNAs located at these contacts. Defective RNA transport is linked to a host of conditions ranging from autism to cancer and researchers need ways to measure RNA movement in order to develop treatments for these conditions. Efforts to edit and measure DNA   as a means to alter protein production, study the underlying biology and correct defects to treat disease   got a big boost a few years ago. That s when researchers discovered they could take CRISPR-Cas9, a naturally occurring defense mechanism bacteria use to fend off invading bacteria, and apply it to edit genes in mammalian systems. Normally, CRISPR-Cas9 works like this: researchers design a  guide  RNA to match the sequence of a specific target gene. The RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to the desired spot in the genome, where it cuts the DNA. The cell repairs the DNA break imprecisely, thus inactivating the gene, or researchers replace the section adjacent to the cut with a corrected version of the gene. Until now, CRISPR-Cas9 could only be used to manipulate DNA. Yeo and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, have applied the technique to develop a flexible means of targeting RNA in live cells, also called RNA-targeted Cas9 (RCas9). In order to target RNA instead of DNA, the researchers altered several features of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Building upon previous work by co-author Jennifer Doudna, PhD, at UC Berkeley, they designed a short nucleic acid called the PAMmer that, along with the guide RNA, directs Cas9 to an RNA molecule. To test the system, Yeo s team targeted the RNA that encodes the proteins ACTB, TFRC and CCNA2. Then they watched as Cas9, fused with a fluorescent protein, revealed the movement of RNA into stress granules, a cluster of proteins and RNAs that form in a cell s cytosol (the area outside the nucleus) when the cell is under stress. Stress granules are linked to neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This system allowed the team to track RNA over time, in live cells, without the need for artificial tags commonly used in other RNA-tracking techniques   an approach that can interfere with normal cellular processes.  CRISPR-Cas9 is supporting a revolution in genomics and medicine based on its ability to target and modify human DNA,  said David Nelles, a UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering graduate student in Yeo s lab and first author of the study.  DNA is the fundamental building block of life and we are just beginning to see the implications of genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9, but many diseases including cancer and autism are linked to problems with another fundamental biological molecule   RNA.

By analyzing the responses of single molecules under conditions where they experience such forces we can develop a better understanding of many biological processes, and potentially, develop more accurately acting drugs. But up until now experimental analysis of single molecule interactions under force have been expensive, tedious and difficult to perform because it requires use of sophisticated equipment, such as an atomic force microscope or optical tweezers, which only permit analysis of one molecule at a time. Now, a research team led by Wesley Wong at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and Boston Children's Hospital has made a major advance by developing an inexpensive method that permits analysis of the force responses of thousands of similar molecules simultaneously. They report in Nature Communications how programmable DNA nanoswitches can be used in combination with a newly designed miniaturized Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM) as a highly reliable tool to observe thousands of individual molecules and their responses to mechanical forces in parallel.The benchtop CFM device, consisting of the CFM unit itself (on the top), parts for transmitting the camera signal as well as a battery (on the right), fits into two standard buckets of a common laboratory centrifuge that are balanced by counterweights in the respective opposite buckets. Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard University ""This new combined approach will allow us and others to examine how single molecule complexes behave when they are thrown out of their equilibrium by the tunable force generated in our newly designed CFM. By basing this instrument on something that most researchers already have and use-the benchtop centrifuge-we hope to make single-molecule force measurements accessible to almost everyone,"" said Wong, Ph.D., who is a Wyss Institute Associate Faculty member and the study's senior author. He is also Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School in the Departments of Biological Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology and Pediatrics, and Investigator in the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital. Earlier efforts led by Wong at the Rowland Institute at Harvard introduced the first CFM in 2010, which was a highly specialized instrument that carried out high-throughput precision force measurements on single molecules by tethering them to beads and pulling at them using centrifugal force. In his latest CFM iteration, Wong and his team developed a way to carry out the same technique with similar precision using a small inexpensive microscope made from easy-to-assemble elements and 3D printed parts that can be inserted into the swinging bucket of a standard benchtop centrifuge found in virtually all biomedical research laboratories. In addition, the team increased the robustness and accuracy of the assay by integrating thousands of so-called DNA nanoswitches, linear DNA strands with pairs of interacting molecules that are associated with two sequences in their middle and that, in addition, by binding to each other create an internal DNA loop; the nanoswitches' ends are tethered to the surface of the sample on one side and to beads on the other.  The picture on the top shows a DNA nanoswitch that forms a looped structure when a bond is formed between the attached reactive components (e.g. receptor-ligand pair shown in red and green); at one end it is attached to the sample stage and at the other to a bead (top). By applying centrifugal forces to the bead in the CFM device, the bond between the reactive components can be repeatedly ruptured, opening up the loop and increasing the length of the DNA tether (bottom), enabling highly reliable measurements of molecular interactions. In the CFM, many beads can be interrogated in parallel, enabling high-throughput single-molecule measurements (bottom left). In the video in the bottom right, the camera captures these rupture events in real time by registering the bead at a different spot. Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard University ""By applying a defined range of centrifugal forces to the beads we can provoke the rupture of the molecular complexes generating the looped DNA structures which will be registered by the camera-coupled lens. Importantly, using DNA nanoswitches as a stable scaffold allows us to repeat this process multiple times with the very same molecule in temperature-controlled conditions which greatly enhances our accuracy in determining the heterogeneity that a single molecular interaction can display,"" said Darren Yang, the first author of the study and a Graduate Student in Wong's team. In future research, bead-associated DNA nanoswitches can be employed to repeatedly assemble and rupture many different biomolecular complexes and to define the mechanical forces that control them. ""The integrated DNA nanoswitches are very modular, and can be functionalized with many different biomolecules in essentially a plug-and-play fashion, to enable a wide variety of molecular interactions to be studied with high throughput and reliability,"" added Wong. Next, the Wyss scientists are planning to apply their DNA nanoswitch-enhanced miniature CFM to the investigation of select biomedically relevant and force-dependent molecular interactions such as protein interactions governing blood clotting or hearing. ""Wong's team has created a new technology platform that greatly reduces the cost of single molecule force analysis and makes it widely accessible to the scientific community.  In addition to increasing our understanding of basic molecular structure-function relations, it may prove to be a valuable tool for drug development,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology program at Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.

Since newly formed neurons were discovered in the hippocampus more than 20 years ago, scientists have identified the many roles they play in learning and memory. However, mystery continues to surround the genetic controls that regulate the formation of the delicate structures and the chemicals necessary for neural communication, Zhao says. In the 1990s, Zhao worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Fred Gage at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California, site of groundbreaking discoveries on the formation of new neurons in the hippocampus. Until the discovery of this  adult neurogenesis,  scientists thought that the brain essentially had to make do with the supply of neurons it acquired at birth. The limited supply of new neurons that grows in the hippocampus throughout the lifespan has a role in memory, and perhaps in recovery from degenerative disease. Zhao, now a professor of neuroscience at UW Madison, has been probing the adult neurogenesis puzzle for most of her scientific career.  While trying to understand the mechanism that regulates adult neurogenesis, I am also using adult neurogenesis as a model to study brain development and developmental diseases,  she says.  In lab animals, adult neurogenesis provides a source of cells that can show us how a neural stem cell develops into a fully-formed neuron.  As might be expected for an organ as fantastically complex as the brain,  neurons come in many varieties,  Zhao says,  and their genetic activity changes as they mature. To really understand this process, we need to know which genes are active, and when.  Under study, a group of neurons might average out, which would mask key distinctions at different stages.  When you look at individual cells you can see a lot more information than you can in groups,  Zhao says. Imagine describing the monarch butterfly. Observing the larval stage, you would conclude it s a caterpillar. Watching the insect stage, you would call it a butterfly. But what would you conclude from looking at a mix of caterpillars and butterflies? The situation in developing neurons is even more confusing, Zhao says.  There are so many different types of neurons, and the stage of development is also critical for understanding the development process.  The technology to leap this hurdle, which can isolate individual neurons so their genes can be extracted, was first used on neurons in 2014. Taking young neurons from the hippocampus of adult mice, postdoctoral fellows Yu Gao and Feifei Wang (now a member of the faculty at Fudan University in Shanghai) isolated 84 single neurons that had differentiated from neural stem cells at least three days before   meaning they had started, but not completed, the transformation to a mature neuron. Once the data on gene activation was assembled, Brian Eisinger, another postdoctoral fellow with expertise in bioinformatics, performed intensive analysis on the rising and falling activity of thousands of genes. The gene activation profiles of individual cells revealed that the developing neurons go through four stages. But the results also revealed hints about the origin of common neurological conditions. First, the most active genes during the stem cell phase overlapped significantly with genes implicated in Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases.  It surprised us to see that genes associated with the stem cell life stage are highly represented in these neurodegenerative diseases,  says Zhao.  We do not know the significance, but it s possible that these conditions are more related to stem cell impairment than we thought.  Second, the gene exhibiting increased activity during neuron maturation overlapped with genes associated with autism. That picture is complex, Zhao acknowledges, as thousands of genes are affected in some way in autism.  This was an exploratory analysis that may open a new window on understanding complex disorders like autism,  Zhao says.  Imagine if you unexpectedly saw a mountain lion s paw print in the forest. Now you would wonder if the lion explained a sudden shortfall of deer in the forest, but you would not know until you looked further.  Junior biochemistry student Laurel Kelnhofer and graduate student Emily Jobe also contributed to the study, published today in the journal Cerebral Cortex. Although papers using single-cell analysis of mammalian neurons have begun to appear in the last year, they focused on large populations of neurons, Zhao says.  Ours is the first single-cell analysis in adult-born new neurons. Our challenge was that these are scarce, so we had to work hard to optimize our cell isolation procedure.  The study could only be performed at a world-class research institution like UW Madison, Zhao added.  The Comprehensive Cancer Center provided the cell sorter we needed to get started. The Waisman Center, where I study mechanisms of brain development, had state-of-the-art confocal microscopes and an early model of the single-cell analyzer. The Biotechnology Center has the latest instruments for RNA quantification and ultra-fast RNA sequencing. To advance science, we needed all of these instruments   and the scientists who know how to run them. ","Published: March 18, 2016"

The finding may lead to new options for male contraception as well as treatments for infertility resulting from problems with sperm mobility. Inside the male reproductive tract, mature sperm are capable of limited movement. This limited movement, however, is not enough to propel them toward the egg when they enter the female reproductive tract. To begin their journey, they must first be activated by the hormone progesterone, which is released by the egg.  Developing new compounds that block ABHD2 ultimately may yield new contraceptive methods to prevent sperm from reaching the egg.  Stuart Moss, Ph.D, Director, NICHD Publishing online in Science, the researchers report that the molecule to which progesterone must bind is the enzyme alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing protein 2 (ABHD2), found in the sperm cell s outer membrane. The study was conducted by Melissa R. Miller and colleagues at the University of California, Berkley, the University of California, San Francisco, and Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.  This is an important advance in explaining how sperm become hypermotile in the female reproductive tract,  said Stuart Moss, Ph.D, director of the male reproductive health program at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded the study.  Developing new compounds that block ABHD2 ultimately may yield new contraceptive methods to prevent sperm from reaching the egg.  Similarly, strategies to bypass or enhance the enzyme might provide therapies for treating infertility resulting from sperm that lack movement capability. Before a sperm can transition to the hyper-active phase, calcium must pass through the cell s outer membrane and enter the flagella, the tail-like appendage the cell uses to propel itself. The sperm protein known as CatSper joins with similar proteins in the flagella to allow the entry of calcium. When the researchers undertook the current study, it was not known whether progesterone interacted directly with CatSper to trigger the calcium influx, or acted on some other molecule (which, in turn, acted on CatSper). Before treating sperm with progesterone, the researchers exposed them to a chemical that inhibits a particular class of enzymes that they believed could include the candidate molecule that acted on CatSper. The hunch proved correct: the treated cells remained inactive after progesterone exposure, indicating that CatSper was not directly involved. Working with modified progesterone, the researchers eventually isolated ABHD2 from the sperm tails. When the researchers inactivated ABHD2, exposure to progesterone failed to activate the sperm cells, confirming that ABHD2 is the molecular target for progesterone.","Published: March 18, 2016"

The researchers noted that because opioid and non-opioid mechanisms of pain relief interact synergistically, the results of this study suggest that combining mindfulness-based and pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic pain-relieving approaches that rely on opioid signaling may be particularly effective in treating pain. Previous research has shown that mindfulness meditation helps relieve pain, but researchers have been unclear about how the practice induces pain relief   specifically, if meditation is associated with the release of naturally occurring opiates. Researchers recorded pain reports in 78 healthy adults during meditation or a non-meditation control in response to painful heat stimuli and intravenous administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone (a drug that blocks the transmission of opioid activity) or placebo saline. Participants were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 1) meditation plus naloxone; 2) control plus naloxone; 3) meditation plus saline; or 4) control plus saline. People in the control groups were instructed to  close your eyes and relax until the end of the experiment.  The researchers found that participants who meditated during saline administration had significantly lower pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings compared to those who did not meditate while receiving saline. Importantly, data from the meditation plus naloxone group showed that naloxone did not block meditation s pain-relieving effects. No significant differences in reductions of pain intensity or pain unpleasantness were seen between the meditation plus naloxone and the meditation plus saline groups. Participants who meditated during naloxone administration also had significantly greater reductions in pain intensity and unpleasantness than the control groups.

These data should promote a re-evaluation of those diseases to see if this new function that we ve identified contributes to those defects,  said senior study author Dr. Michael Buszczak, Associate Professor of Molecular Biology and with the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine at UT Southwestern. The study, published recently in Developmental Cell, indicates that RNA-binding fox (Rbfox) proteins oversee translation of messenger RNA, or mRNA, into proteins. Using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model, researchers showed that the Rbfox1 protein, in particular, has this regulatory role. Rbfox1 proteins were known to play a key role in splicing together coding portions of genes called exons to form mRNA, which is subsequently translated to form proteins. Splicing largely takes place within the nucleus of cells, where many Rbfox1 proteins are found. But there are also variants of Rbfox1 proteins found in the cytoplasm   the portion of the cell outside the nucleus   and the function of those cytoplasmic proteins had not been understood.  We found that cytoplasmic Rbfox1 represses the production of specific proteins,  Dr. Buszczak said. The lead author of the study, UT Southwestern Molecular Biology graduate student Arnaldo Carreira-Rosario, found that Rbfox1 binds to specific elements at the ends of mRNA molecules, preventing these mRNAs from being translated into proteins. If Rbfox1 proteins are lost and mRNA is no longer repressed, that could lead to aberrant growth of cells, or cancers. The researchers found that cytoplasmic forms of Rbfox1 were required for germ cell development in Drosophila.  Without this protein, the germ cells are blocked in a very specific stage of differentiation and just linger there. They can t differentiate into mature eggs,  said Dr. Buszczak, an E.E. and Greer Garson Fogelson Scholar in Medical Research. This block leads to sterility in female Drosophila and, in other contexts, can result in an inappropriate proliferation of cells, which underlies cancer. Work by co-author Dr. Mani Ramaswami of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland points to a link between the newly identified function of Rbfox1 proteins and neuronal development and function, which could have important implications for a number of the neuronal disorders linked to disruption of Rbfox1. The idea is that loss of Rbfox1 causes disease by disrupting protein expression, not RNA splicing,  Dr. Buszczak said.  If this interpretation is correct, then it has implications for how one would develop therapeutics to treat the disease in question.  Other UT Southwestern researchers who contributed to this study were Varsha Bhargava, a graduate student in Molecular Biology; and Rahul Kollipara, a computational biologist with the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development.","Published: March 18, 2016"

The injection of these networks of functioning human neural cells   compared to injecting individual cells -- dramatically improved their survival following transplantation into mouse brains. This is a promising new platform that could make transplantation of neurons a viable treatment for a broad range of human neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, transplantation of neurons to treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson s disease, had very limited success due to poor survival of neurons that were injected as a solution of individual cells. The new research is supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of NIH.  Working together, the stem cell biologists and the biomaterials experts developed a system capable of shuttling neural cells through the demanding journey of transplantation and engraftment into host brain tissue,  said Rosemarie Hunziker, Ph.D., director of the NIBIB Program in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.  This exciting work was made possible by the close collaboration of experts in a wide range of disciplines.  The research was performed by researchers from Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey, departments of Biomedical Engineering, Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, and the Child Health Institute; Stanford University School of Medicine s Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford, California; the Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Piscataway; and the New Jersey Center for Biomaterials, Piscataway. The results are reported in the March 17 issue of Nature Communications. The researchers experimented in creating scaffolds made of different types of polymer fibers, and of varying thickness and density. They ultimately created a web of relatively thick fibers using a polymer that stem cells successfully adhered to. The stem cells used were human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be readily generated from adult cell types such as skin cells. The iPSCs were induced to differentiate into neural cells by introducing the protein NeuroD1 into the cells. The space between the polymer fibers turned out to be critical.  If the scaffolds were too dense, the stem cell-derived neurons were unable to integrate into the scaffold, whereas if they are too sparse then the network organization tends to be poor,  explained Prabhas Moghe, Ph.D., distinguished professor of biomedical engineering and chemical engineering at Rutgers University and co-senior author of the paper.  The optimal pore size was one that was large enough for the cells to populate the scaffold but small enough that the differentiating neurons sensed the presence of their neighbors and produced outgrowths resulting in cell-to-cell contact. This contact enhances cell survival and development into functional neurons able to transmit an electrical signal across the developing neural network.  To test the viability of neuron-seeded scaffolds when transplanted, the researchers created micro-scaffolds that were small enough for injection into mouse brain tissue using a standard hypodermic needle. They injected scaffolds carrying the human neurons into brain slices from mice and compared them to human neurons injected as individual, dissociated cells. The neurons on the scaffolds had dramatically increased cell-survival compared with the individual cell suspensions. The scaffolds also promoted improved neuronal outgrowth and electrical activity. Neurons injected individually in suspension resulted in very few cells surviving the transplant procedure. Human neurons on scaffolds compared to neurons in solution were then tested when injected into the brains of live mice. Similar to the results in the brain slices, the survival rate of neurons on the scaffold network was increased nearly 40-fold compared to injected isolated cells. A critical finding was that the neurons on the micro-scaffolds expressed proteins that are involved in the growth and maturation of neural synapses--a good indication that the transplanted neurons were capable of functionally integrating into the host brain tissue. The success of the study gives this interdisciplinary group reason to believe that their combined areas of expertise have resulted in a system with much promise for eventual treatment of human neurodegenerative disorders. In fact, they are now refining their system for specific use as an eventual transplant therapy for Parkinson s disease. The plan is to develop methods to differentiate the stem cells into neurons that produce dopamine, the specific neuron type that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson s disease. The work also will include fine-tuning the scaffold materials, mechanics and dimensions to optimize the survival and function of dopamine-producing neurons, and finding the best mouse models of the disease to test this Parkinson s-specific therapy.

The license agreement will give ThromboGenics access to a collection of integrin antagonists developed by Galapagos. Research to-date suggests that integrin antagonists could play an important role in the treatment of back of the eye diseases, including diabetic eye diseases. Initially, ThromboGenics intends to further explore and characterize the integrin antagonists that it has in-licensed from Galapagos using a number of well validated preclinical models of diabetic eye disease. ThromboGenics believes that by gaining access to these molecules, it has the potential to develop a novel small molecule integrin antagonist which could be used to treat a broad range of patients with diabetic retinopathy, with or without diabetic macular edema. ThromboGenics has designated the most advanced of these integrin antagonist drug candidates as THR-687. According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are about 415 million people with diabetes worldwide and this number is expected to double over the next 20 years. One in three diabetics will develop diabetic retinopathy at some stage in his or her lifetime. As a result, the market for new treatments for diabetic retinopathy is expected to be one of the fastest growing segments of the ophthalmic medicines market. Over the period to 2023 this market segment is forecast to grow at over 16% per annum from $1.6 billion to $4.2 billion, which is about double the growth rate of the overall ophthalmology market. Dr Patrik De Haes, CEO of ThromboGenics, comments:  We are pleased to have signed this in-licensing deal with Galapagos which will provide us with access to a collection of integrin antagonists, an exciting class of drugs being developed for back of the eye disease. This deal is a further important step in our goal to build one of the industry s leading pipelines targeting diabetic eye disease based on novel disease modifying compounds. Diabetic eye disease is the fastest growing segment of the overall ophthalmology market, and the number of patients needing improved treatment options for both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema is expected to grow significantly over the next decade.  Onno van de Stolpe, CEO of Galapagos, said:  We believe that ThromboGenics is a great partner for this collection of integrin antagonists that we have developed. ThromboGenics has shown thorough understanding of the back of the eye disease in the pre-clinical models that they have developed, in order to assess these potential drug candidates for both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. We are looking forward to watching their progress.  Under the terms of the agreement, ThromboGenics will pay a  1 million upfront technology-transfer payment to Galapagos. Galapagos will also be entitled to receive certain development and commercial milestone payments plus royalties based on any future annual net sales of products that originated from its library of integrin antagonists.","Published: March 18, 2016"

""These data should promote a re-evaluation of those diseases to see if this new function that we've identified contributes to those defects,"" said senior study author Dr. Michael Buszczak, Associate Professor of Molecular Biology and with the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine at UT Southwestern. See Also: New technique permits cell-specific examination of proteins in alzheimer's disease brain tissue The study, published recently in Developmental Cell, indicates that RNA-binding fox (Rbfox) proteins oversee translation of messenger RNA, or mRNA, into proteins. Using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model, researchers showed that the Rbfox1 protein, in particular, has this regulatory role. Rbfox1 proteins were known to play a key role in splicing together coding portions of genes called exons to form mRNA, which is subsequently translated to form proteins. Splicing largely takes place within the nucleus of cells, where many Rbfox1 proteins are found. But there are also variants of Rbfox1 proteins found in the cytoplasm and the function of those cytoplasmic proteins had not been understood. L-R: Dr. Michael Buszczak and graduate students Arnaldo Carreira-Rosario and Varsha Bhargava  contributed to the study. Credit: UT Southwestern Medical Center  ""We found that cytoplasmic Rbfox1 represses the production of specific proteins,"" Dr. Buszczak said. The lead author of the study, UT Southwestern Molecular Biology graduate student Arnaldo Carreira-Rosario, found that Rbfox1 binds to specific elements at the ends of mRNA molecules, preventing these mRNAs from being translated into proteins. If Rbfox1 proteins are lost and mRNA is no longer repressed, that could lead to aberrant growth of cells, or cancers. The researchers found that cytoplasmic forms of Rbfox1 were required for germ cell development in Drosophila. ""Without this protein, the germ cells are blocked in a very specific stage of differentiation and just linger there. They can't differentiate into mature eggs,"" said Dr. Buszczak, an E.E. and Greer Garson Fogelson Scholar in Medical Research.

Dr. Ofer Yizhar and his group in the Weizmann Institute of Science s Neurobiology Department have taken a large step in this direction with a new research method that can provide scientists with targeted control over vital parts of the brain s communications. Learn More: Children's impulsive behaviour is related to their brain connectivity Yizhar works in the relatively new field of optogenetics, in which scientists use genetic engineering and laser light in thin optical fibers to investigate the living brain. With these tools, scientists can modulate and control the activities of nerve circuits in the brain, and thus begin to unravel the networks of links and nodes in the brain s communications systems. Yizhar is particularly interested in the long-distance communications between nerve cells in different areas of the brain.  The coordination between different brain systems is vital to the normal functioning of the brain. If we can understand the extended lines of communication between cells that are in the different regions of the brain, some of them quite far from one another,  says Yizhar,  we might be able, in the future, to understand the changes that take place in the brain in diseases such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Because we do not have an understanding of these diseases on a functional level, we are sorely lacking good ways to treat them.  Optogenetics involves inserting a gene for a light-sensitive protein into the neurons, using a modified virus. These neurons then become activated when light is focused on them through the thin optical fibers. Yizhar and his team established a method that allows them to zoom in on a particular part of the brain s network: the  communications cables  that link up the entire brain. These  cables,  the axons, can be relatively short or can be lengthy, reaching out to distant regions of the brain. See Also: Changes in brain connectivity protect against developing bipolar disorder In the new study, which was published in Nature Neuroscience, the team, led by PhD student Mathias Mahn, showed that optogenetic techniques can be used to temporarily silence these long-range axons, effectively leading to a reversible  disconnect  between two distant brain nodes. By observing what happens when crucial connections are disabled, the researchers were able to begin to filling in the picture of the axons  role in the brain s internal conversation. Since mental and neurological diseases are often thought to result from changes in long-range brain connectivity, these studies could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind health and disease in the brain.  The research led us to a deeper understanding of the unique properties of the axons and synapses that form the connections between neurons,  says Yizhar.  We were able to uncover the responses of axons to various optogenetic manipulations. Understanding these differences will be crucial to unraveling the mechanisms for long-distance communication in the brain.  Weizmann Institute of Science   press release Mahn M et al.

But findings published in eLife show we can supercharge it to be more flexible.   Scientists at the Jagiellonian University in Poland taught braille to sighted individuals and found that learning such a complex tactile task activates the visual cortex, when you d only expect it to activate the tactile one. See Also: Touch-sensing neurons are multitaskers  The textbooks tell us that the visual cortex processes visual tasks while the tactile cortex, called the somatosensory cortex, processes tasks related to touch,  says lead author Marcin Szwed from Jagiellonian University.  Our findings tear up that view, showing we can establish new connections if we undertake a complex enough task and are given long enough to learn it.  The findings could have implications for our power to bend different sections of the brain to our will by learning other demanding skills, such as playing a musical instrument or learning to drive. The flexibility occurs because the brain overcomes the normal division of labour and establishes new connections to boost its power. It was already known that the brain can reorganize after a massive injury or as a result of massive sensory deprivation such as blindness. The visual cortex of the blind, deprived of its input, adapts for other tasks such as speech, memory, and reading Braille by touch. There has been speculation that this might also be possible in the normal, adult brain, but there has been no conclusive evidence.  For the first time we re able to show that large-scale reorganization is a viable mechanism that the sighted, adult brain is able to recruit when it is sufficiently challenged,  says Szwed. Learn More: Paying attention makes touch-sensing brain cells fire rapidly and in sync Over nine months, 29 volunteers were taught to read Braille while blindfolded. They achieved reading speeds of between 0 and 17 words per minute. Before and after the course, they took part in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment to test the impact of their learning on regions of the brain. This revealed that following the course, areas of the visual cortex, particularly the Visual Word Form Area, were activated and that connections with the tactile cortex were established. In an additional experiment using transcranial magnetic stimulation, scientists applied magnetic field from a coil to selectively suppress the Visual Word Form Area in the brains of nine volunteers. This impaired their ability to read Braille, confirming the role of this site for the task. The results also discount the hypothesis that the visual cortex could have just been activated because volunteers used their imaginations to picture Braille dots.  We are all capable of retuning our brains if we re prepared to put the work in,  says Szwed. He asserts that the findings call for a reassessment of our view of the functional organization of the human brain, which is more flexible than the brains of other primates.  The extra flexibility that we have uncovered might be one those features that made us human, and allowed us to create a sophisticated culture, with pianos and Braille alphabet,  he says. eLife  press release Siuda-Krzywicka K et al.

The researchers noted that because opioid and non-opioid mechanisms of pain relief interact synergistically, the results of this study suggest that combining mindfulness-based and pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic pain-relieving approaches that rely on opioid signaling may be particularly effective in treating pain. Previous research has shown that mindfulness meditation helps relieve pain, but researchers have been unclear about how the practice induces pain relief   specifically, if meditation is associated with the release of naturally occurring opiates. Researchers recorded pain reports in 78 healthy adults during meditation or a non-meditation control in response to painful heat stimuli and intravenous administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone (a drug that blocks the transmission of opioid activity) or placebo saline. Participants were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 1) meditation plus naloxone; 2) control plus naloxone; 3) meditation plus saline; or 4) control plus saline. People in the control groups were instructed to  close your eyes and relax until the end of the experiment.  The researchers found that participants who meditated during saline administration had significantly lower pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings compared to those who did not meditate while receiving saline. Importantly, data from the meditation plus naloxone group showed that naloxone did not block meditation s pain-relieving effects. No significant differences in reductions of pain intensity or pain unpleasantness were seen between the meditation plus naloxone and the meditation plus saline groups. Participants who meditated during naloxone administration also had significantly greater reductions in pain intensity and unpleasantness than the control groups.

The procedure, involving a single injection of hRPC cells under the retina, was conducted at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School (HMS) and a world-renowned clinical and research centre for the treatment of eye disease, including retinal degeneration. The patient was ischarged from hospital on the same day. RP is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye that lead to progressive loss of sight due to photoreceptor cells in the retina becoming damaged and eventually dying. ReNeuron has demonstrated that its Human Retinal Progenitor Cells (hRPCs) improve visual acuity in pre-clinical models of retinal degeneration and, uniquely, the cells appear to both protect the host retina from further degeneration as well as engraft into the retina itself and differentiate into the photoreceptor cell types that are lost as a result of the disease. These putative mechanisms of action suggest that ReNeuron s cell therapy candidate could potentially treat any of the specific genetic variants of RP rather than, as is the case with gene therapy approaches, being restricted to the targeting of one particular genetic cause of disease. The Phase I/II clinical trial is an open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ReNeuron s hRPC cell therapy candidate in 15 patients with advanced RP. Importantly, the study marks the Company s initiation of clinical trial activities in the US. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ReNeuron s hRPC programme targeting RP. This, together with the programme s Orphan Drug Designation in both the US and Europe, provides accelerated clinical development and marketing authorisation review processes for the RP therapeutic candidate as well as the potential for a significant period of market exclusivity once approved in these major territories. Further patients have been identified for recruitment into the study and initial short-term safety and tolerability data from the Phase I part of the study are expected towards the end of 2016, with preliminary efficacy read-outs in the first half of 2017. Subject to the outcome of the Phase I/II study, the Company expects to be able to file an application in the second half of 2017 to commence a pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial with its cell therapy candidate for RP. A positive outcome from this pivotal study is expected to form the basis for subsequent marketing authorisation filings in both the US and Europe. Eric Pierce, MD, PhD, Director of the Ocular Genomics Institute and Berman Gund Laboratory for Study of Retinal Degenerations at Mass. Eye and Ear and HMS and Principal Investigator for the clinical trial, commented:  We are delighted to have treated the first patient in this important Phase I/II clinical trial. The human Retinal Progenitor Cells being tested in the study are promising since they can make photoreceptors. The implanted cells may not only prevent degeneration of patients' vision but may possibly restore some vision by replacing degenerated photoreceptor cells. We look forward to reporting future progress with this study in the months ahead.  Joining Dr. Pierce as co-investigators are Dean Eliott, MD and Jason Comander, MD, PhD, both of Mass. Eye and Ear and the HMS Department of Ophthalmology. Olav Helleb , Chief Executive Officer of ReNeuron, said:  The dosing of the first patient in the Phase I/II clinical trial of our cell therapy candidate for retinitis pigmentosa marks another significant milestone for ReNeuron. Retinal degenerative diseases represent extremely attractive targets for cell therapy approaches and our programme targeting RP benefits from a number of key competitive advantages in terms of the potential mechanisms of action of our hRPC cells and the potential speed of clinical development to market for this programme. With the start of this study, we are also delighted to have commenced clinical development activities in the US, a major target market. ","Published: March 17, 2016"

The results of the survey   conducted by ORC International and sponsored by Patheon are published in a white paper,  Pharmaceutical Product Forecasting and Its Impact on Manufacturing.  The white paper includes insights from the 50 industry experts and commentary from Jim Miller, founder and president of PharmSource. When a company fails to meet its forecasted demand, the lack of inventory can result in loss of sales, product risk and overworked employees. It is estimated that a delay in launch costs an average of $15 million per drug, per day, and research shows that a blockbuster drug will lose $1 billion in revenue annually until capacity is developed to meet demand. Generally, underestimating resulted from not having enough background data to support forecasting information.  Making accurate demand forecasts is extremely challenging for pharmaceutical companies, particularly forecasts for new product launches,  said Michael Lehmann, executive vice president sales and marketing for Patheon.  As a driver of innovation and a transformative force in the industry, Patheon is focused on helping clients find innovative solutions to their challenges.  If demand is overestimated, it leads to misappropriated capital, forcing manufacturers to mark down the price of the product, destroy inventory and/or close plants and lay off employees, losing the roughly $500 million it cost to acquire their pharmaceutical plant. Respondents said that they often overestimated demand when there is greater market volatility or when they were overly optimistic in their forecasting. These inaccuracies in demand forecasting, combined with increases in complex manufacturing processes, are driving the need for more choices in manufacturing solutions. Pharmaceutical companies have started outsourcing drug production to take advantage of more flexible manufacturing offerings, and to mitigate risks and prevent the reputational damage resulting from inaccurate demand forecasts.  It is clear that regardless of company size, product type, or market, the challenge of demand forecasting is a significant one,  said Dana Benini, vice president, ORC International.  Since forecasts by their very definition involve a degree of uncertainty, pharma companies should be talking about how flexible, scalable capacity can accommodate the variability factor, and minimize the impact of inaccurate estimates for a product that does not yet exist.  Flexible manufacturing services, like those provided by Patheon, complement the traditional outsourcing service model through adaptable and scalable capacity, and allows clients to increase and decrease capacity as needed. In the face of uncertain forecasts, contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) like Patheon can offer the facilities, equipment and process technology expertise needed for operations and risk management. Patheon commissioned the study to better understand the challenges pharmaceutical companies encounter when implementing demand forecasts for commercial launches. The findings were based on in-depth interviews examining current forecasting processes, key issues that arise from inaccurate forecasting, and how forecasting needs will change in the future.","Published: March 17, 2016"

Through the cooperation agreements, the access to PrenaTest , Europe s first non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT), will significantly be enhanced for gynecologists in the German-speaking regions via extensive medical customer and support networks provided by the partner labs. In Switzerland, the PrenaTest  analysis is already carried out for a couple of months by the laboratory medical center Dr. Risch in Berne. Performing the NIPT analysis in Switzerland was one of the prerequisites for reimbursement by the statutory Swiss healthcare system, as decided by the Swiss authorities mid of 2015. Dr. Risch has already been offering the PrenaTest  to its gynecologists in Switzerland and Liechtenstein since 2013. In Germany, the PrenaTest  technology will soon be transferred to the Limbach Group, one of the largest laboratory chains in Germany, with the aim to conduct the NIPT analysis locally in their human genetics center in Ulm. The Limbach Group recently included the PrenaTest  into their service offering, thus strongly expanding the nationwide support and care of gynecologists throughout Germany. Furthermore, the Medical Genetics Center (MGZ) in Munich, one of the largest human genetic laboratories in Germany, will start to perform the PrenaTest  analysis in spring this year, too. For this reason, the MGZ has established a comprehensive PrenaTest  supply network in cooperation with other leading human genetic and prenatal diagnostic partners in Neu-Ulm, Nuremberg and Munich. Following the recently completed technology transfer in Germany, Labor Dr. Wisplinghoff will now start to perform the PrenaTest  analysis in its laboratories in Cologne. The Wisplinghoff group, supporting gynecologists in the entire north west of Germany and in Berlin, has already been offering the PrenaTest  to its customers since 2013.  Key to the successful technology transfer is our innovative PrenaBoxx , which represents a novel NIPT data analysis solution. The system includes our CE-marked PrenaTest  software and can be easily installed and operated locally in a user-friendly manner,  says Dr. Michael Lutz, CEO of LifeCodexx AG.  More importantly, the PrenaBoxx  is capable of analyzing data from both NGS and qPCR technology platforms and hence represents the most widely applicable NIPT software tool in the current global NIPT market.

These specialized communities of bacteria in the body are known as microbiomes. Now, researchers at the University of Missouri have discovered a microbiome in the male reproductive tract in mice that harbors harmful bacteria that may negatively influence reproductive function and health of males. Bacteria found in this specialized microbiome may pass from father to offspring, where it may program later disease risk, such as obesity. In fathers, some bacteria may initiate diseases, such as prostatitis, that can result in later prostate cancer.  Microbiomes are influenced by many factors such as temperature, the pH or acidity of the environment and whether there s a food source to promote bacterial growth,  said Cheryl Rosenfeld, an associate professor of biomedical sciences in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine and an investigator in the Bond Life Sciences Center.  The male reproductive tract includes a unique niche in which bacteria thrive, i.e. the seminal vesicles. These tubular glands produce seminal fluid, are located in an environment that is temperature controlled and is rich in carbohydrates needed to feed bacteria. Our team set out to isolate this potential microbiome and analyze whether it could harbor harmful bacteria.  Rosenfeld and her team, which included Angela Javurek, a former undergraduate researcher in the Bond Life Sciences Center, collected and isolated seminal fluid and vesicles from male mice. Then, researchers sequenced the DNA of the bacteria located in the reproductive organs and fluid. The team then engaged the MU Informatics Research Core Facility (ICRF), a specialized and sophisticated computational biology group to help analyze the data. Established in 2009 by the Missouri Life Science Trust Fund, the ICRF provides a fundamental tool to life sciences researchers in Missouri   analyzing the overwhelming amount of data that are produced with large research projects. In Rosenfeld s study, Scott Givan, the associate director of the IRCF, and William Spollen, an expert programmer analyst, employed specialized computer programs that helped narrow and identify the microorganisms.  The data showed that the bacterial composition found in the male reproductive tract contained potentially detrimental bacteria that can be transmitted to female reproductive partners and offspring,  Rosenfeld said.  The bacteria also could be the causative agent of chronic prostatitis, a possible precursor to prostate cancer in males,   Additionally, further testing showed this bacterial community contains the bacteria that may cause obesity in rats. Understanding how these genetic and environmental factors influence this particular microbiome could help in understanding how possible developmental disorders and diseases are passed down by fathers to their offspring.

These motors spin the flagella, which work as nanoscale propellers to drive the bacterium forward. Despite motors in diverse bacteria having the same core structure, different bacteria vary widely in their swimming power. For example, Campylobacter jejuni, which causes food poisoning, can swim powerfully enough to bore through the mucus that lines the gut, an environment too thick and sticky for other bacteria to push through. The reasons for these differences in swimming ability have remained obscure   until now. Using a recently installed high-powered electron microscope at Imperial, a team of researchers lead by Dr Morgan Beeby from the Department of Life Sciences has been able visualize these motors in unprecedented detail. Their visualizations of these motors explains the differences in swimming ability, mathematically accounting for differences in motor power.  Bacterial flagellar motors work on a rotational mechanism, spinning their long flagellar tail to produce a helical propeller-like motion. The team found that stronger swimmers have evolved by adding extra parts to their motors, making more powerful motors that have increased turning force, or torque. In flagellar motors, the turning force is produced by a ring of structures called stators around the motor. The team found that Campylobacter jejuni had almost twice as many stators positioned around the motor than in Salmonella, and that these structures sat in a wider ring. More stators provide increased torque, and the increased width of the ring means individual stators exert more leverage when rotating the helical propeller. However, not all bacteria need to be so powerful and swim through such viscous environments as stomach mucus. Instead, another bacterium the team looked at, a close relative of Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera, has evolved a motor with only intermediate power.  For the first time, we have been able to see and explain how these nanoscale molecular machines have evolved in bacteria to colonize new environments,  said Dr Beeby.  It s a fascinating insight into the awe-inspiring diversity of life that has evolved on Earth, and also presents possible drug targets. We may be able to design drugs that specifically sabotage the flagella only in targeted bacterial species.  The team used a method called electron cryo-tomography to rapidly freeze the bacteria to -180?C. This prevents ice crystals from forming that would break the structure apart, allowing the researchers to image the flash-frozen motor from all angles and build up a 3D model. By looking at distantly related bacteria from different branches of the evolutionary tree, the team speculate that the ability to alter torque in this way may have evolved up to two billion years ago.  Entire branches of the bacterial family tree have evolved motors with different torques, leading to a diversity of species each geared to their own environment,  said Dr Beeby. The team is now investigating how and when the evolutionary steps that altered motor torque happened.","Published: March 17, 2016"

Loss of the world's stony coral reefs - up to 30% in the next 30 years, according to some estimates - will mean loss of their services, including sequestering some 70-90 million tons of carbon each year and supporting enormous marine biodiversity. Yet despite many advances, we are still far from understanding the causes and processes contributing to the corals' demise. Weizmann Institute researchers have developed a new experimental platform for studying coral biology at microscale resolutions, which is already providing new insights into this complex problem. The tiny - often less than a millimeter in diameter - animals that build coral reefs create a thin layer of living tissue surrounding the calcium-based skeleton. These animals live in symbiosis with single-celled, photosynthetic algae that provide nutrients and oxygen in return for carbon dioxide and shelter. ""In order to understand what happens during bleaching, when this symbiosis is broken,"" says Dr. Assaf Vardi, ""we need to understand what happens to these organisms at the cellular and molecular levels under various conditions."" Vardi and his team - Orr Shapiro, Esti Kramarsky-Winter and Assaf R. Gavish of the Weizmann Institute's Plant and Environmental Sciences Department - together with Roman Stocker of MIT (currently at ETH, Switzerland), created a system they call ""coral on a chip."" For the first time, the scientists were able to examine living coral polyps in the lab, under highly controlled conditions. This system is based on microfluidics technology, which had been developed to track cellular processes under life-like conditions. Taking a small piece of coral, Vardi and his team induced stressful conditions - in this case by increasing salt content - which caused the corals to release polyps, a process sometimes referred to as ""polyp bail-out."" Settling the bailed-out polyps into prefabricated microfluidic wells, the scientists were able to observe, via continuous observation under a microscope, how miniature coral colonies called ""micropropagates"" grow and behave in different conditions. Using their system, the team recorded, for the first time, the growth of individual aragonite crystals - the basic building blocks of the coral skeleton. The group was also able to directly visualize the initiation of coral disease, pointing to a little-known path of infection. Subjecting coral micropropagates to high light intensities, known to induce coral bleaching, enabled the team to follow the elimination of the symbiotic algae, one cell at a time. Vardi's lab group is already in the process of adapting the coral-on-a-chip system to track the nutrient and carbon cycles of reef-building corals, as well as delving further into disease and bleaching processes. ""Many corals are running out of time; it is crucial to know how our actions are affecting their survival, and how they affect ours,"" he says. ""Our method can help researchers investigate everything from the coral genes that affect survival, to the strategies coral use to build reefs, to their effects on the marine carbon cycle."" Indeed, as corals represent an early stage in the evolution of multicellular organisms, Vardi envisions the coral-on-a-chip platform establishing coral micropropagates as a new model system for research.","Published: March 17, 2016"

However, these drugs don t work at all in some patients, and they lose their effectiveness in others. A new study from MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital reveals why a certain class of these drugs, known as kinase inhibitors, doesn t always halt tumor growth. The researchers found that while kinase inhibitors successfully shut down their targets, they also provoke cells to turn on a backup system that can take over for the one knocked out by the drug. The team also showed that disrupting both systems with a combination of drugs yields much better results, in a study of mice.  We ve discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism involved in resistance to targeted therapeutics,  says Douglas Lauffenburger, the Ford Professor of Bioengineering and head of MIT s Department of Biological Engineering.  Its presence appears to be associated with poor response to some kinase inhibitors in clinical patients. And we ve demonstrated that in mice adding a drug against this resistance mechanism allows the original targeted drug to work when otherwise it wouldn t.  Lauffenburger, who is also an affiliate member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, is the senior author of the study. The lead authors are Miles Miller, a former MIT graduate student who is now a postdoc at Harvard Medical School, and Madeleine Oudin, a Koch Institute postdoc. Bypass system Kinase inhibitors, frequently used against breast, ovarian, and other cancers, work by disrupting cell signaling pathways that stimulate cells to grow, proliferate, or become invasive. Doctors usually prescribe them based on whether a patient s tumor is overexpressing a cancer-driving protein such as epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, these drugs can fail even in tumors where they should work. About half of these failures are caused by genetic mutations that allow cancer cells to evade the drug s actions, but the rest are unexplained, Lauffenburger says. Based on their previous studies of endometriosis (when uterine tissue grows into surrounding organs), Lauffenburger and his colleagues suspected there could be a backup pathway helping cancer cells to sidestep the effects of kinase inhibitors. In those studies, the researchers found that invasive endometrial cells become  addicted  to a certain growth signal, and that this pathway actually shuts off other growth pathways. Drugs that shut down the primary pathway can have the unintended effect of activating those backup systems. The MIT team wondered if the same thing might be happening in cancer cells. They focused on melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer, two very aggressive forms of cancer that are often driven by EGFR ligands (molecules that activate the receptor), which help the cancer cells to become motile and invasive. They found that when EGFR ligands bind to receptors on the cancer cell surface, they not only trigger a cascade of cellular reactions that promotes invasiveness but also activate a positive feedback loop: Enzymes called proteases release EGFR ligands from the cell surface so they can bind to even more receptors, strengthening the pro-invasion signal. The researchers found that those proteases also chop off receptors that initiate other pro-invasion pathways. Essentially, the cancer cells become addicted to the EGFR-driven pathway and shut off competing pathways because they don t need them, Lauffenburger says.  The cells have the capability for other inputs, but if they re already signaling through one, they re perfectly happy to shut down the rest,  he says. Consequently, when doctors give a kinase inhibitor that shuts off the EGFR pathway, it also shuts off the proteases, allowing the backup pathways, which are no longer being suppressed, to take over. More accurate predictions The researchers also showed that these cleaved receptor proteins can be detected in blood samples from patients, and that the protein levels correlate with how well EGFR inhibitors work for individual patients. High levels of cleaved proteins mean that there is a lot of potential for the backup system to kick in, and kinase inhibitors will not be effective. However, if these protein levels are low, that suggests the backup system is not very strong in that patient s tumor.  The discovery seems to identify those patients who will go on to receive long-term clinical benefit versus those whose tumors will quickly adapt and circumvent treatment, by virtue of a blood-based test that can be performed at baseline or within days of initiating treatment,  says Keith Flaherty, an author of the paper and director of developmental therapeutics at the MGH Cancer Center, who hopes to begin performing this kind of test in patients. The study also suggests that patients whose tumors have a strong backup system could benefit from receiving an EGFR inhibitor plus a drug that shuts down the secondary pathway. One candidate is a type of drug known as an AXL inhibitor, which is now in clinical trials. In mouse studies, the MIT team found that treating tumors with that combination of drugs was much more effective than giving either one alone.  Not only can the activation of this novel drug resistance mechanism be identified in patients by measuring (blood) serum receptor levels, but it is therapeutically tractable by combined targeting of cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling molecules. This important study provides novel mechanisms, new biomarkers, and the potential for rapid implementation to improving patient outcomes,  says Gordon Mills, a professor of medicine and immunology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research.","Published: March 17, 2016"

Current harvesting methods take a long time and require injections of a growth factor to boost stem cell numbers. This often leads to side effects. The discovery reduces the time required to obtain adequate numbers of stem cells, without the need for a growth factor. The method, developed by a team of CSIRO researchers working within the manufacturing arm of CSIRO with the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute  (ARMI) at Monash, combines a newly discovered molecule (known as BOP), with an existing type of molecule (AMD3100) to mobilise the stem cells found in bone marrow out into the blood stream. CSIRO researcher Dr Susie Nilsson said her team was able to demonstrate that combining the two molecules directly impacts stem cells so they can be seen in the blood stream within an hour of a single dosage.  Current treatment requires the donor to have growth factor injections for several days leading up to the procedure,  Dr Nilsson said.  Using the new method eliminates the need for this, meaning a procedure that once took days can be reduced to around an hour.  Until now AMD3100 has only been effective in increasing stem cell numbers when combined with the growth factor.  But the growth factor can cause unpleasant side effects like bone pain and spleen enlargement for some donors,  Dr Nilsson said.  Other donors simply don t respond well, and their stem cell count never gets high enough for a successful transplant.  The scientists found that combining the two small molecules not only eliminates the need for the growth factor, but when the harvested cells are transplanted they can replenish the entire bone marrow system, and there are no known side effects. Professor Peter Currie, ARMI Director, said a major benefit of the discovery is that harvesting stem cells will become more efficient and effective, considerably reducing the stress for donors, which in turn benefits patients.  We re looking forward to seeing patients benefit from this discovery,  Professor Currie said.","Published: March 17, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/novel-blood-test-for-alzheimers-203841,Novel Blood Test for Alzheimer s Potential pre clinical early detection test  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Today, Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed too late. In collaboration with a research team at the university and German Center for Neurogenerative Diseases (DZNE) in G ttingen, Researchers at Ruhr-Universit t Bochum (RUB) have developed a blood test that may potentially facilitate detection of Alzheimer's at an early stage. It is based on an immuno-chemical analysis using an infrared sensor. The sensor's surface is coated with highly specific antibodies which extract biomarkers for Alzheimer's from the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid, taken from the lower part of the back (lumbar liquor). The infrared sensor analyses if the biomarkers show already pathological changes, which can take place more than 15 years before any clinical symptoms appear. This method has been featured as the cover story in the internationally renowned academic journal ""Biophotonics"", and the results of the study were also published in Analytical Chemistry. In most instances, diagnosis is too late A major problem of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is the fact that, by the time the first clinical symptoms appear, massive irreversible damage to the brain has already occurred. At that point, symptomatic treatment is the only available option. ""If we wish to have a drug at our disposal that can significantly inhibit the progress of the disease, we need blood tests that detect Alzheimer's in its pre-dementia stages,"" says Prof Dr Klaus Gerwert, Head of the Department of Biophysics at RUB. ""By applying such drugs at an early stage, we could prevent dementia, or at the very least delay its onset,"" adds Prof Dr med. Jens Wiltfang, Head of the Department for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of G ttingen and Clinical Research Coordinator at DZNE G ttingen. Morbus Alzheimer's and misfolding of Amyloid beta peptide For the novel test, the secondary structure of the so-called Amyloid beta peptides serves as biomarker. This structure changes in Alzheimer's patients. In the misfolded, pathological structure, more and more Amyloid beta peptides can accumulate, gradually forming visible plaque deposits in the brain that are typical for Alzheimer's disease. This happens more than15 years before first clinical symptoms appear. The pathological beta Amyloid plaques can be temporarily detected by positron emission tomography, short: Amyloid PET; but this procedure is comparatively expensive and is accompanied by radiation exposure. Patented diagnostic method for Alzheimer's detection Together with Prof Dr med. Jens Wiltfang from G ttingen, the team headed by Prof Dr Klaus Gerwert has developed an infrared sensor for detecting misfolding of Amyloid beta peptides as part of the PhD research projects of Andreas Nabers and Jonas Schartner. The infrared sensor extracts the Amyloid beta peptide from body fluids. The method is patent pending. After initially working with cerebrospinal fluid, the researchers subsequently expanded the method towards blood analysis. ""We do not merely select one single possible folding arrangement of the peptide; rather, we detect how all existing Amyloid beta secondarystructures are distributed, in their healthy and in their pathological forms,"" says Gerwert. Precise diagnostics is not possible until the distribution of all secondary structures is evaluated. Tests that analyse Amyloid beta peptide are already available with so-called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). They identify the total concentration, percentage of forms of different length, as well as the concentration of individual conformations in body fluids; but they have not, as yet, provided information on the diagnostically relevant distribution of the secondary structures at once. ""This is why ELISA tests have not been proven very effective when applied in blood sample analysis in practice,"" explains Klaus Gerwert. First clinical trials completed Using the methods now developed in Bochum and G ttingen, the researchers have analysed samples from 141 patients. They have achieved a diagnostic precision of 84 per cent in the blood and 90 per cent in cerebrospinal fluid, compared with the clinical gold standard. The test revealed an increase of misfolded biomarkers as spectral shift of Amyloid beta band below threshold, thus diagnosing Alzheimer's. ""What's unique about it is that this is the only robust label-free test with a single threshold,"" as Andreas Nabers describes the result of his dissertation. A potential sensor for early detection As part of the published study, the researchers have tested the potential for early detection of Morbus Alzheimer's on a small group of patients. The results suggest that even in pre-dementia stages, an increased concentration of misfolded Amyloid beta peptides can be detected in body fluids. Thus, Morbus Alzheimer's may in future be diagnosable in preclinical stages. ""The sooner Alzheimer's is detected, the better the therapy chances. This sensor is an important milestone in the right direction,"" adds Prof Dr Jens Wiltfang. Currently, sample analyses for early detection in 800 study participants are being conducted, in order to optimise statistical significance.","Published: March 17, 2016"

The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, underscores the importance of human challenge studies, in which volunteers are exposed to disease-causing pathogens under carefully controlled conditions.  The findings from this trial are very encouraging to those of us who have spent many years working on vaccine candidates to protect against dengue, a disease that is a significant burden in much of the world and is now endemic in Puerto Rico,  said Stephen Whitehead, Ph.D., of NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  In fact, these results informed the recent decision by officials at Brazil s Butantan Institute to advance the TV003 vaccine into a large phase 3 efficacy trial.  Dengue fever, prevalent throughout the tropics and subtropics, is caused by any of four related dengue viruses called serotypes that are spread by Aedes mosquitoes, the same mosquitoes that spread Zika virus. Most of the estimated 390 million people who are infected with dengue virus each year develop either no symptoms or a mild illness. However, some people develop serious or life-threatening illness and large outbreaks lead millions to seek care, severely straining health care infrastructure in endemic countries. The high prevalence of natural dengue infections in endemic areas means that many people have experienced infection at some point in the past and therefore may have immunity to the infecting serotype. A high degree of partial immunity in a population can make it difficult to assess the efficacy of any candidate dengue vaccine. A model of dengue infection in humans is one way to overcome the absence of animal models and the challenge of high background immunity in endemic areas. It is important to note that human challenge studies are conducted according to strict criteria designed to provide meticulous attention to volunteer safety and challenge studies would never be used for certain deadly pathogens, such as Ebola. The experimental vaccine was developed primarily by Dr. Whitehead and his colleagues at NIAID s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases. Scientists from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research also contributed to the vaccine s development. The candidate vaccine is made from a mixture of four live, weakened (attenuated) viruses targeted to each of the four serotypes. A total of 48 healthy adult volunteers enrolled at two trial sites, the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, and were randomly assigned to receive either vaccine or placebo injection. Six months later, 41 people returned for the challenge with dengue virus. Dr. Whitehead and colleagues also developed the challenge virus used in the trial, which is a genetically modified version of a dengue-2 serotype virus isolated in the Kingdom of Tonga in 1974. The original virus was notable for causing only mild illness. In previous human challenge trials with this modified virus, Dr. Whitehead and his coinvestigators established the virus dose that would cause all recipients to develop viremia   the presence of virus in the blood   and most to develop a mild rash.  This modified dengue virus is very attractive for use as a challenge virus because we can use it to reliably induce dengue infection in a very high percentage of inoculated volunteers without causing serious illness,  said Dr. Whitehead. By inducing only rash (without fever) in the majority of recipients, the challenge virus mimics natural dengue virus infection, which often features such a rash, he noted. A human challenge model of dengue infection   rather than illness   is an important characteristic, explained Anna Durbin, M.D., who led the clinical trial at Johns Hopkins.  Because there are no specific therapies for dengue fever, it is desirable to have a challenge virus that causes infection, but does not result in significant symptoms of disease,  she said. The reliably high percentage of those who develop viremia following exposure to this challenge virus is another advantage when most or all volunteers develop viremia or other signs of infection, clinical trials can enroll relatively small numbers of people but still achieve answers to such questions as whether a candidate vaccine protects against infection, she noted. In this study, all 20 placebo recipients developed viremia, 16 (80 percent) developed mild rash and 4 (20 percent) had a temporary drop in white blood cell count following challenge with the virus. None of the 21 TV003 vaccine recipients developed viremia or any other sign of infection after challenge.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that this candidate vaccine provided complete protection in everyone who received it,  said Dr. Durbin.  The dengue-2 serotype is considered the relatively weaker component in this, and other, candidate dengue vaccines, so its ability to confer protection from a challenge with dengue-2 virus was encouraging.  Dr. Whitehead is currently developing a human challenge model using a modified dengue serotype-3 virus. This challenge virus could be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of candidate dengue vaccines or therapies. Dengue virus is in the same virus family as Zika virus, and the NIAID team is now leveraging their experience with the live-attenuated dengue vaccine in efforts to develop a Zika vaccine, Dr. Whitehead noted.

Tumor cells contain immune checkpoint molecules that make tumors nearly invisible to the immune system. Immune checkpoint blockade therapies are drugs that rev up the body s immune system to fight cancer.  When the drugs work, they work phenomenally well, providing unprecedented long-term responses. However, the therapies fail to induce responses in the majority of tumors, especially in tumors that contain few killer T cells,  said Dr. Haidong Tang, a postdoctoral researcher at UT Southwestern and lead author of the study published in Cancer Cell. T cells are central to the immune response. The first immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in September 2014 based on its remarkable effects on melanoma in clinical trials.  In patients with advanced cancer who have undergone multiple treatments, up to 10 percent have a complete response. A similar number have a partial but significant response, so the disease becomes chronic basically. It s very exciting to the field,  said senior author Dr. Yang-Xin Fu, Professor of Pathology and Immunology at UT Southwestern.  The problem is that more than two-thirds don t respond at all, therefore increasing the response rate presents an urgent challenge.  In their study, the researchers first showed that the success of the PD-L1 blockade   the scientific name for one cellular pathway targeted by immune checkpoint blockade therapy   depends on whether the patient s own T cells can infiltrate the tumor, he said. Earlier studies that analyzed patient tumor samples hinted at that possibility because they found that tumors with more T-cell infiltration responded more vigorously to checkpoint blockade treatment. However, prior to this study there was no tumor model available to test that hypothesis directly, explained Dr. Fu, who holds the Mary Nell and Ralph B. Rogers Professorship in Immunology. Using their novel mouse models of tumors with and without T-cell infiltration, the researchers demonstrated that T-cell infiltration indeed is required for this immunotherapy to work: Tumors that contained few active T cells failed to respond to immune checkpoint blockade while tumors containing large numbers of active killer T cells responded well. Then the research team treated highly responsive, T-cell-rich tumor models with a chemical that blocks T-cell infiltration into tumor tissues. Checkpoint blockade therapy quit working, validating their hypothesis, the researchers report. To address the problem of how to get more T cells into tumors, the researchers used a T-cell recruiting protein called LIGHT fused to an antibody that recognizes a molecule on the surface of cancer cells. The researchers developed the fusion protein when the laboratory was at the University of Chicago s Pritzker School of Medicine. Experiments indicated that the antibody-LIGHT molecule caused cell signaling, which led to production of chemicals (chemokines) that sounded an alarm and recruited T cells to the tumors. This action overcame tumor resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy and killed tumor cells.  The antibody guides LIGHT to find and target the tumor so the killer T cells can work to reject it,  Dr. Fu said. Using antibody-LIGHT and immune checkpoint blockade therapy together provided a one-two punch to fight tumor cells.  Our study indicates a strategy   antibody-guided LIGHT   with the potential to increase the response rate to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and provides a model in which to test this approach,  said Dr. Fu, also a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. The next step will be working to make the team s molecule even stronger, researchers said. Yang Wang, a research scientist in Pathology at UT Southwestern, assisted in the study. Also contributing to the study were researchers at the University of Chicago; the Institute of Biophysics at the Chinese Academy of Science Key Laboratory for Infection and Immunity, and Alphamab Co., both in China; and AbbVie Biotherapeutics of Redwood City, California.

Among them, hematite, magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles have particularly promising properties for biomedical applications. Researchers in China and Korea reviewed recent studies on the preparation, structure and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and their corresponding applications. The review, published in the journal Science and Technology of Advanced Materials, emphasized that the size, size distribution (the relative proportions of different-sized particles in a given sample), shape and magnetic properties of IONPs affect the location and mobility of IONPs in the human body. However, having complete control over the shape and size distribution of magnetic IONPs remains a challenge. For example, magnetic IONPs are promising for carrying cancer drugs that target specific tissues. For this to happen, they are coated with a biocompatible shell that carries a specific drug. If this ""functionalized"" magnetic IONP is too large, it may be cleared from the blood stream. Thus, it is very important to be able to control the size of these particles. Researchers found that IONPs with diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nanometres are optimal for intravenous injection and can remain in the blood stream for the longest period of time. The surface charge of IONPs is also important for their stability and how they interact with tissues. For example, breast cells uptake positively charged IONPs better than negatively charged ones. At the same time, positively charged IONPs are more rapidly cleared from the circulation. Negatively charged and neutral IONPs tend to remain longer in the circulation. The surface charge of IONPs can be controlled by using an appropriately charged functionalized material as a shell. Other applications that can benefit from improving the functionality of magnetic IONPs include magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic hyperthermia and thermoablation (killing selected cancer cells with heat), and biosensing (detecting molecular interactions for disease diagnosis). Further research is needed to evaluate the toxicity of both bare and functionalized IONPs. The team's next focus will be on fabricating recyclable magnetic IONP catalysts and designing multifunctional biomedical applications, involving magnetic IONPs, that can play a dual role in diagnosing and treating disease, says Professor Wei Wu from China's Wuhan University.","Published: March 17, 2016"

The rescue of memories, which changed both the structure of neurons as well as the behavior of mice, was achieved using optogenetics, a method for manipulating genetically tagged cells with precise bursts of light. This finding suggests that impaired retrieval of memories, rather than poor storage or encoding, may underlie this prominent symptom of early Alzheimer's disease and points to the synaptic connectivity between memory cells as being crucial for retrieval. See Also: When memories age: Neuroscientists follow the trace of memory Loss of long-term memory for specific learned experiences is a hallmark of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is also exhibited by mice genetically engineered to develop AD-like symptoms. Building on their previous work that identified and activated memory cells, a group led by RIKEN Brain Science Institute and RIKEN-MIT Center Director Susumu Tonegawa has now shown that spines (small knobs on brain-cell dendrites through which synaptic connections are formed) are essential for memory retrieval in these AD mice. Moreover, fiber-optic light stimulation can re-grow lost spines and help mice remember a previous experience. The work is published in Nature. A single memory engram cell in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region of a mouse model of early Alzheimer's disease. To optically manipulate specific connections to these engram cells, a blue light-sensitive protein oChIEF was expressed in an upstream brain region, i.e., medial entorhinal cortical inputs (red) to the DG. The majority of DG granule cells were not active during engram labeling (blue, non-engram cells). Credit: RIKEN  Mouse memory is often inferred from learned behavior, in this case associating an unpleasant footshock with a particular cage. Remembering and expecting shocks causes mice to freeze in this enclosure but not in a neutral one. Compared with normal mice, AD mice exhibited amnesia and reduced freezing behavior, indicating progressive memory loss. The engrams, or memory traces, of this particular experience are known to be located in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a key brain area for memory processing. During fear conditioning, researchers used a virus to deliver a gene into the dentate gyrus, which labeled active engram cells. This allowed researchers to visually identify the neurons that made up the engram for that specific fear memory. A second virus contained a gene making only these engram neurons sensitive to light. When the engram cells were reactivated with light in the AD mice, memory of the footshock experience became retrievable and freezing behavior was restored. Memories restored with this method faded away within a day, and the researchers next sought to understand why this happens. They noted a reduction in the number of spines as the mice aged and their Alzheimer's disease progressed. Their waning memory for the fear training was also linked to a loss of these spines. Previous work had shown that spines grow when neurons undergo long-term potentiation, a persistent strengthening of synaptic connectivity that happens naturally in the brain but can also be artificially induced through stimulation. Learn More: Working memory: underlying processes are more complex than we thought Through repeated stimulation with high-frequency bursts of light to the hippocampal memory circuit in AD mice, the team was able to boost the number of spines to levels indistinguishable from those in control mice. The freezing behavior in the trained task also returned and remained for up to six days. The implication is that restoring lost spines in the hippocampal circuit facilitated retrieval of the specific fear experience and its associated freezing behavior. ""We have shown for the first time that increasing synaptic connectivity within engram cell circuits can be used to treat memory loss in mouse models of early Alzheimer's disease,"" says lead author Dheeraj Roy.

Credit: RIKEN  Light stimulation did not boost the number of spines in normal mice or strengthen the fear memory, nor did indiscriminately shining light in the dentate gyrus result in any long-term memory improvement. Only the precise stimulation of engram cells was able to increase the number of spines and bring about the memory improvement in AD mice. ""The successful retrieval of memories in AD mice by increasing the number of spines for normal memory processing only in the memory cells, rather than in a broad population of cells, highlights the importance of highly-targeted manipulation of neurons and their circuits for future therapies.

When we remember events which occurred recently, the hippocampus is activated. This area in the temporal lobe of the brain is a hub for learning and memory. But what happens, if we try to remember things that took place years or decades ago? Neuroscientists at the Ruhr-University Bochum and the Osaka University have been able to give some answers to this question. They reveal that the neural networks involved in retrieving very old memories are quite distinct from those used to remember recent events. The results of the study have now been published in the journal eLife. See Also: Electric current to brain boosts memory Neuroscientists agree that the hippocampus, which contains the cornu ammonis regions 1 and 3 (CA1 and CA3), plays a major role in retrieving recent memories. However, a major controversy in memory research resides on whether the hippocampus is also engaged when experiences date back half a life-time or whether this is the role of the parahippocampal region of the brain: the cortical areas directly adjacent to the hippocampus. Prof. Dr. Magdalena Sauvage and her team of neuroscientists have monitored brain activity in mice during the retrieval of memories that are one day to one year old   e.g. up to the mouse-equivalent of 40 human years. For their study they applied a high-resolution molecular imaging technique, which detects the expression of a particular gene tied to plasticity processes and this way sheds light on cognitive processes. Learn More: Impact of traumatic brain injury on long-term memory explored  For the very first time we were able to show that the retrieval of old and recent memories are supported by distinct brain networks , Prof. Dr. Magdalena Sauvage reports. The CA3 region, believed to be the place of memory storage in the hippocampus, no longer plays a role when we remember very old memories. Rather, the involvement of the CA1 region persists and the cortical areas adjacent to the hippocampus become involved. The reason for the differential involvement of the hippocampal subregions could lie in the mechanisms supported by CA3, explains Prof. Sauvage:  In CA3, memories can be retrieved on the basis of single features of an original memory, which are used as cues. Since the memory for single features degrades over time, we speculate that they might ultimately be of no more use as cues, hence retrieving memory would then essentially rely on CA1 and other processes taking place in the parahippocampal region of the brain .

In a new study, researchers looked to the fish s retinal structure to inform the design of a contact lens that can adjust its focus. Imagine a contact lens that autofocuses within milliseconds. That could be life-changing for people with presbyopia, a stiffening of the eye s lens that makes it difficult to focus on close objects. Presbyopia affects more than 1 billion people worldwide, half of whom do not have adequate correction, said the project s leader, Hongrui Jiang, Ph.D., of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. And while glasses, conventional contact lenses and surgery provide some improvement, these options all involve the loss of contrast and sensitivity, as well as difficulty with night vision. Jiang s idea is to design contacts that continuously adjust in concert with one s own cornea and lens to recapture a person s youthful vision. The project, for which Jiang received a 2011 NIH Director s New Innovator Award (an initiative of the NIH Common Fund) funded by the National Eye Institute, requires overcoming several engineering challenges. They include designing the lens, algorithm-driven sensors, and miniature electronic circuits that adjust the shape of the lens, plus creating a power source   all embedded within a soft, flexible material that fits over the eye. In their latest study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Jiang and his team focused on a design for the image sensors.  The sensors must be extremely small and capable of acquiring images under low-light conditions, so they need to be exquisitely sensitive to light,  Jiang said. The team took their inspiration from the elephant nose fish s retina, which has a series of deep cup-like structures with reflective sidewalls. That design helps gather light and intensify the particular wavelengths needed for the fish to see. Borrowing from nature, the researchers created a device that contains thousands of very small light collectors. These light collectors are finger-like glass protrusions, the inside of which are deep cups coated with reflective aluminum. The incoming light hits the fingers and then is focused by the reflective sidewalls. Jiang and his team tested this device s ability to enhance images captured by a mechanical eye model designed in a lab. In separate studies, the researchers have designed and tested a couple of different approaches for the contact lens material. For one approach, they formed a liquid lens from a droplet of silicone oil and water, which won t mix. The droplet sits in a chamber atop a flexible platform, while a pair of electrodes produces an electric field that modifies the surface tension of each liquid differently, resulting in forces that squeeze the droplet into different focal lengths. The lens is able to focus on objects as small as 20 micrometers, roughly the width of the thinnest human hair. They developed another type of lens inspired by the compound eyes of insects and other arthropods. Insect eyes comprise thousands of individual microlenses that each point in different directions to capture a specific part of a scene. Jiang and his colleagues developed a flexible array of artificial microlenses.  Each microlense is made out of a forest of silicon nanowires,  Jiang explained. Together, the microlenses provide even greater resolution than the liquid lens. The array s flexibility makes it suitable not only for contact lenses, but for other potential uses. Wrap it around a laparoscopic surgical scope and you ve got a high-resolution, 360-degree view inside a patient s body. Mount it on a lamppost and you can see the surrounding intersection from all sides. In order to change focus, the contact lens will also need to be equipped with an extremely small, thin power source. Jiang s working solution: a solar cell that simultaneously harvests electrons from sunlight, converting them into electricity, and that also stores energy within a network of nanostructures. It works much the way a conventional solar panel does, but the addition of storage capability within a single device is novel, Jiang said. The device still needs tweaking, but the team is optimistic that it will be powerful enough to drive the lens yet small enough to fit the space available. A prototype for clinical testing may still be five to 10 years off, Jiang said. Once it s available, however, it may not cost much more than conventional contact lenses.  There s a huge market for this and with mass production, the cost is not likely to be a barrier,  he said. The research was supported in part by NIH grant DP2OD008678 to Jiang s lab.","Published: March 16, 2016"

The team discovered that what have historically been considered three major types of kidney cancer according to their characteristics under the microscope, could be further distinguished into nine major subtypes through molecular analyses. Each subtype was unique in terms of altered molecular pathways and patient survival.  Creighton and colleagues' findings are important because they help pave the way toward more effective personalized medicine. Each kidney cancer has unique characteristics. As a result, different cancers may respond differently to the same treatment. Understanding what makes each kidney cancer unique can provide clues to finding targets for effective therapies. The nine subtypes discovered by Creighton and colleagues were found to have therapeutic implications. ""Different types of cancer can show different pathways being dysregulated,"" said Creighton. ""And for some of the pathways we have therapies we can use to target them."" In particular, the researchers found that a pathway called immune checkpoint was most active in a subtype of clear cell kidney cancer that is typically very aggressive. The immune checkpoint pathway can potentially be a target for specific therapies. ""Not all patients have this pathway activated but molecular analysis would allow us to identify those patients that represent the best candidates for receiving therapies that target that pathway specifically,"" Creighton said.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (collectively, Roche) for the discovery, development and commercialization of up to five small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy. Under the terms of the agreement, Blueprint Medicines will receive an upfront cash payment of $45 million and will be eligible to receive up to an additional approximately $965 million in contingent option fees and milestone payments related to specified research, preclinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestones across all five potential programs. Of the total contingent payments, up to approximately $215 million are for option fees and milestone payments for research, preclinical and clinical development events prior to licensing across all five potential programs. In addition, the agreement provides for specified royalties and cost sharing, which are described in more detail below. Immunokinases are intracellular targets known to regulate numerous aspects of immune response and represent an important opportunity for potentially innovative approaches to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and eradicate tumor cells. To date, cancer immunotherapies have demonstrated important clinical benefits. However, most cancer immunotherapies have focused on antibodies or combinations with existing approved therapies and have not yet targeted immunokinases with small molecules. This collaboration seeks to develop new mechanisms of modulating the tumor immune response by targeting immunokinases with the goal of enhancing response rates and broadening the utility of using cancer immunotherapies to treat additional cancer types. ""We believe Blueprint Medicines' proprietary drug discovery platform and expertise in immunokinases, combined with our proven ability to move quickly through drug discovery, is a perfect complement to Roche's expertise with cancer immunotherapy biology and in developing and commercializing innovative therapies,"" said Jeff Albers, Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines.

Co-senior author Professor Matthew Brown, from QUT s Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, said they investigated ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn s Disease and ulcerative colitis (collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease), psoriasis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.  These diseases affect about three per cent of the world s population, and commonly occur together in families and in individuals. The big question has been whether this is due to shared environmental risk factors, or due to shared genes and now we believe we have the answer,  Professor Brown said.  The research has conclusively demonstrated these conditions occur together mostly because they share similar genetic backgrounds.  Studying nearly 86,000 subjects from 26 countries, our researchers identified 244 genetic variants which control whether or not people develop these conditions, a large proportion of which were completely new findings.  They found that for nearly all of these diseases the reason they frequently occur together in individuals is due to the different diseases sharing genetic risk factors, rather than one disease causing the other.  For some diseases such as the common form of spinal arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, the study roughly trebled the number of genes known to be involved.  Professor Brown said the new gene discoveries pointed to some potential new therapies, including agents already in use for other diseases which can now be trialled in these conditions very promptly.  The discoveries have shed new light onto the causes of these diseases, such as identifying genetic risk variants which most likely work by affecting the bacteria present in the gut, in turn causing inflammation in joints, the liver or the gut itself,  Professor Brown said.  These study findings are a major leap forward in our understanding of these common but difficult-to-treat diseases.  It has been known for over 50 years these conditions frequently occur together in individuals and families. We now know this is mainly because the genes involved affect the risk of many diseases, and that the diseases are therefore very similar in their underlying causes, even if they present in such different ways.  This research has pointed us to several different potential therapeutic targets for these diseases, for which there is a huge global need for better therapies. ","Published: March 16, 2016"

""Both the immune system and nearby healthy cells send signals instructing damaged and unhealthy cells to undergo apoptosis, which is like programmed 'cell suicide'. But cancer cells have developed a wide range of strategies to ignore these instructions,"" says Professor Richard Morgan, from the University of Bradford's Institute of Cancer Therapeutics, who developed the drug and who led the research. ""There's a range of drugs which try to force apoptosis in different cancers, but this is the first one to work in mesothelioma."" Mesothelioma is a cancer of the lining of the lung. It's almost invariably caused by exposure to asbestos and is resistant to all current chemotherapies. Its prognosis is dismal, with those diagnosed usually given a year to live at most. A study by the universities of Bradford and Surrey found that after three weeks' treatment with HXR9, human mesothelioma tumours in mice stopped growing, with a complete loss of tumour blood vessels and widespread cancer cell death.  HXR9 targets the HOX gene family, which includes 39 fairly similar genes that help enable the remarkably rapid cell division in growing embryos. Many of these genes are usually switched off in adults, but previous research has shown that in many cancers - including prostate, ovarian, and brain cancer, melanoma, and leukaemia - HOX genes are switched back on, helping the cancer cells to proliferate and survive. ""We've effectively knocked out a key defence mechanism in this cancer through targeting the HOX genes,"" says Professor Morgan. A further key finding reported in the study, funded by the British Lung Foundation, was that mesothelioma has a very strong association with one of the HOX genes in particular - known as HOXB4. ""We examined the amount of HOXB4 protein in tumours of 21 mesothelioma patients and compared it with their length of survival. There was a clear link: the more HOXB4 we found, the shorter time the patient survived, so we may also have found a way to predict which patients have the most aggressive form of this cancer,"" says Professor Morgan. Because of greater awareness of the danger of asbestos in the West, the future incidence of mesothelioma is expected to decline. However, in Africa and some parts of Asia, asbestos is still commonly used in industries such as construction and ship building, and few precautions are taken when demolishing buildings that contain asbestos. ""Mesothelioma may become much less of a problem in the West, but it's still going to be a significant public health problem in many parts of the world. We already know that it's resistant to available drugs, which is why we need entirely new treatments,"" says Professor Morgan. Ian Jarrold, Head of Research at British Lung Foundation said: ""Although still early days, this study is a significant step forward in that it is the first time a drug has been observed causing so-called 'cell suicide' in mesothelioma. ""People living with mesothelioma often tell us that among their first reactions to diagnosis is despair at the lack of treatment available. We hope that the progress being made in research we fund will soon provide new treatments and new hope for patients.""","Published: March 16, 2016"

It is well known, for example, that grapefruit has an adverse effect on a number of anti-arrhythmic and cholesterol-lowering drugs: it contains ingredients that inhibit an endogenous enzyme responsible for the degradation of certain medications in the liver. Consumption of grapefruit thus increases the side-effects associated with these drugs. Until now, only a few examples existed of food ingredients that influence the efficacy of the drug to the benefit of the patient through nutrition. Scientists from ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich have recently discovered a new example of such a correlation. Higher concentration of enzymes The researchers struck gold when they investigated the effects of sulforaphane on human intestinal cells. Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring ingredient in a number of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli. The scientists, led by Shana Sturla, Professor at the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich, treated various types of colon cancer cells and intestinal cells from healthy subjects with this substance in the laboratory. The concentration used was approximately equivalent to that which reaches the intestines after consuming a meal with broccoli, and importantly, at a dose that did not itself act in killing the cells. The researchers discovered that sulforaphane increases the concentration of a number of enzymes in the colon cancer cells, including those of an enzyme with the abbreviation AKR1C3. Interestingly, sulforaphane does not have this effect in all cases: in colon cancer cells that already exhibit a significantly elevated concentration of AKR1C3 as a result of the cancer, the broccoli substance caused a further increase in the concentration of the enzyme. But sulforaphane had no influence in colon cancer cells with an initially very low concentration of AKR1C3. The same was found with intestinal cells unaffected by cancer. Drug dose can be reduced The enzyme AKR1C3 is a biochemical actor in several metabolic pathways in the human body. It is also central in the efficacy of a cancer drug that is currently still in development and clinical testing. This drug, called PR-104A, is administered in an inactive form and is converted into its active form inside the cancer cells by the AKR1C3 present there. The researchers therefore used cell culture to investigate whether the broccoli ingredient increased the efficacy of PR-104A. Their hypothesis was confirmed: when the scientists pre-treated the colon cancer cells with sulforaphane, less than a third of the usual dose of PR-104A was enough to kill the cancer cells. ""Since cancer drugs generally have strong side-effects, any approach that reduces the dose of medication while maintaining efficacy is always welcome,"" says Sturla. Non-toxic and without side-effects ""What's interesting with sulforaphane is that it occurs naturally in our food and is non-toxic in the concentrations we used,"" says the ETH professor. ""In addition, the sulforaphane-enhancing effect was seen only in cancer cells and not cells from healthy tissue, which would be very important for avoiding unwanted side-effects from the combination"". Based on these results in cell cultures, the scientists aim to conduct biomarker-based clinical studies with cancer patients to investigate whether sulforaphane positively supports a treatment with PR-104A. The researchers also want to find further food ingredients that positively influence the efficacy of medication, even in small amounts, as well as accompanying biomarkers that can help track personalized responses. ""We assume that there are other such combinations out there,"" says Sturla. The expertise they have built up will benefit them in this further research. In this project, which was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation with funding for interdisciplinary research, the scientists investigated the influence of sulforaphane on intestinal cells at different levels: at the genetic level, that of proteins and enzyme activity, and the functional effect on cells. In addition to scientists from Sturla's group (toxicology), ETH Zurich scientists from the groups of Professor Bernd Wollscheid (biomedical proteomics) and Professor Niko Beerenwinkel (computational biology) closely collaborated, as well as Giancarlo Marra (molecular cancer research) from the University of Zurich.","Published: March 16, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/transforming-breast-cancer-treatment-212278,Transforming Breast Cancer Treatment Landmark preclinical study cured lung metastases in    percent of breast cancers by making nanoparticles inside the tumor  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A team of investigators from Houston Methodist Research Institute may have transformed the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer by creating the first drug to successfully eliminate lung metastases in mice. The majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases to the lung and liver, yet there is no cure. Existing cancer drugs provide limited benefit due to their inability to overcome biological barriers in the body and reach the cancer cells in sufficient concentrations. Houston Methodist nanotechnology and cancer researchers have solved this problem by developing a drug that generates nanoparticles inside the lung metastases in mice. In this study, 50 percent of the mice treated with the drug had no trace of metastatic disease after eight months. That s equivalent to about 24 years of long-term survival following metastatic disease for humans.  Due to the body s own defense mechanisms, most cancer drugs are absorbed into healthy tissue causing negative side effects, and only a fraction of the administered drug actually reaches the tumor, making it less effective, said Mauro Ferrari, Ph.D, president and CEO of the Houston Methodist Research Institute. This new treatment strategy enables sequential passage of the biological barriers to transport the killing agent into the heart of the cancer. The active drug is only released inside the nucleus of the metastatic disease cell, avoiding the multidrug resistance mechanism of the cancer cells. This strategy effectively kills the tumor and provides significant therapeutic benefit in all mice, including long-term survival in half of the animals.  This finding comes 20 years after Ferrari started his work in nanomedicine. Ferrari and Haifa Shen, M.D., Ph.D., are co-senior authors on the paper, which describes the action of the injectable nanoparticle generator (iNPG), and how a complex method of transporting a nano-version of a standard chemotherapy drug led to never before seen results in mice models with triple negative breast cancer that had metastasized to the lungs.  This may sound like science fiction, like we ve penetrated and destroyed the Death Star, but what we discovered is transformational. We invented a method that actually makes the nanoparticles inside the cancer and releases the drug particles at the site of the cellular nucleus. With this injectable nanoparticle generator, we were able to do what standard chemotherapy drugs, vaccines, radiation, and other nanoparticles have all failed to do,  said Ferrari.  Houston Methodist has developed good manufacturing practices (GMP) for this drug and plans to fast-track the research to obtain FDA-approval and begin safety and efficacy studies in humans in 2017.  I would never want to overpromise to the thousands of cancer patients looking for a cure, but the data is astounding,  said Ferrari, senior associate dean and professor of medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine.  We re talking about changing the landscape of curing metastatic disease, so it s no longer a death sentence.  The Houston Methodist team used doxorubicin, a cancer therapeutic that has been used for decades but has adverse side effects to the heart and is not an effective treatment against metastatic disease. In this study, doxorubicin was packaged within the injectable nanoparticle generator that is made up of many components.   Shen, a senior member of the department of nanomedicine at Houston Methodist Research Institute, explains that each component has a specific and essential role in the drug delivery process. The first component is the nanoporous silicon material that naturally degrades in the body. The second component is a polymer made up of multiple strands that contain doxorubicin. Once inside the tumor, the silicon material degrades, releasing the strands. Due to natural thermodynamic forces, these strands curl-up to form nanoparticles that are taken up by the cancer cells. Once inside the cancer cells, the acidic pH close to the nucleus causes the drug to be released from the nanoparticles. Inside the nucleus, the active drug acts to kill the cell.   If this research bears out in humans and we see even a fraction of this survival time, we are still talking about dramatically extending life for many years. That s essentially providing a cure in a patient population that is now being told there is none,  said Ferrari, who holds the Ernest Cockrell Jr. Presidential Distinguished Chair and is considered one of the founders of nanomedicine and oncophysics (physics of mass transport within a cancer lesion).  The Houston Methodist team is hopeful that this new drug could help cancer physicians cure lung metastases from other origins, and possibly primary lung cancers as well.","Published: March 16, 2016"

They found that the cancer cells used a molecular switch to temporarily rewire themselves to become more able to withstand the drugs in the first two weeks of treatment, and then went on to develop permanent resistance through genetic changes. The HIV drug, called nelfinavir, works by blocking the molecular switch which boosts cells' ability to survive treatment. The research, carried out in mice, suggests that nelfinavir could be used in combination with standard skin cancer treatments to make them more potent and delay drug resistance, making available treatments effective for a longer period of time. Professor Claudia Wellbrock, lead author from The University of Manchester, said: ""In the first few weeks of standard treatment for skin cancer, the cancer cells become stronger and more robust against treatment. ""But if we can target skin cancer cells before they become fully resistant, we would have a much better chance of blocking their escape. And we think this research has brought us one step closer to making this a reality."" Professor Nic Jones, Director of Cancer Research UK's Manchester Cancer Research Centre, said: ""Melanoma can be difficult to treat because the cancer becomes resistant to drugs quite quickly. But this exciting research means we might be able to fight back by blocking the first steps towards resistance, so that treatments are effective for longer. ""While drug resistance is a big challenge, we're making great progress. Drug resistance in late stage skin cancer is still a big problem and something we need to tackle.

Previous work has shown that central insulin action suppresses glucose production in the liver by increasing levels of the ligand interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the liver. The ligand activates the transcription factor STAT3, which in turn suppresses gene expression of glucose-producing enzymes. However, how the liver communicates with central nervous system and the vagus nerve, which controls unconscious processes like digestion, has so far not been understood. Now a collaboration of researchers in Japan led by Hiroshi Inoue at Kanazawa University s Institute for Frontier Science Initiative (InFiniti) has identified the molecular mechanism for this communication. Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter in the vagus nerve. It also suppresses IL-6 via the  7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The researchers administered insulin and monitored subsequent vagal nerve activity, as well as IL-6 levels in a type of white blood cell in the liver known as  Kupffer cells . They noticed a decrease in vagal nerve activity accompanied by increases in IL-6 in the Kupffer cells, resulting in decreased glucose production. The researchers then investigated the effects of administering methyllycaconitine, which prevents  7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity, as well as removal of the vagal nerve. They found that while STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-6 expression in the liver increased only slightly the IL-6/STAT3 signalling response to administered insulin was lost. The researchers compared the response in lean and obese mice and found that the administered insulin  failed to elicit changes in vagus nerve activity of high-fat diet-induced obese mice.  They conclude,  These findings suggest that the aberrant regulation of Kupffer cells via the vagus nerve and  7-nAchR-mediated cholinergic action by central insulin action may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatic inflammation in obesity and of dysregulation of hepatic glucose production.

The discovery, detailed in a study published online in The Journal of Experimental Medicine, could lead to new therapeutic interventions that provide some protection from the disease, which is the No. 1 cause of death in America.  We ve pinpointed a defect in glucose metabolism by a class of arterial-plaque-associated immune cells as a key factor driving those cells into a hyper-inflammatory state,  said Cornelia Weyand, MD, professor and chief of immunology and rheumatology, who is the study s senior author. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Tsuyoshi Shirai, MD, PhD. Blocking that glucose overconsumption or, for that matter, a couple of other downstream links in the chain of ensuing biochemical events prevented this hyper-inflammatory activation, the researchers discovered. The findings support a growing recognition that it s not just arterial deposition of fatty materials called lipids that causes coronary heart disease, but also underlying chronic inflammation.  It s been unclear where the inflammation comes from,  Weyand said. Coronary artery disease, which accounts for nearly half of all deaths in the United States, arises when blood flow through the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart is impaired. The underlying process   the buildup of plaque inside the arteries   is called atherosclerosis.  Most of us develop arterial plaque over the course of our lifetimes,  Weyand said. Plaque accumulation can begin early in life, with deposits sometimes evident in individuals as young as 15 to 20 years old, and progresses steadily with advancing age. When these deposits become severe enough, they can restrict blood flow. It used to be thought that this occlusion triggered heart attacks. But a puzzle remained: If this process is so gradual, why are heart attacks so sudden? While lipids are a prime constituent of arterial plaque, it s now understood that plaque also contains immune cells   chiefly, a type called macrophages. These cells wear many hats. They attack and ingest invading bacteria, repair tissue, clean up debris left behind after injury or infection, and more.  We can t live without them,  said Weyand. Macrophages generally fall into two broad categories: The kinder, gentler ones   so-called M2 macrophages   are like construction engineers, nibbling cellular debris, releasing factors that encourage new cell growth and stimulate blood flow, and otherwise overseeing tissue repair. So-called M1 macrophages, on the other hand, are inflammatory: As hard-boiled as traffic cops who ve heard every excuse, they blow the whistle on pathogens, recruiting other types of immune cells to the scene. In addition, they attack the invaders themselves by spitting out nasty little clouds of biohazardous chemicals called free radicals. And they squirt out proteins that act both locally and systemically to ramp up the entire immune system to high-alert status.  Some believe that coronary artery disease patients  macrophages are so preoccupied with their inflammatory power trip they neglect their clean-up tasks,  allowing plaque to continue building up in arteries, Weyand said. In any case, the unremitting inflammation renders the plaques increasingly brittle, sometimes culminating in a piece of plaque suddenly breaking off and wounding the artery wall. The ensuing speedy formation of a clot can trigger a heart attack. The presence of even mildly elevated levels of systemic inflammation can be revealed in laboratory blood tests, such as the one for C-reactive protein, or CRP, now routine in checking cardiovascular health. Statin drugs, which substantially slow the progression of coronary artery disease and prevent heart attacks, are now understood to work not just by lowering lipid levels but also by reducing systemic inflammation. That s why statins reduce heart-related problems among patients who have normal blood-lipid levels but high blood levels of CRP. The CRP test, in turn, is a good proxy for another protein with a starring role in driving inflammation throughout the body: an immune-signaling protein known as interleukin-6. The body s premier producers of IL-6 are M1 macrophages. Macrophages begin life as cells called monocytes that are born in the body s bone marrow. Released into the circulation, monocytes travel through the bloodstream until, responding to chemical  danger signals  that indicate possible injury or infection, they slip into a tissue, take up residence and differentiate into macrophages. Weyand and her associates commenced their study by comparing monocytes harvested from the blood of 140 patients with coronary artery disease, each of whom had experienced at least one heart attack, with those from 105 healthy, demographically matched control subjects. The blood was obtained by study co-authors John Giacomini, MD, chief of cardiology at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System and professor of medicine at Stanford, and assistant professor of medicine Themistocles Assimes, MD, PhD. The scientists cultured the monocytes and used standard laboratory methods to differentiate them into macrophages. They observed that the monocytes from patients with coronary artery disease had a pronounced predisposition to develop into inflammatory, IL-6-producing M1 macrophages.  We also found that macrophages from people with Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia or hypertension   each of these a known risk factor for coronary artery disease   were making more IL-6,  said Weyand. The greater the number of these risk factors they had, the more IL-6 their macrophages made, she said.  Even before taking up residence in arterial plaque and becoming full-fledged macrophages, these patients  monocytes were already leaning toward becoming inflammatory,  Weyand said.  If you simply overfeed normal monocytes or macrophages, they don't turn into high IL-6 producers. We wondered why.  In a series of follow-up experiments, she and her colleagues discovered the reason. First, they noticed that levels of free radicals inside patient-derived macrophages were double those of macrophages derived from healthy subjects. They traced these free radicals  production to compartments within the patients  macrophages known as mitochondria, which abound in all living cells and serve as their powerhouses, supplying energy by burning sugars and fatty acids.  This is no easy task,  Weyand said.  In doing so, the mitochondria inevitably wind up generating free radicals. The harder they work, the more free radicals they produce.  When Weyand and her associates used a drug to mop up free radicals in the mitochondria of patient-derived macrophages, their IL-6 production   a major feature of their inflammatory prowess   dropped off considerably. Blocking glucose metabolism within the mitochondria had the same effect.  Something in there is leading to excessive IL-6 production,  said Weyand.  That something is our old friend sugar.  The researchers pinned the excessive free-radical production in the mitochondria of patient-derived macrophages to excessive uptake of glucose by those cells, attributable to a faulty overproduction of proteins responsible for importing glucose into cells.  The primary problem, we learned, is that these macrophages take up glucose at a higher rate than normal cells do,  said Weyand.  That causes them to break it down faster, overheating their mitochondria, which then produce too many free radicals.  One of the most surprising findings was the discovery that those high levels of free radicals were inducing a change in the status of PKM2, an enzyme that normally busies itself by helping to generate energy from the breakdown of glucose. Under the free-radicals  influence, the scientists learned, PKM2 blows off its day job and instead heads into the cell nucleus, where it activates a protein called STAT3 that proceeds to substantially boost the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. The good news, Weyand said, is that several interventions   blocking glucose uptake, sponging up free radicals and preventing PKM2 s status change   reduce the macrophages  excess inflammatory activity. This could lead to new therapeutic approaches, she said. The team s work is an example of Stanford Medicine s focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.

The human skin is constantly exposed to various pollutants, UV rays, radiation and other stressors that exist in our day-to-day environment. When they filter into the body they can create Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)   oxygen molecules known as Free Radicals, which are able to damage and destroy cells, including lipids, proteins and DNA. In the skin - the largest organ of the body   an excess of ROS can lead to various skin conditions, including inflammatory diseases, pigmenting disorders, wrinkles and some types of skin cancer, and can also affect internal organs. This damage is known as Oxidative Stress. The body is naturally equipped with defense mechanisms to counter oxidative stress. It has anti-oxidants and, more importantly, anti-oxidant enzymes that attack the ROS before they cause damage. In a review article published in the journal Cosmetics, a PhD student from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working in collaboration with researchers at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, suggested an innovative way to invigorate the body to produce antioxidant enzymes, while maintaining skin cell redox balance   a gentle equilibrium between Reactive Oxygen Species and their detoxification. ""The approach of using the body's own defense system is very effective. We showed that activation of the body's defense system with the aid of a unique delivery system is feasible, and may leverage dermal cure,"" said Hebrew University researcher Maya Ben-Yehuda Greenwald. Ben-Yehuda Greenwald showed that applying nano-size droplets of microemulsion liquids containing a cellular protective pathway inducer into the skin activates the natural skin defense systems. ""Currently, there are many scientific studies supporting the activation of the body's defense mechanisms. However, none of these studies has demonstrated the use of a nanotechnology-based delivery system to do so,"" Ben-Yehuda Greenwald said. Production of antioxidant enzymes in the body is signaled in the DNA by activation of Nrf2   a powerful protein that exists in every cell in our body. This Nrf2 cellular-protective signaling pathway is a major intersection of many other signaling pathways affecting each other and determining cell functionality and fate. Nrf2 is capable of coordinating the cellular response to internal as well as external stressors by tight regulation of phase-II protective enzymes, such as the antioxidant enzymes. Ben-Yehuda Greenwald has also discovered a new family of compounds capable of activating the Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, by incorporating them into the unique delivery system she has developed, she managed to efficiently stimulate the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and mimic the activity of the body's' natural way of coping with a variety of stress conditions. ""The formula we have created could be used in topical medication for treating skin conditions. Our formula could be used both as preventive means and for treatment of various skin conditions, such as infections, over-exposure to UV irradiation, inflammatory conditions, and also internal disease,"" she said. While the researchers focused on the skin, the formulation could prove to be effective in enhancing the body's natural protection against the damaging effects of ROS in other parts of the body, such as inflammation in cardiovascular diseases, heart attack, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's. Ben-Yehuda Greenwald integrated several fields of research into her work and was guided by experts in their fields - Prof. Roni Kohen, the Director of the School of Pharmacy, The Institute of Drug Research in the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine; Prof. Shmuel Ben-Sasson from the Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research at The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada in the Hebrew University s Faculty of Medicine; and Prof. Havazelet Bianco-Peled from the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.

This spread, known as metastasis, is responsible for 90 percent of cancer deaths. Studying mice, the researchers found that cancer cells with a particular version of the Mena protein, called MenaINV (invasive), are able to remodel their environment to make it easier for them to migrate into blood vessels and spread through the body. They also showed that high levels of this protein are correlated with metastasis and earlier deaths among breast cancer patients. Finding a way to block this protein could help to prevent metastasis, says Frank Gertler, an MIT professor of biology and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.  That s something that I think would be very promising, because we know that when we genetically remove MenaINV, the tumors become nonmetastatic,  says Gertler, who is the senior author of a paper describing the findings in the journal Cancer Discovery. Madeleine Oudin, a postdoc at the Koch Institute, is the paper s lead author.On the moveFor cancer cells to metastasize, they must first become mobile and then crawl through the surrounding tissue to reach a blood vessel. In the new study, the MIT team found that cancer cells follow the trail of fibronectin, a protein that is part of the  extracellular matrix  that provides support for surrounding cells. Fibronectin is found in particularly high concentrations around the edges of tumors and near blood vessels. Cancer cells within a tumor environment are constantly faced with differences in fibronectin concentrations, and they need to be able to move from low to high concentrations to reach the blood vessels,  Oudin says. MenaINV, an alternative form of the normal Mena protein, is key to this process. MenaINV includes a segment not found in the normal version, and this makes it bind more strongly to a receptor known as alpha-5 integrin, which is found on the surfaces of tumor cells and nearby supporting cells, and recognizes fibronectin. When MenaINV attaches to this receptor, it promotes the binding of fibronectin to the same receptors. Fibronectin is normally a tangled protein, but when it binds to cell surfaces, it gets stretched out into long bundles. This stimulates the organization of collagen, another extracellular matrix protein, into stiff fibrils that radiate from the edges of the tumor. This pattern, which is typically seen in tumors that are more aggressive, essentially paves the way for tumor cells to move toward blood vessels. If you have curly, coiled collagen, that s associated with a good outcome, but if it gets realigned into these really straight long fibers, that provides highways for these cells to migrate on,  Oudin says. In studies of mice, cells with the invasive form of Mena were better able to recognize and crawl toward higher concentrations of fibronectin, moving along the collagen pathways, while cells without MenaINV did not move toward the higher concentrations. Predicting metastasisThe researchers also looked at data from breast cancer patients and found that high levels of MenaINV and fibronectin are associated with metastasis and earlier death. However, there was no link between the normal version of Mena and earlier death. Gertler s lab had previously developed antibodies that can detect the normal and invasive forms of Mena, which are now being developed for testing patient biopsy samples. Such tests could help doctors to determine whether a patient s tumor is likely to spread or not, and possibly to guide the patient s treatment. In addition, scientists may be able to develop drugs that inhibit MenaINV, which could be useful for treating cancer or preventing it from metastasizing. The researchers now hope to study how MenaINV may contribute to other types of cancers. Preliminary studies suggest that it plays a similar role in lung and colon cancers as that seen in breast cancer. They are also investigating how the choice between the two forms of the Mena protein is regulated, and how other proteins found in the extracellular matrix might contribute to cancer cell migration. The research was funded by the Ludwig Center at MIT, the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research program, the National Institutes of Health, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program through the Kathy and Curt Marble Cancer Research Fund, the Prostate Cancer Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute.","Published: March 16, 2016"

The Journal of Neuroscience published the research, led by Emory biologist Samuel Sober, who uses Bengalese finches as a model to understand how the brain learns. See Also: Learning with all the senses: Movements and images facilitate vocabulary learning ""Our experiments are the first to isolate the role of dopamine in sensory-motor learning, as distinct from the other functions that dopamine performs in the brain,"" Sober says. ""Bengalese finches are songbirds that have extremely precise singing behavior and can also refine their songs in response to auditory feedback. This provides a way for us to understand similar patterns of learning in humans. The ability to use auditory feedback to fix errors in behavior underlies everything from learning to speak, to sing and to play an instrument."" The research found that a reduction in dopamine levels in a small region of the basal ganglia in the finches' brains caused a reduction in their ability to correct vocal errors, while having no detectable effect on their ability to sing. The basal ganglia is situated at the base of the forebrain and is associated with a variety of functions, including voluntary motor movements and procedural learning. ""Some neurons send messages to the basal ganglia using dopamine,"" Sober explains. ""These dopamine-containing cells are some of the same neurons that slowly die off over years in patients with Parkinson's Disease, and problems with vocal control are often observed in Parkinson's patients. We hope that our research may help with the understanding of the role of dopamine in vocal behavior and the development of potential therapies for learning deficits."" A great deal of scientific literature already exists on the role of dopamine in learning to associate a stimulus with a reward or a punishment. What's much less understood is how dopamine may play a role in learning to perform a skilled behavior, such as speaking. To conduct the experiments on the Bengalese finches, the researchers first recorded each bird singing while an occasional blast of white noise was emitted from a speaker near the cage when the bird sang within a particular range of pitches. ""The finch interprets this blast of noise as an error,"" Sober explains. ""We measured how fast each bird changed its pitch to avoid that noise."" Related: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning A drug was then administered to the birds to lower the dopamine levels in their basal ganglia by about half and their singing was once again recorded. ""We found that their ability to correct their singing in response to the white noise also went down by about half,"" Sober says. ""They were still able to learn from the white noise 'mistake,' but they were significantly worse at it."" While the experiment demonstrates that dopamine is necessary for processing vocal errors, many questions remain. ""We don't know if reducing the level of dopamine changes the birds' ability to detect a vocal mistake, or whether it just affects their ability to fix mistakes once they detect them, or perhaps both,"" Sober says. ""Our next step is to better understand, at the cellular and molecular level, how changes in dopamine affect activity in the basal ganglia.""

Understanding the process well enough could lead to therapies in humans to control inflammation and hasten recovery from brain injury such as stroke, said American University (AU) Professor Colin Saldanha, whose study has published in Endocrinology. Through experiments, Saldanha and his colleagues found that estrogen-producing glial cells play a role in the rapid response. See Also: New evidence reveals link between brain inflammation and major depression ""The most surprising thing to me is that the inflammation control is happening within hours, and that estrogen is made in the brain around an injury site in response to an injury,"" Saldanha said. ""These animals have evolved a mechanism to protect their brains from injury very quickly."" Inflammation is a normal part of the body's immune response. It affects the brain differently compared with other parts of the body. In the brain, too much inflammation can cause degenerative effects, or in the worst case scenario, death. Chronic inflammation causes cell damage and the loss of important neurons that regulate memory, mood and movement. Being able to control and limit inflammation in an injured brain may preserve vital brain function. As a neurobiologist and member of AU's Center for Behavioral Neuroscience, Saldanha studies estrogen in songbirds. The birds produce the common sex steroid in their brains, as do humans and other mammals. It's been known that hormones affect the brain since the 1850s, but realizing that similar hormones could be made in the brain itself, took until the 1980s. The animals make good research subjects for neuroscience for many reasons, including because of their brain plasticity. Previous work by Saldanha and his colleagues explored how hormones communicate with neurons. They discovered a new method of communication, synaptocrine signaling, by which neurons create and feed high levels of estrogen to one another. That's when they also discovered which cells were synthesizing estrogen under conditions of brain injury: the glial cells, which are important, non-neuronal cells that live in the brain. For more than a decade, National Institutes of Health (USA) has funded Saldanha's research because of the implications it has for treating neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, strokes and inflammatory diseases. The release of estrogen in the brain to control inflammation is a natural process. It happens within about 24 hours in songbirds. The same process occurs in mammals over several days - perhaps far too late to stop brain degeneration or an end to life. In the current experiments, Saldanha discovered another important function of glial cells that they activated the rapid response to protect the birds' brains. However more needed to be understood about how the protective process was keeping inflammation in check. The researchers conducted three experiments using a type of acute injury, similar to a stroke. The injury spurred the secretion of small proteins called cytokines, which trigger an inflammatory response. At certain points during the response, Saldanha and his colleagues controlled the levels of estrogen by preventing aromatase the key protein needed for estrogen production from working. Learn More: Neurons listen to glial cells In the first experiment, researchers injured both sides of the brain, but flooded only one side with estrogen. The side flooded with estrogen showed less inflammation. In a second experiment, researchers injured both sides of the songbird brain and limited aromatase function to only one side of the brain. On the side without aromatase, the inflammatory cytokines remained dangerously elevated. That's when researchers knew estrogen controls inflammation and its very production occurs in response to injury. Estrogen is a complex chemical, which makes it exciting to study, Saldanha said. ""We can't just pump people full of estrogen. It can have very bad effects on systems other than the brain,"" Saldanha said. ""It's very tricky, which is why exploring this is so important, so we can figure out how to harness its power without any deleterious side-effects.""

The team found that genetic variants disrupt components of these networks in disease-specific tissues, giving new insights on disease mechanisms which may lead to targeted treatments that are more effective and have fewer side-effects for the patient. The project was spearheaded by researchers from the newly formed Department of Computational Biology (DCB) at the University of Lausanne (UNIL) and the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, in collaboration with researchers from the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Advances in genome-sequencing and related technologies have given rise to large studies that compare genetic variants between healthy people and people with a given condition. These studies have successfully identified thousands of genetic variants that are linked to different diseases. However, the mechanisms by which these variants influence disease processes remain mostly unknown, which is currently hindering progress to developing better diagnostic tests and personalized treatments for patients. Daniel Marbach, David Lamparter and Prof. Sven Bergmann (SIB, UNIL), in collaboration with Prof. Zolt n Kutalik (SIB, CHUV, UNIL) and Prof. Manolis Kellis (MIT), have now mapped networks of interacting genes that are perturbed by disease variants with unprecedented resolution across hundreds of human cell types and tissues. Poorly understood regulatory regions ""The challenge is that over 90% of disease variants lie outside of genes, in regions of the genome that are still poorly understood"" Marbach says. ""These regions can have regulatory functions, which are sometimes disrupted by genetic variants. Things get even more complicated as the regulatory relationships may vary between different tissue types. For example, a certain gene may activate another one in the liver, but not in the heart."" The team thus tackled the ambitious task of creating accurate ""maps"" of the regulatory networks that control the activity of genes in a given tissue. Data from an international research consortium (FANTOM) coupled with novel analysis techniques allowed them to create the largest collection of such networks to date, describing the regulatory interactions among over 19,000 genes in close to 400 human cell types and tissues. The study thus gives the first comprehensive view of the regulatory systems across a broad range of cells and tissues. Taking inspiration from social networks The underlying hypothesis was that genetic variants may impact genes that are connected within regulatory networks of tissues that are specific to certain diseases. To test their hypothesis, the researchers employed techniques similar to those applied to social networks to gain information about users on the basis of their interconnections. But in this case, they used biological networks to gain information about genes that can lead to diseases. In a large study including genetic data for diverse neurodegenerative, psychiatric, immune-related, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, the researchers found that disease variants often affect groups of genes that were densely interconnected within regulatory networks, confirming their hypothesis. Moreover, these affected network components pinpointed with remarkable precision cell types or tissues that are implicated in disease processes. ""For example, people with schizophrenia were found to have genetic variants that perturb interacting genes in brain tissues that are responsible for cognitive and emotional behavior, while genetic variants associated with obesity impact genes that interact in tissues of the intestinal system"" Marbach says. Towards better targeted treatments ""Our work shows that accurate maps of gene networks for different tissues will be of tremendous value to advance our understanding of how diseases start and progress, which is essential to design targeted treatments and to identify patient groups that respond to these treatments in a personalized medicine setting,"" concludes Prof. Bergmann.","Published: March 15, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/common-virus-depends-on-microrna-191086,Common Virus Depends on MicroRNA  In the ongoing arms race between pathogenic viruses and the cells they infect  each side needs every advantage it can get  One way wily viruses can get a leg up is by subverting the microRNAs  miRNAs  of their host   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.These miRNAs are small stretches of RNA made by host cells to regulate gene expression. If a virus can co-opt one, it can manipulate its host without having to make its own protein. This strategy saves valuable space in the viral genome and allows the virus to better hide from the host s immune system. DNA viruses are known to utilize miRNAs of the cells they infect; they even produce their own. Last year, Rockefeller scientists were surprised to discover that hepatitis C, a virus that contains RNA rather than DNA, not only sequesters a host miRNA but relies upon it. Now the same team which includes researchers in the labs of Charles M. Rice, Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Professor and head of the Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, and Robert B. Darnell, the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-oncology has found evidence that another RNA virus, the bovine viral diarrhea virus, which infects cows and other livestock, also depends on miRNAs for infection.  A new surveying technique To see if RNA viruses other than HCV use host miRNAs, the researchers developed a screening method that chemically attaches those miRNAs to their targets.  The problem with bioinformatic searches for miRNA targets is that they are small enough to occur every few thousand bases in the transcriptome,  says Troels Scheel, the first author of the study, now at the University of Copenhagen.  Moreover, computational approaches typically don t know what s expressed in different cell types,  and therefore which mRNA sequences they identify as miRNA targets might be physiologically relevant. In contrast, a biochemical scan developed in the Darnell and Rice labs called CLEAR-CLIP identifies real miRNA target sequences by physically linking the miRNA to some of its target mRNA, without the need for any a priori sequence information.  Is HCV an outlier? Is its dependence on miRNA unique?  wondered Joseph Luna, a postdoc in the Rice lab. To find out, he and his colleagues used CLEAR-CLIP to analyze the interactions of 15 RNA viruses with their host miRNAs. Among them were several viruses known to cause human disease, including poliovirus, dengue, and chikungunya virus. Their analysis showed that bovine viral diarrhea virus, or BVDV, a pestivirus that poses major trouble in the meat and dairy industries, specifically bound to both miR-17 and another host miRNA called let-7. BVDV relies on miR-17, and also sponges it up Usually, miRNAs function by repressing the expression of genes or their translation into protein. But in this case, miR-17 stabilizes the BVDV genome, just as miR-122 does for HCV. Upon infecting its host, the virus takes control of it by altering the expression of its genes. And since BVDV sops up so much of the host cell s miR-17, it prevents this miRNA from repressing the host genes normally under its control. The scientists found they could weaken the replication and production of the virus by inhibiting its interaction with the miRNA. They say miR-17 might provide an effective target for the development of new drugs to control BVDV. In the report, the researchers speculate that dependence on host miRNAs might be a general phenomenon in pestivirus replication, although they are not yet sure what biological purpose it could serve. But regardless of its function, this interaction between pestiviruses and miRNA may provide a ripe target for antiviral therapies since viral replication depends upon it.","Published: March 15, 2016"

The findings are important for the treatment of Parkinson s disease and are published in Stem Cell Reports, March 2016. Neurological disease research, such as on Parkinson s disease, relies on animal models and immortalized neural cell lines because the central nervous system of patients is not accessible for invasive examination. Cultured neural stem cells could provide an alternative that is closer to the biology of the patient in question. However, due to the epigenetic memories of iPSCs, efficient preparation of neural stem cells requires human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) usually derived from skin fibroblasts harvested from patient skin biopsies, which can lead to bleeding, scarring and infection. Now researchers from a collaboration of universities and institutions in Japan have demonstrated the potential efficacy of a less invasive alternative.  T cells can be obtained non-invasively, are easily stored and efficiently reprogrammed, and might therefore be an ideal source of patient-specific iPSCs,  explain Juntendo University s Wado Akamatsu and Keio University s Hideyuki Okano, and colleagues in their latest report. However the snag is that the source of stem cells seems to affect what cells they are likely to differentiate into. T cells are a type of lymphocyte or white blood cell and the researchers obtained very few neural cells from T cell-derived iPSCs cultured in standard embryoid bodies compared with the usual fibroblast-derived iPSCs. To encourage differentiation into neural cells, the researchers tried converting the iPSCs directly into neural stem cells as neurospheres   culture systems of free-floating neural cells - instead of embryoid bodies that contain cells of other germ layers. By using this protocol, T cell-derived iPSCs efficiently differentiated into neural cells as well as fibroblast-derived iPSCs. Neurospheres generated from T cell-derived iPSCs were differentiated into neurons and various neuronal subtypes in similar quantities to those from fibroblast-derived iPSCs. Furthermore, the researchers confirmed that iPSCs derived from the T cells of patients suffering from juvenile Parkinson s disease (PARK2) exhibited impaired mitochondrial phenotypes that the team had previously reported using the fibroblast-derived iPSCs derived from this patient.  These results strongly support that the hiPSCs derived from T-cells can be used as a model of neurological disease by using our differentiation protocol,  state Wado Akamatsu and Hideyuki Okano and colleagues in their latest report.","Published: March 15, 2016"

Under the terms of the CRADA, RareCyte and the NCI will collaborate over a 3- year period to investigate the use of RareCyte s technology to identify, characterize, capture and analyze rare immune cell populations as well as individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from preclinical and clinical studies conducted by the NCI. The specific goals of the CRADA include the detection, characterization, single cell retrieval, and analysis of rare circulating immune cells, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells and antigen-specific conventional T cells, and CTCs derived from preclinical and clinical studies conducted by the NCI and the development of assays showing response to immunotherapy and the extent of cancer progression. The study will be led by NCI principal investigator, Jay A. Berzofsky MD, PhD, chief of the Vaccine Branch of the NCI. He and Masaki Terabe, PhD, deputy section chief and head of the Cancer Immunology Unit, have deep expertise in T cell immunology and tumor immunology and translation of basic immunological research to strategies to develop vaccines. Joining them will be Lauren V. Wood MD, clinical director of the NCI Vaccine Branch, who has done extensive clinical research in cancer and HIV infection and clinical translation of therapeutic vaccine platforms into first-in-human trials. The group will also collaborate with Jane Trepel who heads the Preclinical Development Core within the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Branch, which focuses on drug development and currently participates in more than 50 clinical trials.  With advances in cancer immunotherapy, a significant challenge remains in identifying immunologic responses that correlate with beneficial clinical outcomes,  stated Eric Kaldjian, MD, chief medical officer of RareCyte and CRADA collaborator principal investigator.  The ability to characterize the immune response is an important aspect of personalized approaches for patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy. We believe that RareCyte s technology makes this possible.  RareCyte s integrated rare cell separation, identification and retrieval platform starts with the AccuCyte  blood separation system for comprehensive collection and transfer to slide of the nucleated cell fraction of a blood draw containing leukocytes and CTCs. Slides are then stained in the same manner as tissue sections or cytology preparations followed by high resolution microscopic scanning with the CyteFinder  instrument. Using up to 6-channel immunofluorescence staining and detection, rare immune cell subsets may be identified by the RareCyte platform. The method has high recovery rate (>90%) and can detect a single cancer cell in a tube of blood containing 40-50 million leukocytes. Ultimately, individual cells can be captured for genomic analysis using the CytePicker  retrieval device incorporated in the CyteFinder instrument.","Published: March 15, 2016"

The investigators described their accomplishments   which include developing an automated bioreactor system capable of supporting a whole human heart during the recellularization process   earlier this year in Circulation Research.   Generating functional cardiac tissue involves meeting several challenges,  says Jacques Guyette, PhD, of the MGH Center for Regenerative Medicine (CRM), lead author of the report.  These include providing a structural scaffold that is able to support cardiac function, a supply of specialized cardiac cells, and a supportive environment in which cells can repopulate the scaffold to form mature tissue capable of handling complex cardiac functions.  The research team is led by Harald Ott, MD, of the MGH CRM and the Department of Surgery, senior author of the paper. In 2008, Ott developed a procedure for stripping the living cells from a donor organ with a detergent solution and then repopulating the remaining extracellular matrix scaffold with organ-appropriate types of cells. Since then his team has used the approach to generate functional rat kidneys and lungs and has decellularized large-animal hearts, lungs and kidneys. This report is the first to conduct a detailed analysis of the matrix scaffold remaining after decellularization of whole human hearts, along with recellularization of the cardiac matrix in three-dimensional and whole-heart formats. The study included 73 human hearts that had been donated through the New England Organ Bank, determined to be unsuitable for transplantation and recovered under research consent. Using a scaled-up version of the process originally developed in rat hearts, the team decellularized hearts from both brain-dead donors and from those who had undergone cardiac death. Detailed characterization of the remaining cardiac scaffolds confirmed a high retention of matrix proteins and structure free of cardiac cells, the preservation of coronary vascular and microvascular structures, as well as freedom from human leukocyte antigens that could induce rejection. There was little difference between the reactions of organs from the two donor groups to the complex decellularization process. Instead of using genetic manipulation to generate iPSCs from adult cells, the team used a newer method to reprogram skin cells with messenger RNA factors, which should be both more efficient and less likely to run into regulatory hurdles. They then induced the pluripotent cells to differentiate into cardiac muscle cells or cardiomyocytes, documenting patterns of gene expression that reflected developmental milestones and generating cells in sufficient quantity for possible clinical application. Cardiomyocytes were then reseeded into three-dimensional matrix tissue, first into thin matrix slices and then into 15 mm fibers, which developed into spontaneously contracting tissue after several days in culture.  The last step reflected the first regeneration of human heart muscle from pluripotent stem cells within a cell-free, human whole-heart matrix. The team delivered about 500 million iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes into the left ventricular wall of decellularized hearts. The organs were mounted for 14 days in an automated bioreactor system developed by the MGH team that both perfused the organ with nutrient solution and applied environmental stressors such as ventricular pressure to reproduce conditions within a living heart. Analysis of the regenerated tissue found dense regions of iPSC-derived cells that had the appearance of immature cardiac muscle tissue and demonstrated functional contraction in response to electrical stimulation.   Regenerating a whole heart is most certainly a long-term goal that is several years away, so we are currently working on engineering a functional myocardial patch that could replace cardiac tissue damaged due a heart attack or heart failure,  says Guyette.  Among the next steps that we are pursuing are improving methods to generate even more cardiac cells   recellularizing a whole heart would take tens of billions   optimizing bioreactor-based culture techniques to improve the maturation and function of engineered cardiac tissue, and electronically integrating regenerated tissue to function within the recipient s heart.  Team leader Ott, an assistant professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, adds,  Generating personalized functional myocardium from patient-derived cells is an important step towards novel device-engineering strategies and will potentially enable patient-specific disease modeling and therapeutic discovery. Our team is excited to further develop both of these strategies in future projects. ","Published: March 15, 2016"

More than 1000 samples were taken from a coastal metropolitan city and a major inland regional city between 2009 and 2015,  Professor Hall said.  Methamphetamine consumption increased 4.8 times in the metropolitan area over the timeframe, and 3.4 times in the regional area.  This coincides with a study released last week, which showed an upsurge of more than 170,000 regular meth users across Australia between 2009 and 2015, to a total of 270,000 users nationwide.  Professor Jochen Mueller of Entox and colleagues Dr Phong Thai, Ms Foon Yin Lai and Mr Jake O Brien collaborated to build on previous insightful studies featuring waste testing. Armed with knowledge about the ways that specific drugs are excreted, they used census populations for both the metropolitan and regional catchments to ascertain their results. Methamphetamine consumption was measured in milligrams per day per 1000 inhabitants. In 2009 the mean for the coastal metropolitan area was 234mg/day/1000 people, which increased to 1126mg/day/1000 people in 2015. The study began a year later in the inland regional city, marked by a mean of 115mg/day/1000 people in 2010, which increased to 398mg/day/1000 people in 2015. Professor Hall said the wastewater analysis alone did not determine whether consumption had increased because there were more users or because existing users were consuming more.  However, when you view this together with other timely research, it is consistent with there being exponential growth in the number of users,  Professor Hall said. A report on national estimates, led by Professor Louisa Degenhardt from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, was released last week.","Published: March 15, 2016"

This action is a conservative first step to support the global medical research community and breaks the mold of data hoarding being done in academic and commercial organizations.  The first data released today are anonymized, aggregated data of 10,000 human genomes (exomes) focused on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.  Ambry Genetics has already identified 10-fold more genes implicated in these conditions than previously known to the public, broadening understanding and potentially opening up more drug targets than from any single data release in history.  The company also is committed to continuing this effort to sequence genomes and release the data for all of its consented and de-identified patient samples, potentially contributing data from almost 200,000 genomes annually based on projections from its current sample volumes, and profoundly impacting the collective understanding of the genetics behind all human disease.   As a stage four cancer survivor, I find it shocking that public and private laboratories routinely lock away vital genomic information. That practice is delaying medical progress, causing real human suffering, and it needs to stop,  said Charles Dunlop, Founder and CEO, Ambry Genetics.  As Ambry s CEO, I am fully committed to breaking the mold, sequencing genomes at our own expense and sharing the data on an ongoing basis. Above everything else we are all human beings, and as a 23-year veteran in the industry, I m sick and tired of seeing suffering and death. I invite other commercial and academic laboratories to do the same.  This milestone is supportive of President Barack Obama s Precision Medicine Initiative, and reflects Ambry s position in the ongoing debate over the ownership of genetic data. Mr. Dunlop believes that human genes should not be patented or owned. That is why, in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court 2013 decision around gene patents, he continued the fight that led to court decisions essentially eliminating the validity of gene patents.  This belief also fuels why Ambry Genetics is doing additional genome sequencing at its own expense, releasing aggregate allele-frequency data (showing the percentage of people with a specific gene mutation) on an ongoing basis.    Despite the promise of the Human Genome Project, medical advancements over the past decade have continued slowly because many researchers have lacked access to the kind of genomic information that Ambry Genetics is now giving away for free,  said Fergus J. Couch, Ph.D., Professor and Chair of the Division of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.  Ambry Genetics  decision to make these data available is a potential game changer in the efforts to understand hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and to improve care for individuals predisposed to these and other cancers.  For the free AmbryShare database, Ambry Genetics has made a significant financial investment into building the infrastructure and human resources to support its ongoing commitment to data sharing and scientific collaboration. Mr. Dunlop said this all helps to speed the discovery of new diagnostic targets, treatments, and cures, to save more lives, sooner.  In addition, Ambry Genetics is looking for support from the medical community, asking clinicians to provide as much clinical information for each patient as possible, including patient family medical histories through Progeny s Family History Questionnaire.  Mr. Dunlop notes that this additional information will dramatically impact our ability to understand all human disease within our lifetime.  With today s announcement, Ambry Genetics is building on its collaborative heritage by contributing the largest volume of hereditary cancer genome data ever released to the scientific community,  said Aaron Elliott, Ph.D., Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Scientific Officer, Ambry Genetics.  Before today, we actually knew very little about the genes contributing to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. By releasing these data to the public, we are hitting the fast-forward button on medical research. We intend to do this for all the conditions we test for to better understand the genetic component of human disease.  Currently, the platform for the AmbryShare database is ideal for bioinformatics professionals   experts in molecular biology who can understand and interpret the data.  As the company builds the platform, the site will evolve to include information targeted at clinicians and eventually the general public.  Ultimately, the AmbryShare database will be compatible with third-party registries and other open-source databases (such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information s ClinVar, to which Ambry Genetics is a heavy contributor), with the intent of making genetic science more collaborative. Ambry Genetics is one of the largest and fastest growing genetic testing companies by volume and revenue, with a growing database of genomic data amassed from more than a decade of genetic diagnostic testing, including results of the first commercially-offered human exome sequencing services.  The 16-year-old, privately-held company has actively shared data as one of the biggest contributors to public variant interpretation databases, scientific presentations, and peer-reviewed publications.  In February, Ambry Genetics opened its Super Lab, one of the largest, most sophisticated genetic testing laboratories in the world with a high volume capacity and rigorous quality control practices. The new laboratory, together with Ambry s 2015 acquisition of Progeny, the industry standard for genetic risk modeling software used in clinics to gather important family history data, are both key contributions to building a useful publically-available database, and a critical first step toward understanding human disease and quickening the pace of cures.","Published: March 15, 2016"

This relies partly on luck that the patient gets screened at the right time, but more important is that the testing techniques are sensitive enough to register the minuscule hints that diseases leave in the blood stream. A new technique developed by a team of chemists at Stanford has shown promise to be thousands of times more sensitive than current techniques in lab experiments, and it is now being put to test in real-world clinical trials. When a disease   whether it's a cancer or a virus like HIV   begins growing in the body, the immune system responds by producing antibodies. Fishing these antibodies or related biomarkers out of the blood is one way that scientists infer the presence of a disease. This involves designing a molecule that the biomarker will bind to, and which is adorned with an identifying ""flag."" Through a series of specialized chemical reactions, known as an immunoassay, researchers can isolate that flag, and the biomarker bound to it, to provide a proxy measurement of the disease. The new technique, developed in the lab of Carolyn Bertozzi, a professor of chemistry at Stanford, augments this standard procedure with powerful DNA screening technology. In this case, the chemists have replaced the standard flag with a short strand of DNA, which can then be teased out of the sample using DNA isolation technologies that are far more sensitive than those possible for traditional antibody detections. ""This is spiritually related to a basic science tool we were developing to detect protein modifications, but we realized that the core principles were pretty straightforward and that the approach might be better served as a diagnostic tool,"" said Peter Robinson, a co-author on the study and graduate student in Bertozzi's group. The researchers tested their technique, with its signature DNA flag, against four commercially available, FDA-approved tests for a biomarker for thyroid cancer. It outperformed the sensitivity of all of them, by at least 800 times, and as much as 10,000 times. By detecting the biomarkers of disease at lower concentrations, physicians could theoretically catch diseases far earlier in their progression. ""The thyroid cancer test has historically been a fairly challenging immunoassay, because it produces a lot of false positives and false negatives, so it wasn't clear if our test would have an advantage,"" Robinson said. ""We suspected ours would be more sensitive, but we were pleasantly surprised by the magnitude."" Putting basic research to use in a clinical setting has been a focus of Bertozzi's since she arrived at Stanford. ""I moved to Stanford with the anticipation that translation of my students' innovations to clinically impactful products and technologies would be enabled,"" said Bertozzi, who is a faculty fellow of Stanford ChEM-H, as well as a professor, by courtesy, of radiology and of chemical and systems biology. ""That goal is being delightfully fulfilled."" Based on the success of the thyroid screening, the group has won a few grants to advance the technique into clinical trials. One trial underway in collaboration with the nearby Alameda County Public Health Laboratory will help evaluate the technique as a screening tool for HIV. Early detection and treatment of the virus can help ensure that its effects on the patient are minimized and reduce the chance that it is transmitted to others. This effort is supported by a pilot grant from Stanford-Spectrum, funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health. ""Many of our collaborators are excited that the test can be readily deployed in their lab,"" said co-author Cheng-ting ""Jason"" Tsai, a graduate student in Bertozzi's group. ""In contrast to many new diagnostic techniques, this test is performed on pre-existing machines that most clinical labs are already familiar with."" The researchers are also pursuing tests for Type 1 diabetes, for which early detection could help patients manage the disease with fewer side effects.","Published: March 15, 2016"

In particular they note the pernicious nature of the most common form of gastric cancer metastasis, which occurs in the peritoneum - the membrane surrounding the abdominal cavity. The researchers  latest work targets some of the limitations of existing gastric cancer therapies, such as targeting challenges and the development of resistance to anticancer drugs. The only known target for gastric cancer is the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). However expression of this protein tends to be low in gastric cancers and is particularly low in peritoneal cancers. To tackle this obstacle the researchers devised a viral vector that transducts into HER2-negative cells with genes expressing the extracellular domain protein for HER2. They showed the approach was effective in samples with mixed HER2-positive HER2-positive cells, as would likely be the case in peritoneal cancers. They then administered a humanised photosensitizer drug targeted towards HER2-positive cells, originally developed by Hisataka Kobayashi at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, US, followed up with photoimmunotherapy to selectively destroy HER2-positive cancer cells. Following the gene transduction, the photosensitizer recognised the HER2-negative cells as HER2-positive and bound to them so that the photoimmunotherapy could take effect. They demonstrated tumour suppression with this combined approach on mice that originally had HER2-negative cancer cells injected into the peritoneum. Photoimmunotherapy attacks the cell structure, which reduces the risk of acquired resistance. In addition repeated courses enhanced the efficacy with minimal side effects. The researchers conclude,  The novel therapy of molecular-targeted photoimmunotherapy integrated with gene transfer technology is a promising approach for the treatment of peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer.  BackgroundTargeted drug deliveryOne of the greatest challenges in fighting cancer is avoiding damage to healthy cells, which can cause considerable sickness as a side effect of therapy. Some cancer cells can be recognised by targeting moieties, which bind to them. By functionalising therapeutic particles with these moieties the attack can be directed at cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. The protein HER2 is overexpressed in certain types of cancer, and as such has become an important biomarker. Trastuzumab has been developed as a humanized photosensitizer that targets HER2 and seemed a good starting point for developing more effective gastric cancer treatments in the absence of other molecular-targeting gastric cancer drugs. Since the expression of HER2 is so low in peritoneal cancers (2.9%), the researchers developed a means of transducing HER2-negative cancer cells with the gene for the HER2 extracellular domain protein so that Trastuzumab would target them. Viral transductionViruses are infectious agents that can only replicate inside another cell. Viral reproduction by transducing viral DNA into other cells has become a useful tool for microbiologists. In the current work the researchers developed a medium-sized viral vector to transduct genes expressing HER2-extracellular-domain proteins into HER2-negative cancer cells. Ex vivo experiments also suggested that the gene was preferentially transduced to cancer cells on the peritoneal cavity. One of the limitations of the current results is incomplete transduction of the gene expressing the HER2 extracellular domain protein by the adenovirus. The adenovirus developed for the transduction was engineered not to replicate, but adjustments to allow conditional replication may improve the efficacy of the treatment. PhotoimmunotherapyCell necrosis is a form of injury that causes premature cell death. Exposure to infrared radiation can cause cell necrosis in cancer cells that have been photosensitized with Trastuzumab. As photoimmunotherapy does not require uptake of the photosensitizer inside the cancer cells it can be more effective than photodynamic therapy.","Published: March 15, 2016"

Paulson School for Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) has invented a method for 3D bioprinting thick vascularized tissue constructs composed of human stem cells, extracellular matrix, and circulatory channels lined with endothelial blood vessel cells. The resulting network of vasculature contained within these deep tissues enables fluids, nutrients and cell growth factors to be controllably perfused uniformly throughout the tissue. ""This latest work extends the capabilities of our multi-material bioprinting platform to thick human tissues, bringing us one step closer to creating architectures for tissue repair and regeneration,"" says Wyss Core Faculty member Jennifer A. Lewis, Sc.D., senior author on the study, who is also the Hans rg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at SEAS. To date, scaling up human tissues built of a variety of cell types has been limited by a lack of robust methods for embedding life-sustaining vascular networks. Building on their earlier work, Lewis and her team have now increased the tissue thickness threshold by nearly tenfold, setting the stage for future advances in tissue engineering and repair. The method combines vascular plumbing with living cells and an extracellular matrix, enabling the structures to function as living tissues. In the study, Lewis and her team showed that their 3D bioprinted tissues could sustain and function as living tissue architectures for upwards of six weeks. In the study, Lewis' team demonstrated the 3D printing of one centimeter-thick tissue containing human bone marrow stem cells surrounded by connective tissue. By pumping bone growth factors through the supporting vasculature lined with the same endothelial cells found in our blood vessels, the team induced cell development toward bone cells over the course of one month. ""This research will help to establish the fundamental scientific understanding required for bioprinting of vascularized living tissues,"" Zhijian Pei, National Science Foundation Program Director for the Directorate for Engineering Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation, which funded the project. ""Research such as this enables broader use of 3-D human tissues for drug safety and toxicity screening and, ultimately, for tissue repair and regeneration."" Lewis' novel 3D bioprinting method uses a customizable, printed silicone mold to house and plumb the printed tissue structure. Inside this mold, a grid of vascular channels is printed first, over which ink containing living stem cells is then printed. The inks are self-supporting and strong enough to hold shape as the structure's size increases with each layer of deposition. At intersections meeting within the foundational vascular grid, vertical vascular pillars are printed, which interconnect a pervasive network of microvessels throughout all dimensions of the stem cell-laden tissue. After printing, a liquid composed of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix fills in the open regions around the 3D printed tissue, cross linking the entire structure. The resulting soft tissue structure is replete with blood vessels, and via a single inlet and outlet on opposite ends of the chip, can be immediately perfused with nutrients to ensure survival of the cells. The pervasive vasculature facilitates stem cell differentiation by enabling delivery of cell growth factors throughout all areas of the tissue. To achieve a variety of tissue shapes, thicknesses, and compositions, the shape of the printed silicone chip can be customized and the cell inks can be tuned to include a wide variety of cell types. ""Having the vasculature pre-fabricated within the tissue allows enhanced cell functionality at the deep core of the tissue, and gives us the ability to modulate those cell functions through the use of perfusable substances such as growth factors,"" said David Kolesky, a graduate researcher at the Wyss Institute and SEAS and one of the study's first authors. ""Jennifer and her team are shifting the paradigm in the field of tissue engineering based on their unique bioprinting approach,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology program at Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS. ""Their ability to build living 3D vascularized tissues from the bottom-up provides a potential way to form macroscale functional tissue replacements that can be surgically connected to the body's own blood vessels to provide immediate perfusion of these artificial tissues, and thus, greatly increase their likelihood of survival. This would overcome many of the problems that held back tissue engineering from clinical success in the past.""

Scientists have long been interested in how the vascular system   the body s network of large and small blood vessels   may be involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer s disease and related dementias. Scientists from diverse fields using the latest methodologies will work collaboratively towards shared goals: to dissect the complex molecular mechanisms by which vascular risk factors influence Alzheimer s disease and identify new targets for treatment and prevention. Developed by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), both part of NIH, the five-year, $30-million program brings together over a dozen research teams working on five complementary projects. Harnessing the power of new molecular technologies and big data analytics, the teams will make biological datasets available to the wider research community.  Despite evidence that the brains of most Alzheimer s patients have a variety of vascular lesions, and that mid-life diabetes and high blood pressure are major risk factors for Alzheimer s, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved is quite limited,  said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D.  M OVE-AD will not only advance our understanding of these mechanisms, but also identify the molecular signatures   sets of genes, proteins and metabolites   that may be used as markers for disease risk or to track the effectiveness of promising therapies.  The teams will generate several layers of molecular data from brain tissue donated by deceased Alzheimer s research participants and from blood cells and plasma donated by living study participants with various types of vascular risk. They will then develop mathematical models of the molecular processes that link vascular risk factors to Alzheimer s onset and progression by combining molecular data with data on cognition, brain imaging and several measures of vascular health. In parallel, the teams will use a number of animal models that show different vascular disease traits to tease out the molecular mechanisms linking vascular risk factors and Alzheimer s and to test the predictions made from the analyses of the human data.  A growing body of research suggests vascular damage often contributes to Alzheimer s disease,  said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., program director, NINDS.  This focused collaborative effort may push our understanding of Alzheimer s disease over a tipping point and facilitate the development of better treatments for those who are suffering.  M OVE-AD builds upon the open-science approach and the big-data infrastructure established by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer s Disease (AMP-AD), a precompetitive partnership between NIH, industry and nonprofit organizations to speed the discovery of promising therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers.  Breaking down the traditional barriers to collaboration and data-sharing is key to moving the science forward, so we ve ensured that the discoveries each team makes can be rapidly shared among the Consortium and the wider research community,  said Suzana Petanceska, Ph.D., senior advisor for strategic development and partnerships in the NIA Division of Neuroscience.  We ve also established a panel of external leading experts to help shape the direction of M2OVE-AD research and potentially, bring about new partnerships and avenues of investigation.

Published in Cell Reports, the work describes a new process for making brain tissue transparent that outperforms other methods and allows extremely detailed imaging of tiny but important structures within neurons. Many aspects of learning and behavior are accompanied by structural changes in neurons at the synapse. Being able to see these kinds of structural changes in 3-D will help us understand what normal changes look like, and allow us to identify differences that occur in abnormal situations. See Also: Atomic force microscopy for imaging nanoscale dynamics of neurons Fluorescence microscopes are very useful for this because fluorescent proteins are often used to trace neurons that originate from a specific brain region or to label specific structures of interest like synapses of a neuron. One important issue is that in order to create accurate 3D images of deep tissue in the brain, the brain needs to be transparent. In recent years, several methods have been developed for making tissue transparent, a process called optical clearing. Two problems that plague the development of these agents for high-resolution microscopy are tissue damage and spherical aberrations that create inaccurate images. To date, clearing methods have been useful for imaging large structures at low resolutions, but tissue damage through harsh chemicals or swelling make them impractical for imaging fine structures on neurons, such as dendritic spines or axonal boutons. Quantitative analyses of synapses in wild-type and NMDAR-deficient neurons. L5 neurons were labeled with cytoplasmic tdTomato and EYFP-gephyrin using in utero electroporation and analyzed at P22 (Airyscan). Unbranched oblique dendrites (100 200  m long) extending from the trunk of the proximal part of the apical dendrites from L5 pyramidal neurons were analyzed. Representative super-resolution images are reconstructed with VAST. Note that gephryin puncta on the dendrite shaft vs. spines are unambiguously defined. Both wild type (A) and NR1-deficient neurons (B) were analyzed. Credit: RIKEN  Building off their previous success with the clearing agent SeeDB (See Deep Brain), the CDB group led by Takeshi Imai has developed a new recipe, called SeeDB2, which additionally minimizes the disruptive spherical aberrations, maintains fine structures without damage, and allows bright and stable fluorophores the chemical compounds that re-emit light when excited and allow for fluorescent imaging. Substances like water and oil make light slow down and bend different amounts, which is quantified as their refractive indexes. In order to clear tissue without inducing light scattering and spherical aberrations, the team hit upon a strategy to match the refractive index of the clearing agent to that of the tissue samples. A special recipe of iohexol and saponin, buffered in Tris-EDTA, matched the refractive index of samples used in objective-lens high-resolution imaging using oil immersion, and proved to effectively clear and maintain samples without introducing any morphological damage. Learn More: Researchers open  Golden Window  in deep brain imaging  While the degree of transparency obtained using SeeDB2 is less than what can be achieved with other optical clearing agents,  notes Imai,  only SeeDB2 can be used to obtain super-resolution images of fine neuronal structures. Researchers must therefore choose the clearing agent that best fits their experimental purpose.  Using SeeDB2, the team was able to obtain super-resolution images of neural circuitry 10 times deeper in the brain than was possible in the past, and showed that their approach was compatible with several different types of super-resolution microscopy. As many cognitive-related disorders are associated with synaptic abnormalities, as a way to showcase what can be accomplished with their new recipe, the group focused on imaging the dendrites of normal neurons and those in which an important subunit of an excitatory glutamate receptor had been knocked-out. They were able to see that the size of spines was larger and that inhibitory synapses accumulated in the enlarged spines of the mutant neurons. Notes Imai,  Finding that changes in an excitatory receptor affected fine structures at inhibitory synapses is an important discovery that was made possible by our new optical clearing formula. We expect that super-resolution imaging of deep tissue neural circuitry will continue to be a powerful strategy for studying connectomics at the synaptic level, and that SeeDB2 will have an important role in making these studies possible.""

Through induced pluripotent stem cell techniques, researchers also grew neurons from one patient in the laboratory to be used in future experiments. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a genetic disease that causes wasting away of the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement, like walking, speaking, and even the direction of our eyes. See Also: Potential treatment found for Friedreich's ataxia Currently, SCA has no cure or treatment. The mutations responsible for about 30 percent of cases are still unidentified. Two different families with SCA sought treatment at two different hospitals in Japan. After preliminary testing on the symptomatic individuals, doctors identified none of the known genetic mutations. Researchers at Hiroshima University then received the patient's genetic samples and began the process of searching for the new mutation. After genetic sequencing of four family members with SCA, a research team led by Professor Hideshi Kawakami, MD, PhD, from the Department of Epidemiology at Hiroshima University used statistical analysis to compare the families' DNA to that of unrelated people without SCA. This statistical analysis allowed researchers to identify which genetic variation the family members with SCA shared that healthy people did not. The gene responsible for causing both families' SCA is located on Chromosome 17. The gene, called CACNA1G, encodes the Cav3.1 protein. Cav3.1 serves as a type of ion channel, or gateway, between the inside of nerve cells and the rest of the body. Scientists in different fields of research already know Cav3.1 controls how many Calcium ions are allowed into nerves when they send an electrical impulse through the brain. Cav3.1 had never been linked to SCA before. Changing a single letter in the DNA sequence of CACNA1G switches a single amino acid in the chain of 2377 amino acids that cells connect to build the Cav3.1 protein. Researchers performed the experiments to examine the way the mutated Cav3.1 channel behaves in cells growing in a dish. This mutation makes the Cav3.1 channels open at a lower threshold, meaning they let Calcium into the cell differently from healthy cells.

Skin cells from one patient were used in induced pluripotent stem cell experiments to grow this patient's neurons in the laboratory. These new neurons showed no obvious physical deformities, which might fit with normal SCA progression. Depending on which SCA mutation they have, some patients may not experience symptoms until middle-age.

The researchers used a modified version of CRISPR called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to inactivate genes in iPSCs and heart cells created from iPSCs. The method, first reported in 2013by Stanley Qi, PhD, a co-author on the current paper, significantly improves the original CRISPR-Cas9 system by allowing genes to be silenced or turned off more precisely and efficiently. CRISPRi also offers the flexibility of reversing and carefully controlling the amount of gene suppression. The standard CRISPR system uses the protein Cas9 to delete a precise part of the genome by making small cuts in a cell s DNA. CRISPRi builds on this technology by using a special deactivated version of the Cas9 protein and an additional inhibitor protein, KRAB. Together, these proteins sit at the target spot on the genome and suppress gene expression without cutting the DNA. To the scientists  surprise, temporarily silencing gene expression in this way was much more consistent than permanently cleaving the genome.  We were amazed by the dramatic difference in performance between the two systems,  said senior author Bruce Conklin, MD, a senior investigator in the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and Roddenberry Stem Cell Center at Gladstone.  We thought that permanently cutting the genome would be the more effective way to silence a gene, but in fact, CRISPRi is so precise and binds so tightly to the genome that it is actually a better way to silence a gene.  In the study, the researchers compared how well CRISPRi and CRISPR-Cas9 silenced a particular gene that controls iPSC pluripotency the capability of iPSCs to turn into multiple cell types. They discovered that CRISPRi was much more efficient than CRISPR-Cas9: in more than 95% of the cells created using CRISPRi, the target gene was silenced, compared with only 60-70% of cells grown from CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPRi also did not cause any off-target changes in gene expression, like undesired insertions or deletions to the cell s genome, which is a concern with CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPRi also acted like a toggle switch, enabling the scientists to reverse gene suppression by simply removing the chemical that turns on the gene inhibitor. In addition, the researchers were able to tune how much they silenced a gene by changing the amount of the chemicals they added. Both of these results support much more versatile investigations into the role of certain genes that affect development and disease. The researchers demonstrated the enhanced capabilities of CRISPRi in iPSCs, T cells, and heart cells made from stem cells. For example, they created a model of heart disease using genome editing to suppress a gene essential for heart function.  CRISPRi holds a major advantage in making disease-relevant cell types,  said first author Mohammad Mandegar, DPhil, a research scientist at Gladstone.

Damaging changes to this gene, which occur rarely, increase the risk of schizophrenia 35-fold and also increase risk for a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. The research, published today in Nature Neuroscience, establishes for the first time that single-letter changes to the DNA code of one gene can have such a substantial effect on the risk of schizophrenia, leading to a step forward in understanding the biology and potential treatments of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness affecting nearly 300,000 people in the UK, but knowledge of what causes it is very limited. Previous studies of families have shown that genetics plays an important role in the disorder. Researchers found that mutations that remove the function of the SETD1A gene are almost never found in the general population, and affect less than 1 in 1000 people with schizophrenia. While this gene explains only a very small fraction of all schizophrenia patients, it provides an important clue to the wider biology of the disorder. Dr Jeff Barrett, lead author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute said:  The results were surprising, not only that we found such a high level of certainty that the SETD1A gene was involved, but also that the effects of the gene were so large. Psychiatric disorders are complex diseases involving many genes, and it is extremely difficult to find conclusive proof of the importance of a single gene. This is a really exciting finding for research into schizophrenia.  In the largest study of its kind to date, the genome sequences of more than 16,000 people from the UK, Finland and Sweden were analysed, including those from 5,341 people who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Damage to the SETD1A gene was found in ten of the schizophrenia patients, and surprisingly was also found in 6 other people with other developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as intellectual disability. This finding that the same gene is involved in both schizophrenia and developmental disorders shows that they may share common biological pathways.  Professor Sir Mike Owen, Director of Cardiff University s MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, said:  We have a very limited understanding of how schizophrenia arises, and this has hampered attempts to develop new treatments. Current drugs are only effective in alleviating some of the symptoms, can lead to troubling side effects, and are ineffective in a sizeable minority of cases. Defects in the SETD1A gene, which by itself explains only a small fraction of cases, may guide us towards new pathways that could be targets for therapeutic drugs in a larger number of cases.  The study* incorporates new DNA sequence data and builds upon eight published studies, one of which previously suggested SETD1A as a candidate susceptibility gene. Professor Aarno Palotie, Research Director at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, at the University of Helsinki said:  To get this level of certainty about the involvement of rare genes requires a huge collaborative effort.  Four International consortia have contributed data to this study, with hundreds of researchers and thousands of patients over 30 years. Collaborations like this pave the way for large-scale analyses over the next couple of years that could really explain the genetic basis of schizophrenia. ","Published: March 14, 2016"

""Early life exposure to lead causes a long lasting impact on gut microbiome, and the change of gut microbiome may partially contribute to the increased body weight in adult life,"" said lead author Chuanwu Xi, associate professor of environmental health science. Lead was added to the drinking water of female mice prior to breeding through nursing their young. Once weaned, the offspring were raised to adulthood without additional exposure, and then tested for lead effects acquired from their mothers. ""The lead levels in the mouse mothers were carefully designed to be within human population exposure levels. Our lowest dose is near the current U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's blood lead action level of 5 micrograms per deciliter, while the higher dose mirrors exposure levels during the 1960s and 70s,"" said Dana Dolinoy, U-M associate professor of environmental health sciences and of nutrition sciences. ""Since we are investigating the effects of the developmental origins of disease, it is important to evaluate current and historically relevant lead levels."" Lead is found throughout the environment in natural and man-made settings. For decades, researchers have found many health problems associated with exposure, even at levels lower than the threshold for safety set by the CDC. Most previous studies have dealt with ingestion and inhalation. ""We investigated more specifically the role of gut microbiome in the health impact upon lead exposure in this study,"" Xi said. Research has shown that large numbers of bacteria live in animal intestines, and the range of diversity in these microbes, and the balance of various organisms, is increasingly known to be tied to health. In this study that used deep DNA sequencing of bacterial specific genes, the guts of both males and females exposed to lead had all of the similar complexity in microbiota as those not exposed. The differences were in the balance of the different groups of microorganisms. For example, both adult males and females exposed to lead during early development had fewer aerobes and significantly more anaerobes, suggesting a changing microenvironment of the gut. ""In both males and females developmental lead impacted the adult microbiome. We only observed adult onset obesity in the males, but females may have shown effects on obesity if we had followed them longer,"" Dolinoy said.","Published: March 14, 2016"

But the therapy doesn t cure them, and those who take the drugs have an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, kidney and liver disease, and other disorders seen in HIV patients. HIV infection also can lead to diseases affecting the intestines, with increased gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation, diarrhea and problems with nutrient absorption. The role of gut microbes in such issues is not completely understood, but now, in two studies led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, scientists have identified intestinal bacteria and viruses as possible sources of such inflammation and disease. Identifying the source could open the door to strategies to limit damage in the GI tract and reduce inflammation and related problems that affect patients with HIV.   People with advanced HIV have intestinal disease and significant systemic inflammation that may cause progressive defects in immunity and speed the progression from HIV infection to AIDS,  said senior investigator Herbert W.  Skip  Virgin IV, MD, PhD.  We think changes in the virome and bacterial microbiome damage gut epithelial cells and allow bacteria and viruses to leak into surrounding tissues and blood, contributing to inflammation.  Inflammation is believed to play a role in a range of disorders, including cardiovascular disease, abnormal blood lipids, diabetes and other insulin-related abnormalities. One of the two studies monitored infected primates, and the other followed HIV-positive people in the African country of Uganda. Both showed that changes in the viral and bacterial makeup of the GI tract were linked to severe immunodeficiency due to progression of HIV in human patients and SIV (Simian immunodeficiency virus) in primates. The researchers studied 36 rhesus monkeys, some of which were infected with SIV. They also followed 82 HIV-infected people in Uganda, 40 of whom took antiretroviral therapy and 42 of whom did not. In the people and primates, AIDS and resulting immunodeficiency were linked to a greater number of viruses in the gut, compared with the number of gut viruses in people and primates who had a normal immune response. Those with severely weakened immune systems also had more bacterial pathogens in the gut. In the study of SIV in monkeys, the researchers found that vaccination against SIV prevented the development of those abnormalities. The severity of immunodeficiency is determined in humans by measuring counts of immune cells called CD4 cells. A count of 200 or lower means that person s immune system is deficient. Significantly, HIV infection alone, in the absence of immunodeficiency, had a minimal effect on the number of viral and bacterial pathogens in the gut. Virgin, the Edward Mallinckrodt Professor and head of the Department of Pathology and Immunology, said controlling the proliferation of damaging viruses and bacteria in the gut might reduce damage in the GI tract and, as a result, limit problems that affect patients with chronic HIV infection.  In these studies, we ve learned more about which viruses emerge and when they emerge following infection with SIV and HIV,  said Scott Handley, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and immunology and the first author on the study focused on infections in primates.  We ve also identified potentially disease-causing bacteria in the gut that appear only in severely immunocompromised people and animals.  Specifically, the researchers found AIDS and resulting immunodeficiency are associated with the expansion of adenoviruses and enterobacteriacae. Both are enteropathogens, meaning they have the potential to cause disease.  It eventually may be possible, perhaps by treating patients with a specialized mixture of probiotics, to help restore gut health and prevent the damage to cells in the gut that contributes to inflammation and to an HIV infection becoming AIDS,  said co-investigator Guoyan Zhao, PhD, an assistant professor of pathology and immunology.  There are multiple, novel viruses in the intestinal ecosystems of those with SIV and HIV infection,  Virgin added.  Some of those viruses, particularly the adenoviruses that can damage intestinal cells, also may have the capacity to act as vectors for vaccine delivery. Some of our collaborators are investigating that strategy and are working to develop a vaccine. ","Published: March 14, 2016"

Many types of cancer require synthesis of serine to sustain rapid, constant and unregulated growth. To find a drug candidate that interfered with this pathway, the team screened a large library of compounds from a variety of sources, searching for molecules that inhibited a specific enzyme known as 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which is responsible for the first committed step in serine biosynthesis.  In addition to discovering an inhibitor that targets cancer metabolism, we also now have a tool to help answer interesting questions about serine metabolism,  said Luke L. Lairson, assistant professor of chemistry at TSRI and principal investigator of cell biology at the California Institute for Biomedical Research (CALIBR). Lairson was senior author of the study, published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), with Lewis Cantley of Weill Cornell Medical College and Costas Lyssiotis of the University of Michigan. Addicted to Serine Serine is necessary for nucleotide, protein and lipid biosynthesis in all cells. Cells use two main routes for acquiring serine: through import from the extracellular environment or through conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (a glycolytic intermediate) by PHGDH.  Since the late 1950s, it has been known that cancer cells use the process of aerobic glycolysis to generate metabolites needed for proliferative growth,  said Lairson. This process can lead to an overproduction of serine. The genetic basis for this abundance had remained mysterious until recently, when it was demonstrated that some cancers acquire mutations that increased the expression of PHGDH; reducing PHGDH in these  serine-addicted  cancer cells also inhibited their growth. The labs of Lewis C. Cantley at Weill Cornell Medical College (in work published in Nature Genetics) and David Sabatini at the Whitehead Institute (in work published in Nature) suggested PHGDH as a potential drug target for cancer types that overexpress the enzyme. Lairson and colleagues hypothesized that a small molecule drug candidate that inhibited PHGDH could interfere with cancer metabolism and point the way to the development of an effective cancer therapeutic. Importantly, this drug candidate would be inactive against normal cells because they would be able to import enough serine to support ordinary growth. As Easy as 1-2-800,000 Lairson, in collaboration with colleagues including Cantley, Lyssiotis, Edouard Mullarky of Weill Cornell and Harvard Medical School and Natasha Lucki of CALIBR, screened through a library of 800,000 small molecules using a high-throughput in vitro enzyme assay to detect inhibition of PHGDH. The group identified 408 candidates and further narrowed this list down based on cell-type specific anti-proliferative activity and by eliminating those inhibitors that broadly targeted other dehydrogenases. With the successful identification of seven candidate inhibitors, the team sought to determine if these molecules could inhibit PHGDH in the complex cellular environment. To do so, the team used a mass spectrometry-based assay (test) to measure newly synthesized serine in a cell in the presence of the drug candidates. One of the seven small molecules tested, named CBR-5884, was able to specifically inhibit serine synthesis by 30 percent, suggesting that the molecule specifically targeted PHGDH. The group went on to show that CBR-5884 was able to inhibit cell proliferation of breast cancer and melanoma cells lines that overexpress PHGDH. As expected, CBR-5884 did not inhibit cancer cells that did not overexpress PHGDH, as they can import serine; however, when incubated in media lacking serine, the presence of CBR-5884 decreased growth in these cells. The group anticipates much optimization work before this drug candidate can become an effective therapeutic. In pursuit of this goal, the researchers plan to take a medicinal chemistry approach to improve potency and metabolic stability.","Published: March 14, 2016"

The ability to derive na ve stem cells has been possible for over thirty years from mouse embryos, using a technique developed by Sir Martin Evans and Professor Matthew Kaufman during their time at Cambridge, but this is the first time this has been possible from human embryos. Human pluripotent stem cells for use in regenerative medicine or biomedical research come from two sources: embryonic stem cells, derived from fertilised egg cells discarded from IVF procedures; and induced pluripotent stem cells, where skin cells are reprogrammed to a pluripotent form. However, these cells are already  primed  for differentiation into specific cell types. In contrast, all instructions have been erased in na ve cells, which may make it easier to direct them into any cell type of interest. Recently na ve-like human induced pluripotent stem cells have been created by reprogramming but it has been unknown whether they can also be obtained directly from the human embryo. When an egg cell is fertilised by a sperm, it begins to divide and replicate before the embryo takes shape. Around day five, the embryonic cells cluster together and form a structure called the  blastocyst . This occurs before implantation into the uterus. The blastocyst comprises three cell types: cells that will develop into the placenta and allow the embryo to attach to the womb; and cells that form the  yolk sac , which provides nutrients to the developing foetus; and the  epiblast  comprising the na ve cells that will develop into the future body. In research published today in the journal Stem Cell Reports, scientists from the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute managed to remove cells from the blastocyst at around day six and grow them individually in culture. By separating the cells, the researchers in effect stopped them  talking  to each other, preventing them from being steered down a particular path of development.  Until now it hasn t been possible to isolate these na ve stem cells, even though we ve had the technology to do it in mice for thirty years   leading some people to doubt it would be possible,  explains Ge Guo, the study s first author,  but we ve managed to extract the cells and grow them individually in culture. Na ve stem cells have many potential applications, from regenerative medicine to modelling human disorders.  Na ve pluripotent stem cells in principle have no restrictions on the types of adult tissue into which they can develop, which means they may have promising therapeutic uses in regenerative medicine to treat devastating conditions that affect various organs and tissues, particularly those that have poor regenerative capacity, such as the heart, brain and pancreas. Dr Jenny Nichols, joint senior author of the study, says that one of the most exciting applications of their new technique would be to study disorders that arise from cells that contain an abnormal number of chromosomes. Ordinarily, the body contains 23 pairs of identical chromosomes (22 pairs and one pair of sex chromosomes), but some children are born with additional copies, which can cause problems   for example, children with Down s syndrome are born with three copies of chromosome 21.  Even in many  normal  early-stage embryos, we find several cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes,  explains Dr Nichols.  Because we can separate the cells and culture them individually, we could potentially generate  healthy  and  affected  cell lines. This would allow us to generate and compare tissues of two models, one  healthy  and one that is genetically-identical other than the surplus chromosome. This could provide new insights into conditions such as Down s syndrome.  - See more at: http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-develop-very-early-stage-human-stem-cell-lines-for-first-time#sthash.1yyaOFHN.dpuf","Published: March 14, 2016"

Their algorithm may help researchers find new therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. Metabolic pathways are immense networks of biochemical reactions that keep organisms functioning and are also implicated in many diseases. They present the kind of challenges  big data  projects are designed to address. In recent years, computer scientists have built many ways to model these networks in humans, particularly since the 2007 introduction of the first genome-scale model of human metabolic pathways. But the big picture doesn t have all the answers. A pathway in the liver might not act the same way as an identical chain in the muscle. To that end, the Rice lab of bioengineer Amina Qutub designed an algorithm, Cost Optimization Reaction Dependency Assessment (CORDA), to model metabolic pathways specific to their home tissues. CORDA is detailed in an open-access paper by Qutub and Rice graduate student Andr  Schultz this month in PLOS Computational Biology. In the new CORDA algorithm, metabolic reactions not supported by experimental data are assigned a high  cost  that gives them less importance. For accuracy, this cost is minimized in a method that depends on flux balance analysis, a standard method for simulating metabolism in a network. The researchers expect their algorithm will be a broad tool to model cell- and tissue-specific metabolism.  CORDA yields tissue-specific models that are more comprehensive and functional than previous algorithms,  Schultz said.  The algorithm allows us to quickly compare models and understand differences across tissues.  To test their method, Schultz and Qutub generated a library of 76 healthy and 20 cancer-specific metabolic reconstructions. From these models, they identified metabolic similarities between the healthy tissues of different origins, as well as key differences between the healthy and cancerous tissues. In one example, the team looked at 271 metabolites (small molecules produced in the process of metabolism) known to be present in all of the models. The researchers found that two   both essential to fatty-acid and glycerophospholipid pathways   stood out as essential selectively for cancer models. This comparison also highlighted the up-regulation of folate metabolism, the down-regulation of thiamine metabolism and tight regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in cancerous tissues.  Interestingly, although cancer metabolism has often been thought of collectively, CORDA was able to capture key differences between different cancer types,  Qutub said.  In the future, the fast computational approach introduced by CORDA will allow for the high-throughput generation of patient-specific models of metabolism. ","Published: March 14, 2016"

A collaborative team comprising researchers from Cardiff and Osaka University in Japan describe their findings today in Nature. The eye is composed of highly specialized tissues that are derived from a variety of cell lineages during development.  Previous studies have demonstrated that particular cell types, such as those that constitute the retina or cornea, can be created in the laboratory from pluripotent stem cells. However, these studies do not represent the complexity of whole eye development. These latest experiments report the generation of multiple cell lineages of the eye, including the lens, cornea, and conjunctiva, using human induced pluripotent stem cells.  The scientists have been able to show that the corneal epithelial cells can be cultivated and transplanted onto the eyes of rabbits with experimentally induced blindness to surgically repair the front of the eye.  Study co-author, Professor Andrew Quantock from the School of Optometry and Vision Sciences, said:  This research shows that various types of human stem cells are able to take on the characteristics of the cornea, lens and retina.   Importantly, it demonstrates that one cell type - the corneal epithelium - could be further grown in the lab and then transplanted on to a rabbit s eye where it was functional, achieving recovered vision.  Our work not only holds potential for developing cells for treatment of other areas of the eye, but could set the stage for future human clinical trials of anterior eye transplantation to restore visual function.

Professor Milica Radisic (IBBME, ChemE), graduate student Boyang Zhang and their collaborators are among those research groups around the world racing to find ways to grow human tissues in the lab, under conditions that mimic a real person s body. They have developed unique methods for manufacturing small, intricate scaffolds for individual cells to grow on. These artificial environments produce cells and tissues that resemble the real thing more closely than those grown lying flat in a petri dish. The team s recent creations have included BiowireTM   an innovative method of growing heart cells around a silk suture   as well as a scaffold for heart cells that snaps together like sheets of Velcro . But AngioChip takes tissue engineering to a whole new level.  It s a fully three-dimensional structure complete with internal blood vessels,  says Radisic.  It behaves just like vasculature, and around it there is a lattice for other cells to attach and grow.  The work   which is published today in the journal Nature Materials   was produced collaboratively with researchers from across U of T, including ProfessorMichael Sefton (ChemE, IBBME), Professor Aaron Wheeler (Chemistry, IBBME) and their research teams, as well as researchers from Toronto General Hospital and University Health Network. Zhang built the scaffold out of POMaC, a polymer that is both biodegradable and biocompatible. The scaffold is built out of a series of thin layers, stamped with a pattern of channels that are each about 50 to 100 micrometres wide. The layers, which resemble the computer microchips, are then stacked into a 3D structure of synthetic blood vessels. As each layer is added, UV light is used to cross-link the polymer and bond it to the layer below. When the structure is finished, it is bathed in a liquid containing living cells. The cells quickly attach to the inside and outside of the channels and begin growing just as they would in the human body.  Previously, people could only do this using devices that squish the cells between sheets of silicone and glass,  says Radisic.  You needed several pumps and vacuum lines to run just one chip. Our system runs in a normal cell culture dish, and there are no pumps; we use pressure heads to perfuse media through the vasculature. The wells are open, so you can easily access the tissue.  Using the platform, the team has built model versions of both heart and liver tissues that function like the real thing.  Our liver actually produced urea and metabolized drugs,  says Radisic. They can connect the blood vessels of the two artificial organs, thereby modelling not just the organs themselves, but the interactions between them. They ve even injected white blood cells into the vessels and watched as they squeezed through gaps in the vessel wall to reach the tissue on the other side, just as they do in the human body. AngioChip has great potential in the field of pharmaceutical testing. Current drug-testing methods, such as animal testing and controlled clinical trials, are costly and fraught with ethical concerns. Testing on lab-grown human tissues would provide a realistic model at a fraction of the cost, but this area of research is still in its infancy.  In the last few years, it has become possible to order cultures of human cells for testing, but they re grown on a plate, a two-dimensional environment,  says Radisic.  They don t capture all the functional hallmarks of a real heart muscle, for example.  A more realistic platform like AngioChip could enable drug companies to detect dangerous side effects and interactions between organ compartments long before their products reach the market, saving countless lives. It could also be used to understand and validate the effectiveness of current drugs and even to screen libraries of chemical compounds to discover new drugs. Through TARA Biosystems Inc., a spin-off company co-founded by Radisic, the team is already working on commercializing the technology. In future, Radisic envisions her lab-grown tissues being implanted into the body to repair organs damaged by disease. Because the cells used to seed the platform can come from anyone, the new tissues could be genetically identical to the intended host, reducing the risk of organ rejection. Even in its current form, the team has shown that the AngioChip can be implanted into a living animal, its artificial blood vessels connected to a real circulatory system. The polymer scaffolding itself simply biodegrades after several months. The team still has much work to do. Each AngioChip is currently made by hand; if the platform is to be used industrially, the team will need to develop high-throughput manufacturing methods to create many copies at once. Still, the potential is obvious.  It really is multifunctional, and solves many problems in the tissue engineering space,  says Radisic.  It s truly next-generation. ","Published: March 14, 2016"

A team led by Professor of Biology Welkin Johnson took one such long look back and revealed the global spread of an ancient group of retroviruses that affected about 28 of 50 modern mammals' ancestors some 15 to 30 million years ago. One of the most extensive viral evolutionary reconstructions undertaken generated a  family tree  that shows a virus that jumped from one host species to another and crisscrossed all but the polar regions of the globe during its lifetime. Just as a paleontologist might reconstruct a dinosaur skeleton from a few fossilized bones dug from the Earth, Johnson and his team relied on  viral fossils    bits of viral genetic sequences that persist today as now harmless codes embedded in the DNA of species that once played host to the viruses.  You can think of the virus sequences that are in nearly every human genome as molecular viral fossils,  says Johnson, whose research combines traditional, molecular virology with evolutionary genetics, in order to study how viruses adapt to their hosts.  They hold the secrets to viruses that are now extinct, but in the same way that bones can be used to reconstruct human evolution, these sequences can be used to reconstruct when and where these viruses existed and what species they infected,  says Johnson, who is also chairman of the Biology Department at BC. Retroviruses are abundant in nature and include human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and -2) and human T-cell leukemia viruses. The scientists' findings on a specific group of these viruses called ERV-Fc, to be published in the journal eLife, show that they affected a wide range of hosts, including species as diverse as carnivores, rodents, and primates. The distribution of ERV-Fc among these ancient mammals suggests the viruses spread to every continent except Antarctica and Australia, and that they jumped from one species to another more than 20 times. The study also places the origins of ERV-Fc at least as far back as the beginning of the Oligocene epoch, a period of dramatic global change marked partly by climatic cooling that led to the Ice Ages. Vast expanses of grasslands emerged around this time, along with large mammals as the world's predominate fauna. ""Viruses have been with us for billions of years, and exist everywhere that life is found. They therefore have a significant impact on the ecology and evolution of all organisms, from bacteria to humans,"" says Johnson. ""Unfortunately, viruses do not leave fossils behind, meaning we know very little about how they originate and evolve."" Using ""fossil"" remnants, the team sought to uncover the natural history of ERV-Fc. They were especially curious to know where and when these pathogens were found in the ancient world, which species they infected, and how they adapted to their mammalian hosts. To do this, they first performed an exhaustive search of mammalian genome sequence databases for ERV-Fc loci and then compared the recovered sequences. For each genome with sufficient ERV-Fc sequence, they reconstructed the sequences of proteins representing the virus that colonized the ancestors of that particular species. These sequences were then used to infer the natural history and evolutionary relationships of ERV-Fc-related viruses. The studies also allowed the team to pinpoint patterns of evolutionary change in the genes of these viruses, reflecting their adaptation to different kinds of mammalian hosts. Perhaps most interestingly, the researchers found that these viruses often exchanged genes with each other and with other viruses, suggesting that genetic recombination played a significant role in their evolutionary success. ""Mammalian genomes contain hundreds of thousands of ancient viral fossils similar to ERV-Fc,"" says lead author William E. Diehl, who conducted the study while a post-doctoral researcher in the Johnson lab. Diehl is now at the University of Massachusetts. ""The challenge will now be to use ancient viral sequences for looking back in time, which may prove insightful for predicting the long-term consequences of newly emerging viral infections,  Diehl says.  For example, we could potentially assess the impact of HIV on human health 30 million years from now. The method will allow us to better understand when and why new viruses emerge and how long-term contact with them impacts the evolution of host organisms."" Johnson says the findings may be able to help researchers who are studying contemporary viruses, their jump between species and their emergence in new parts of the world.  My hope that what we ve learned here can open up the door for this line of research so the methods and approach the team used becomes something researchers in the lab can use to examine other viruses, including those we live with today,  says Johnson.","Published: March 14, 2016"

Drug resistance is the major reason for the failure of anti-cancer therapies and patient deaths. Despite major improvements in cancer treatment in recent decades, cures are still mostly achieved by early cancer detection and local therapy using surgery and radiotherapy. Once cancer cells have spread throughout the body and formed metastases (secondary tumours), the prognosis remains grim with 5-year survival rates being below 20%. Effective systemic drug therapies are needed therefore to improve the outcomes of patients diagnosed with metastatic disease. However, many cancers are characterised by intrinsic resistance, where there is no therapy response from the time of diagnosis, or acquired resistance, where there is an initial therapy response but cancer cells eventually become resistant. Arguably, the most important resistance mechanism in cancer cells is the action of so-called ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, drug pumps that act as a mechanism to move anti-cancer drugs from cancer cells. Of these, ABCB1 (also called multi-drug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) or P-glycoprotein) is the most relevant one. Previous attempts to target ABCB1 as part of anti-cancer therapies have failed. A major reason for this is that ABCB1 is expressed at many sites in the body, particularly at tissue barriers such as the gastro-intestinal barrier and the blood brain barrier. This has meant in the past that agents that inhibited ABCB1 were not specific to the interaction of the desired anti-cancer drug with the ABCB1 on cancer cells but affected the body distribution of many different drugs and food constituents, resulting in toxic side-effects. The new research demonstrates that certain inhibitors of ABCB1 specifically interfere with the ABCB1-mediated transport of certain anti-cancer drugs. This provides a first step towards the design of tailored combinations of anti-cancer drugs and ABCB1 inhibitors that specifically cause the accumulation of anti-cancer drugs in ABCB1-expressing cancer cells but do not affect the body distribution of other drugs or food constituents.","Published: March 14, 2016"

That's what researchers with the Vanderbilt Institute of Global Health (VIGH) found in a study conducted in rural north-central Nigeria. Their findings are helping to raise hopes that mother-to-child transmission of HIV will eventually be eliminated. ""We show that packaging individually effective interventions can have positive and measurable impacts on progress toward eliminating pediatric HIV infections in Africa,"" said first author Muktar Aliyu, M.D., MPH, DrPH, associate professor of Health Policy and Medicine and the VIGH associate director for Research. Aliyu also discussed the results of the study at the 2016 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston sponsored by the International Antiviral Society-USA. HIV infection and death rates have remained stubbornly high in Nigeria. According to a 2014 report by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Nigeria ranked first among all countries in the number of AIDS deaths in 2013, accounting for 10 percent of all AIDS deaths worldwide. Nigeria is also home to the second largest number of new HIV infections among children after South Africa, Aliyu said. Much of the problem is lack of access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which can prevent transmission of HIV infection from mothers to their babies and, in people who are already infected, can keep the virus from spreading in their bodies. Only two out of every 10 Nigerians who are living with HIV have access to treatment. In their study, the Vanderbilt researchers focused on 12 rural sites in Nigeria. They randomly assigned HIV-infected women who were either pregnant or had recently given birth to receive a special package of services. Another group of women, who served as controls, got the standard level of care. In the intervention group, men were encouraged to take part in their wives' care, and non-physician health care providers, including midwives and community health workers, were trained to provide a breadth of services as economically and efficiently as possible. In addition, point-of-care CD4 cell count testing -- a laboratory indicator of immune system function -- was made available, and integrated mother-infant services were provided after delivery. In both intervention and control groups ART was provided to pregnant women with HIV disease, breast-feeding mothers and infants who had been exposed to HIV by their mothers during delivery. At the 12-week visit, the incidence of HIV infection among infants in the test group was 2.4 percent, compared to 7.3 percent in the control group -- a 74 percent reduction in the infection rate. Culturally sensitive policies that include non-physician health care providers, engage men in the community and integrate health care services in resource-strapped settings thus can prevent maternal-to-infant HIV transmission, save lives, and improve outcomes for both mothers and their babies, the researchers concluded.","Published: March 14, 2016"

It also seeks to fine-tune the molecular structures of these compounds through analog design and synthesis to improve their disease-fighting properties and lessen their side effects. Such is the case with their synthesis of trioxacarcins, reported this month in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.  Not only does this synthesis render these valuable molecules readily available for biological investigation, but it also allows the previously unknown full structural elucidation of one of them,  Nicolaou said.  The newly developed synthetic technologies will allow us to construct variations for biological evaluation as part of a program to optimize their pharmacological profiles.  At present, there are no drugs based on trioxacarcins, which damage DNA through a novel mechanism, Nicolaou said. Trioxacarcins were discovered in the fermentation broth of the bacterial strain Streptomyces bottropensis. They disrupt the replication of cancer cells by binding and chemically modifying their genetic material.  These molecules are endowed with powerful anti-tumor properties,  Nicolaou said.  They are not as potent as shishijimicin, which we also synthesized recently, but they are more powerful than taxol, the widely used anti-cancer drug. Our objective is to make it more powerful through fine-tuning its structure.  He said his lab is working with a biotechnology partner to pair these cytotoxic compounds (called payloads) to cancer cell-targeting antibodies through chemical linkers. The process produces so-called antibody-drug conjugates as drugs to treat cancer patients.  It s one of the latest frontiers in personalized targeting chemotherapies,  said Nicolaou, who earlier this year won the prestigious Wolf Prize in Chemistry.

Adults with active copies of the gene produce enzymes that break down hormones and about half of all clinically used drugs - potentially reducing the effectiveness of some cancer treatments. Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, found that 7-8 per cent of around 2,500 cancer patients analysed had a cluster of single-letter variations in their DNA code causing CYP3A7 to be active in adults. If the results are confirmed in other studies, they could help to suggest ways of better optimising cancer treatments for patients with this version of the CYP3A7 gene. The study was funded by organisations including Breast Cancer Now, Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK. The researchers set out to determine whether the cluster of genetic variants - which had previously been associated both with levels of the female sex hormone oestrogen and with risk of developing breast cancer - was also associated with an increased risk of poor cancer outcomes. They carried out a series of analyses on samples from 1,008 women with breast cancer treated at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, 347 patients with lung cancer and 1,128 with chronic lymphoid leukaemia. The scientists found that 7-8 per cent of patients in each group - breast cancer, lung cancer and leukaemia - carried a specific single-letter genetic 'tag' in their cells which suggested they had the version of the CYP3A7 gene that was still active in adulthood. They found that in all three groups of cancer patients, the tag was associated with a poor prognosis, possibly because of an effect on the way these patients break down therapeutic cancer drugs. Among the breast cancer patients, the tag was associated with a 74 per cent increased risk of dying from breast cancer. Among the lung cancer patients, it was associated with a 43 per cent increased risk of death from any cause, and among the patients with leukaemia, it was associated with a 62 per cent increased risk of disease progression. The study suggests that in the future, modifying standard types or doses of chemotherapy might improve outcomes in carriers of the activating genetic variant for CYP3A7, which is called CYP3A7*1C . Study co-leader Dr Olivia Fletcher, Group Leader in the Breast Cancer Now Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ""Our study shows that some patients with breast cancer, lung cancer and leukaemia carry a genetic variant which increases their capacity for breaking down hormones - and potentially drugs. We showed that patients with the variant tend to have worse outcomes than those without, and one possibility is that they are eliminating chemotherapy drugs from the body too efficiently. ""We will need further studies to determine whether the genetic variant is exercising its effect by interfering with treatment, and if so, exactly how it is affecting treatment. Our research won't have an immediate impact on clinical practice, but in the longer term, doctors might be able to take into account the presence of this - and other - genetic variants in planning treatment, in order to make sure that all patients have the treatment that is best for them."" Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ""Initially, research into cancer genetics was largely concerned with establishing the effects on the risk of developing cancer, but there is now increasingly also a focus on finding out how a patient's genetic background can affect response to treatment. ""This intriguing study suggests that genetic effects on a person's metabolism, and how they process drugs, could have an impact on their outcome after being diagnosed with cancer. In the future, it is likely that genetic testing will form a much more fundamental part of treatment planning for cancer, so that genetic variants like this can be taken into account in choosing the most effective therapy."" Dr Richard Berks, Senior Research Communications Officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: ""It's crucial that people with breast and other cancers receive the most appropriate treatment, tailored to their specific needs. ""This work could help identify cases where certain drugs will not be effective for individual patients, saving that person needless treatment with one drug and opening the door for an alternative that may be more beneficial to them. ""Research into how to use existing drugs more wisely will be critical as we move towards a world of truly personalised medicine, and one in which people no longer lose their lives to breast cancer.""","Published: March 14, 2016"

This fish has surprising genetic similarities to many vertebrate animals - including humans.  Led by Drs John Postlethwait and Ingo Braasch from the Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, US in collaboration with the Broad Institute, the study of the Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) genome reveals that it is small, and manageable. Furthermore, it lacks much shuffling and duplication that occurred in the  main  fish ancestral line; it conserved its genome.  The Gar is particularly useful for biological studies because it bridges the gap between most fish and other vertebrates, allowing much more meaningful comparison than before. Its genome resembles the common ancestor of fish and four-limbed animals, such as birds. Indeed, the Gar s chromosomes show only 17 major rearrangements from the chicken s, despite the evolutionary gap between them. Prof Di Palma, co-author of the study and Director of Science at TGAC, said:  The Spotted Gar is a superb reference species, an out-group that provides additional statistical power to help define much of the functional material in vertebrate genomes that otherwise remains obscure.  Around 96 per cent of all known fish species are categorised as Teleosts (ray fins). The Gar belongs within the other four per cent and provides a highly informative comparative basis for evolutionary studies. For example, researchers have already used the Gar genome to find the genetic equivalent of wrist/ankle/digits in this living fish, confirming fossil evidence of an aquatic origin of fin to limb transition(1). The Gar branched off from the Teleosts more than three hundred million years ago, and conserved its genome more than might be expected since then. So far, we only know of one fish species that may have evolved more slowly   the coelacanth, often referred to as a  living fossil . To a casual observer, the Gar largely resembles a typical fish   but it does have rather unusual  ganoid  scales, with a primitive sort of enamel for strength. Its genome sequence has two genes involved in mineralization of enamels for those scales   evidence that  enamel genes  evolved in early vertebrates before they were recruited to teeth. Teleost fish, by contrast, lack those enamel genes; only the Gar provides the clues for sorting out the evolutionary tree for that gene family(2). Prof Di Palma, added:  The Gar genome clarifies the evolutionary history of many important gene families, including numerous ancestral noncoding elements.  Prof John Postlethwait, commented:  Especially important for understanding human health and disease, the gar genome helps identify genetic sequences that are shared by human disease genes and teleost fish medical models like zebrafish; by studying those otherwise invisible shared elements, we will be able to better understand human complex diseases like diabetes, heart disease, addiction, and the bone loss that comes with ageing.

The NeoSpectra sensors offer developers a finely-tuned sensor module to create mobile devices that can instantly analyze materials on the spot   from oil and gas samples to pharmaceuticals, food and soil   through measuring spectral response. Delivering the same functionality as conventional  bench-top  spectrometers in labs, the NeoSpectra module brings to end-users the ability to immediately quantify composition, detect impurities and ascertain quality, speeding analysis of samples from days to minutes without the need for offsite lab verification. NeoSpectra sensors are the smallest and the lowest cost Fourier Transform InfraRed (FT-IR) spectrometers on the market today. Built around micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) components that are fabricated using cost-effective, high-volume semiconductor techniques, the module covers a wide spectral range, consumes very little power, and is about the size of a smartphone. The first generation of NeoSpectra sensors operate in the near infra-red (NIR) spectral range with three different configurations available between 1,150nm and 2,500nm, enabling material composition analysis and/or identification in a wide range of application areas. Unlike existing miniaturized NIR spectroscopy solutions, NeoSpectra sensors are constructed from permanently aligned, highly reproducible components.  Over the last few decades, we have witnessed how high volume semiconductor technologies including MEMS have played a disruptive role in many industries,  said Bassam Saadany, Optical MEMS division manager at SWS.  We believe that NeoSpectra ignites this disruption in the spectroscopy arena.  NeoSpectra sensors are being designed into analytical products in a range of industries including agricultural, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, food processing and other kinds of instrumentation. The small size and low cost of the module is sparking development of innovative hand-held measurement tools that were not previously possible due to size and cost constraints. NeoSpectra delivers added revenue potential to developers by enabling non-specialist professionals   from farmers to pharmacists   to conduct material analysis onsite rather than sending samples to a lab.  We are amazed by the innovative applications that our developer customers continue to bring us that capitalize on the small footprint and scalability of NeoSpectra sensors,  said Scott Smyser, VP of marketing and business development at SWS.  These developers combine the legacy of conventional NIR spectroscopy analysis methodologies with new features enabled by NeoSpectra to deploy never-seen instruments that can be used by non-experts.

So we are seeing the opening up of a new field of research into obtaining terahertz radiation that has a whole host of applications.  The UPV/EHU's Nano-bio Spectroscopy Research Group led by  ngel Rubio, a UPV/EHU professor in the Department of Materials Physics and director of the Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, has simulated the converting of ultraviolet light into radiation in the terahertz range by making it pass through a graphene nano-ribbon, and has put forward a new compact device designed to generate radiation of this type based on the phenomenon discovered. The research, conducted in collaboration with the research group led by Yoshiyuki Miyamoto of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of Japan, has appeared in the prestigious journal Nanoscale, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry (United Kingdom). Low-frequency terahertz radiation has a broad range of applications, such as the characterisation of molecules, materials, tissues, etc. However, right now it is difficult to manufacture small, efficient, low-cost devices to produce terahertz radiation.  This phenomenon ""extends the range of applicability of radiation of this type to many other spheres in which it was not being used,"" explained  ngel Rubio, ""owing to the fact that one would have to resort to much bigger radiation sources"". The starting point of a new field of research To carry out this simulation, they used graphene nano-ribbons: strips cut out of sheets of graphene. In the research they concluded that UV light that exerts an effect on the nano-ribbon emits a totally different radiation (terahertz) perpendicular to the incident light. This phenomenon ""opens up the possibility of generating structures that will allow the frequency range to be changed using different nanostructures,"" explained Prof Rubio. ""A new field of research is being opened up"". Now that the existence of the phenomenon has been demonstrated, ""it would be necessary to see if the same thing can be done with a different type of light source,"" explained  ngel Rubio. In the research they used a high-intensity laser pointer so that the simulation would be correct, but it should be possible to use ""more accessible light sources"", he specified. What is more, another step to be taken in this field would be ""to use a set of nanostructures instead of a single one to produce an actual device."" The UPV/EHU group has worked on the proposal of the idea and its implementation in code that allows a simulation to be made on the computer, while the Japanese research centre AIST has been responsible for the numerical calculations. The researchers have used novel simulation techniques of first principles, methods in which the predictive capacity is very high: the behaviour of a material is predicted without using external parameters. ""The simulation techniques have reached a point,"" concluded Rubio, ""where systems that are later shown to actually behave in the same way experimentally can be predicted"".","Published: March 14, 2016"

Brooks Pate, UVA s William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Chemistry, is the architect behind the emerging technology that is changing the industry standard in chemical analysis. His advances in spectroscopy are opening new doors in everything from pharmaceutical research to the study of interstellar matter. Spectroscopy is used to study matter by recording the spectrum of light it emits or absorbs when hit with electromagnetic radiation. In the early 2000s, Pate and his research team developed a new method of spectroscopy that allows digital control over the process and thus a much more rapid rate of molecular analysis. Pate had received a MacArthur Fellowship in 2001; the so-called  genius grant  gave him $500,000 over five years. The UVA Licensing and Ventures Group later helped Pate license his technique   called FT-MRR, short for  Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance    to a Charlottesville start-up, BrightSpec. With a number of UVA alumni at the helm, BrightSpec has spent the last three years adapting FT-MRR for commercial use and sold its first three spectrometers last fall.  Since BrightSpec began, the applications have been devoted to trace analysis of chemicals, detecting small quantities of harmful chemicals in products, and in particular, looking at small amounts of solvents left in pharmaceutical products that are harmful to you if you continue to ingest them over time,  Pate said. BrightSpec s FT-MRR platform allows scientists to run analyses of tiny trace amounts of chemicals in minutes, a measurement process that could take days or weeks with older technologies.  What this technology has done for molecular rotational spectroscopy is kind of the equivalent of tube televisions finally becoming these flat-screen LCDs,  BrightSpec co-founder and UVA alumnus Brent Harris said.  Rotational spectroscopy was this big bulky analog technique. We turned it into something really advanced   digital, fast and reasonably priced for other competitive instruments. Now there s this brand-new tool that chemists can use.  In addition to its ability to quickly identify impurities in pharmaceutical products, the BrightSpec FT-MRR platform is also uniquely suited to perform fast chiral analysis, an important step in determining drug efficacy. The chirality of a molecule refers to a subtle difference in shape. For example, two chiral glucose molecules are made up of the same number of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms, but they are structured as mirror images of each other rather than exact copies. One is  left-handed  and one is  right-handed.   This structural difference really matters in biological systems and especially in the human body,  Pate said.  The body has a preference for left-handed or right-handed molecules and chemical reactions are different depending on whether a molecule is left-handed or right-handed.  Drugs that are composed of molecules arranged in the body s preferred chiral shape will latch onto internal systems more easily and treat patients more effectively. Pharmaceutical companies and other interested researchers send their samples to BrightSpec for these types of analyses or purchase their own FT-MRR spectrometer to run in-house tests. Outside the pharmaceutical industry, BrightSpec s method of rapid analysis also has applications for energy research, commercial chemical production and astrochemistry   the study of molecules in the star-forming regions of space.  The first three instruments we sold were to institutional and academic research groups,  BrightSpec co-founder and another UVA alumnus Justin Neill said.  Until a few years ago, if those researchers wanted an instrument with these kinds of capabilities, they d have to attempt to build one themselves. Now, they have exciting applications that they want to work on and they decided that they could get started faster by buying the instruments from us.  The first purchasers include the U.S. Department of Energy s Argonne National Laboratory, the Max Planck Society in Germany and the University of Valladolid in Spain. As the company grows, the BrightSpec team hopes to continue expanding its reach into different areas of chemical analysis. It has received multiple grants from the United States Army and the National Science Foundation to continue its work in small-business innovation and research.  The people that we sell to are people who already have everything, all the technology at their disposal and it s still taking them months to get to an answer of whether their sample is right or wrong,  Harris said.  We re giving them a technology that helps them innovate on their own research and products faster. ","Published: March 14, 2016"

Follow-up study is needed before this procedure could be implemented, however.  We used a novel light reflectance spectroscopy probe to evaluate surgical margins on radical prostatectomy tissue specimens and correlated the findings with pathological examination,  said Dr. Jeffrey Cadeddu, Professor of Urology and Radiology at UT Southwestern and lead author of the study. Light reflectance spectroscopy measures light intensity reflected or backscattered from tissues. When someone has prostate cancer, a radical prostatectomy is often called for in which the prostate gland and some of the surrounding tissue is surgically removed. Due to the amount of time involved with traditional techniques and the lack of proven clinical usefulness, analysis to determine removal of all cancer surrounding the visible tumor s edges is not routinely performed during surgery. As such, undetectable cancer cells can be left behind and are termed  positive surgical margins.  Patients with intermediate- to high-risk disease requiring radical prostatectomy were enrolled in the study. Immediately after the prostate gland was removed, light reflectance spectroscopy was performed on suspected malignant and benign prostate margins. Each sample was analyzed and correlated with pathological samples, which were analyzed post-surgery. Light reflectance spectroscopy analysis was performed on 17 prostate gland specimens, on which a total of 11 histologically positive and 22 negative surgical margins were measured. The optical probe predicted positive surgical margins with 85 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity, and 86 percent accuracy.  This study highlights one of a growing number of technology platforms that aim to improve the outcomes of cancer surgery,  said Dr. Cadeddu, who holds the Ralph C. Smith, M.D., Distinguished Chair in Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery.  Further study is required to determine whether such analysis may be used in real time to improve surgical decision-making and decrease the amount of tissue surgeons need to remove.  According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to skin cancer. After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in U.S. males. NCI estimated that 220,800 men would be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2015, and nearly 27,540 men would die of the disease   the most recent data available.","Published: March 14, 2016"

They occur when a blocked artery prevents blood from getting to the brain and usually result in long-term disability or death. Now, a team of researchers led by the University of Missouri (MU) School of Medicine has developed a new, real-time method of imaging molecular events after strokes?a finding that may lead to improved care for patients. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified ""During an ischemic stroke, harmful enzymes called gelatinase become overactive in areas of the brain where blood flow is cut off, said Zezong Gu, PhD, an associate professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""Over-activation of these enzymes causes brain damage. Our team hypothesized that if we could visualize and track this activity in real-time, we could then work on developing a way to block the activity and prevent brain damage from occurring."" Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to diagnose strokes because it produces precise, sectional images of the brain. Although these images can verify the region of arterial blockages within the brain, current contrast agents are not specific or sensitive enough to reveal important molecular events, such as gelatinase activity, on an MRI image. To overcome this obstacle, the researchers used peptides that specifically recognize gelatinase activity. The peptides were tagged with contrast agents through a process developed by research team member Roger Tsien, PhD, a biochemist and Nobel Laureate at the University of California, San Diego. Learn More: A prescription for better stroke care ""Once the tagged peptides traveled to the site of increased gelatinase activity, they were absorbed into the cells with this activated enzyme,"" Gu said. ""When enough of these peptides were absorbed, the stroke site was visible on an MRI. We tested this technique in both cell-based and mouse models of ischemic stroke. Using this method, we successfully tracked gelatinase activity."" Gu suggests that real-time imaging of this activity could lead to a better understanding of how to treat strokes and mediate the damage they cause. ""Our findings indicate that tagged peptides can be used as a non-invasive probe to detect and track gelatinase activity,"" Gu said.

Researchers and clinicians from Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust teamed up to develop the app after becoming concerned about the low uptake of certain vaccines amongst pregnant women. The app includes a personalised vaccination schedule based on the woman s due date, which can be synced to her phone s calendar, with reminders about when to get her own vaccines and when to vaccinate her baby during the first year of life. It provides different levels of information about vaccines in general and takes the user on a journey by explaining specifically how women in pregnancy can protect their babies through vaccinations. It explains the concept of protection through maternal antibodies and the general function of the immune system and the placenta. The app also tackles concerns about vaccinations with information on their ingredients and safety records, and it contains links and videos to other websites for further information. The app s developers were inspired to create MatImms because of the low uptake of the vaccine against whooping cough identified during their research. Whooping cough is the most common cause of death in babies from a vaccine-preventable disease in the UK and an outbreak in 2011-12 resulted in the deaths of 14 infants. A vaccine for pregnant women, introduced in 2012, can protect the baby until it receives its own course of vaccination after two months of age via the national infant immunisation schedule. However, a survey of 200 pregnant women in London between 2013 and 2014 revealed that over a third of women were not even aware they could have a whooping cough vaccination and only 26 per cent had actually been vaccinated. Similarly, only 38.5 per cent of pregnant women were vaccinated for flu nationally last year, according to a survey of 7,800 GP practices. Between 2009 and 2012, one in eleven maternal deaths was caused by flu and more than half of these deaths could have been prevented by a flu jab. When women were surveyed about what would help them to make an informed decision about taking up the recommended vaccines during their pregnancies, the consensus was that the information given to them was not sufficient and many had suggested that a net-based information tool would be more useful than leaflets. Beate Kampmann, Professor of Paediatric Infection, Immunity and International Child Health at Imperial College London, who led the development of the app, said: ""Whooping cough can have a devastating effect on babies and some continue to die from this vaccine-preventable disease. The whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy plays an important role in protecting babies from this infection. ""However, our research shows that a lack of effective communication is the main reason why women do not take up the recommended vaccinations during pregnancy. Our app aims to address the communication gap by providing a one stop shop for women to get all the information they need on the vaccines available to them during their pregnancy from health care professionals and scientists from Imperial College London. ""We hope that our app can help raise awareness, increase the numbers of women having the whooping cough and flu vaccines and protect more babies."" Professor Kampmann worked with Marielle Bouqueau, research midwife at St Mary s Hospital, part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Dr Beth Holder, Research Associate at Imperial College London to develop the app with input from other members of the Department of Paediatrics at Imperial College London and pregnant women themselves. The project was funded by the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre.The team will conduct a further study on whether the app is useful to pregnant women and helps inform their decisions around taking up vaccination during pregnancy.","Published: March 12, 2016"

A few years ago, researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health discovered in rats that awake mental replay of past experiences is critical for learning and making informed choices. Now, the team has discovered key secrets of the underlying brain circuitry   including a unique system that encodes location during inactive periods.  Advances such as these in understanding cellular and circuit-level processes underlying such basic functions as executive function, social cognition, and memory fit into NIMH s mission of discovering the roots of complex behaviors,  said NIMH acting director Bruce Cuthbert, Ph.D. While a rat is moving through a maze   or just mentally replaying the experience   an area in the brain s memory hub, or hippocampus, specialized for locations, called CA1, communicates with a decision-making area in the executive hub or prefrontal cortex (PFC). A distinct subset of PFC neurons excited during mental replay of the experience are activated during movement, while another distinct subset, less engaged during movement in the maze   and therefore potentially distracting   are inhibited during replay.  Such strongly coordinated activity within this CA1-PFC circuit during awake replay is likely to optimize the brain s ability to consolidate memories and use them to decide on future action  explained Shantanu Jadhav, Ph.D., now an assistant professor at Brandeis University, Waltham, MA., the study s co-first author. His contributions to this line of research were made possible, in part, by a Pathway to Independence award from the Office of Research Training and Career Development of the NIH s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Jadhav and his fellow scientist Gideon Rothschild, Ph.D., led the study under the supervision of their post-doctoral preceptor, NIMH grantee Loren Frank, Ph.D. , of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). They report on their findings March 10, 2016 in the journal Neuron. Prior to the study, researchers knew that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex play a critical role in memory-guided behavior, but exactly what neural activity patterns underlie these abilities remained a mystery. Previous studies had shown that neurons called place cells in the hippocampus become associated with particular places when rats explore mazes. During breaks when animals are inactive, they replay these place experiences in their minds. The place cells that activated while exploring the maze fire again in the same sequence, but on a much faster timescale. This is reflected in telltale split-second bursts of electrical activity called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), in the hippocampus.  We had previously shown that this SWR activity in the hippocampus is necessary for learning, but we didn t know if or how it might engage other parts of the brain,  explained Jadhav.  We suspected that in order to support memory retrieval, hippocampal and PFC activity during SWRs has to be coordinated.  When they examined activity in groups of neurons in the two regions simultaneously as rats were learning spatial tasks, Jadhav and Rothschild s team saw coordinated reactivation during SWRs spanning both the hippocampus and the PFC. In the PFC, they were surprised to see that this reactivation involved both excitation as well as inhibition of functionally distinct populations of neurons. Within a particular SWR, prefrontal neurons that showed spatial representations similar to the concurrently reactivated hippocampal neurons were excited, whereas prefrontal neurons with unrelated representations were inhibited. Any potentially distracting activity inconsistent with the replayed information coming from the hippocampus would thus be suppressed, presumably optimizing awake memory function.  Our results show that SWRs mark times of strong coordination between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that reflects highly specific structured reactivation of representations related to ongoing experience,  said Jadhav. In a parallel study, Frank s UCSF team focused on a neighboring region of the hippocampus called CA2. There, they were surprised to discover a distinct population of neurons that not only fire most strongly outside of SWRs, but also signal an animal s location when the animal is immobile, including during sleep. The firing pattern of these neurons was thus complementary to the firing pattern of the SWR-associated place cells found in CA1. The study revealed that the brain employs distinct neural codes for formation of location-specific memories depending on whether the animal is moving or still. Notably, CA2 has also recently been linked to social memories; social experiences often take place during periods of inactivity, according to Frank. Remarkably, the timescale of the firing changes from SWR- vs. non-SWR patterns were similar in the prefrontal cortex and in CA2, indicating that the brain rapidly switches between the two coding systems with split-second agility.  Delusions and similar mental problems involve mistaking internally generated information for real things from the outside world; it may be that the rapid and precise switching between past and present that we see in normal brains is impaired in psychiatric disease,  said Frank.

University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) chemists partnered with medical researchers from the National University of Singapore to develop a molecule that can inhibit an enzyme linked with the onset of stroke. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified Most strokes occur when a disruption of blood flow prevents oxygen and glucose from reaching brain tissue, ultimately killing neurons and other cells. The team found that its molecule, known as 6S, reduced the death of brain tissue by as much as 66 percent when administered to the cerebrum of a rat that had recently suffered a stroke. It also appeared to reduce the inflammation that typically accompanies stroke, which the World Health Organization has estimated kills more than 6 million people annually.  The fact that this inhibitor remained effective when given as post-stroke treatment   is encouraging, as this is the norm in the treatment of acute stroke,  the researchers reported in their study published by the journal ACS Central Science. The inhibitor works by binding to cystathionine beta-synthase, or CBS   an enzyme that normally helps regulate cellular function but can also trigger production of toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide in the brain. Though hydrogen sulfide is an important signaling molecule at normal concentrations, stroke patients exhibit elevated concentrations believed to initiate the brain damage they often suffer. Chemist David Berkowitz and his UNL colleagues modeled their inhibitor on a naturally occurring molecule produced by the CBS enzyme, tailoring the molecule s structure to improve its performance. By swapping out functional groups of atoms known as amines with hydrazines, the team ultimately increased the inhibitor s binding time from less than a second to hours.  We wanted a compound that would bind well, specifically to this enzyme,  said Berkowitz, a Willa Cather Professor of chemistry.  But we also wanted one that could be synthesized easily. Those are two very different considerations.  Berkowitz and his colleagues achieved the latter goal, in part, by plucking out the molecule s carbon-sulfur bond and replacing it with a double bond. Slicing that double bond gave the researchers two identical halves of the molecule. With the assistance of a Nobel Prize-winning technique called cross-metathesis, the team was then able to  synthesize two halves of the molecule for the price of one,  Berkowitz said. To test the effectiveness of the 6S molecule in treating stroke, Berkowitz and fellow UNL chemist Christopher McCune reached out to Peter Wong, professor of pharmacology at the National University of Singapore.  We started researching this and came upon Peter s work pretty quickly,  Berkowitz said.  We saw that he was one of the protagonists, one of the guys who is on the leading edge of understanding how (hydrogen sulfide) signaling works.  Though the research teams have never actually met in person, Berkowitz said videoconferencing and a steady stream of emails have helped overcome the barriers of time and distance. In the process, he said, each team has developed a profound appreciation for the other s work.  Peter ended up latching onto the chemistry more than we did, and we ended up latching onto the biology,  Berkowitz said.  It s actually been really fun. These are two kinds of science that are pretty far apart, and that s probably the most exciting thing about this: the interdisciplinary nature.  Learn More: Images of brain after mild stroke predict future risk Because the 6S inhibitor has demonstrated its effects in cell cultures and the brain tissue of rats, Berkowitz cautioned that it represents just an initial step toward developing a stroke-treating drug for humans. However, he said the proof-of-principle experiments effectively illustrate the concept s promise. Berkowitz also expressed optimism that the synthesis method detailed in the study could streamline the more general production of enzyme-targeting inhibitors.  We started out with a very fundamental-science perspective on understanding the chemistry of this whole class of vitamin B6-dependent enzymes,  he said.  We re in a good place now, because that science has allowed us to make these inhibitors and many others. We re now working on several enzymes that may represent important targets for translation of the basic inhibitor chemistry into truly therapeutic goals.

The study was launched to assess GenePeeks  innovative approach to enhancing the current carrier screening paradigm, in an effort to decrease a future child s risk for inheriting severe autosomal recessive diseases. The study will enroll up to 200 patients and evaluate the effectiveness of GenePeeks technology in identifying risk of conceiving a child that could be affected by more than 1,000 severe pediatric diseases. After participants  saliva samples are collected and sequenced using a next-generation sequencing platform, reproductive risk will be analyzed using these two different approaches: expanded carrier screening versus GenePeeks  analytics. Investigators will compare the accuracies of the resulting risk profiles.  We look forward to a rigorous examination of our predictive technology,  said Lee Silver, Ph.D., Co-founder of GenePeeks, Inc. and Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton University.  This study will allow us to demonstrate the advantages of our approach, which aims to give families access to the incredible advances in human genomics that have occurred over the past decade.  All people carry silent disease mutations that do not cause disease unless combined with another mutation in the same gene through the reproductive process. Carrier screening involves analysis of each prospective parent s individual carrier status to determine whether they carry any of a predetermined list of genetic mutations. However, the existing focus on a relatively small number of historically observed  knock-out  mutations means that the vast majority of disease-causing mutations remain undetected in the carrier screening process. In contrast, GenePeeks digitally combines the DNA information of prospective parents to create  Virtual Progeny  and evaluates their risk for more than 1,000 recessive genetic diseases associated with a wide variety of known and novel mutations that cause a spectrum of damage to the underlying gene. The company s proprietary technology uses patented informatics to uncover disease risk that cannot be seen with existing screening tools.  We are committed to providing highest-quality care for patients seeking reproductive assistance, and we are particularly interested in scientific advances that help protect families from serious diseases,  said Dr. Alan B. Copperman, Co-Director of RMA of New York.  We are pleased to collaborate with GenePeeks to evaluate the most effective methods for determining disease risk so our patients can make informed decisions about building families.

New investors, Fort Knox F rvaring AB, Partnerinvest  vre Norrland AB and Norrlandsfonden join founder investor Karolinska Development in this new financing round. The new funds will be used by Umecrine Cognition to conduct a Phase I (first in human) clinical trial with the company s oral drug candidate GR3027 in 58 healthy volunteers to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, and to establish clinical proof-of-principle with regard to the mechanism of action of GR3027. First patients have been enrolled at a clinical centre in Sweden, and results from the study are expected in H2 2016. HE is a frequent neurological complication and one of the most debilitating manifestations of liver disease affecting millions around the world. Caused by liver insufficiency, HE leads to a general depression of the central nervous system with clinical manifestations ranging from mild cognitive impairment to deep coma. This severely affects the lives of patients and their caregivers. The cognitive impairment associated with cirrhosis can also result in the utilization of more health care resources for adults than other manifestations of liver disease. There are no known treatments on the market that directly target the neurological cause of HE. Umecrine Cognition s lead candidate GR3027 is a GABAA receptor modulating steroid antagonist (GAMSA) designed to antagonize GABAA receptor activation by endogenous neuroactive steroids. The enhanced signaling from GABAA receptors is a key driver for the neurological symptoms associated with HE. In preclinical animal models, GR3027 normalizes key neurological symptoms associated with HE. Preclinical safety and toxicity studies suggest that GR3027 is a safe and well-tolerated drug. Magnus Doverskog, CEO of Umecrine Cognition, comments:  This announcement represents a significant milestone for Umecrine Cognition. Our short-term financial aims are to finalize the investor consortium with qualified investors that will take the company through to clinical proof-of-concept, which is primary efficacy data of GR3027 in patients with HE. We now have the first part of a strong investor consortium in place. I am very pleased to welcome Fort Knox F rvaring AB, Partnerinvest  vre Norrland AB and Norrlandsfonden onboard, and also by the continued support from Karolinska Development.  We now enter clinical development with GR3027, a drug candidate that has show unprecedented preclinical data in a therapeutic area where the treatment options today are very limited. The clinical development approach is to first confirm the treatment principle of GR3027 in this Phase I trial with healthy volunteers before advancing to HE patients in subsequent clinical studies.

The guide offers research-based principles that affect a child s self-control and overall mental health, starting during pregnancy through the eighth year of life. It recognizes that while substance use generally begins during the teen years, it has known biological, psychological, social, and environmental roots that begin even before birth.  Thanks to more than three decades of research into what makes a young child able to cope with life s inevitable stresses, we now have unique opportunities to intervene very early in life to prevent substance use disorders,  said NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, M.D.  We now know that early intervention can set the stage for more positive self-regulation as children prepare for their school years.  Principles of Substance Abuse Prevention for Early Childhood addresses the major influences on a child s early development such as lack of school readiness skills, insecure attachment issues, and signs of uncontrolled aggression in childhood behaviors. Special attention is given to a child s most vulnerable periods during sensitive transitions, such as a parents  divorce, moving to a new home, or starting school. There is strong evidence that a stable home environment, adequate nutrition, physical and cognitive stimulation, and supportive parenting can lead to good developmental outcomes. Two supplemental sections for policymakers and practitioners go into greater detail on how early childhood interventions are designed and how to select the right strategies for a community s specific needs.  This guide is important reading for anyone who has an influence over a child s life, from early development through the transition to elementary school,  added Volkow. Principles of Substance Abuse Prevention for Early Childhood is the fourth in a series of evidence-based principles produced by NIDA, including: Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment; Principles of Adolescent Substance Use Disorder Treatment; and Principles of Drug Abuse Treatment for Criminal Justice Populations.

For the first time, researchers found that a specific enzyme can  tag  certain types of abnormal proteins to send them to join clumps, where they may be less toxic to the cell. See Also: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs  We have uncovered a new molecular mechanism underlying neurodegeneration,  said Claudio Joazeiro, associate professor of cell and molecular biology at TSRI and senior author of the new study.  This could lead to new diagnostics or new therapeutic approaches, especially for ALS.  The study, which was published recently in the journal eLife, provides a new perspective on the role of protein clumps, which have long been associated with some types of neurological diseases. Cells are made of millions of proteins that perform the essential functions of life. With so many players in a cell, things sometimes go wrong. In ALS, genetic mutations can cause nerve cells to accumulate abnormal proteins and eventually die, leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness and paralysis. To develop a treatment for ALS, researchers have been investigating the cell s ability to identify and destroy abnormal proteins before it s too late. In 2009, a study by Joazeiro and his colleague Steve Kay, now president of TSRI, reported that mutations in an enzyme called Listerin (Ltn1) cause ALS-like symptoms in mice. Then, in 2010, a study by Joazeiro and Mario Bengtson, a former postdoctoral researcher at TSRI and now assistant professor at the University of S o Paulo, Brazil, discovered that Ltn1 can identify abnormal proteins that have become  jammed  in the ribosome, the cellular structure that assembles new proteins.  In a sea of normal proteins, these enzymes are able to identify which ones are potentially toxic,  said Joazeiro. While Ltn1 tags abnormal proteins in the ribosome for destruction, for some reason it does not catch all of them. This led the researchers to believe that another enzyme in the cell s larger ribosome-associated quality control complex might be important for catching other ne er-do-wells. Using yeast cells and techniques in molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell fluorescence, the team found that another ribosome-associated quality control complex subunit, called Rqc2, swoops in to  tag  abnormal proteins Ltn1 misses. However, when tagged in this alternate way, rather than being immediately targeted for destruction, the proteins form clumps or aggregates.  This is the first evidence that proteins are tagged for aggregation,  said TSRI Research Associate Ryo Yonashiro, who was co-first author of the study with Erich B. Tahara, formerly of TSRI and now at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Learn More: Study shows more patients with ALS have genetic origin than previously thought The researchers think the clumps may act like traps to keep individual abnormal proteins from interfering with normal proteins. Proteins collected in clumps might also be easier for a cell to destroy. The new findings help explain why mice known to have mutations in the genes that encode the ribosome-associated quality control complex also show ALS-like symptoms as they age. These mice may simply lack the enzymes needed to maintain adequate protein quality control. In one scenario, mutations in the complex preventing protective clumps from being formed might be toxic. In another, mutations resulting in too many clumps could be detrimental as well.  Because we all have these enzymes we have been studying, we think it s very likely that this process is going to be relevant in human diseases as well,  Joazeiro said. The researchers plan to investigate further the role of protein aggregates and the molecular mechanisms that lead to ALS. The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI)   press release Yonashiro R et al.

The results could influence physical therapy routines for patients struggling to control their bodies after a stroke or spine injury. See Also: Do spinal cord injuries cause subsequent brain damage? Multiple different types of circuits of nerves control the communication between motor and sensory nerves in the spine. One, called presynaptic inhibition, works like a gate to control incoming sensory information and prevents muscle spasms. Another, called reciprocal Ia inhibition, coordinates pairs of muscles by making one set relax so another can contract, like when your triceps stretches out so you can flex to show off your biceps. Several studies showed that motor skill training influences these neural circuits, but scientists had not considered the speed of the training. ""We wanted to investigate if practicing a particular movement when moving slowly could change the nerves more or less than practicing the same movement at full speed,"" said Mr. Shinji Kubota, a former physical therapist and current PhD student in Prof. Funase's lab. The results suggest that different circuits of nerves respond differently to movement speed. The presynaptic inhibition circuit becomes more sensitive to signals telling muscles to contract after repetitive movements of any speed. The reciprocal Ia inhibition circuit becomes more active after repetitive fast movements, but is unchanged after repetitive slow movements. More inhibition of the nerves means the muscles will be less active. ""During physical rehabilitation after a stroke or a spinal cord injury, a common problem for patients' is that their muscles are spastic they contract and become stiff or cause uncontrollable shaking. Spasticity is speed dependent, so the spastic symptoms can get worse when patients try to move quickly, but slow movements are usually easier,"" said Kubota. Motor skill rehabilitation may be more effective if therapy routines reflect which type of neural circuit controls the physical movement. Learn More: New discovery gives hope that nerves could be repaired after spinal cord injury Skillful movements, like moving the arm to reach for a cup, are controlled by the presynaptic inhibition circuit which is unaffected by movement speed, so practicing at a slower-than-normal speed that avoids spasticity could still produce positive changes. In contrast, walking relies on the reciprocal Ia inhibition circuit to repeatedly switch muscle activity from contracting to relaxing and this circuit is improved only after practice sessions of fast movements. Advocating for scientific rigor, Kubota is cautious about claims for immediate clinical applications of the results. ""Injuries to the brain or spine present all kinds of challenges for therapists to consider. Understanding the mechanisms underlying changes in neural circuits will probably be a key element in developing effective rehabilitation approaches for people with central nervous systems disorders. My next goal is to create an animal model of stroke injuries and investigate if there is any link between changed nerve function and improved physical performance,"" said Kubota.

For people with head injuries, quick evaluation and treatment are critical. That s why researchers at Hennepin County Medical Center (Minneapolis, Minn.) and the University of Minnesota are launching an innovative, comprehensive study in collaboration with Abbott to better identify the range of brain injuries among patients. Using multiple evaluation tools, including eye tracking, blood-based biomarkers, imaging and cognitive measures, scientists hope to develop a new standard approach to help classify brain injuries, including concussions, and provide the information needed to guide doctors  treatment decisions.  We know that there are different types of brain damage that can occur after trauma, whether it s a mild concussion or a severe injury,  said neurosurgeon Uzma Samadani, M.D., Ph.D., Rockswold Kaplan Endowed Chair for TBI Research at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), associate professor at the University of Minnesota and one of the lead investigators of the study.  Our goal with this study is to combine multiple assessment techniques to quickly assess the severity of brain injuries and enable clinicians to provide appropriate treatments.  Using various tools to assess head injury Dr. Samadani s prior work suggests that eye tracking may detect injury in the brain, which is not always visible in imaging such as a CT scan. In the study, researchers will use eye tracking, which involves a high-frequency camera to map the positions of the pupils as a person watches a video or TV.  Data have shown a connection between brain injury and abnormal eye movements,  said Dr. Samadani.  With new high-resolution cameras, we can detect subtle differences in movement much more easily and objectively than in the past.  The study will also employ blood-based biomarker evaluations, as research suggests that certain biomarkers could indicate brain injury. Beth McQuiston, M.D., medical director, Diagnostics, Abbott and co-sponsor of the study says,  When someone experiences a head injury like a concussion, specific protein biomarkers will be found in the blood. If the protein levels are higher than normal, that may show a brain injury has occurred and serve as a warning bell that further evaluation is needed.  Abbott researchers are working on a test designed to detect the specific proteins in the blood associated with brain injury and help evaluate potential concussions. The test, which is currently in development, would be analyzed on Abbott s i-STAT   a handheld, portable device that is used to perform a broad range of blood tests right at a person s side. Lastly, the Minnesota Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Grant Program will fund MRI imaging to be used in the study to look for finer structural issues that may not be visible in CT scans. Imaging studies will include MRI scans not typically performed on trauma patients and may help identify tiny areas of bleeding or other damage to the brain.  Imaging tells us what the brain looks like, eye tracking tells us how well it s working and blood-based biomarkers can tell us the nature of the damage,  said Thomas Bergman, M.D., study co-investigator and Chief of Neurosurgery at HCMC.  When we put all of this information together, we will have a better understanding about brain injury that will help us treat patients now and in the future. ","Published: March 10, 2016"

Bladder cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the western world, with over 10,000 new cases diagnosed in the UK each year. Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) generally have greater than 90 percent survival rates over five years, but high recurrence rate and significant risk of progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) require continual monitoring. Current bladder cancer monitoring methods rely on repeat cystoscopy and biopsy. These procedures are highly invasive, unpleasant for the patient, and expensive for the healthcare system. With the grant, Affymetrix will develop a health and economic benefits assessment for replacing surveillance cystoscopies with non-invasive genomic profiling from urinary cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using the OncoScan assay. Identifying genomic changes in a non-invasive fashion would allow for improved patient well-being as well as delivering significant cost savings for the UK National Health System (NHS). The successful grant application was supported by research led by Dr. Richard Bryan from the University of Birmingham and an IUK Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform grant led by Prof. Mike Griffiths from the West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory. This research has demonstrated that key genomic aberrations evident in bladder tumor biopsy material can also be detected in urinary cfDNA with the OncoScan assay, even for very early stage NMIBC tumors. This work, examining a cohort of 23 patients with confirmed urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) was published recently in the European Journal of Human Genetics. The team showed that cfDNA from UBC patients is highly representative of the tumor genome and has a consistently higher tumor burden than DNA from exfoliated whole cells found in urine cell pellets, thereby allowing greater detection of important tumor-specific biomarkers. Dr. Bryan stated, ""Although the majority of non-invasive tests for bladder cancer currently in use or being researched seem to rely upon the DNA extracted from the cells found in urine, we have shown that the cell-free DNA from the remainder of the urine is much more representative of the actual tumor, and so potentially more accurate. This opens up so many new and unexplored avenues for the millions of bladder cancer patients worldwide who are waiting for a revolution in their treatment and follow-up. This is really exciting. We will continue to explore these avenues through follow-on funding from Innovate UK, and will continue to work with Affymetrix to try to achieve this goal."" Following a favorable assessment of likely benefits for the NHS, Affymetrix will seek additional grant funding to test the OncoScan assay s clinical performance and its ability to stratify patients who are likely to progress to MIBC compared to cystoscopy.  We are pleased to have the opportunity to demonstrate the cost effectiveness and utility of the OncoScan platform,  said Andy Last, chief operating officer at Affymetrix.  The promise of a non-invasive, comprehensive, whole-genome profile offers the potential to advance the way bladder cancer is monitored and treated, as well as greatly reduce the monitoring burden for patients.

Although 5-HT is predominantly known as a neurotransmitter within the central nervous system, new evidence points to additional important functions for serotonin in the periphery. A report in The American Journal of Pathology shows that experimentally-induced RA in serotonin-deficient mice is worse than disease reported in controls and that some effects of RA can be reduced by serotonin or its agonists (compounds that activate serotonin receptors). See Also: Serotonin's early role in the assembly of brain circuits These findings may lay the groundwork for new treatment approaches for RA.

The investigators used a mouse model of RA known as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) that produces features similar to that of human RA. Disease manifestations include cartilage and bone destruction, as well as the activation of cells responsible for bone resorption, known as osteoclasts. They compared the effects of CIA in normal mice to those in mice genetically bred with a deficiency in tryptophan hydroxylase-1, a key enzyme needed for serotonin production in peripheral tissues. The investigators found that both the number and activity of osteoclasts were higher in 5-HT-deficient mice with arthritis. In addition, more bone resorption was detected both at the affected joints and at remote sites. The serotonin-deficient mice with arthritis also showed changes in certain cell-signaling molecules known as cytokines (higher IL-17, higher TNF- , and lower IL-4) in their paws. Specifically, they displayed a shift in the balance between T cell subtypes, especially regulatory T cells and Th17 lymphocytes.

In a new study, scientists have found the brain cells apparently responsible for this innate wisdom. In a part of the brain responsible for recognizing color, texture and shape, Johns Hopkins University researchers found neurons that used large-scale environmental cues to infer the direction of gravity. The findings, published online in the journal Current Biology, suggest these cells help humans orient themselves and predict how objects will behave. See Also: Team finds long-sought protein sensor for the  sixth sense proprioception  Gravity is a strong ubiquitous force in our world,  said senior author Charles E. Connor, a professor of neuroscience and director of the university s Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute.  Our results show how the direction of gravity can be derived from visual cues, providing critical information about object physics as well as additional cues for maintaining posture and balance.  Connor, along with lead author Siavash Vaziri, a former Johns Hopkins post-doctoral fellow, studied individual cells in the object area of the rhesus monkey brain, which has turned out to be a remarkably close model for organization and function of human vision.  They measured responses of each cell to about 500 abstract, three-dimensional shapes presented on a computer monitor. The shapes ranged from small objects to large landscapes and interiors. They found that a given cell would respond to many different stimuli, especially large planes and sharp, extended edges. What tied these stimuli together was their alignment in the same, tilted rectilinear reference frame. These cells, sensitive to different tilts, could provide a continuous signal for the direction of gravity, even as a person constantly moves. In other words, Connor said, these neurons could help people understand which way is up.  The world does not appear to rotate when the head tilts left or right or gaze tilts up or down, even though the visual image changes dramatically,  he said.  That perceptual stability must depend on signals like these that provide a constant sense of how the visual environment is oriented.  Learn More: Ghost illusion created in the lab The team s initial discovery of cells sensitive to large-scale shape, reported in Neuron in 2014, was surprising because they found them in a brain region long regarded as dedicated exclusively to object vision. The new findings make sense of this anatomical juxtaposition, since knowing the gravitational reference frame is critical for predicting how objects will behave.  When we dive after a ball in tennis, the whole visual world tilts, but we maintain our sense of how the ball will fall and how to aim our next shot,  Connor said.  The visual cortex generates an incredibly rich understanding of object structure, materials, strength, elasticity, balance, and movement potential. These are the things that make us such expert intuitive physicists. Johns Hopkins University   press release Vaziri S, Connor CE.

The idea is that giving this formula to children at risk of conditions such as milk allergy and eczema, instead of standard formula, can reduce the chance of infants developing the conditions. The US Food and Drug Administration have previously approved a manufacturer's claim that a partially hydrolysed formula may reduce risk of eczema in some infants, and a Cochrane review in 2006 found limited evidence that feeding an infant hydrolysed formula may reduce risk of milk allergy in babies and children. However the new research showed there was no statistically significant reduction in risk of these conditions amongst babies using hydrolysed formula. The paper also revealed conflicts of interest in many of the studies - due to financial links with baby formula manufacturers. Dr Robert Boyle, senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: ""Despite parents being advised these hydrolysed milk formulas may reduce the risk of conditions such as milk allergy and eczema, we found no evidence to support these claims."" In the paper, which was funded by the UK Food Standards Agency, the team analysed studies that included over 19,000 participants. This new study is the most complete and robust assessment of all the evidence to date, says Dr Boyle. The study found there was no significant reduction in risk of developing eczema, wheezing, or food allergy (including cow's milk allergy). Some of the trials also investigated risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but no link was found. ""Not only did we find no evidence of reduced risk from hydrolysed formula, but we found very few studies which were methodologically sound and without a conflict of interest. For instance, in some of the studies all babies were started on the formula at birth, or a few days after. This raises questions about whether enough was done to promote breastfeeding to the mothers in those studies,"" said Dr Boyle. Professor Jo Leonardi-Bee, senior statistician on the study from the Division of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Nottingham, adds that the results may not be representative of all studies conducted in this area. ""Our research suggests that there was evidence of publication bias, where some studies that showed formula milk didn't actually reduce allergies may not have been published."" She says further studies into infant milk formula must be more robust. ""We need to ensure future studies are carefully designed, so that our guidance to parents is based on reliable evidence."" The trials analysed by the team mostly investigated whether hydrolysed milk formula could reduce the risk of allergies or eczema in children considered at a high risk of the conditions. This usually meant the youngster had a first-hand relative, such as a sibling or parent, with allergies or eczema. The trials compared hydrolysed formula to standard formula, and some trials made comparisons with breast milk or between two different hydrolysed formulas.","Published: March 9, 2016"

The research may help explain why certain people are more prone to anxiety. The new study shows that people diagnosed with anxiety are less able to distinguish between a neutral,  safe  stimulus (in this case, the sound of a tone) and one that had earlier been associated with gaining or losing money. In other words, when it comes to emotionally-charged experiences, they show a behavioral phenomenon known as  over-generalization,  the researchers say. See Also: Anxiety and the ability to predict an outcome  We show that in patients with anxiety, emotional experience induces plasticity in brain circuits that lasts after the experience is over,  says Prof. Rony Paz of the Weizmann Institute of Science.  Such plastic changes occur in primary circuits, and these later mediate the response to new stimuli. The result is an inability to discriminate between the experience of the original stimulus and that of a new, similar stimulus. Therefore anxiety patients respond emotionally to the new stimuli as well and exhibit anxiety symptoms even in apparently irrelevant situations. They cannot control this response: it is a perceptual inability to discriminate.  The study was a collaboration between psychiatrist Dr. David Israeli and Paz, and it was led by Dr. Offir Laufer, then a PhD student in Paz s group. Paz and his colleagues recruited anxiety patients to participate in the study. They trained the patients to associate three distinct tones with one of three outcomes: money loss, money gain, or no consequence. In the next phase, the participants were presented with one of several new tones and were asked whether the tone was one they had heard before while in training. If they were right, they were rewarded with money. The best strategy would be to take care not to mistake (or over-generalize) a new tone for one they had heard in the training phase. But people with anxiety were more likely than healthy controls to think that a new tone was one they had heard earlier. That is, they were more likely to mistakenly associate a new tone with the earlier experience of money loss or gain. Those differences were not explained by differences in participants  hearing or learning abilities. The research shows that they simply perceived sounds that were earlier linked to an emotional experience differently. Learn More: Social anxiety is highly heritable but is affected by environment Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs) of the brains of people with anxiety and those of healthy controls revealed differences in the activity of several brain regions. These differences were mainly found in the amygdala, a region related to fear and anxiety, as well as in the primary sensory regions of the brain. These results strengthen the idea that emotional experiences induce long-term changes in sensory representations in anxiety patients  brains. The findings might help explain why some people are more prone to anxiety than others. The underlying brain plasticity that leads to anxiety isn t in itself bad, Paz says.  Anxiety traits can be completely normal; there is evidence that they benefitted us in our evolutionary past. Yet an emotional event, sometimes even a minor one, can induce brain changes that can potentially lead to full-blown anxiety,  he says. Understanding how the process of perception operates in anxiety patients may help lead to better treatments for the disorder. Weizmann Institute of Science  press release Laufer O, Israeli D, Paz R.

MS is a disease of the central nervous system that results in damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers. Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty thinking a phenomenon often referred to as ""brain fog."" MS affects an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. See Also: Study of self-awareness in multiple sclerosis has implications for rehabilitation Damage to the thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that acts as a kind of information hub, and its connections with other parts of the brain play an important role in the cognitive dysfunction many MS patients experience. Researchers led by Laura De Giglio, MD, PhD, from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. They used a collection of video games from the Nintendo Corporation, called Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training, which train the brain using puzzles, word memory and other mental challenges. The games are based on the work of Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, MD. Twenty-four MS patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either take part in an eight-week, home-based rehabilitation program consisting of 30-minute gaming sessions, five days per week or be put on a wait list, serving as the control group. Patients were evaluated by cognitive tests and by 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and after the eight-week period. Functional imaging when the brain is in its resting state, or not focused on a particular task, provides important information on neural connectivity. ""Functional MRI allows you to study which brain areas are simultaneously active and gives information on the participation of certain areas with specific brain circuits,"" Dr. De Giglio said. ""When we talk about increased connectivity, we mean that these circuits have been modified, increasing the extension of areas that work simultaneously."" Graph shows mean cognitive test scores at baseline and follow-up in the intervention group (IG) and wait-list group (WLG). Bars indicate raw scores for cognitive test results. Paired t test P values are reported only for significant differences between baseline and follow-up. Credit: RSNA  At follow-up, the 12 patients in the video-game group had significant increases in thalamic functional connectivity in brain areas corresponding to the posterior component of the default mode network, which is one of the most important brain networks involved in cognition. The results provide an example of the brain's plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life. ""This increased connectivity reflects the fact that video gaming experience changed the mode of operation of certain brain structures,"" Dr. De Giglio said. ""This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis."" Learn More: First study of brain activation in multiple sclerosis using fNIRS The modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior. The results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS. In the future, the researchers hope to study whether the plasticity induced by video games in MS patients is also related to improvements in other aspects of their daily lives. They also plan to look at how the video game can be integrated into a rehabilitation program together with other rehabilitative techniques.

Dr. Chad Creighton, associate professor of medicine and member of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center Division of Biostatistics at Baylor College of Medicine, led the study that analyzed close to 900 kidney cancers at the molecular level. The team discovered that what have historically been considered three major types of kidney cancer according to their characteristics under the microscope, could be further distinguished into nine major subtypes through molecular analyses. Each subtype was unique in terms of altered molecular pathways and patient survival. This study made use of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Creighton and colleagues  findings are important because they help pave the way toward more effective personalized medicine. Each kidney cancer has unique characteristics. As a result, different cancers may respond differently to the same treatment. Understanding what makes each kidney cancer unique can provide clues to finding targets for effective therapies. The nine subtypes discovered by Creighton and colleagues were found to have therapeutic implications.  Different types of cancer can show different pathways being dysregulated,  said Creighton.  And for some of the pathways we have therapies we can use to target them.  In particular, the researchers found that a pathway called immune checkpoint was most active in a subtype of clear cell kidney cancer that is typically very aggressive. The immune checkpoint pathway can potentially be a target for specific therapies.  Not all patients have this pathway activated but molecular analysis would allow us to identify those patients that represent the best candidates for receiving therapies that target that pathway specifically,  Creighton said.  If we have this information, then we may have an idea of what would work better for the patient. The molecular information can potentially help guide better decisions for treating each patient.  For Creighton, this work also highlights a rich data resource that he and others expect will be used extensively by investigators in the field to continue advancing their studies of kidney cancer.  Much is going to be learned about kidney cancer with researchers using these data to answer new questions about the disease,  Creighton said.","Published: March 8, 2016"

These are the findings of two reports launched by researchers from Imperial College London. Both reports, produced by NIHR Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre (PSTRC), provide evidence on the current state of patient safety and how it could be improved the future. They urge healthcare providers to embrace a more open and transparent culture to encourage continuous learning and harm reduction. Professor Ara Darzi, Director of the NIHR Imperial PSTRC and senior author of the reports said:  For too long the mind-set has been that patient harms are inevitable, and that nothing can be done to prevent them. But keeping patients safe is a fundamental part of care. Although we currently face many changes   such as increasingly complex patient cases and limited resources   we must focus on creating safer environments for patients. This should involve a systems-based approach, and coordinating action across all levels of the political and health systems. We also must ensure patients and staff are integral to any solution, and not just seen as victims or culprits.  The first report focuses on the current system used by NHS staff to report patient safety incidents, called the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). The report authors explain this system requires refinement and renovation, so as to take advantage of new technologies and recent behavioural insights. For example app-based technologies offer a simplified platform that engages staff in the incident reporting process. This will not only improve the ease of reporting, but also the accuracy of data reported. In particular, the report reiterates problems around under-reporting of safety incidents, and reveals structural concerns within the NRLS, that have inhibited its usefulness as a tool to drive safety improvement. Erik Mayer, lead author of the report, from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial, explains: ""The UK has one of the biggest incident reporting systems in the world. But despite this, evidence suggests that as little as 5 per cent of patient safety incidents are reported. This is often related to the culture of institutions and the culture of medicine. For instance, staff may witness an incident that should be reported, but are hesitant to do so for fear of repercussions.  Furthermore, the information produced by the system is difficult to analyse, making it hard to spot dangerous trends or problems.  At the moment there is no standardised method to code or group the reports. So, for example, a delay in a medication being given may be recorded in a number of different ways, depending on the hospital. We need to standardise this and ensure that we have an improved approach to incident reporting.  The second report, Patient Safety 2030, suggests a  toolbox  for patient safety. This would include: using digital technology to improve safety; providing robust training and education, and strengthening leadership at the political, organisational, clinical and community levels. Other points in the  toolbox  include effective and high-quality education and training; strengthening measurement methods, including incident reporting, and exploring new digital solutions. However, the authors warn that interventions implemented to reduce avoidable patient harm must be engineered with the whole system in mind, and empower patients and staff to become more involved in preventing harm and improving care. Ultimately, both reports issue a global call-to-action on patient safety: both for individual health systems to convert the evidence on how to improve patient safety into everyday practice, and for the global community of health systems to share learnings from each other's successes and failures. The publications:  NRLS Research and Development Final Report , funded by NHS England, will be presented on March 8th at the Royal Society in London. The  Patient Safety 2030 , funded by a grant from the Health Foundation, an independent charity committed to bringing about better health and healthcare for people in the UK, will be presented on March 9th at the Patient Safety Global Action Summit 2016.","Published: March 8, 2016"

Along the way, a series of neurons in the eye uses electrical and chemical signals to relay the information. In a study of mice, National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists showed how one type of neuron may do this to distinguish moving objects. The study suggests that the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), a protein normally associated with learning and memory, may help neurons in the eye and the brain relay that information. See Also: Eye s motion detection sensors identified ""The eye is a window onto the outside world and the inner workings of the brain,"" said Jeffrey S. Diamond, PhD, senior scientist at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the senior author of the study published in Neuron. ""Our results show how neurons in the eye and the brain may use NMDA receptors to help them detect motion in a complex visual world."" Vision begins when light enters the eye and hits the retina, which lines the back of the eyeball. Neurons in the retina convert light into nerve signals which are then sent to the brain. Using retinas isolated from mice, Dr. Alon Poleg-Polsky, PhD a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Diamond's lab, studied neurons called directionally selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs), which are known to fire and send signals to the brain in response to objects moving in specific directions across the eye. Electrical recordings showed that some of these cells fired when a bar of light passed across the retina from left to right, whereas others responded to light crossing in the opposite direction. Previous studies suggested these unique responses are controlled by incoming signals sent from neighboring cells at chemical communication points called synapses. In this study, Dr. Poleg-Polsky discovered that the activity of NMDA receptors at one set of synapses may regulate whether DSGCs sent direction-sensitive information to the brain. NMDA receptors are proteins that generate electrical signals in response to the neurochemicals glutamate and glycine. When activated, they allow electrically charged ions to flow in and out of cells like water through an unlocked canal. In the early 1980s, studies in France and at the NIH showed that magnesium blocks the flow until the neuron is strongly activated and its electrical state rises above a certain voltage. This regulation is thought to be critical for certain types of learning and memory, and in amplifying signals in neurons. Learn More: Making artificial vision look more natural Further experiments by Dr. Poleg-Polsky examined how magnesium's control of NMDA receptors may regulate the firing of DSGCs. To mimic realistic conditions, Dr. Poleg-Polsky passed bars of light across retinas while exposing them to various background lights. The results suggested that the variable magnesium block that ensured the cells consistently sent information to the brain in response to the passing bars of light despite the distracting incoming stream of signals generated by the background lights. The NMDA receptors did this by amplifying the cells' responses to the bars in a process called multiplicative scaling. ""Cells in the eye can multiply,"" said Dr. Poleg-Polsky. ""The process may help these cells determine whether a tiger is sauntering by, or fast approaching as it's looking for dinner."" Neurons in the eye and brain receive a constant stream of information. The results of this study support a growing body of evidence suggesting that NMDA receptors play in critical role in how neurons relay information. ""Our results suggest that NMDA receptors help neurons distinguish relevant information from irrelevant background noise,"" said Dr. Diamond.

See Also: Mapping language in the brain The research also offers additional insight into why this type of dementia causes people to lose the ability to express themselves and understand language. Using a special imaging technique, Northwestern University Medicine scientists have discovered the toxic build-up of amyloid protein is greater on the left side of the brain the site of language processing than on the right side in many individuals living with PPA. Previously, amyloid accumulation in the brain could only be studied after an individual with Alzheimer's disease had died. This snapshot in time was after the disease had run its full course, and amyloid had spread throughout the entire brain. Now, a new technology called Amyloid PET Imaging allows researchers to study the build-up of the toxic amyloid during life. ""By understanding where these proteins accumulate first and over time, we can better understand the course of the disease and where to target treatment,"" said Emily Rogalski, the lead study investigator and research associate professor at Northwestern's Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center (CNADC). ""It is important to determine what Alzheimer's looks like in PPA, because if it's caused by something else, there is no sense in giving a patient an Alzheimer's related drug, because it would be ineffective,"" Rogalski said. The goal is to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life in order to guide treatment and identify regions to target for future drug trials. ""This new technology is very exciting for Alzheimer's research,"" said Adam Martersteck, the first author and a graduate student in Northwestern's neuroscience program. ""Not only can we tell if a person is likely or unlikely to have Alzheimer's disease causing their PPA, but we can see where it is in the brain.

Learn More: Future help for stroke patients with language problems This is the first study to examine and compare beta-amyloid buildup in the brain using the Amyvid amyloid PET imaging tracer between individuals with PPA and those with Alzheimer's memory dementia, the more common disease that causes memory problems. Both types of dementia (memory and language) can be caused by an accumulation of beta-amyloid, an abnormal toxic protein in the brain. By using Amyloid PET Imaging, Northwestern scientists at CNADC showed the toxic amyloid protein was distributed differently in people that had the PPA language dementia versus the memory dementia in the early stages. Researchers found there was more amyloid in the left hemisphere parietal region of individuals with PPA compared to those with Alzheimer's memory dementia. Scientists scanned 32 PPA patients, and 19 of them had high amounts of amyloid and were likely to have the Alzheimer's pathology. They were compared to 22 people who had the Alzheimer's memory dementia. Those with the memory dementia had the same amount of amyloid on the left and right side of the brain.

In fact, its life may depend on it. New research has identified a protein that promotes a sleep-like state in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Without the snooze-inducing molecule, worms are more likely to die when confronted with stressful conditions, report researchers in the journal GENETICS. See Also: Expert panel recommends new sleep durations The C. elegans sleep-like behavior is surprisingly similar to the sleep of humans and other mammals. In this state, the worm stops moving, relaxes, and uncurls its body. It also shows reduced neuronal activity and is less responsive to stimuli, but will then  wake up  if an experimenter pokes it too much. Like sleep-deprived humans, a worm that has been woken up repeatedly will fall back to sleep faster and will stay asleep longer than a well-rested worm. The similarities are not just superficial: many of the molecules that regulate this process in C. elegans, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), also influence sleep in mammals. This suggests that the worm sleep-like state is evolutionarily related to our own slumber. Because C. elegans is easy to experimentally manipulate and has a simple nervous system, it can serve as a tool for understanding how human sleep-wake cycles are regulated. Worms don t sleep on a day/night schedule like mammals. Instead, their sleep-like behavior occurs at specific stages during development; the worms enter this state each time they transition from one larval stage to another. They also sleep for several hours after a stressful event, including extremely hot or cold conditions or exposure to toxins. If they don t get this post-stress nap, worms are less likely to survive the noxious event. In the new research, the authors investigated whether a protein known to regulate rhythmic activities in C. elegans like feeding, defecating, and reproducing also regulates sleep. This protein, VAV-1, is active in a specific worm neuron that has previously been implicated in promoting sleep-like states via EGFR. The researchers found that VAV-1 was needed specifically in the sleep-regulating neuron for sleep after stress, but not for the type of sleep linked to larval transitions. They also found that VAV-1 is needed for maintaining normal amounts of EGFR in the neuron. The sleep state could be directly induced by genetically modifying the worms so that they overproduce VAV-1. Learn More: Key cell type in the brain that controls body clock circadian rhythms identified Crucially, VAV-1 is needed for the protective effects of post-stress sleep: after being heated to a sweltering 40 C (104 F), worms lacking VAV-1 function were substantially more likely to die within the following days. It remains unknown whether the human equivalent of VAV-1 plays a role in regulating human sleep, but the idea is worth further investigation, says study leader Kenneth Norman, of Albany Medical College. The human proteins Vav2 and Vav3 are expressed in the thalamus, a brain structure involved in regulating sleep, and, like worm VAV-1, the mammalian proteins seem to play a role in nervous system function and EGFR signaling.  Just as in mammals, the nematode sleep program is incredibly important for life. The mystery remains what is happening during sleep that allows animals to survive,  says Norman.  We hope we can find some valuable clues by studying this evolutionarily-conserved process in a powerful model organism like C. elegans.  Genetics Society of America  press release Fry AL et al.

While this discovery sheds new light on the mechanics of neuroplasticity, it could also help explain diseases like autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and dementia, which may arise when this process breaks down and connections between brain cells are not formed or removed correctly.  We have long considered the reorganization of the brain s network of connections as solely the domain of neurons,  said Ania Majewska, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) and senior author of the study.   These findings show that a precisely choreographed interaction between multiple cells types is necessary to carry out the formation and destruction of connections that allow proper signaling in the brain.  See Also: Blocking inflammation prevents cell death, improves memory in Alzheimer's disease The study is another example of a dramatic shift in scientists  understanding of the role that the immune system, specifically cells called microglia, plays in maintaining brain function.  Microglia have been long understood to be the sentinels of the central nervous system, patrolling the brain and spinal cord and springing into action to stamp out infections or gobble up dead cell tissue.  However, scientists are now beginning to appreciate that, in addition to serving as the brain s first line of defense, these cells also have a nurturing side, particularly as it relates to the connections between neurons. The formation and removal of the physical connections between neurons is a critical part of maintaining a healthy brain and the process of creating new pathways and networks among brain cells enables us to absorb, learn, and memorize new information.    The brain s network of connections is like a garden,  said Rebecca Lowery, a graduate student in Majewska s lab and co-author of the study.   Not only does it require nourishment and a healthy environment, but every once in a while you need to prune dead branches and pull up weeds in order to allow new flowers to grow.  While this constant reorganization of neural networks has been well understood for some time, the basic mechanisms by which connections between brain cells are made and broken has eluded scientists.  Performing experiments in mice, the researchers employed a well-established model of measuring neuroplasticity by observing how cells reorganize their connections when visual information received by the brain is reduced from two eyes to one.  The researchers found that in the mice s brains microglia responded rapidly to changes in neuronal activity as the brain adapted to processing information from only one eye.  They observed that the microglia targeted the synaptic cleft.The microglia  pulled up  the appropriate connections, physically disconnecting one neuron from another, while leaving other important connections intact.  Learn More: Study links brain inflammation triggered by chronic pain to anxiety and depression This is similar to what occurs during an infection or injury, in which microglia are activated, quickly navigate towards the injured site, and remove dead or diseased tissue while leaving healthy tissue untouched.  The researchers also pinpointed one of the key molecular mechanisms in this process and observed that when a single receptor called P2Y12 was turned off the microglia ceased removing the connections between neurons. These findings may provide new insight into disorders that are the characterized by sensory or cognitive dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and dementia.  It is possible that when the microglia s synapse pruning function is interrupted or when the cells mistakenly remove the wrong connections   perhaps due to genetic factors or because the cells are too occupied elsewhere fighting an infection or injury   the result is impaired signaling between brain cells.  These findings demonstrate that microglia are a dynamic and integral component of the complex machinery that allows neurons to reorganize their connections in the healthy mature brain,  said Grayson Sipe, a graduate student in Majewska s lab and co-author of the study.   While more work needs to be done to fully understand this process, this study may help us understand how genetics or disruption of the immune system contributes to neurological disorders.

Scientists at St. Jude Children s Research Hospital and the German Cancer Research Center led the study, results of which appear in the scientific journal Cell. The research involved the most comprehensive analysis yet of the genetic alterations and other molecular characteristics of primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNET). These rare, aggressive tumors occur in children and adults, but are most often diagnosed in young children and account for about 1 percent of pediatric brain tumors. CNS-PNET tumors arise from extremely immature and undifferentiated tissue in the central nervous system. The tumors are difficult to diagnose using current microscopic techniques, which has hindered development of precision medicine to improve long-term survival. Currently about 40 percent of young patients with CNS-PNET tumors are alive five years after diagnosis. Researchers in this study used molecular techniques to compare tissue from 323 tumors classified as CNS-PNET to 211 other well-defined brain tumors. The investigators found that 61 percent of the CNS-PNET tumors could be reclassified as a different type of brain tumor based on the shared molecular features. In many cases, the reclassification suggested a completely different treatment. The analysis of the remaining CNS-PNET tumors found that a majority fell into one of four distinct subgroups, each with unique recurring genetic alterations, including gene rearrangements, deletions and amplifications.  Important questions about proper classification of these tumors have lingered and stymied efforts to advance treatment by developing and testing targeted therapies,  said co-senior author David Ellison, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Pathology. He organized the study with corresponding author Marcel Kool of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Co-first author Brent Orr, M.D., Ph.D., who led the study at St. Jude, said:  In the future, these findings should help us assign patients to the appropriate clinical trial and to improve the design of clinical trials, particularly for precision medicines that target the newly identified genetic alterations that define these tumors.  Orr is an assistant member of the St. Jude Department of Pathology. The other first authors include Dominik Sturm, M.D., of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Work has begun to develop clinical tests that incorporate molecular markers into classification and diagnosis of CNS-PNET tumors. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating molecular information into the World Health Organization system of classifying brain and spinal tumors.  We have supplemented looking down the microscope with cutting-edge molecular techniques to better classify the tumors, which sets the stage for improved diagnosis, treatment and surveillance,  Ellison said. For this study, researchers analyzed the pattern of chemical tags called methyl groups present on DNA from CNS-PNETs and other well characterized brain tumors. Such methylation profiles are considered to reflect a tumor s cell of origin and to provide information on how closely tumors with similar microscope appearances are related. Based on the methylome profiles, 61 percent of the CNS-PNET tumors could be reclassified as different tumors of the brain or central nervous system, including high-grade gliomas, ependymomas and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs). Most of the remaining CNS-PNET tumors could be classified into one of four distinct subgroups based on their methylation profile. Additional analysis demonstrated that the methylation profiles correlated with other genetic characteristics of the four molecularly distinct CNS-PNET tumor subgroups. In contrast, some tumors from the subgroups were difficult to distinguish using microscopic techniques. DNA and RNA sequencing of the four likely new CNS-PNET subtypes revealed subgroup-specific signature mutations, including gene deletions, amplifications or rearrangements. Analyses of gene expression data identified other subgroup-specific differences in pathways that are disrupted in tumor cells. The disruptions feature alterations in genes that could be targeted for drug development. The tumor subgroups also differed in regards to the age and gender of patients as well as the treatment outcome. The findings suggest that the tumors would also respond to different targeted therapies.  The findings on this rare and devastating tumor would not have been possible without international cooperation,  Orr said.

The findings of the research, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, could in the future help to tailor rehabilitation techniques for patients who have suffered brain damage, such as stroke patients, and inform treatments for conditions such as dyscalculia, which causes difficulty in processing numbers. The brain is divided into two halves - the left side controls the right half of the body, and vice versa. Generally, one side of the brain is more dominant than the other. For example, people who are right-handed tend to have more activity in the left side of their brains. Previous studies have highlighted the general region where the brain handles numbers - in an area called the fronto-parietal cortex, which runs approximately from the top of the head to just above the ear. But scientists are in the dark about how exactly the brain unpicks and processes numbers. However, previous observations from stroke patients, who often suffer damage to the right side of their brains, have given clues that suggest large numbers and small numbers are handled on different sides of the brain. Dr Qadeer Arshad, lead author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said: ""Following early insights from stroke patients we wanted to find out exactly how the brain processes numbers. In our new study, in which we used healthy volunteers, we found the left side processes large numbers, and the right processes small numbers. So for instance if you were looking at a clock, the numbers one to six would be processed on the right side of the brain, and six to twelve would be processed on the left."" In their study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, the team temporally deactivated either the left or right side of the brain of healthy volunteers. They did this using a complex technique   the volunteers were asked to wear goggles that showed them a picture of either a horizontal or vertical line. At the same time, the participants underwent a procedure called the caloric reflex test. This is commonly used to diagnose ear and balance disorders and involves trickling either hot or cold water into a person s ears. Earlier research has shown this combination activates different sides of the brain. Volunteers then took a range of number tests. These involved saying the middle number between a number range, for instance between 22 and 76, or drawing the numbers of a clock face. ""When we activated the right side of the brain, the volunteers were saying smaller numbers   for instance if we asked the middle point of 50-100, they were saying 65 instead of 75. But when we activated the left side of the brain, the volunteers were saying numbers above 75,  said Dr Arshad. He adds that the context of the number was crucial.  If someone was looking at a range of 50-100 then the number 80 will probably be processed on the left side of the brain. However, if they are looking at a range of 50-300, then 80 will now be small number, and processed on the right.  After asking the volunteers to draw a clock face, the team found that when the right side of the brain was activated, the participants tended to draw the numbers 1 to 6 slightly larger and more prominent, with greater space between the numbers. When the left brain was activated, they drew 6 to 12 bigger. Caloric plus RIV shows the clocks drawn by the participants as they had water trickled into their ear and watched vertical or horizontal lines through goggles. It is the latter situation where one side of the brain was acitivated. The top row shows the right side being activated, while the bottom row shows the left side. Dr Arshad adds that people tend to have one side of their brain more dominant than the other, and can test on themselves which side is more active during number processing.  If you someone asks you to quickly name the middle number between two numbers - say 22 and 46 - and you overestimate the midpoint (34), you may have a relatively more active left side of the brain than someone who responds with 31. You can try this task a number of times with different numbers to see which side of the brain is most dominant.  He adds that the findings from the current study may help inform treatments for individuals who struggle to process numbers. The findings offer a starting point for unravelling how the brain handles and represents numbers   so-called numerical cognition. If we understand how numbers are processed we may be able to target treatments and rehabilitation therapies. The next stage is to examine how the brain handles large, complex calculations.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/peanut-allergy-prevention-strategy-204923,Peanut Allergy Prevention Strategy Researchers at NIH have suggested that the early peanut consumption will offer lasting protection  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The benefits of regularly consuming peanut-containing foods early in life to prevent the development of peanut allergy persist even after stopping peanut consumption for one year, new clinical trial findings show. The trial, called LEAP-On, was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The results were published online March 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in Los Angeles. The LEAP-On study is an extension of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study. LEAP showed that regular peanut consumption begun in infancy and continued until 5 years of age led to an 81 percent reduction in development of peanut allergy in infants deemed at high risk because they already had severe eczema, egg allergy or both. At the end of LEAP, participants who enrolled in LEAP-On were instructed to avoid peanut consumption for one year to help investigators determine whether continuous peanut consumption is required to maintain protection against development of peanut allergy. After the avoidance period, peanut allergy prevalence was determined, as it was in LEAP, by an oral food challenge. Only 4.8 percent of the children who had regularly consumed peanut-containing foods during LEAP were allergic to peanut following the year of peanut avoidance. In comparison, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 18.6 percent among those who had avoided peanut throughout LEAP and LEAP-On.  These new results build on the landmark findings from the LEAP study, which was the first to show that early introduction of peanut can prevent the development of allergy to it,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  They demonstrate that regular consumption of peanut-containing foods beginning in infancy induces peanut tolerance that persists following a year of avoidance, suggesting the lasting benefits of early-life consumption for infants at high risk of developing peanut allergy.  Led by Gideon Lack, M.D., of King s College London, the LEAP-On study enrolled 556 LEAP participants: 274 children who had regularly consumed peanut-containing foods from infancy to age 5 and 282 who had avoided peanut during the same period. Researchers then asked the original peanut-consumers and the original avoiders to avoid peanut consumption for one year. At the end of the avoidance period, the researchers assessed peanut allergy at age 6.  The findings clearly demonstrate that the majority of infants who had consumed peanut in the LEAP study did in fact remain protected after they stopped eating peanut for 12 months, and that the protection was long-lasting,  said Dr. Lack. Adherence to peanut avoidance was high overall, as assessed with a questionnaire and confirmed by quantifying peanut protein in dust samples collected from participants  beds. Some of the original peanut-consumers did occasionally consume peanut during the year-long avoidance period, but intermittent, low-dose peanut consumption did not result in new cases of peanut allergy.  The findings suggest that children who have regularly consumed peanut-containing foods from infancy to age 5 as a peanut allergy prevention strategy can safely switch to consuming peanut as desired as part of a normal diet,  said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation.  We expect that many will continue to enjoy peanut-containing foods consumed regularly, and others will maintain their non-allergic status with moderate intervals of diminished or no peanut consumption.  The investigators are planning longer-term follow-up of the study participants to assess whether the benefits of regular early-life peanut consumption are maintained over many years when followed by consumption of peanut ad lib, or as much and as often as desired.  Further studies are needed to determine the longer term effects of intermittent ad lib peanut consumption following introduction early in life,  noted Dr. Lack.  Parents of infants and young children with eczema or egg allergy should consult with an allergist, pediatrician or their general practitioner prior to feeding them peanut products.

The analysis found that 2.5 percent of adults   nearly 6 million people   experienced marijuana use disorder in the past year, while 6.3 percent had met the diagnostic criteria for the disorder at some point in their lives. A report of the study, led by Bridget Grant, Ph.D., of the NIAAA Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biometry, appears online in the American Journal of Psychiatry.  ...Marijuana use can lead to harmful consequences for individuals and society.  George F. Koob, Ph.D., Director, NIAAA  The new analysis complements previous population-level studies by Dr. Grant s group that show that marijuana use can lead to harmful consequences for individuals and society . In a recent report, Dr. Grant and her team found that the percentage of Americans who reported using marijuana in the past year more than doubled between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013, and the increase in marijuana use disorders during that time was nearly as large. The new study analyzed data about marijuana use that were collected in the 2012-2013 wave of NIAAA s National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), the largest study ever conducted on the co-occurrence of alcohol use, drug use, and related psychiatric conditions. The researchers interviewed more than 36,000 U.S. adults about alcohol use, drug use, and related psychiatric conditions. Notably, the current study applies diagnostic criteria for marijuana use disorder from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to the NESARC data. In DSM-5, marijuana dependence and abuse are combined into a single disorder. To be diagnosed with the disorder, individuals must meet at least two of 11 symptoms that assess craving, withdrawal, lack of control, and negative effects on personal and professional responsibilities. Severity of the disorder is rated as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number of symptoms met. Consistent with previous findings, the new data showed that marijuana use disorder is about twice as common among men than women, and that younger age groups are much more likely to experience the disorder than people age 45 and over. The risk for onset of the disorder was found to peak during late adolescence and among people in their early 20s, with remission occurring within 3 to 4 years. Also in keeping with previous findings, the new study found that past-year and lifetime marijuana use disorders were strongly and consistently associated with other substance use and mental health disorders. Dr. Grant and her colleagues also reported that people with marijuana use disorder, particularly those with severe forms of the disorder, experience considerable mental disability. They note that previous studies have found that such disabilities persist even after remission of marijuana use disorder. The researchers also report that only about 7 percent of people with past-year marijuana use disorder receive any marijuana-specific treatment, compared with slightly less than 14 percent of people with lifetime marijuana use disorder.  These findings demonstrate that people with marijuana use disorder are vulnerable to other mental health disorders,  said Nora D. Volkow, M.D., director of NIDA, which contributed funding to the study.  The study emphasizes the need for such individuals to receive help through evidence-based treatments that address these co-occurring conditions.  The study authors note the urgency of identifying and implementing effective prevention and treatment for marijuana use disorder. And with ongoing changes in the drug s legal status at the state level and a shift in beliefs about the risks associated with its use, they also note that public education about the dangers associated with marijuana use will be increasingly important to address public beliefs that marijuana use is harmless. As marijuana and alcohol are frequently used together, more research is also needed to understand the effects of combined use. Studies suggest that using marijuana and alcohol together impairs driving more than either substance alone and that alcohol use may increase the absorption of THC, the psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. In June 2015, NIAAA published a study based on NESARC data showing that alcohol use disorder (AUD) was on the rise in the U.S. over the last decade. The results showed that nearly one-third of adults in the United States have an AUD at some time in their lives, but only about 20 percent seek AUD treatment.","Published: March 5, 2016"

A 10-month training program improved muscle resistance to activity-induced damages and increased aerobic performance in mice. While swimming and running was both beneficial for motor neurons affected by SMA, different types of exercise had an impact on different motor neurons and muscle fibers. Swimming protected intermediate and fast motor neurons (the most affected type of motor neuron in SMA), and enhanced the cross-sectional area of large muscle fibers, while running only protected slow motor neurons and enhanced the cross-sectional area of intermediate muscle fibers. See Also: Treatment hope for baby muscle disease Physical exercise is known to induce benefits in some neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, but its benefits in other diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, remains controversial and highly debated for its routine use in patient care. SMA is a neurodegenerative disease and the leading genetic cause of childhood death. It affects motor neurons and leads to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. There is currently no cure for SMA and potential benefits of exercise in patients with SMA have not yet been investigated. 'Physical exercise' is a term that covers a wide range of very different conditions, including long-term vs acute exercises, concentric vs eccentric contractions and power vs endurance exercises. Therefore, the type of exercise could be the key in understanding the apparently contradictory effects of exercise in a given disease. For their study, researchers used transgenic SMA-like mice as well as a control group of mice (68 mice per group). For 10 consecutive months, 5 days/week for 10 min /day, the mice had to perform either a low intensity running exercise (favoring the use of oxidative energetic pathways) or a high intensity swimming exercise (favouring the use of anaerobic energetic pathways). Throughout the 10-month training, they evaluated morphological and behavioral adaptations, as well as the physiological adaptations. Olivier Bondi from the Universit  Paris Descartes and main investigator of the study explained: ""So far, the clinical care strategy for SMA patients has been based on symptomatic alleviation and physiotherapy. Active exercise has previously been avoided to minimise damage to muscles and neurons. Learn More: Study unveils new therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy Our study shows, though, that not only could physical exercise be part of a cheap, beneficial long-term care programme for SMA patients (especially compared to pharmacological approaches and walking aids), it also highlights the importance of defining a specific exercise regimen to limit the neurodegeneration process. Our research could provide several clues when designing rehabilitation programs for SMA patients; and the findings have already been used to design an innovative clinical trial for SMA patients in France (ExerASI, n  ID RCB 2013-A01331-44).

See Also: Amyloid plaques may be strangling blood flow Alzheimer's disease results from the accumulation in the brain of protein deposits that are toxic to nerve cells. The deposits themselves are largely comprised of insoluble aggregates of so-called beta-amyloid peptides short fragments cleaved from a protein found on nerve-cell membranes and they begin to form decades before any overt symptoms of dementia emerge. Now research teams led by Christian Haass, who holds the Chair of Metabolic Biochemistry at LMU and is the speaker of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Munich, and Professor Michael Ewers of the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD) at Munich University Medical Center, now report that the concentration of a specific segment of the protein TREM2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is significantly elevated in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. ""Our findings indicate that TREM2 plays an important role in the progression of Alzheimer's, and perhaps even other forms of dementia. It appears to be part of a defense mechanism that involves phagocytic cells that eliminate damaged nerve cells and toxic protein deposits, such as those made up of beta-amyloid peptides,"" says Haass. The new study is published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine. TREM2 is a cell-surface receptor that is essential for the function of specialized phagocytic cells called microglia, which are found only in the brain. Microglial cells serve as an arm of the innate immune system and act as the brain's waste disposal squad, recognizing and destroying cell debris and other types of toxic particulate material. The detection by Haass, Ewers and colleagues of increased concentrations of a soluble fragment of TREM2 in the CSF of patients with mild symptoms of Alzheimer's disease forges a further link between the protein and the neurodegenerative disorder. The same researchers had previously shown that mutations that affect TREM2 function also reduce the ability of microglia to clear amyloid aggregates and damaged cells. Learn More: Engineering self-assembling amyloid fibers In their latest work, the LMU team studied over 400 Alzheimer's patients who showed cognitive defects of varying severity, and compared them with age-matched controls. Biochemical analyses of samples of CSF revealed that patients who exhibited mild cognitive deficits had the highest concentrations of a particular fragment of the TREM2 protein found in the study. The amounts detected in patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease were significantly lower. ""This correlates with the level of activity of the microglial cells, which falls off as the condition progresses. This in turn presumably means that less beta-amyloid and cell debris can be cleared away,"" Haass points out. ""We therefore believe that this biomarker provides us with a way to assess the capacity of innate immune cells in the brain to degrade and dispose toxic material."" At the current stage it is still unclear whether the changes in the concentration of the TREM2 fragment in the CSF is a cause or a consequence of disease progression. However, the researchers favor the idea that the early increase in the level of TREM2 is attributable to the activation of microglia in response to initial signs of damage to the nerve cells in the brain. ""Our results indicate that the alterations in TREM2 reflect physiological changes that occur at an early stage in the development of Alzheimer's dementia. This makes TREM2 interesting from a therapeutic perspective,"" says Michael Ewers.

In addition, measurements of the levels of TREM2 in the CSF could help to define the most effective window for early interventions to combat or control the disorder.

The researchers have found links between subtle actions and reactions that allow cancerous cells to spread with little to stand in their way. The team led by Dr. Edwin Ostrin, an assistant professor of pulmonary medicine at MD Anderson, and theoretical biological physicist Herbert Levine at Rice, details its findings in a recently published study. The study shows for the first time that some aggressive lung cancer cells display significantly reduced expression of proteins known as immunoproteasomes, a key player in the process that signals the immune system s T-cells to attack diseased cells. The researchers suggest it may be possible to enhance the production of these proteins to override the cells  escape mechanism. Immunoproteasomes are produced inside cells, where they degrade unneeded or damaged proteins, including those produced by invading pathogens. The degraded pieces are secreted by the cell and bond to its surface and create beacons that inform nearby T-cells of the cell s diseased nature. If T-cells don t sense these surface beacons, called antigens, a cancer is more likely to evade detection and destruction. Data gathered over the years by MD Anderson researchers shows patients with early stage non-small-cell lung cancer   the most common type   who have low expression of immunoproteasomes are more likely to see their cancers return after treatment and metastasize. The researchers led by Dr. Satyendra Tripathi, a postdoctoral fellow at MD Anderson and lead author of the paper, set out to discover why immunoproteasomes are reduced in lung cells transitioning from epithelial-type cells, which bind to each other to form skin and organ linings, to free-floating mesenchymal-type cells. Tripathi had observed the expression of a cluster of genes that encode immunoproteasomes and their association with epithelial to mesenchymal transition.  Cancers containing cells that express mesenchymal markers tend to be later-stage, more aggressive and more metastatic,  Ostrin said.  Identifying this new mechanism opens a potential pathway for exposing these cells to immune attack.  Researchers at MD Anderson and Rice combined efforts to view the cause and effect of the expression levels of dozens of genes representing proteins from 42 non-small-cell lung cancer lines.  One of the main new ideas in therapy is to somehow get the immune system to fight against the cancer,  Levine said.  What we want to understand is how the characteristics of the cancer cells either enhance that possibility or preclude it.  Levine, co-director of Rice s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, said it s been known for some time that motile mesenchymal-type cells are relatively resistant to chemotherapy.  Now, what seems to also be true is that the cells are relatively more resistant to immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy aims to boost the body s own immune system to fight cancer. MD Anderson researchers led by Ostrin and Dr. Samir Hanash, director of the McCombs Institute for the Early Detection and Treatment of Cancer, profiled protein expression in the target cell lines and correlated the data to patient outcomes; meanwhile, the Rice researchers built computer models that allowed them to rapidly combine and evaluate protein-signaling pathways over time.  The idea was to leave no stone unturned,  Levine said.  We modeled the changes in gene expression that can be readily measured, how they might be caused and how these are correlated to all the other changes going on in the cells.  We want to go from the basic biology of defining the circuits and how they change the expression of these key proteins to showing that they really do have a consequence in terms of recognition by the immune system,  he said. What emerged was that the suppression of immunoproteasomes appears to be a consequence of feedback loops activated by the transition to mesenchymal-type cells. The next step, the researchers said, is to consider whether inducing immunoproteasome production in target cancer cells will counteract their evasion tactics. This might be tested in animal models.  We would hope that reversal of this downregulation through treatment with IFN-gamma, rapamycin or 5-aza-dC may work symbiotically with immune checkpoint inhibition that is currently proving so promising in many cancers,  Ostrin said.  From the lofty goal of saying how one should modify treatment of cancer, any purely modeling effort is going to be incremental,  Levine said of his team s contribution.  But in this study, because it has real data from real patients saying this is a real problem, modeling helps point us in a treatment direction we might actually begin to try.

""If the duplications and subsequent mutations of this gene during evolution didn't happen, then life would be completely different today,"" said Steven Pelech, a professor in Division of Neurology in the UBC Faculty of Medicine. ""The most advanced life on our planet would probably still be bacterial slime."" Plants, animals, mushrooms and more all exist because they are made up of eukaryotic cells that are larger and far more complex than bacteria. Inside of these eukaryotic cells are hundreds of organelles that perform diverse functions to keep them living, just as different organs do for the human body. The new research identifies the gene that gave rise to protein kinases. On a cellular scale, these highly interactive signaling proteins play a role similar to the neurons in the brain by transferring information throughout the cell by a process known as protein phosphorylation. This ability to transmit signals from one part of the cell to another not only enabled cells to become more complex internally, but also allowed cells to come together to form systems, paving the way for the evolution of intelligent life. Research into these enzymes has become very important to medicine. More than 400 human diseases like cancer and diabetes are linked to problems with cell signaling. Disease occurs when a cell gets misinformed or confused. Today about one-third of all pharmaceutical drug development is targeted at protein kinases. For more than 30 years, researchers have known that most protein kinases came from a common ancestor because their genes are so similar. ""From sequencing the genomes of humans, we knew that about 500 genes for different protein kinases all had similar blueprints,"" said Pelech, also a researcher at Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. ""Our new research revealed that the gene probably originated from bacteria for facilitating the synthesis of proteins and then mutated to acquire completely new functions."" The same gene that gave rise to protein kinases also led to the formation of a group of enzymes know as choline and ethanolamine kinases. The choline kinase enzyme is critical for the production of phosphatidylcholine, a major component of the membranes that wrap around eukaryotic cells and their organelles, but is missing from bacteria. Pelech says that the approach they used to study the evolution of this gene could be adapted to study other important protein families and could eventually lead to the creation of a protein version of the evolutionary tree of life.","Published: March 4, 2016"

Lead researcher Professor Michelle Coote from The Australian National University (ANU) said the team had overturned conventional thinking with their new-found control of the common reaction, which is used to make a range of chemicals from self-healing materials to the drug cortisone. ""It's the most unexpected result possible,"" said Professor Coote, a theoretical chemist at the ANU Research School of Chemistry and Chief Investigator with ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science (ACES). ""We now have a totally new way of thinking about chemistry. ""The breakthrough could speed up manufacturing processes and allow unprecedented control of chemical reactions, for example in manufacturing flexible electronic components based on organic circuits,"" she said. An electric field catalyst is completely different to conventional catalysts, which are often based on expensive rare chemicals and can create unwanted by-products or contaminate the final products. As electric fields can be turned on and off very quickly from outside the test-tube, the new approach gives the researchers remote control over chemical processes. Professor Coote predicted that electric fields could strongly affect reaction rates, but it had never been observed before because standard chemical reactions are conducted with molecules oriented in random directions in a gas or liquid. The Centre of Excellence brought together a team, including researchers from Universitat de Barcelona in Spain and Dr Simone Ciampi from the University of Wollongong, that devised a way to test Professor Coote's prediction, using the electric field generated by the tip of a scanning-tunneling electron microscope. The group oriented all the molecules in the same direction by attaching them to a surface, and then used the probe of the electron microscope to test each molecule. By changing the strength and polarity of the electric field, the team were able to vary the rate of the Diels-Alder reaction, in which a conjugated diene and a substituted diene form a cyclohexene system, by a factor of five Professor Coote said the result will help research understand a lot of natural biochemical reactions. ""Nature uses enzymes as the ultimate catalyst, which can vary reaction rates by 14 orders of magnitude,"" she said. ""Enzymes work with carefully oriented charged functional groups, held in precise orientations, effectively generating an oriented electric field within the active site."" Professor Coote started the project when ANU joined the University of Wollongong as an ACES partner and was introduced to colleagues at Universitat de Barcelona. ACES Director Professor Gordon Wallace said it is only a holistic approach to interdisciplinary research that can take ideas to industries in the shortest time possible. ""The collegial environment and multidisciplinary approach within ACES meant that we could mobilise all the skills necessary--from molecular modelling to exquisite experiments--very quickly to enable this amazing discovery,"" Professor Wallace said.","Published: March 4, 2016"

More than 80 percent of pancreatic cancer diagnoses occur too late for surgery, making chemotherapy the only possible treatment. Scientists from the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA and UCLA s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center have developed a delivery system for one chemotherapy drug that greatly reduces the occurrence of serious side effects while enhancing the drug s effectiveness against pancreatic cancer. The approach uses mesoporous silica nanoparticles to deliver the drug directly to the tumor instead of having the free drug spread throughout the body via the bloodstream. In recent years, the chemotherapy regimen known as FOLFORINOX, which combines the drugs 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and leucovorin, has improved survival outcomes over the standard treatment option, gemcitabine, which has fewer side effects. The severe side effects of FOLFORINOX, which are primarily caused by the irinotecan component, mean that only a minority of the healthiest patients can be treated with it. The silica nanoparticles used in the study work like glass bubbles that contain a large amount of irinotecan in pores on their surfaces. The particles are wrapped in a double layer of lipids, similar to cell membranes, which safely trap the drug without leakage until the nanoparticle reaches the cancer site, where it is designed to unload the drug based on the acidic environment of the cancer cell.   Because of stable drug retention by the lipid layers, the nanoparticles greatly reduce the amount of healthy tissue cells exposed to irinotecan,  Nel said.  The severe side effects of irinotecan largely result from its exposure to healthy tissues such as bone marrow, liver, and gut.  The researchers compared the effectiveness of the lipid-coated nanoparticles to an FDA-approved irinotecan carrier that encases drug molecules in fatty spherical particles called liposomes. In mice with human pancreatic tumors, delivering the drug via silica nanoparticles reduced tumor size more effectively than delivering it via liposomes. The nanoparticle technique was also safer because less of the drug leaked into the bloodstream.  This dramatically decreased the amount of severe side effects to the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and liver in the mice. The nanoparticles were also more efficient than the liposomes in treating the spread of tumors to surrounding organs,  Liu said. The researchers believe that a FOLFORINOX regimen could be made safer and more effective against pancreatic cancer using the mesoporous silica nanoparticle delivery system for irinotecan, Meng said. He added that they still have some distance to go before launching a human clinical trial, but with this study they have developed a normal strategy for irinotecan delivery by a nanoparticle. Their technique would make it relatively easy to scale up the technology to production levels, because the nanoparticles  effectiveness means that less of the drug is required for treatment. The researchers also found that their approach can be used to deliver several other chemotherapy drugs, meaning that it may also prove useful in treating other types of cancer.","Published: March 4, 2016"

It also can aid in conservation genetics efforts by helping to trace paternity and to track how males move within and between populations in endangered species, like gorillas. ""Surprisingly, we found that in many ways the gorilla Y chromosome is more similar to the human Y chromosome than either is to the chimpanzee Y chromosome,"" said Kateryna Makova, the Francis R. and Helen M. Pentz Professor of Science at Penn State and one of two corresponding authors of the paper. ""In regions of the chromosome where we can align all three species, the sequence similarity fits with what we know about the evolutionary relationships among the species -- humans are more closely related to chimpanzees. However, the chimpanzee Y chromosome appears to have undergone more changes in the number of genes and contains a different amount of repetitive elements compared to the human or gorilla. Moreover, a greater proportion of the gorilla Y sequences can be aligned to the human than to the chimpanzee Y chromosome."" The Y chromosome of mammals is extremely difficult to sequence for a number of reasons. One reason is that the Y chromosome is present in only one copy and makes up only about one to two percent of the total genetic material found in a cell of a male. To reduce this difficulty, the researchers used an experimental technique called flow-sorting to preferentially select the Y chromosome for sequencing based on the chromosome's size and genetic content. ""Flow-sorting increased the amount of the Y chromosome in our dataset to about thirty percent,"" said Paul Medvedev, assistant professor of computer science and engineering and of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State, the other corresponding author of the paper. ""To further enrich our data for the Y chromosome, we developed a computational technique -- called RecoverY -- to sort the data into Y and non-Y sequences based on how frequently similar sequences appeared in our data."" The Y chromosome, like all DNA, is composed of a series of molecules called ""bases"" that are represented by the letters A, T, C, and G. Current genetic sequencing technologies produce ""reads"" of sequence that are much shorter than the entire length of the chromosome. These reads need to be placed in order and pieced together by finding places where they overlap into longer and longer chunks. The research team used two different sequencing technologies to help with this assembly of the DNA sequence of the Y chromosome. The first technology produces massive amounts of very short reads -- about 150 to 250 bases in length. Using this method, the researchers sequenced enough reads to cover the entire length of the Y chromosome about 450 times. They assembled these short reads into longer chunks that they then further connected using a second technology that produces longer reads -- about seven thousand bases in length on average. ""By reducing non-Y chromosome reads from our data with flow sorting and the RecoverY technique that we developed, and by using this combination of sequencing technologies, we were able to assemble the gorilla Y chromosome so that more than half of the sequence data was in chunks longer than about 100,000 bases in length,"" said Medvedev. Another reason that determining the genetic sequence of the Y chromosome is so difficult is that it is composed of an unusually high number of repeat sequences -- regions where the sequence of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs is identical, or nearly identical, for thousands or millions of bases in a row. Many of these repeats, including some genes, appear as back-to-back series of the same repeated sequence or as long palindromes which, like the word ""racecar,"" read the same forward and backward. The researchers used an experimental technique -- ""droplet digital polymerase chain reaction"" -- to determine the number of copies of the genes that appear in these series. ""Sequencing the Y chromosome is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle, without knowing the final picture, from a pile of pieces where only about one out of every hundred is useful, and most of the pieces you do need look identical,"" said Makova. ""We've developed a pipeline for sequencing the Y chromosome that is more efficient than previous methods and reduces a number of the difficulties associated with determining the genetic sequence of the Y chromosome. Our method will open the door for studying the Y chromosome for more labs, more species, and more individuals within those species."" To demonstrate the utility of the gorilla Y chromosome sequence they generated, the researchers designed genetic markers that can be used to differentiate the genetic relatedness among male gorillas and thus to aid in conservation genetics efforts targeted at preserving this endangered species.","Published: March 4, 2016"

There are different types of breast cancer, but one type in particular accounts for almost three quarters of all breast tumors. These tumors feature a receptor for estrogen, and very often become resistant to hormone therapy. Despite their high frequency, these  estrogen receptor-positive  tumors have been difficult to research because the animals we test drugs on are often not relevant to the clinic. EPFL scientists have now developed the most biologically faithful animal model for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Their model has also been tested on human breast tissue in a pre-clinical context. About 90 percent of tested new cancer drugs fail. The reason, in part, is that the animals on which these drugs are tested often fail to capture the complex biology of the cancers they are meant to represent. This biological inaccuracy frequently gives rise to data that seem encouraging at first but are then not matched in humans. The drug fails, and pushes research back to square one. Some of the best pre-clinical animal models for breast cancer are made by injecting human breast tumors into the fatty tissue of the animal s breast or its flank   the animal itself is usually a mouse. Nevertheless, these animal models   called  patient-derived xenografts    underrepresent the most frequent and lethal breast tumors, the estrogen receptor-positive type. The reason is that after injection into the animal, the tumor cells frequently die off and fail to proliferate. The lab of Cathrin Brisken at EPFL has now developed the first xenograft to better represent the biology of estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors in humans. Postdoc George Sflomos and colleagues show that the mouse s milk ducts are the key for the physiological growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors, as they offer the injected cells a more suitable environment to grow and proliferate in rather than the conventional routes (the mammary fat pad and the flank). By injecting cells from an estrogen receptor-positive tumor into the mouse s milk ducts, the researchers could improve the survival rate of the tumor cells the first time ever. To test their new xenograft idea, the team obtained breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues from estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients, and injected them directly into the milk ducts of mice. The results were remarkable: All the new xenograft models that were tested faithfully mimicked actual patient tumors in terms of histopathology and even molecular biology.  With this breakthrough, breast cancer disease, progression and metastasis, now become amenable to study,  says Sflomos.  We can now study crucial factors, such as the action of hormones and molecular responses to therapies, for the first time in a relevant context. But more importantly, this model opens up new opportunities not only for the development but also for the evaluation of breast cancer therapies. ","Published: March 4, 2016"

""Our work seeks to contribute to bridging this knowledge gap"". A study on mice by Travis Stracker and his team, in collaboration with Vincenzo Costanzo's laboratory at the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM) in Milan, in which they reveal a gene candidate for a subtype of human ciliopathy has been published. The gene in question, GEMC1, is indispensable for the generation of multiciliated cells specific to tissues such as the brain, trachea, lungs and oviducts. The surface of multiciliated cells is covered by hundreds of cilia. These tiny, hairlike structures serve to circulate cerebrospinal fluid, remove mucus from the respiratory tract, and transport ovum through the oviduct, among other functions. Defects in the generation or function of these cells causes a subtype of ciliopathies called Mucociliary Clearance Disorders. Candidate and master gene Specifically, GEMC1-deficient mice produced by Stracker reproduce the symptoms of a rare disease called RGMC (Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia)--a condition that causes hydrocephaly, severe respiratory infections, and infertility. The work, led by IRB Barcelona PhD student Berta Terr  and IFOM postdoctoral researcher Gabriele Piergiovanni, reports that GEMC1 regulates the only two genes known to date that underlie this disease, Multicilin and Cyclin O, thus making it a potential candidate gene for RGMC. In addition, the study has revealed that GEMC1 is one of the most important genes in the gene signalling cascade for the production of multiciliated cells. This means that this gene affects many others that depend on its expression. The gene expression analysis of this first study has revealed at least 10 new candidate genes related to cilia, as well as dozens that were already known or suspected of being involved in the function of cilia. ""The mice are a particular model of RGMC but we believe that this model will allow us to identify many new genes involved in motile cilia, which affect other types of ciliopathies. We are now performing new gene expression analyses of specific cell populations to shed more light on a field about which little is known,"" says Stracker, who studied GEMC1 because of its function in DNA replication and potential contribution to cancer. ""While examining this gene for other reasons, we unexpectedly found it was potentially involved in ciliopathies. This kind of thing often happens in basic research and for us it was really interesting because of the lack of knowledge regarding these diseases and the biomedical implications our findings may have,"" explains Stracker. ""As ciliopathies are diverse and rare diseases, they have not received widespread attention from funding agencies and the pharma industry, as they are not interested in developing treatments for small markets, which is a great shame,"" chides the researcher. Rare Diseases at IRB Barcelona Scientific literature documents between 6,000 and 7,000 rare diseases-- conditions defined by the European Union as those that affect only 5 in 10,000 people or fewer. In Europe alone, between 27 and 36 million people have some form of rare disease. Because these diseases are complex, many have no treatment, thus leaving those who suffer from them, and their families and carers a heavy burden. In Spain, about 3 million people are affected by rare diseases, of which 400,000 are in Catalonia. Innovative and cutting-edge basic research offers enormous potential to take the knowledge gained in cell and molecular biology laboratories and use it to design therapies for rare diseases. In this regard, IRB Barcelona is currently conducting about 20 studies in rare diseases, among them Lafora disease, Kennedy syndrome, diverse type of rare cancers, Friedreich Ataxia, Cystinuria, mithocondrial diseases, Charcot Marie Tooth disease, Ataxia-telangiectasia and Seckel syndrome.","Published: March 4, 2016"

Joseph Corriveau, Ph.D. director of ECBC, and Robert Webb, DVM, CEO of Biodetech, officially entered into both agreements in front of a gathering of scientists, members of the Harford County business community, Soldiers and personnel from both organizations.  This agreement will commence another successful partnership between ECBC and industry in providing products and solutions for the warfighter and the nation,  said Corriveau.  It s a wonderful partnership with amazing possibilities.  Biodetech, a biotechnology firm based in nearby Fallston, Md., now has a partially exclusive license of ABOid patents to further develop the technology for the commercial food industry. Two U.S. patents for methods of detection and identification of cell type were issued to ECBC for ABOid in 2012 and 2013.  We are excited to present the ABOid system to the food industry,  said Webb. Scientists in ECBC s Detection Spectrometry Branch developed the ABOid biological detection software system that uses bioinformatics algorithms that are capable of rapidly identifying microbes in food samples without knowing what the sample is. Utilizing data from a mass spectrometry system, users can run mass spectral data through the software to provide statistical validation of a sample s identity.  I was absolutely intrigued,  Webb said of his reaction when he learned of the technology and its potential applications to food safety. A retired Army colonel, Webb brings more than 20 years of food safety experience to the ABOid development project, having served in the Army Public Health Command s Veterinary Services, which is responsible for securing the Army s food supply.  This can be applied to the entire food system.  Quick and accurate identification of unknown substances is the key feature of ABOid. The software can identify substances in a matter of hours instead of days as all currently used food analysis systems operate.  ABOid can rapidly identify a multitude of other pathogens in our food, as well as any act of food terrorism,  Corriveau said. Also key is that ABOid uses the data from a sample, not the actual sample, eliminating any potential risk of transporting an unknown substance as well as the cost of shipping samples to be examined. Data is collected from a mass spectrometer and sent via electronic file for processing by ABOid software.  Given the rapidity and the comprehensive nature of this test, there s nothing like this out there in the food industry,  Webb said. A team of scientists at ECBC have been working on ABOid technology for a decade, Corriveau said, but several years ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture came to ECBC and asked for help in monitoring and protecting the country s food supply. The Army s Public Health Command provided hundreds of food samples of a commonly served side item, mashed potatoes, to determine ABOid s capabilities to detect chemicals or other toxins in food, from salmonella to ricin.  ABOid was able to detect the toxins in the mashed potatoes with 100 percent accuracy,  said Mary Wade, ECBC principal investigator. Since testing, ABOid has been used successfully to analyze the food supply at Army public health facilities in Korea and Japan and with this agreement, Wade said, the technology could be used in the civilian sector to examine meats, dairy and other food products. As an Army laboratory, ECBC has the authority to license intellectual property rights on behalf of the government. The purpose of a PLA is to commercialize federally owned technology for the benefit of the nation. A PLA can be granted on patents already issued or filed by the government under an exclusive, partially exclusive or non-exclusive basis. For applications beyond the food industry, the ABOid patents and software remain available for licensing from ECBC.","Published: March 4, 2016"

RosettaGX Reveal is the only molecular test in the thyroid market that has been validated in a multicenter, international, blinded study using convenient, routinely prepared cytology slides. The assay is CLIA certified, but New York requires an additional license from the NYSDOH for CLIA-certified tests to be offered to patients in the state. With this conditional approval, RosettaGX Reveal is now available in all 50 states. In making the assay available pending final approval, the NYSDOH requires the Company to provide any additional information that it may request within 60 business days.  We are very pleased to have approval to market this important cancer diagnostic for the benefit of physicians and patients in the vast New York market,"" stated Kenneth A. Berlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rosetta Genomics.  It is estimated that nearly 550,000 FNAs are performed on thyroid nodules each year in the U.S. and that approximately 740,000 are performed annually in Europe. Interpretation of FNA samples is not always straightforward, leading to an indeterminate result in up to 30% of the samples. Many patients with indeterminate results undergo surgery as a precaution despite the fact that up to 80% of these cases are benign. This exposes patients to unnecessary surgical risk and costs the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars. Through an analysis of our validation study data, we believe we can help prevent up to 75% of unnecessary thyroid surgeries.   In addition to this expanded geographic access, recent managed care contracting initiatives have resulted in covered lives for RosettaGX Reveal exceeding 150 million in the U.S. These increases in geographic and health insurance access, along with the potential health economicbenefits the RosettaGX Reveal assay can bring by avoiding unnecessary surgeries, should enhance adoption into a market valued at more than $350 million annually in the U.S. alone. This market is one that continues to see accelerating penetration of molecular classifiers such as RosettaGX Reveal, which we expect to continue over the next several years,  added Mr. Berlin.","Published: March 4, 2016"

The smallest of spaces contain innumerable colors, structures and contrasts. Despite this we are able to identify objects and movements with high accuracy. Even the fruit fly, which only has a fraction of our neurons, can manage these distinctions. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried have now found evidence that the visual system of the fruit fly has adapted optimally to the features of the environment over millions of years. The unequal distribution of bright and dark regions in nature is reflected in similarly asymmetric processing by the fly brain. See Also: How the brain learns to distinguish between what is important and what is not Without us being aware of it, our visual system tackles incredibly difficult tasks every second. For example, to be able to reach for a pen, our brain must distinguish its form and texture quickly and accurately from dozens of other, often very similar, objects in the environment. This process works under a very wide variety of light conditions and against almost any kind of background. To facilitate the processing of such visual information, the visual system incorporates expectations of typical features of the environment into its calculations. Alexander Borst and his team at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have investigated how these expectations factor into neuronal calculations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In their experiments, the researchers made use of an innate behavior of flies. The animals steady their course with the help of what is known as the optomotor reaction. For example, if a fly is blown off course to the left by a gust of wind, the entire world rotates to the right from its perspective. To get back on course, flies reliably rotate in the same direction as the perceived image, in this instance to the right. To study the principles behind this course correction, the researchers built a virtual environment for the animals. Three computer monitors led the fly to believe that it was navigating through different natural environments while sensors followed its movements on an air-suspended polyurethane ball. Tests carried out in a virtual environment show how expected features in a complex environment are taken into account in neuronal calculation. Credit: MPI of Neurobiology / Prech & Leonhardt  ""I crawled through the woods around the institute for days with my smart phone, to record the panorama images we used in these experiments,"" reports Aljoscha Leonhardt, one of the study's first authors. The researchers occasionally simulated a virtual gust of wind by briefly rotating the environment on the screens to the right or left. As in nature, Drosophila skilfully adjusted to this optical drift: within a fraction of a second, the insect was moving straight again through the virtual world. The researchers then used a genetic trick to suppress the activity of the neurons that calculate the direction of movement in the fly brain and ultimately trigger the fly's rotation. In a similar way to vertebrates, this computation is performed in two parallel channels in the fly's optical system: once for increases in brightness (ON channel) and once for reductions in brightness (OFF channel). The former is carried out in T4 cells and the latter in T5 cells. When both types of neurons were switched off, the animals were no longer able to see the movement of their environment and could not correct their course. However, if only one of the channels was switched off, to the astonishment of the neurobiologists, the flies continued to compensate for the virtual gusts of wind rapidly and efficiently. Hence each of the two channels appears to respond optimally to environmental changes. Learn More: 3D reconstruction of neuronal networks provides unprecedented insight into organizational principles of sensory cortex However, further tests revealed that considerable differences exist between the two channels. For example, while the T4 cells of the ON channel responded very strongly to slowly moving bright edges, the T5 cells of the OFF channel were mainly active in the presence of rapid dark edges. To test whether this asymmetry represents an adaptation to nature, the researchers simulated the network on the computer. They trained virtual T4 and T5 cells to estimate the speed of moving natural images as precisely as possible. The result showed a very similar asymmetry to that observed in the earlier physiological tests. ""We assume that the functional differences between T4 and T5 cells developed as an adaptation to the different distribution of bright and dark in the natural visual environment,"" explains Georg Ammer, the second first author of the study. Incorporating expectations of the natural environmental conditions makes the visual processing more reliable and efficient. Because people and flies live in similar visual environments, it is conceivable that this insight into visual processing in the fly brain is also applicable to the human brain.

These findings may assist in crime scene investigations. Prior to this study no one had previously tabulated the full range of changes from a series of forensic cases in order to determine a signature for this specific environment. Using actual forensic anthropological cases, Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) researcher James Pokines, PhD, compiled a complete set of physical changes to these bones and then compared them with the changes that occurred to large animal bones in the same environment. ""There are clear differences in the changes in bones caused in different environments; on land, these include animal scavenging, algae formation, soil staining and weathering (bleaching and cracking) of bones. These differ in ways from bones that have been buried or recovered from the ocean,"" explained Pokines, who is the corresponding author and assistant professor of anatomy and neurobiology at BUSM. Pokiness hopes that this study helps to identify a specific signature regarding bones found in the New England environment and that this signature can be compared to those found in other parts of the country.

We already know several genes involved in balding and hair colour but this is the first time a gene for greying has been identified in humans, as well as other genes influencing hair shape and density,  said lead author, Dr Kaustubh Adhikari, UCL Cell & Developmental Biology.  It was only possible because we analysed a diverse melting pot of people, which hasn t been done before on this scale. These findings have potential forensic and cosmetic applications as we increase our knowledge on how genes influence the way we look.  The findings could help develop forensic DNA technologies that build visual profiles based on an individual s genetic makeup. Research in this field has previously used samples from people of European descent, but these new results could help forensic reconstructions in Latin America and East Asia. The gene identified for grey hair   IRF4   is known to play a role in hair colour but this is the first time it has been associated with the greying of hair. This gene is involved in regulating production and storage of melanin, the pigment that determines hair, skin and eye colour. Hair greying is caused by an absence of melanin in hair so the scientists want to find out IRF4 s role in this process. Understanding how IRF4 influences hair greying could help the development of new cosmetic applications that change the appearance of hair as it grows in the follicle by slowing or blocking the greying of hair. Professor Andr s Ruiz-Linares, UCL Biosciences, who led the study, said:  We have found the first genetic association to hair greying, which could provide a good model to understand aspects of the biology of human aging. Understanding the mechanism of the IRF4 greying association could also be relevant for developing ways to delay hair greying.  Another gene, PRSS53, which was found to influence hair curliness, was investigated by the University of Bradford s Centre for Skin Sciences as part of the study. ""An enduring fascination of human evolution has been our peculiarly luxuriant scalp hair, and finding a new variation in the Protease Serine S1 family member 53 (PRSS53) gene provides an important insight into the genetic controls underpinning scalp hair shape and texture,  explained Professor Desmond Tobin, University of Bradford.  The PRSS53 enzyme functions in the part of the hair follicle that shapes the growing hair fibre, and this new genetic variation, associated with straight hair in East Asians and Native Americans, supports the view that hair shape is a recent selection in the human family.  The scientists found additional genes associated with hair including EDAR for beard thickness and hair shape; FOXL2 for eyebrow thickness and PAX3 for monobrow prevalence.  It has long been speculated that hair features could have been influenced by some form of selection, such as natural or sexual selection, and we found statistical evidence in the genome supporting that view,  added Dr Adhikari.  The genes we have identified are unlikely to work in isolation to cause greying or straight hair, or thick eyebrows, but have a role to play along with many other factors yet to be identified.  The team collected and analysed DNA samples from 6,630 volunteers from the CANDELA cohort recruited in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. After an initial screen, a sample size of 6,357 was used, at 45% male and 55% female. This group included individuals of mixed European (48%), Native American (46%) and African (6%) ancestry, giving a large variation in head hair appearance. Both men and women were assessed for hair shape, colour, balding and greying, but only men were tested for beard, monobrow and eyebrow thickness. Visual traits for each individual were compared to whole genome analysis results to identify the genes driving differences in appearance. These were then checked against existing databases of different populations to see if the differences made sense based on previous knowledge and were under selection.","Published: March 3, 2016"

The gift comes from businessman and philanthropist Norman Braman of Miami and his wife, Irma. Mr. and Mrs. Braman made the gift to establish a permanent and ongoing capacity to study and teach the Holocaust in all its dimensions - its causes and consequences, its role in the establishment of the state of Israel, and its continuing impact on modern Judaism which has been impacted by a rise in acts of anti-Semitism and questions of Israel s legitimacy. The gift will fund an endowed professorship in the forensic study of the Holocaust as well as related research, teaching and public service programs on the Holocaust, its origins, methods and consequences.  This gift will ensure that the study of the Holocaust remains an integral area of study and scholarship at Georgetown,  said Georgetown President John J. DeGioia.  It comes at a very meaningful time, with the launch of a new, permanently endowed home at Georgetown for research and teaching on the history, culture and traditions of the Jewish people. We are deeply grateful to Norman and Irma Braman for their generosity in enabling this important work.  World-renowned historian and scholar Rev. Patrick Desbois will be the inaugural holder of the Braman Endowed Professorship of the Practice of the Forensic Study of the Holocaust. Desbois, a Roman Catholic priest from France, has pioneered the application of modern forensic research methods to the study of the Holocaust.  We are pleased to make this gift to support Father Patrick Desbois s very important research on the Holocaust and to provide it a permanent home at a distinguished American university,  said Norman Braman.  As America s oldest Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown was the natural location to focus Father Debois  unique research. Furthermore, the university s commitment to Catholic-Jewish relations is unambiguous, evidenced in the way Professor Jan Karski s memory has been preserved 15 years after his death. It is evident in the establishment of the new Center for Jewish Civilization. And we see it in the work and in the teaching of Associate Director of the CJC Father Dennis McManus, whom we have come to know and whose leadership was critical in bringing our collective thinking together. All these things made us feel that Georgetown is a natural home for this gift.        Mr. Braman continued, saying  I have decided to make this gift, now, and to Georgetown, in part as a sign of my appreciation for the leadership of Pope Francis and the priority he so clearly attaches to fostering closer relations between Jews and Catholics.  Georgetown this week also announced the launch of the Center for Jewish Civilization, permanently endowed through more than $10 million in philanthropy from nearly 500 donors. The Center will continue and expand a 13-year old program dedicated to research, teaching and programming in subject areas encompassing American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertains to Israel, Holocaust and genocide studies, Jewish-Catholic relations both past and present, as well as Jewish literature, culture and religious expression. Since 2006 the Center, formerly the Program for Jewish Civilization, has been directed by Professor Jacques Berlinerblau whose scholarly research has focused on issues ranging from biblical Hebrew, to Jewish-American fiction, to contemporary African-American and Jewish-American relations. Over more than 20 years of innovative scholarship, Desbois has combined a multidisciplinary approach   historical, anthropological, psychological and legal   with ongoing interviews of eyewitnesses to explain how the Nazis planned and executed the Holocaust by bullets in Eastern Europe through their ruthlessly efficient mobile killing squads, the full death toll from which was previously significantly underreported. The scholar is founder and principal researcher of Yahad   In Unum, an organization dedicated to locating the mass graves of Jewish people killed by the Einsatzgruppen and other killing units in the Holocaust by bullets in the former Soviet Union. In 2013, Desbois was recruited by CJC Associate Director Rev. Dennis McManus to teach at Georgetown s Jan Karski Institute for Holocaust Education   a summer professional development program for primary and secondary school teachers that prepares them to teach the Holocaust to today s students in schools all across the U.S. Collaborating in the undergraduate program since 2014, Desbois and McManus co-teach the Holocaust by Bullets course named for Desbois  2008 book, which focuses on the mass executions of Jewish people and also won the National Jewish Book Award. Next month several students will travel with Father Desbois to conduct original field research in Eastern Europe and Russia.  Our shared goal is to support research, teaching and public programs that deepen our understanding of the many disparate factors that led to the Holocaust, how to best assure none of its remnants  ever appear  again,  Braman said.  Father Desbois  ongoing and intensive forensic research   in the field, with new sources and at new sites   is offering fresh insight into an unimaginable crime against humanity. His work reminds us that the study of the Holocaust should never cease; there will always be more to learn. And in that there is hope that it will not be repeated.  The Braman Endowed Program Fund will support teaching, research and field study for Georgetown faculty and students. As well, it will fund the development of a new public outreach program intended to ensure that future leaders are equipped to prevent future Holocausts. An annual symposium for young journalists, early-career diplomats and public policy makers from around the world will educate them on new Holocaust-related research and emerging theories about identifying early and responding preemptively to the conditions of society that can lead to genocide. This new initiative is of particular importance to Mr. Braman and Father Desbois, who share the belief that maintaining a sustained, living understanding of the Holocaust can help prevent similar mass violence in the future.   Desbois will train future leaders to provide material and legal evidence of these atrocities through field experience and by teaching a forensic methodology. This involves the discovery of evidence of genocide through the corroboration and expansion of written records based on videotaped oral testimonies of eyewitnesses as well as  physical proof  of the killing fields.  The mass shootings of Jews in the ex-Soviet Union was an entire continent of crime,  says Desbois.  Unfortunately, this form of genocide,  Holocaust by Bullets,  is the model for mass killings today, thus, the lessons to be learned are practical, and the details need to be exposed for all to see and understand.  He continued,  the assassins never imagined that 70 years later, men and women motivated by a quest for the truth would interview eyewitnesses to the killings of Jews. To all those who commit genocide we say: sooner or later, wherever the mass murder of humans has taken place, someone will return. Norman and Irma Braman s gift will ensure that this happens.                                 Father Desbois brings students face to face with deep questions of morality through his teaching and his original research which is absolutely changing our understanding of the Holocaust and its history,  says CJC director and professor of Jewish civilization, Jacques Berlinerblau.  It is an honor to have within our Center for Jewish Civilization a colleague who is making such a monumental contribution to the field of Holocaust studies and providing our students with an opportunity to be part of this work.

Unfortunately, the critical estimation of the freshness of frozen seafood products is extremely hard to achieve. Thus, determining the initial freshness of fishery products before they are frozen is a big challenge. The ordinary way to determine fish freshness is by calculating K-values based on chemical assays of nucleotides compounds, however, this method is very time-consuming. Professor Emiko Okazaki stated that  we need couple of hours of intensive works to identify whether a fish sample was fresh before being frozen or not .  It would be of great interest to find an alternative tool to shorten this very prolonged time of analysis. Therefore, the development of a smart, rapid and reliable method is urgently needed in research and industry , she added. The first author Dr. Gamal ElMasry, a JSPS fellow from Egypt said ""As the fluorescence signals from the frozen fish we examined changed dramatically with their initial freshness conditions (Figure 1), autofluorescence spectroscopy as an interesting sensor technology characterized by high sensitivity and accuracy makes this method a substantial and promising tool in the screening of fishery products, even in their frozen state. In other words, changes occurred in the fluorescent-emitting molecules during the degradation of aged fish before the freezing process could be tracked using its fluorescence signals"" Currently, this research team is working on the first step of developing such a system by analyzing excitation-emission matrices (EEMS) of frozen fish of different freshness conditions and measuring their reference freshness values by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). ""We have found that there are some specific excitation wavelengths at which the detection of the freshness of frozen fish could be easily recognized.

There are currently no standard biomarkers or algorithms for the prognosis of the progression to hemorrhagic fever or potentially fatal shock syndrome.  In a collaboration with colleagues from the University of California, Berkeley, the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health, and the University of Yucatan, Mexico, the researchers analyzed serum samples from dengue patients in Mexico and Nicaragua. They used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify molecular features in patients diagnosed with dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome or non-dengue disease groups. As per earlier studies by others, they confirmed that infection with dengue virus perturbs the human metabolome; the set of small molecule metabolites within the serum sample. They also found many metabolites had statistically significant differences in pair-wise comparisons between the three diagnostic groups. In the Nicaraguan samples, distinct metabolic clusters were associated with the three different diagnostic groups. However this effect was not seen in the Mexican samples. The researchers suggest this may be due to much greater diversity in both the disease (two different serotypes and no available information on immune status) and the patients in Mexico, who had a larger age distribution compared with the pediatric-only Nicaraguan samples. It is clear that metabolic profiles for the disease will differ between region, patient age, genetic background, and disease status, nonetheless, similar trends were found for many metabolites that differentiated disease outcomes in the two groups. In order to explore whether differences in the metabolome might be used to predict dengue outcomes, the researchers studied 31 samples from Nicaragua. 16 of these patients progressed from dengue fever to hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome while the remaining 15 did not. 65 metabolites were found that differentiated the two disease outcomes. Six of these prognostic metabolites have thus far been structurally confirmed. By identifying and profiling molecules that differ between different forms of dengue, the researchers lay the foundations for finding biomarkers present at early-stage dengue that are able to predict disease development. An early predictor of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome would allow appropriate triaging of patients for management and treatment. An understanding of the metabolic profile of infected patients also provides insights into the intracellular pathways instrumental in dengue infection, replication and pathogenesis. ""Metabolomics provides new opportunities and a powerful approach to investigate potential viral, host, pathogenic and immunological determinants of dengue infection and pathogenesis,"" explains Dr. Barry Beaty, from the Colorado State University. The research team is currently conducting a prospective clinical study in Nicaragua to further identify small molecule biomarker ""biosignatures"" for efficient diagnosis and prognosis of dengue.","Published: March 3, 2016"

Their discovery offers insight into what factors may drive our microbiome differences, which are thought to be linked to metabolic disorders in western populations.  This is one of the first studies to show that that the microbiomes of a traditional agriculturalist group exhibit an intermediate state, between the microbiomes of hunter-gatherers and those of a western industrialized society,  says first author Andres Gomez, a microbial ecologist and staff scientist at the J. Craig Venter Institute in California. Gomez, formerly a post-doctoral research in the Blekhman s lab, thinks the gradient may be evidence that the Bantu traditional agriculturalists have been gradually transitioning to westernized subsistence patterns, and this transition may have been the way modern humans evolved their gut microbiomes. Blekhman is an assistant professor in the University s College of Biological Sciences. The hunter-gatherers analyzed in the study, called the BaAka pygmies, rely heavily on wild game, fish, and fruits and vegetables for sustenance. However, the Bantu population relies fully on a market economy. These agriculturalists grow tubers, fruits, and other plants, make use of flour-like products, and raise goats for meat. They also use antibiotics and other therapeutic drugs when available. Gomez was first inspired to compare the microbiomes of the two populations when he was studying the gut microbes of wild gorillas with help from BaAka gorilla trackers.  I met these people and found their lifestyle fascinating,  says Gomez.  They have almost no western influences.  He and his colleagues also worked with Bantu research assistants, and decided to collect fecal samples from the two groups for analysis. The team looked at samples from 28 BaAka and 29 Bantu community members. Sequencing data revealed that while the BaAka and Bantu gut microbes were from similar bacterial species, the abundance of traditional bacterial groups was diminished in the Bantu. Further comparisons with western microbiome data showed that the Bantu microbiome composition falls on a spectrum between the BaAka and western populations.  When the researchers delved into the functions of the different bacterial communities, they found a potential gradient between the BaAka and western microbes in pathways involved in processing carbohydrates and foreign substances.  We suspect that the enrichment in carbohydrate- and xenobiotic-processing pathways that we see in Bantus and US Americans is related to access to more digestible sugars and therapeutic drugs, while the hunter-gatherers consume more fibrous plants and do not have access to drugs or antibiotics,  says Gomez, though he cautions that the team needs better functional approaches to support these predictions.  The study supports the idea that diet is the most important driver of microbiome composition in humans,  says Gomez.  We are what we eat, and our microbiome is a very important reflection of lifestyle. ","Published: March 3, 2016"

Stanford University and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) researchers write that their findings should be a  call to arms for those interested in clinical grade technical accuracy for genome sequencing.  As genome sequencing transitions from research to clinic, they say, it is essential to have methods to benchmark performance in all regions that are sequenced for diagnostic or other medical purposes. Challenges in benchmarking difficult, but clinically important regions of the genome are reported in today s issue of Genome Medicine. The results underscore the need to extend benchmarking references against which sequencing data and analyses can be compared and validated. In effect, these types of standards are quality-control and quality-assurance tools. They are necessary for checking the accuracy of sequencing data and analyses and preventing false positives and false negatives. However, genome-sequencing technologies aimed at the large health care market are advancing so quickly that efforts to develop the field s underpinning benchmarking tools must race to keep up. Central to the Stanford-NIST study, one such tool is the genomic reference material created by NIST and its partners in the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. The NIST reference material NIST RM 8398, Human DNA for Whole-Genome Variant Assessment currently has about 77 percent of the genome characterized with high levels of confidence.  The harder-to-characterize regions that we can t yet sequence with confidence include regions known to be clinically important,  explains NIST biomedical engineer Justin Zook.  This means that our benchmark genome cannot currently be used to assess performance for more challenging genes and other difficult regions of the genome that already are being tested or for which new sequencing methods are being developed.   The good news is that, in this case, 77 percent of the donor s genome was reliably sequenced using current methods,  says lead author Rachel Goldfeder from Stanford University.  The challenge now is to focus our efforts on the other 23 percent namely, on regions of the genome that remain elusive. Only then can we realize the full potential of precision medicine.  In their study, Stanford and NIST researchers used data from whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing methods. Exome sequencing focuses only on the protein-encoding portions of genes, comprising less than 2 percent of the entire genome. Both types of these so-called next-generation sequencers follow a similar process. Paired strands of DNA are uncoupled and randomly chopped into short segments. Numerous copies of the segments are made and then are sequenced by recreating the missing paired strand for each copy. The matches are analyzed to determine their sequence of letters from the from the four-letter genetic alphabet: A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine) and T (thymine). Then, bioinformaticians apply complex mathematical algorithms to determine where the decoded pieces originated. The pieces can then be compared to a defined ""reference sequence"" to identify variations in stretches of letters and where letters have been deleted or inserted in specific genes. When differences are found, a  variant call  is logged. For RM 8398, the Genome in a Bottle Consortium had catalogued high-confidence variant calls in the well-characterized regions of the benchmarking genome. The Stanford-NIST team compared these calls with variant calls made with two sequencing systems. Of particular interest were differences in 56  medically actionable  genes that the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends for reporting. Accuracy of variant calls within high-confidence regions depended on the genome region; type of difference say, an inserted or substituted letter; extent of coverage (number of times a specific DNA segment has been read); and analytical methods. In whole genome sequencing, for example, false negative calls unidentified variations or mutations resulted largely from software tools used to filter out errors in sequencing data, the researchers found. Most false negatives in whole exome sequencing stemmed from poor coverage not enough reads to generate data of sufficient quality. In some ways, significant parts of the genome are largely uncharted territory. Only about 5 percent of the 19,000 to 21,000 protein-encoding genes are situated entirely within portions of the human genome currently characterized with high confidence. Unlike many research studies of groups of people, a  false call on a clinical report  can result in harmful consequences for patients, their families and even groups of people at risk for specific diseases, the researchers explain. Therefore, they say, it is critical to understand how accurately all regions of interest can be tested. The team also points out that because current sequencing technologies are prone to systematic errors at certain genome locations, some variants reported in publicly available genome-sequencing databases may actually be false positives, or it may be difficult to distinguish between real variants and systematic sequencing errors. The Stanford-NIST team found that, on average, about a fifth of each of the 56 disease-related genes flagged by ACMG is situated outside well-characterized, high-confidence regions of the NIST reference genome. Addressing this  sobering  state of affairs, the researchers write, requires working toward consensus across technologies or  at the very least,  transparency in communicating the confidence level for every variant call.","Published: March 3, 2016"

The protein, MG53, travels throughout the bloodstream and helps the body fix injuries to the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs without causing scars. It's a discovery that could help heal open wounds, decrease recovery time after surgery and reduce the spread of infections. ""A massive scar on your skin may look bad, but imagine you have a heart attack and get a scar on your heart--that could be lethal,"" says Jianjie Ma, a physiologist at Ohio State and co-author of the presentation. All animals carry this gene, he said, and it's almost identical no matter which species. MG53 fixes the cell and tissue damage that occurs during everyday living. Even simple actions, like walking or typing, will cause injuries to the body. Usually this isn't a problem because MG53 can make repairs before there's any serious harm. Ma and his team genetically engineered mice without the gene that makes MG53 to see what would happen without its healing capabilities. The experiments showed that the mice lacking MG53 had difficulty recovering from injury, because of their compromised repair capacity; their heart would not function well under stress conditions. MG53 works in tandem with another protein called TGF Beta, a type of ""cytokine"" protein that also heals wounds, but the healing process happens so quickly that it causes scars. If you have more TGF Beta in your bloodstream than MG53, you scar easily. Ma's goal is to develop a therapy that will inhibit TGF Beta and promote MG53. Medical professionals can use the therapy during procedures to promote quick, scarless healing. His next step is to identify a small compound that can do this and eventually test whether it has the desired effect in human trials.","Published: March 3, 2016"

""We established a robust, stepwise approach that recapitulates the formation of functional sperm-like cells in a dish,"" co-senior study author Jiahao Sha of Nanjing Medical University said in a statement. ""So we think that it holds tremendous promise for treating male infertility."" Co-senior study author XiaoYang Zhao of the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, however, noted that before this technique is translated to the clinic, possible risks and species differences between mice and humans must be fully studied. ""Therefore, it's too early to discuss the technique's clinical use now,"" Zhao said in an email to Xinhua. Infertility affects up to 15 percent of couples, and about one-third of cases can be traced to the man. One major cause of male infertility is the failure of precursor germ cells in the testes to undergo a type of cell division called meiosis to form functional sperm cells, the researchers said. Several studies have reported the successful generation of precursor germ cells from stem cells, but the precursors then had to be injected the tests of sterile mice in order to create mature sperm. In the new study, Sha teamed up with co-senior study authors XiaoYang Zhao and Qi Zhou of the Institute of Zoology to develop a stem cell-based method that fully recapitulates meiosis and produces functional sperm-like cells. The first step was to expose mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to a chemical cocktail, which coaxed the ESCs to turn into primordial germ cells. Next, the researchers mimicked the natural tissue environment of these precursor germ cells by exposing them to testicular cells as well as sex hormones such as testosterone. Under these biologically relevant conditions, the ESC-derived primordial germ cells underwent complete meiosis, resulting in sperm-like cells with key features of meiosis, including correct nuclear DNA and chromosomal content. Finally, the researchers injected these sperm-like cells into mouse egg cells and transferred the embryos into female mice and found these embryos developed normally and gave rise to healthy, fertile offspring. In future studies, the researchers planned to test their approach in other animals such as primates in anticipation of human studies. ""If proven to be safe and effective in humans, our platform could potentially generate fully functional sperm for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization techniques,"" Sha said. ""Because currently available treatments do not work for many couples, we hope that our approach could substantially improve success rates for male infertility."" Several U.S. experts, including Professor Kyle Orwig of the University of Pittsburgh, Assistant Professor Vittorio Sebastiano of the Stanford School of Medicine and Professor Peter Donovan of the University of California, Irvine, who were not involved in the study, called the results ""landmark,"" ""a milestone in the (stem cell) field"" or ""a significant advance"" in understanding sperm development and production. These experts also said they thought that the technique could be adapted in the future using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which act much like embryonic stem cells but are created from skin cells, in order to circumvent most of the ethical concerns related to the requirement to use embryos. ""Someday and under some circumstances, germline gene therapy might gain acceptance,"" Orwig said in a statement. ""If that occurs, iPSCs (not ESCs) could be an outstanding vehicle for correcting infertility-causing genetic defects before differentiation to germ-like cells.""

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/enhancing-crispr-gene-editing-technology-193457,Enhancing CRISPR Gene Editing Technology Scientists have developed a process that improves the efficiency of CRISPR  an up and coming technology used to edit DNA  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.""Scientists all over the world are using CRISPR right now in their studies, but the technology is not as functional as it could be,"" says Haoquan Wu, Ph.D., who enhanced the process and is a biomedical scientist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso (TTUHSC El Paso). CRISPR is a groundbreaking technology that allows scientists to modify genes. Two key components make CRISPR's DNA editing ability possible. The first is Cas9, an enzyme capable of cutting DNA. The second component is single guide RNA, which directs Cas9 on exactly which portion of a DNA strain to snip to deactivate the unwanted section. As a new technology, however, CRISPR still has room for improvement. The technology's ability to delete, or knockout, genes is not consistent. These problems prompted Wu to wonder if he could improve CRISPR's overall ability to target and eliminate genes. ""I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with CRISPR as it is, but I would say that there's a lot of room for improvement since it's a new technology,"" he explains. ""And we wanted to test to see if we could make it better by changing the single guide RNA."" The idea paid off. In a recent paper Wu and his team of TTUHSC El Paso researchers describe how they were able to achieve knockout efficiency of greater than 50 percent by tweaking the sequence of the single guide RNA template. The researchers specifically extended it by 5 base pairs. They also modified other characteristics of the duplex. ""The extent of the improvement in knockout efficiency with these changes was striking,"" Wu says. ""This is going to help reduce concerns that knockout experiments might not work, and also significantly increase the efficiency of more challenging editing procedures like gene deletion."" The TTUHSC El Paso team, which included major contributions from post-doctoral researcher Ying Dang, Ph.D., plans to continue studying this modified single guide RNA template to better understand why it enhances CRISPR's functionality. They've also applied for a patent for their new method, which they hope will be adopted by other scientists using CRISPR.","Published: March 3, 2016"

Ion channels normally control the balance of chemicals such as potassium, calcium and sodium within our cells. The virus the research focused on was the Bunyavirus family, which includes lethal human pathogens such as Hantaviruses and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, a widespread disease that is becoming more prevalent in Mediterranean countries and endemic in Africa, the Middle East and some Asian countries, where outbreaks can kill up to four out of 10 people who contract it. They found that drugs that inhibit potassium ion channels were effective against Bunyamwera virus, which is a model for all of the bunyaviruses. Adding drugs that specifically block the ion channels that regulate potassium levels blocked the ability of all of the bunyaviruses tested to infect cells, but did not have any effect on unrelated viruses. The viruses tested included Hazara virus, used as a model for CCHFV, and Schmallenberg virus, which causes deformities and neurological defects in unborn lambs and calves. The common drugs used in the research included the anti-psychotic haloperidol, the anti-depressant fluoxetine, and a local anaesthetic, bupivacaine. Dr Jamel Mankouri, of the School of Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Leeds, said: ""This is a breakthrough finding since bunyaviruses are considered as emerging pathogens with the potential to establish a global disease range with massive importance in healthcare, animal welfare and economics. ""Being able to block these ion channels is an important first step in understanding how we can stop these viruses spreading and causing human disease."" ""We observed that these viruses are highly dependent upon the gradient of potassium that exists across the membranes of the cells."" Academics used a live virus system to directly compare how different viruses were affected by each drug. The virus usually kills cells in our system after five days, but the study showed that the presence of protective drug compounds led to cells surviving beyond the five-day period. By using drugs targeting specific sub-sets of potassium ion channels, they found that Bunyamwera virus and Schallenberg virus responded differently. This suggests that while the bunyaviruses are generally manipulating potassium ion channels to survive in cells, it is likely that each virus targets a specific type or group of channels to make a favourable environment to grow. Dr John Barr, who helped develop the idea at Leeds, added: ""Very few new antiviral drugs have made it into clinical use in the last 15 years. One of the main reasons is cost; these are very expensive drugs to develop. ""Taking a drug that has already been proven to be safe, and using it to target a different condition or infection - a process known as drug repurposing - bypasses this expensive and time-consuming stage. ""There are many drugs targeting ion channels that are currently in use for a wide range of conditions. Our work shows that some of these might be suitable to treat virus infections."" Dr Janet Daly, who led the team at Nottingham, said: ""This project brought together experts in human and animal viruses, modelling the 'One Virology' philosophy we have here at Nottingham. ""This breadth of expertise was essential to studying these viruses as they have the ability to jump from animals to humans and vice versa."" Dr Alain Kohl, who headed up the research at the University of Glasgow, said: ""If existing drugs are confirmed to be effective against known members of a particular virus family, this opens up the possibility of using these 'off-the-shelf' treatments in a rapid response against dangerous new related virus strains that emerge.""","Published: March 3, 2016"

The results showed declines in fertility of up to 100% and an increase of 60% in the mortality rate of larvae, amongst the insects studied. The findings, which are published today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, come as the World Health Organisation calls for all avenues to be explored, including research using genetic technology, in tackling the Zika virus. The Swansea team's findings offer the prospect of a much more targeted approach to insect control, targeting only the insect in question, and without the significant downsides of chemical pesticides, such as environmental damage, health risks, and insects becoming resistant. The technology at the heart of the team's work is called RNAi, a natural process that cells use to turn down, or silence, the activity of specific genes, for example the genes that control fertility. Although RNAi has been investigated previously in relation to insects, the problem has been how to deliver it effectively. Injection into selected insects is one delivery method, but this is time-consuming and expensive, and many insects are simply too small for this to be viable. The Swansea team's research, which is described as ""a significant advance"", demonstrates that bacteria can be an effective delivery vehicle for the RNAi. Their technique, known as symbiont-mediated RNAi, uses friendly (symbiotic) bacteria inhabiting an insect's gut as a Trojan horse to deliver a ""switch off"" command to chosen target insect genes. The researchers tested out the technique on two insect species: The Kissing bug (Rhodnius prolixus) - these long-lived blood-sucking bugs carry the parasites that cause Chagas Disease, which affects up to 8 million people in central and south America. They are known as kissing bugs as they tend to settle on people's faces at night. The research showed that the technique suppressed fertility in this bug by up to 100% Western Flower Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) - this is a very invasive agricultural pest affecting many parts of the world, which has developed resistance to pesticides The technique resulted in an increase of 60% in the larvae mortality rate of this species In the light of these findings, the researchers conclude that: ""this represents a significant advance in the ability to deliver RNAi, potentially to a large range of non-model insects."" Significantly, the team report that the technique would be transferable to many insect species, including the Aedes mosquitoes, which carry the Zika virus. ""It is expected that symbiont-mediated RNAi would be effective in other insect species. The unifying prerequisite is that the insects harbor culturable symbionts, a criterion already known to be met by many globally important insect species such as Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, tsetse flies, white fly and honeybees."" The method involves identifying an appropriate bacterium in each insect to deliver the RNAi. The bacteria are specific to that particular insect and cannot live outside it. The technique has various important advantages compared to chemical pesticides: It is targeted specifically at the species in question, and does not harm other insects, such as bees and other pollinators It does not carry the risk of environmental damage and harm to human health Insects do not acquire resistance to it in the way that they do to chemical pesticides Professor Paul Dyson of Swansea University Medical School and Dr Miranda Whitten of Swansea University College of Science are leading this work. Professor Dyson has just returned from a research visit to Brazil, where the Zika virus is most prevalent. He has also previously used this technology to develop a pesticide-free weapon against insects that cause sleeping sickness and damage crops, research which was funded by the Gates Foundation. Professor Paul Dyson of Swansea University Medical School said: New approaches are urgently needed to reduce the global burden of pest insects and to investigate insect biology and disease transmission. This technology allows us to target insects much more effectively than conventional pesticides, and without their side-effects. Using bacteria as a Trojan horse gets round some of the problems in delivering RNAi to the insect. It is a significant advance. It can help us to tackle some of the insects and crop pests that have such a devastating impact on human health and the food chain. Our method could also help in the fight against the Zika virus, as the Aedes mosquito that bears the virus has bacteria that would be suitable. Dr Miranda Whitten of Swansea University College of Science said: The symbiotic bacteria basically do all the hard work for us - they are programmed to manufacture the RNAi molecules inside the insect's body, for as long as needed, and they do this without being detected by the insect's immune system. As we can choose which gene - or combination of genes - to target, we now have a highly flexible gene-suppression toolbox. This is combined with an exquisite specificity that shouldn't affect other insect species, even if they share the same habitat.","Published: March 3, 2016"

Brown, Ph.D., chief scientific officer and senior vice president of research at Dicerna, presented a case study of the application of the GalNAc-DsiRNA-EX-Conjugate technology to a well-characterized hepatic disease gene, Alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), resulting in a reduction of serum Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) in a transgenic mouse model of liver disease. GalNAc-DsiRNA-EX-Conjugates are being optimized for both SC and IV administration, Dr. Brown noted, adding that both routes of delivery have the potential to yield high bioavailability and efficient liver uptake at equivalent doses.  Utilizing our proprietary technology, we have developed DsiRNA-EX-Conjugates that facilitate efficient delivery and gene target knockdown in the liver,  commented Dr. Brown.  Our GalNAc-DsiRNA-EX-Conjugates, with their  Tetraloop  configuration, appear to offer numerous advantages including RNAi potency, nuclease resistance, and reduced immunostimulation, and the platform is remarkably tolerant of conjugate linker lengths and chemistries. The technology facilitates efficient design of therapeutic RNAi leads, and it potentially enables GalNAc-mediated subcutaneous or intravenous conjugate delivery to the liver, making possible a degree of flexibility not seen with other conjugate-based approaches.   Our DsiRNA-EX-Conjugate platform may establish a product engine for subcutaneous delivery of gene-targeted molecules,  commented Douglas Fambrough, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Dicerna.  This potential allows us to investigate, in parallel, potential therapies for use against a wide variety of liver targets for multiple disease indications.  Dicerna has developed investigational DsiRNA-EX-Conjugates for liver-related diseases by attaching N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) sugars to one or more points on DsiRNA-EX molecules, yielding multiple proprietary conjugate delivery configurations. The GalNAc sugars specifically bind to receptors on target cells, leading to internalization and access to the RNAi machinery within the cells. Dr. Brown also presented data showing a greater than 75% reduction in serum A1AT in non-human primates treated with a prototype SERPINA1 GalNAc-DsiRNA-EX-Conjugate, with effects lasting more than seven weeks after the last of five SC doses.  We are optimizing our DsiRNA-EX-Conjugates for four therapeutic liver targets, with additional programs planned,  Dr. Brown said.  We aim to increase our understanding of GalNAc conjugate medicinal chemistry through ongoing study of this unique therapeutic approach.  Dr. Brown s presentation will be available after 7:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, February 25, 2016 on the Events & Presentations page in the Investors & Media section of the Dicerna website.","Published: March 3, 2016"

Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have discovered that different groups of neurons, those charged with keeping time, become active at different times of day despite being on the same molecular clock. The findings are published in the journal Science. See Also: Setting the circadian clock Life on Earth follows the rising and setting of the sun. Daily cycles have been found in animals, plants, fungi and even bacteria. For humans, sleeping and waking as well as hormone levels, body temperature and cognitive performance, follow a daily cycle. ""The influence of our circadian rhythms can be substantial. For example, some of us are night owls and others are morning larks,"" said senior investigator Paul Taghert, PhD, professor of neuroscience. ""It's important to understand how such fundamental timing information is translated into actual neuronal signals in the brain that control daily rhythms, including rhythmic behavior."" The biological control for these daily cycles is known as the circadian clock. In animals, a master circadian clock in the brain helps coordinate most of these body rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle. The biochemical basis of the circadian clock has been conserved through evolution. It involves a small number of ""clock proteins"" whose levels go up and down in a controlled manner once a day. But scientists long have puzzled over how some circadian-controlled behaviors and physiological changes that occur two or more times a day correspond to the once-daily rise and fall of clock proteins. The fruit fly Drosophila, for example, is behaviorally active twice a day, in the morning and evening. Taghert, along with graduate student Xitong Liang and Timothy Holy, associate professor of neuroscience, asked how one biochemical peak in clock proteins could lead to two distinct peaks of activity at different times of day. They wondered whether the neuronal time-keeping circuit produces a single daily signal or generates multiple signals throughout the day. To answer that question, Liang performed whole brain scans of living fruit flies every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Fruit flies are widely used in circadian research because the clock in each fly's tiny brain is represented by only 150 time-keeping or so-called pacemaker neurons, making it much easier to dissect than the clock in larger animals. Even in mice, for example, the circadian system involves about 20,000 pacemaker neurons in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The experiments measured calcium levels inside pacemaker cells to assess the cells' activities - higher calcium levels indicate higher levels of neuronal activation. Unexpectedly, each pacemaker group displayed a distinct phase of activity. These activity patterns were sensitive to environmental signals, such as day length, and also to the circadian clock. The researchers found that one specific group of pacemaker neurons was active about four hours before the fly's morning peak in activity, and another specific group was active about four hours before the fly's evening activity. ""Essentially, groups of neurons decide to take different parts of the clock,"" explained Holy. ""One group says, 'We'll be active in the morning, to make the fly active that time of day,' and this other group of neurons says, 'Even though our molecular clock is peaking here in the morning, we're going to wait to be most active until later on in the day.'"" Studying the genes of mutant fruit flies, the research team identified a chemical signal called pigment-dispersing factor (PDF). This neuropeptide is secreted by the morning pacemakers to help diversify the timing of pacemakers that control behaviors at other times of day. ""PDF is secreted by cells that are most active at dawn,"" Liang said. ""In the flies with a mutation in the PDF receptor, we found that two other groups of neurons normally active at other times of day instead become active at dawn."" The activity of the pacemaker neurons become more synchronous in the mutant flies, and the regular morning-evening pattern of fly activity is thrown off, the researcher said. Learn More: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions Previously, scientists had thought that cellular activity was closely coupled to the peak levels of the clock molecules. ""The idea was, as the clock goes, so goes the activity,"" Taghert said. ""But here, we're suggesting that there may be a disconnect in some cells, and the reason for that disconnect is to space out the timing signals. ""We would never have been able to measure this activity 10 years ago,"" he said. Until a few years ago, it would not have been possible to monitor the activity of groups of neurons in a living animal in distant parts of the brain over extended time periods. ""One of the important new tools in neuroscience is the ability to measure brain activity with light,"" Holy explained. ""However, too much light can be damaging to brain cells, especially if you're imaging for a long time. A few years ago, my lab developed a microscope that can illuminate the brain very gently, yet still get very high-quality pictures of what's happening over time. The trick is to shine light on just the part of the brain that's in focus so you avoid damaging any part you're not looking at. After snapping one picture, you move the microscope and take another picture of a different part of the brain. By doing that very quickly, you can cover the whole brain of the fly in a second or less."" ""This is very much an example of techniques allowing you to answer questions that weren't answerable before,"" Taghert added. Because many principles of circadian time-keeping are conserved across distant species, this neuronal mechanism discovered in Drosophila also may indicate a general clock principle.

The genetic defect causes changes in the cellular metabolism meaning that neurons are subjected to oxidative stress and an increased immune response in the brain. The study is published in Neurobiology of Disease. See Also: Stem cell study reveals how Parkinson's spreads Parkinson s disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease, has genetic causes in 15% of cases. Premature aging of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain is the reason for the motor symptoms that characterise this disease. However, how this happens is not yet fully understood. Prof. Karsten Hiller, leader of the Metabolomics research group at the LCSB, is looking for the answer in the metabolism. In the current study, he and his research team investigated a specific form of Parkinson s disease with a defective DJ1 gene.  We need the right amount of DJ1. While in some forms of cancer there is too much DJ1, in this case of Parkinson s disease, neurons don t have enough DJ1 and die off , explains Hiller. The research team took a closer look at the metabolism of neurons lacking DJ1 and discovered that two key metabolic pathways are affected.  Without DJ1, neurons cannot absorb enough glutamine and this affects serine production. Both amino acids are important for producing glutathione, which is used to neutralize free radicals , explains Dr. Johannes Meiser, lead author for the study.  In the absence of DJ1, this defence mechanism does not work effectively and oxidative stress occurs. This prematurely ages the cells.  The research team was also able to show that mutations in the DJ1 gene can also negatively affect other cells in the brain. Microglial cells, which are responsible for the immune reaction in the brain, become 'hyperactive' when the DJ1 gene is defective. Learn More: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity  Normally, microglial cells are only activated when something in the brain needs to be cleaned up, for instance during inflammation,  explains Hiller.  However, if these cells are constantly active, as we discovered happens with the DJ1 defect, this weakens the underlying neurons.  Interestingly, the researchers were able to determine metabolic changes not only in the brain s immune cells but also in the blood of Parkinson s patients with mutant DJ1. This could lead to new diagnostic avenues in the future. The next step will involve investigating how affected metabolic pathways can be influenced using drugs. The changes described in glutamine and serine metabolic processes could thus be used to develop novel approaches for treating Parkinson s. University of Luxembourg  press release Meiser J et al.

In two studies with mice and humans to be published together in the journal eLife, the investigators from Baylor College of Medicine, US, have found that the ability to synthesize new proteins, regulated by the molecule eIF2, accounts for adolescents' hypersensitivity to both cocaine and nicotine. See Also: Your adolescent brain on alcohol: Changes last into adulthood ""In humans, adolescence, namely the period between the early teenage years and early twenties, is a time of heightened susceptibility to the effects of addictive drugs, but previous studies have struggled to explain why. Our studies support the idea that regulation of protein synthesis by eIF2 might be the underlying cause,"" says senior author Mauro Costa-Mattioli. In the first study, the team injected adolescent and adult mice with saline or a low dose of cocaine. Their results showed that in adolescents, but not adults, cocaine reduces the activity of eIF2 . This leads to an increase in the strength of the connections, or synapses, between dopamine-storing neurons in a part of the midbrain that is rich with these cells. ""This greater communication between dopamine-rich neurons gives a greater sense of pleasure from taking the drug and encourages behaviors related to addiction,"" says lead author Wei Huang. ""Only higher doses of cocaine led to similar responses in adult mice, proving that adolescents have a lower threshold for the effects of cocaine on these neurons."" With the combined use of genetics and pharmacology, the investigators altered the production of proteins controlled by eIF2  in adult mice, essentially converting them into adolescents by making them more susceptible to cocaine-induced changes in synaptic strength and behavior. Conversely, adolescent mice with increased eIF2  activity in the brain became more resistant to the effects of cocaine, as seen in adults. ""It's truly remarkable that by manipulating the processes surrounding eIF2  in this way, we can rejuvenate brain activity. This could hold significant promise for developing new treatments for drug addiction and related disorders,"" says Costa-Mattioli. Learn More: How kids' brain structures grow as memory develops For the second paper, the team carried out similar experiments in mice with different doses of nicotine instead of cocaine, showing that the same effects are also true for this drug.

""In the US, the indirect financial costs of smoking and the costs of enforcing the drug control system are estimated at more than $300 billion and $100 billion per year, respectively. To help bring down both these and the human costs of addiction, our new insights could help educate adolescents about the risks of recreational drug use and experimentation, discouraging these behaviors as a result.

Their method, called PRISM, uses a molecular barcoding system to test potential drug compounds on cancer and other cell lines at an unprecedented scale and speed. The system allows for pooling and testing of multiple cell lines simultaneously, and promises to accelerate the search for targeted therapies by better representing the broad genetic diversity of disease. ""Before, you could in principle test chemical compounds of interest against hundreds of cell lines, but it would require a lab member going to a freezer, taking out hundreds of vials--one for each cell line--and setting up hundreds of tissue culture plates. Then, every time you wanted to modify the compound a little and test it again across cell lines, it would mean going back to the freezer,"" explains Todd Golub, chief scientific officer at the Broad and senior author of the paper. ""PRISM makes it far less cumbersome to get the data you need from a panel of cell lines."" PRISM involves the introduction of trackable ""barcodes"" that are integrated into the genetic makeup of each cell line being studied. The barcodes are 24 DNA nucleotides in length. With four different nucleotides comprising our genetic code (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine), the barcodes are long enough to be distinct from other stretches of DNA in the genome, and also allow for the generation of a seemingly limitless number of codes. Once the barcodes have been introduced into individual cell lines, multiple lines can be mixed together as a ""pool"" that can then be exposed to a chemical compound. At the end of the experiment, counting the numbers of each barcode serves as a readout that reveals how many cells from each cell line survived exposure to the compound. PRISM's pooling potential helps address a persistent problem in cancer research: how to efficiently test potential drugs in a way that reflects the genetic diversity of a disease like cancer. Tumors are notoriously heterogeneous--the product of genetic mutations that may be common in a particular type of cancer, or exceedingly rare. PRISM allows researchers to test a chemical compound against tens or hundreds of cell lines, each containing distinct mutations, all in one go. ""One of the perennial challenges in cancer research has been finding an approach to drug discovery that is complex enough to represent cancer, but simple enough to enable studies at higher scale than has been feasible in the lab,"" says first author Channing Yu, a medical oncologist and postdoctoral researcher in Golub's lab at Dana-Farber and the Broad. ""We created the PRISM method specifically to address this problem."" Understanding which cancer cell lines (and, by extension, which mutations) might respond to a specific compound or drug has profound implications for targeted therapy. Targeting each patient's particular form of cancer is a goal of an increasingly popular clinical model called ""precision medicine,"" which aims to tailor treatment for each patient. At the heart of precision medicine is the recognition that, if the biology underlying a condition varies among patients, the response to therapeutics, too, will vary. ""In the area of oncology, but even more generally, embracing the genetic diversity of disease is really important,"" says Golub, who is also director of the Broad's Cancer Program, the Charles A. Dana Investigator in Human Cancer Genetics at Dana-Farber, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. ""There is real power in being able to understand how potential drugs work in the context of the molecular diversity of the disease. PRISM lowers the barrier to studying this genetic complexity; it offers a wider lens with which to view and understand the activity of a compound across cancer types."" The expansion of genetic diversity in the earliest phases of drug discovery may permit the identification of new cancer targets. The researchers note that PRISM makes it easier to profile a broad range of cancers--not only rare cancers, but also cancers from populations whose genetics are traditionally underrepresented in research studies. The customizable design of the PRISM method also permits its implementation in different settings. The method can be adapted for use in large genome centers or small academic laboratories. It can be used to study a particular chemical compound of interest in great depth, or in a broader screen at the starting point of a drug discovery effort. The number of cell lines can also vary depending on the experiment being implemented; one could test a handful of cell lines or hundreds of them. ""This method is modular and can be used in many different types of experiments. Whether the scale of the experiment is very small or extremely large, PRISM offers the potential to simplify it and make it more feasible,"" says Yu, who is also an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. Golub's team used a bead hybridization barcode readout system, which had already been ""battle-tested"" in work with DNA, RNA, and proteins, as a basis for the method. In a discovery screen profiling 102 cell lines against 8,400 compounds, PRISM led the researchers to a specific novel compound, BRD-7880; the specific action against cell lines in the panel rapidly led them to discover that this compound worked by inhibiting aurora kinase B, an enzyme involved in cell division that is abnormally regulated in several cancers. The system enabled the team to read up to 500 barcodes at once, but the researchers say batch sizes can vary. Additionally, barcodes could be read out using next-generation genome sequencing techniques. Beyond the expansion of the collection of barcoded cell lines for testing larger panels of compounds, next steps will include determining whether PRISM can be used to study the complex interactions between different cell types found within tumors, or to study tumor evolution during cancer development or after cancer treatment.","Published: March 2, 2016"

The estimated five-year rate of metastasis was 0 percent for PRAME mRNA low class 1 uveal melanomas and 38 percent for PRAME mRNA high class 1 uveal melanomas. This research builds upon Harbour s identification of class 1 and 2 uveal melanomas in 2004. There are about 2,000 to 3,000 cases of uveal melanoma diagnosed each year in the United States, according to Harbour, who is also a professor and Vice Chairman for Translational Research, the Mark J. Daily Endowed Chair, and Director of the Ocular Oncology Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, part of UHealth   the University of Miami Health System. He explained that uveal melanomas are categorized into class 1 and class 2 tumors by gene expression profiling and that class 1 tumors have a much lower chance of metastasizing than class 2 tumors.  However, about 10 percent of patients with class 1 uveal melanoma do develop metastasis,  said Harbour.  The main purpose of this study was to identify a clinically useful biomarker for this subgroup of class 1 uveal melanomas, which in turn might help in the development of precision medicines for melanoma patients.  We were surprised to find that one biomarker alone   PRAME   was sufficient to identify the subgroup of class 1 tumors with increased metastatic risk,  continued Harbour.  These findings could have immediate clinical impact. The data imply that patients with class 1 uveal melanomas with increased PRAME expression should be managed differently than patients with class 1 uveal melanomas without PRAME expression. They should be monitored more closely for metastatic disease and they should be considered for clinical trials of adjuvant therapy.  Harbour and colleagues performed genome-wide analysis of mRNA isolated from five class 1 uveal melanomas that metastasized and eight class 1 tumors that did not metastasize. The most highly overexpressed mRNA in the tumors that metastasized was PRAME. Further analysis of PRAME mRNA levels showed that seven of seven class 1 tumors that metastasized had high levels of PRAME mRNA, and that 16 of 19 class 1 tumors that did not metastasize had minimal levels of PRAME mRNA. Among 64 class 1 uveal melanoma samples, 39 (61 percent) had low levels of PRAME mRNA (PRAME negative), and 25 (39 percent) had high levels of PRAME mRNA (PRAME positive). None of the patients with PRAME-negative tumors developed metastasis, while seven of the patients with PRAME-positive tumors did. To validate the association between high levels of PRAME mRNA and metastasis for class 1 uveal melanomas, the researchers analyzed two additional datasets. The first was a combination of two independently published datasets and the second was a dataset from Leiden University in the Netherlands. In both these datasets, PRAME-positive tumors had a significantly increased risk for metastasis compared with PRAME-negative tumors. Harbour said that because this is a retrospective study, meaning that the researchers identified PRAME by looking back at patients who had been treated in the past, they are planning a prospective, multicenter study to validate the findings. He explained that the class 1/class 2 gene expression profile test remains the only prognostic assay for uveal melanoma that has ever been prospectively validated in a multicenter study, and ongoing investigation will holdPRAME to this same high standard of prospective validation.","Published: March 2, 2016"

The vaccine is the result of two decades of research, and is the most protective tested to date. Melioidosis is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is thought to be spread in soil and dust, but experts do not yet know why it only affects people and animals in tropical regions. Occasionally people from the UK have contracted melioidosis while on holiday abroad. There is an urgent need for an effective vaccine. In North-East Thailand melioidosis is the third most common cause of death from infectious diseases, exceeded only by HIV and tuberculosis. In Darwin, Northern Australia, melioidosis is the most common cause of fatal community-acquired septicemic pneumonia. Melioidosis typically causes pneumonia and sepsis, and because these symptoms are similar to many other diseases it is often misdiagnosed. This means rates of people affected could be much higher than officially recorded. The condition is hard to treat as B. pseudomallei is resistant to many antibiotics. Antibiotic courses lasting several months are usually required and patients often relapse. Potential vaccines have been tested before, but none provided high-level protection. Other vaccines against the disease tested on animals have given protection against the acute form of the disease but have failed to provide long-term control of persistent, chronic melioidosis. Advances in technology mean experts at the University of Exeter have now been able to produce a vaccine which could help give humans protection against the disease. Preliminary studies have been carried out on mice, and it is hoped clinical trials on humans will take place in the future. The vaccine is made up of a combination of different proteins, some of which help produce antibodies which boosts the immune system. However, unlike other melioidosis vaccines that have been tested previously, some of the proteins in the new vaccine induce immune responses to provide enhanced protection against chronic infection. Professor Richard Titball, Professor of Molecular Microbiology, said:  Because of new technology we have been able to look at the genetic makeup of the bacterium and start to understand how the bacteria adapt to conditions during chronic infection.  We now want to carry out further work to determine whether one or more of the proteins are responsible for this enhanced protection, and to test additional proteins to see if they can be protective antigens.  Academics from the University of Milan, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine were involved in the study, which was funded by the Fondazione CARIPLO, one of the world s main philanthropic organizations.","Published: March 2, 2016"

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-new-way-to-discover-dna-modifications-186569,A New Way to Discover DNA Modifications Researchers systematically find molecules that help regulate and protect DNA  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. DNA is made from four nucleosides, each known by its own letter   A, G, C, and T. However, since the structure of DNA was deciphered in 1953, scientists have discovered several other variants that are often added to the DNA sequences to replace one of the usual four letters. These variants, which may be modified versions of the traditional nucleosides, often help cells to control which genes are turned on and off, and are referred to as  epigenetic marks  in the DNA. In bacteria, they can also protect DNA from invasion by other organisms such as viruses. Until now, these DNA modifications have been discovered by chance, as scientists uncovered unexpected signals in chemical analyses of DNA. However, a new approach from MIT, the University of Florida, and other institutions offers a systematic approach to discovering unknown epigenetic marks and modifications.  It s a way to discover nucleic acid modifications that you didn t know existed,  says Peter Dedon, the Underwood-Prescott Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT.  We ve developed a technology platform for the discovery and characterization of these new modifications.  Dedon and his colleagues suspect that bacteria and viruses, in particular, have many DNA modifications that have not been discovered yet, which could offer new antibiotic targets and new tools for biotechnology. Using their approach, which combines bioanalytical chemistry, comparative genomics, and a special type of DNA sequencing, the team has discovered a DNA modification that helps bacteria to protect their genomes from viral infection.  A multipronged approach DNA modifications are usually inserted by enzymes into DNA after it is synthesized during cell division. Such modifications are often used as markers that help tell a cell which genes should be turned on at a given time. The DNA modifications can also help cells defend their DNA from attack by foreign DNA from viruses and other bacteria. A larger variety of similar modifications also help all types of RNA, including messenger RNA and transfer RNA, perform their functions. Dedon and Val rie de Cr cy-Lagard, a professor of microbiology and cell science at the University of Florida, decided to take a more systematic approach to discovering such modifications. De Cr cy-Lagard had previously discovered many of the genes required for the synthesis of RNA modifications known as queuosine and archeosine, which are found in microorganisms and are derived from a common precursor called preQ0. Using comparative genomics, a technique for screening the genomes of different organisms for variants of specific DNA sequences, she found similar genes in multiple bacterial species, located in a specific gene cluster that contained genes for DNA modification. Comparative genomics, one leg of the platform, thus provided the first clue about a potential new DNA modification. De Cr cy-Lagard and Dedon, both senior authors of the new PNAS paper, decided to test de Cr cy-Lagard s prediction that these bacteria insert preQ0 into DNA. Using mass spectrometry, which allows researchers to both search for unknown molecules and find those with a specific mass, Dedon s lab found DNA modified with preQ0-like structures, which the team named dADG, in bacteria with the modification gene cluster but not in bacteria that lacked it. The researchers then showed that, in the types of bacteria they studied, the dADG modification is part of a defense system that protects the bacterial cell DNA. These bacteria produce enzymes called restriction enzymes that chop up the unmodified DNA of an invading virus, for example. Dedon and de Cr cy-Lagard are now searching in other bacteria for different epigenetic functions for these DNA modifications. In a collaboration with Richard Roberts, chief scientific officer at New England Biolabs, the team is now applying the third element of their technology platform to characterize the new dADG modification   a special kind of DNA sequencing called single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT), done on machines made by Pacific Biosciences. SMRT sequencing often picks up a signal when it encounters something other than the traditional four nucleosides.  There s a little hiccup in the process, a tiny little pause, and if you tune the software correctly, you can pick up that signal and know where it is in the genome,  Dedon says.  This lets you map DNA modifications across the genome.  This type of sequencing doesn t reveal what the modification is, but it pinpoints its location. By combining the observational power of SMRT sequencing with the predictive power of comparative genomics and the ability to detect and identify modifications using bioanalytics, scientists can find a new modification, figure out what the modification is, and discover its role.  This paper continues a remarkable series of investigations from the Dedon laboratory concerning novel DNA chemistry,  says Christopher Mathews, a professor emeritus of biochemistry and biophysics at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the research.  Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genes for some of the novel synthetic pathways represent the basis for hitherto unknown restriction-modification systems.  Antibiotic targets In humans, there are only a few known DNA modifications, most of which weren t discovered until decades after the four traditional DNA bases were identified.  Are there more out there? It s an interesting question,  Dedon says.  There probably aren t a huge number, but we could go look for more in humans.  In bacteria, on the other hand, the team believes there may be at least a dozen more modifications that haven t been found yet, and even more in bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). One of the important connections between bacterial DNA modifications and humans lies in the bacteria of the human gut   the gut microbiome. The team now has evidence that bacteria in the gut microbiome contain dADG, as well as another bacterial DNA modification that they discovered called phosphorothioates, and they are looking to see if they play any role in human health and disease. Any new modifications discovered could also become useful antibiotic targets, especially those that prevent restriction enzymes from chopping up the bacteria s own DNA. Drugs that inhibit the enzyme that inserts the DNA modification would disrupt the defense system, allowing the restriction enzyme to destroy the host cell s DNA. In some bacteria, the modifications may also be essential as epigenetic marks and thus antibiotic targets as well.  A lot of these enzymes are unique to the bacterium and they re also essential to the survival of that organism, so they might make good antibiotic targets,  Dedon says.","Published: March 2, 2016"

Yet this barrier is so effective that it can also block the delivery of therapies for treating neurological diseases or brain injury. A team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, led by Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., has advanced the Institute s Human Organs-on-Chips technology by developing a method for modeling the 3D structure of the human blood-brain barrier inside a microfluidic device, which will help scientists study human neurovascular function and inflammation in vitro.  ""The blood-brain barrier is the first line of defense against chemicals and molecules that could induce brain injury, but it also blocks transport of potentially life-saving therapeutics to the central nervous system,"" said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""It s very difficult to get small molecule drugs and biologics into the brain due to the blood-brain barrier, and until now there hasn t been a good in vitro model for studying the multi-cellular interactions that govern the barrier s permeability in humans,"" said Anna Herland, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute and the first author on the new study. To develop their 3D blood-brain barrier on-a-chip, the team used a microengineering technique to fabricate a hollow blood vessel lined by human endothelial cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix containing human pericytes and astrocytes that together form the blood-brain barrier within the microvessels of our own brains. They did so by forming a microchannel inside a clear, polymer chip, filling the channel with collagen matrix containing human brain astrocyte cells, and then forming a long narrow lumen from one end to the other using a ""viscous fingering"" method. The resulting lumen, representing the shape of a blood vessel, was then seeded with human brain pericyte cells and, finally, lined with living human endothelial cells that normally build the interior surfaces of our vessel walls. Strikingly, over the course of the study, the human cells self-assembled to take on their normal positions as seen in vivo, with the pericytes in close apposition to the endothelial cells and the astrocytes cells extending through the collagen matrix to contact the endothelial cells. The cells, nourished by nutrients and a blood substitute flowing through the vessel-like microchannel, reconstituted a blood-brain barrier to small molecules similar to that seen in vivo. Using this model, the Wyss team studied neuroinflammatory responsein vitro by introducing a pro-inflammatory protein that is associated with several diseases of the central nervous system including Alzheimer s, stroke, brain ischemia, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and others. The experiment revealed that both pericyte and astrocyte cells can modulate the production of neuroprotective proteins, and that these cells can also act independently of one another in their response to inflammation signals. The newfound ability to study these complex interactions in vitro is a significant advance when compared to traditional cell culture techniques, which do not mimic the physiologically relevant 3D orientation of different cell types and structures like the blood-brain barrier on-a-chip. This new device can be used to investigate the cause and effects of neuroinflammation, which play a central role in many neurological disorders, as well as to identify potential new approaches to develop drugs that selectively cross the human blood-brain barrier.","Published: March 2, 2016"

""We are eager to see this technology come to fruition and move to the public."" The device, called the Bacteria Rapid Detection using Optical Scattering Technology, or BEAM, has shown great promise in identifying dangerous pathogens such as listeria, staphylococcus, salmonella, vibrio, and E. coli. Since the technology does not require a reagent, it reduces the cost of the pathogen identification. The technology can be used to test any food source for contamination, changing the model for rapid and definitive identification of pathogens. ""The technology can transmit a pathogenic organism fingerprint across the country instantly without the danger of physically transporting the pathogenic organism. This can be achieved without any reagents or assay requirements, which makes this a unique feature for this technology,"" said J. Paul Robinson, the SVM Professor of Cytomics in the Purdue Department of Basic Medical Sciences, and member of the Purdue Center for Food Safety Engineering who helped develop the technology. ""Another attribute is that the technology evaluates every colony on a Petri-dish, so it eliminates or significantly minimizes the sampling bias, and as a result dramatically lowers dramatically the rate of false negatives - something that no other technology in organism identification can claim."" Other innovators of this technology are Dan Hirleman, Purdue's chief corporate and global partnerships officer; Arun Bhunia, professor of food science; Bartlomiej Rajwa, assistant professor of computational biology in the Bindley Bioscience Centter; and Euiwon Bae, senior research scientist in the School of Mechanical Engineering.

Alzheimer s is characterised by, amongst other factors, the presence of amyloid, in its various forms,and hyperphosphorylated tau leading to cognitive impairment. The research published suggeststhat a previously undiscovered mechanism in a key group of neurons affected in a neurodegeneratingbrain is the key driver of the continuing cycle of neuronal cell death. It could be possible to halt theprogression of the disease by intercepting this mechanism. Over 46 million people live with dementia worldwide; this is predicted to reach 131.5 million by 2050 due to the ageing populations. There is an urgent need for a different type of therapy that actually stops the characteristic progressive cell loss. Researchers at Neuro-Bio have now validated a novel theory for the continuing cycle of neuronal death that typifies Alzheimer s and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson s and Motor Neurone Disease. The key driver is a 14 amino acid peptide ( AChE peptide ) that originates from acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme essential in breaking down a well-known chemical messenger between neurons, but increasingly recognised as a signalling molecule with non-enzymatic functions. Whilst the existence of the AChE peptide and its link to neurodegeneration have been previously proposed in Professor Greenfield s work, these are the first reports of its detection in both human and rat brain and its actions in driving an Alzheimer-like biochemical profile. The two consecutive papers in Neuropharmacology report raised levels of the novel peptide inAlzheimer s midbrain and cerebrospinal fluid compared with controls, and demonstrate that, in vitro, thepeptide drives production of both amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau. In the first paper, the damaging effects of either the AChE peptide or amyloid are shown to be blocked by a novel prototype drug (NBP-14), a cyclised form of the AChE peptide. NBP-14 intercepts the action of the AChE peptide on the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor, which is found on the outer surface of neuronal cells. In the second paper, the effects of the AChE peptide and their blockade by NBP14 are demonstrated in ex vivo rat basal forebrain, using real-time optical imaging of large-scale, transient  neuronal assemblies . Professor Susan Greenfield, CEO of Neuro-Bio and senior author on both papers, commented: These publications are the culmination of some 40 years research from our lab building up a picture indicating that the naturally occurring AChE peptide is a pivotal signalling molecule in a mechanism underlying Alzheimer s and related disorders. We are encouraged by the potential for the prototype compound NBP-14 to block the activity of this peptide and also by the possibility of monitoring the peptide as a biomarker for early, even pre-symptomatic diagnosis.  Professor Gary Small of the Brain Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, and member of the Neuro-Bio Scientific Advisory Board added:  This recent work showing that a peptide derived from acetylcholinesterase is elevated in the Alzheimer brain and that a synthetic version of this peptide enhances calcium influx and eventual production of amyloid beta and tau phosphorylation via an allosteric site on the  7 nicotinic receptor is extremely exciting. The fact that a synthetic cyclic version of this peptide is neuroprotective makes this innovative therapeutic approach highly promising.  Professor Margaret Esiri of the Neuropathology Dept at the John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford and member of the Neuro-Bio Scientific Advisory Board commented:  After quite a number of years of research this is an important staging-post at which Neuro-Bio can develop aspects of the work in new directions and with new confidence. This I can see is really exciting and gives new opportunities to increase the pace of the research.  Professor Terry Sejnowski, Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Francis CrickProfessor at The Salk Institute said:  Any new approach to Alzheimer s disease, which is increasing in prevalence as we live longer, that shows as much promise as this new peptide should be quickly brought to the attention of the scientific community. The dominant focus on beta amyloid has side-tracked the scientific community and thepotential new direction will be a surprise to Alzheimer s researchers. ","Published: March 2, 2016"

The US team of academics will work with drug development experts at UK-based MRC Technology, to target the immune system in a bid to halt nerve cell damage. The investment comes as part of the  4 million Dementia Consortium   a global partnership between Alzheimer s Research UK, MRC Technology and the pharmaceutical companies Abbvie, Astex, Eisai and Lilly. By uniting expertise, the Consortium is bridging the gap between academic research and the pharmaceutical industry in the search for new drugs to slow neurodegenerative diseases. The Consortium s project with the University of South Florida marks their first contract for collaboration with an American University. The link between the immune system and neurodegeneration is the focus of intense investigation and a number of drug discovery efforts aimed at reducing inflammation have got underway recently. In this collaborative project, Dr David Morgan and Dr Kevin Nash of the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer's Institute, University of South Florida will explore the role of immune system regulator, fractalkine, in neurodegeneration. Their previous work in animal models of Alzheimer s disease indicated a neuroprotective role for the protein, with increased levels of fractalkine dampening inflammation, halting nerve cell death and reducing tau deposits. The team observed similar benefits in mouse models of Parkinson s, suggesting that fractalkine receptor agonism could be a treatment approach for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. As no known small molecule agonists of the fractalkine receptor exist, the Dementia Consortium funding will couple Dr Morgan s expertise in neurodegeneration and in vivo validation techniques with the MRC Technology s extensive screening capabilities and medicinal chemistry programmes. Talking about the new funding, Dr David Morgan said:  We ve been exploring the role of fractalkine in Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease for many years now, highlighting a neuroprotective role for the protein. Thanks to funding from the Dementia Consortium, we are now able to shift our focus from pathway characterisation to drug development. We re particularly excited that this approach could have an impact across a number of different neurodegenerative diseases and look forward to coupling our disease knowledge with drug discovery experts in the UK, to help accelerate progress towards treatments.  Dr Simon Ridley, Director of Research at Alzheimer s Research UK, said:  Dementia is our greatest medical challenge, with 46 million people worldwide living with the condition. The Dementia Consortium is one of a range of initiatives by Alzheimer s Research UK to accelerate the  bench to bedside  journey, ensuring that academic insights are translated into the clinic as rapidly as possible. The high attrition rate in drug discovery means we must invest heavily in promising early stage development projects and the Dementia Consortium provides a unique vehicle for this investment, uniting expertise across the academic, technology transfer and pharmaceutical sectors.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director, Drug Discovery at MRC Technology, said:  Scientists are increasingly looking at the body s own immune system to fight some of the most challenging diseases of our time. This project will progress promising findings that fractalkine could reduce inflammation and cell death. Drug discovery expertise in our laboratories will now be applied to find small molecules to stimulate the fractalkine receptor so we can move a step closer to finding a new treatment for people with dementia.  On forming new partnerships, Valerie McDevitt, Associate Vice President for Technology Transfer & Business Partnerships at the University of South Florida said:  The University of South Florida places emphasis on building new relationships like this one to help bridge the gap between academic research and industry. Our collaboration with the Dementia Consortium provides an opportunity to positively impact the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and aligns with our university mission to serve as a highly effective major economic engine.

Marjorie Solomon, licensed psychologist and Oates Endowed Chair, focuses on clinical intervention programs for children and young adults with autism spectrum disorder. Marjorie Solomon, licensed psychologist and Oates Endowed Chair, focuses on clinical intervention programs for children and young adults with autism spectrum disorder.  Some research studies suggest that young adults with autism are at great risk for having poor outcomes in adulthood as measured by having meaningful friendships, being competitively employed and living independently. But our experience working with teens and young adults on the spectrum tells us that this is not always the case,  said Marjorie Solomon, Oates Endowed Chair in Lifespan Development in Autism, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the UC Davis MIND Institute and principal investigator of the study.  Through the Cognitive Control in Autism (CoCoA) study, we hope to learn more about the neurobiology of this period of development so that we can maximize growth in teens and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to help them learn, thrive and achieve their full potential in life,  she added. Flexibility in processing information, changing actions a focus For the five year study, Solomon and her team will focus on cognitive control, an executive function that allows a person to flexibly process information and change actions to achieve internal goals rather than remaining rigid and inflexible. For example, if a page of text had some words printed in different colors and the goal was to read a full paragraph aloud, exercising cognitive control would allow a person to make a judgment to read the word  green  out loud even if the word is printed in red on the page. Solomon said that the development of cognitive control is important in learning, from planning and problem solving to multitasking, and that it undergoes tremendous development through adolescence in typically developing individuals. The CoCoA study hopes to isolate the biological components that correspond to strengths and challenges in the development of cognitive control in both typically developing and ASD study participants to answer the many questions that remain.  We don t know if the development of cognitive control in typically developing teens is similar to adolescents with ASD and if adolescents with ASD can overcome their cognitive-control deficits as they age into their 20s,  she said.  We also would like to better understand the many strengths teens and young adults with ASD use to compensate in tasks that are difficult for them and how this relates to their functioning in daily life in adulthood.  How to enroll in the Cognitive Control in Autism (CoCoA) study UC Davis MIND Institute investigators plan to enroll approximately 100 children and young adults with ASD and 100 with typical development who are between the ages of 12 and 22. Study participants will be compensated for their time, receive free assessments and be given a digital file of their own brain scan. Participants must be willing to come back for assessments one-to-two times more during the five-year study period. Participation in the study involves two visits to the UC Davis Health System campus in Sacramento, one at the MIND Institute and one at the UC Davis Imaging Research Center. During the visits, participants will fill out questionnaires, complete computer-based brainteasers and puzzles, and have their brains scanned using fMRI while completing a learning task. The fMRIs show researchers which parts of the brain are active during the tasks. After this first visit, participants will then return to the MIND Institute to participate in additional behavioral testing and a brain scan either one or two times more during the next five years.  Scanning and assessing individuals more than once is a novel aspect of the study that will enable us to delve deeper into what occurs during development from ages 12-27,  Solomon said.  Another innovative part of the study is that we will be developing new measurements that are sensitive to important contemporary aspects of adults with typical development and those with ASD, such as communicating by using social media.  Solomon said typically developing individuals, as well as those with ASD, have something to gain from participating in the study. Some get the pleasure of knowing they are helping people with autism, and those with autism get free testing that may help us to better understand their unique gifts,"" she said. ""We take the time to discuss their results and answer their questions. They also become associated with a system of care that specializes in helping people with autism. A lot of families appreciate that. ","Published: March 2, 2016"

Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. This rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,  said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.  Eye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.  Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis. DRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving. Each participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago. Among participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants  vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25. Among participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.  The results of the DRCR Network s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,  said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina.  The study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.  The number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year. The need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group. The risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs. Results of the study were published online in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Eylea and Lucentis were provided by drug manufacturers Regeneron and Genentech, respectively. Additional research funding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, also a part of NIH.  This important study would not have happened without funding from the National Institutes of Health and the cooperation of two competing companies,  said Adam R. Glassman, M.S., principal investigator of the DRCR.Net Coordinating Center at the Jaeb Center for Health Research.","Published: March 2, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/air-pollution-linked-to-higher-risk-of-preterm-birth-185819,Air Pollution Linked to Higher Risk of Preterm Birth Researchers at NIH have found early exposure of air pollution may affect pregnancy outcomes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Pregnant women with asthma may be at greater risk of preterm birth when exposed to high levels of certain traffic-related air pollutants, according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. The researchers observed an increased risk associated with both ongoing and short-term exposure to nitrogen oxides (link is external) and carbon monoxide (link is external), particularly when women were exposed to those pollutants just before conception and in early pregnancy. For example, an increase of 30 parts per billion in nitrogen oxide exposure in the three months prior to pregnancy increased preterm birth risk by nearly 30 percent for women with asthma, compared to 8 percent for women without asthma. Greater carbon monoxide exposure during the same period raised preterm birth risk by 12 percent for asthmatic women, but had no effect on preterm birth risk for non-asthmatics. The last six weeks of pregnancy was another critical window for women with asthma, according to the researchers. Exposure to high levels of particulate matter (link is external)   very small particles of substances like acids, metals, and dust in the air   also was associated with higher preterm birth risk. The study was published online in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.  Preterm birth is a major public health problem in this country, affecting more than 1 in 10 infants born in the United States,  said Pauline Mendola, Ph.D., lead author and an investigator at the NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  Our study found that air pollution appears to add to the preterm birth risk faced by women with asthma. These findings set the stage for further studies designed to help prevent preterm birth in this at-risk group.  Asthma is a lung disease that affects an estimated 9 percent of women of reproductive age (link is external) in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maternal asthma is associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications and health problems for infants. While prior studies have examined the effects of various air pollutants on preterm birth risk, the research team said that its study is the first to examine whether exposure to air pollution before conception might affect later pregnancy.  Early environmental exposures can have significant effects on later health,  said Dr. Mendola.  In this case, it may be that early exposure to air pollution sets off inflammation or other internal stresses that interfere with embryo implantation or placental development. Those disruptions could lead to preterm delivery down the road. More research will help us to better understand the potential impact of air pollution in the months surrounding conception.  Also taking part in the study were researchers from the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth; the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Oulu, Finland; the Emmes Corporation in Rockville, Maryland; and Texas A&M University in College Station. The researchers analyzed data from a national sample of 223,502 singleton pregnancies (pregnancies with a single fetus), delivered at 19 hospitals around the country from 2002 to 2008. Electronic medical records of the women included their asthma status and date of delivery. The team matched that data with daily measures of air quality from the regions surrounding each of the hospitals to assess the potential effects of air pollution, week by week, on preterm birth risk. They studied six pollutants and accounted for such factors as location, age, race and ethnicity, pre-pregnancy weight, smoking and alcohol use, and chronic maternal health conditions. The research team hopes that studies like this one will one day improve the care of pregnant women with asthma and reduce their risk for preterm birth. Meanwhile, people with asthma who are concerned about exposures to air pollution may want to limit their outdoor activity during periods when the air quality is forecast to be unhealthy for sensitive groups, said Dr. Mendola.","Published: March 2, 2016"

See Also: Does concussion impact men and women differently? Researchers studied the severity and frequency of game-related concussions among 40 former professional football players, many of whom had suffered cognitive deficits. The researchers combined this data with the estimates of each player's cognitive reserve, a mechanism which helps protect the brain from injury. Cognitive reserve is developed through mentally enriching experiences, such as education and reading. The researchers concluded that a unique combination of the harmful and the protective factors can predict cognitive outcomes in players who had suffered concussions during their football careers and have been retired from American professional football for an average of 20 years. ""The most important factor in determining the potential cognitive deficits from sports-related concussions was the football players' cognitive reserve"" said Matthew J. Wright, PhD, an LA BioMed lead researcher and lead author of the paper published online in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Psychology. ""We also found that post-traumatic amnesia after a concussion was a more significant predictor of later cognitive deficits than the loss of consciousness."" Learn More: Promising new biomarkers for concussion found The research was conducted at LA BioMed, the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. To determine cognitive reserve, the researchers utilized test, questionnaire and interview data. The researchers also surveyed other studies, which have found cognitive reserve is protective in other forms of brain injury and disease, including Alzheimer's disease. The study's findings are significant because, after motor vehicle accidents, sports-related injuries are the second-most common cause of traumatic brain injuries. Sports-related injuries account for as many as 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries per year in the U.S., according to researchers. Young men, aged 10-19 years, tend to have the highest rates of sports concussions, and 5% to 10% of high school and college American football players are at risk of suffering a concussion each year. ""While further study is needed, our findings open the door to the possibility that professional football could use individual indices to predict the potential for long-term cognitive losses in determining when, or if, a player should return to the field after suffering a concussion,"" Dr. Wright said.

Kim Green and colleagues with UCI's Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders found that flushing away the abundant inflammatory cells produced in reaction to beta-amyloid plaques restored memory function in test mice. Their study showed that these microglia cells contribute to the neuronal and memory deficits seen in this neurodegenerative disease. Results appear in the journal Brain. See Also: Body s immune system may play larger role in Alzheimer s disease than thought ""Our findings demonstrate the critical role that inflammation plays in Alzheimer's-related memory and cognitive losses,"" said Green, an assistant professor of neurobiology & behavior. ""While we were successful in removing the elevated microglia resulting from beta-amyloid, further research is required to better understand the link among beta-amyloid, inflammation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's."" The neurobiologists treated Alzheimer's disease model mice with a small-molecule inhibitor compound called pexidartinib, or PLX3397, which is currently being used in several phase 2 oncology studies and a phase 3 clinical trial to treat a benign neoplasm of the joints. The inhibitor works by selectively blocking signaling of microglial surface receptors, known as colony-stimulating factor 1 receptors, which are necessary for microglial survival and proliferation in response to various stimuli, including beta-amyloid. This led to a dramatic reduction of these inflammatory cells, allowing for analysis of their role in Alzheimer's. The researchers noted a lack of neuron death and improved memory and cognition in the pexidartinib-treated mice, along with renewed growth of dendritic spines that enable brain neurons to communicate. Learn More: Study links brain inflammation triggered by chronic pain to anxiety and depression Green said that although the compound swept away microglia, the beta-amyloid remained, raising new questions about the part these plaques play in Alzheimer's neurodegenerative process. In healthy tissue, microglia act as the first and main form of immune defense in the central nervous system. But in a disease state, such as Alzheimer's, microglia appear to turn against the healthy tissue they were originally assigned to protect, causing inflammation in the brain.

We know that dopamine reinforces  rewarding  behaviors, but to our surprise, we have now shown that situations that animals learn to avoid are also regulated by dopamine,  said senior author John Dani, PhD, chair of the department of Neuroscience. The team s findings are published in Cell Reports. See Also: Dopamine signaling pathway that controls cocaine reward in mice identified Special neurons in the brain send out a burst of dopamine in both negative and positive situations. However, the exact way in which dopamine neurons are wired and connected to the brain center called the hippocampus remains controversial among neuroscientists. Knowing exactly how the neurotransmitter dopamine shapes memory and behavior in association with an event or the surrounding environment is important to better understand such conditions as post-traumatic stress syndrome.  We showed in mice that a special circuit in the hippocampus has flexibility in combining with environmental input to shape behavior during an experiment in which the mice learn to avoid an unpleasant experience,  Dani said.  This is the first time that we have been able to show, as proof of principle, that the dopamine circuitry is also involved in learning to avoid aversive situations.   In previous animal experiments, when mice experience an unexpected reward, for example discovering a tube in which they can obtain a sugar-water treat, a burst of dopamine is emitted in the brain. The debate among neuroscientists centers on whether the neurotransmitter only shapes behavior when an animal is receiving a positive reward or if the neurotransmitter is also involved in shaping the way an animal learns how to avoid an uncomfortable situation. Learn More: Discovery puts designer dopamine neurons within reach The team found that if the mice encounter a negative stimuli, a subgroup of neurons fires and releases dopamine in conjunction with the aversive environmental input. They also showed that when the dopamine signal to the hippocampus is chemically blocked in the mice, it prevents them from learning to avoid the negative stimulus. However, if the dopamine signal is chemically boosted in the mice, they remember to avoid the aversive event longer.    The bottom line of our study is that dopamine plays a role in both conditions, and that dopamine enables mice to learn and remember to avoid the negative situation, in this case avoiding a light foot shock in one room of a two-room enclosure.

Located in the BioHub at Alderley Park, Cheshire, they recently received a visit from the Duke of York who was interested to hear about Blueberry s goals to develop new anti-infective treatments and see first hand some of the nanoparticle formulation and characterisation work. Nanotechnology is often hailed for its potential to advance medicine, however it is not simply working at ever smaller dimensions; rather, working at the nanoscale enables scientists to utilise the unique physical, chemical, mechanical, and optical properties of materials that naturally occur at that scale. Blueberry has unique nanopolymer delivery technology that opens up huge opportunities to rapidly develop new medicines and help find ways to treat infection and inflammation. Blueberry s novel nanotechnology drug delivery platform allows the company to deliver drugs into cells and tissue in an efficient way, which has the potential to facilitate the development of therapies to tackle the huge healthcare needs of antibiotic resistance in bacterial infection. As they can deliver drugs so efficiently with this platform, Blueberry can:   Cut doses   and potential side effects   while maintaining efficacy   Make changes inside cells to make them susceptible to drugs   with the potential to revitalise old antibiotics that don t work Dr Mike Davies, Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at Blueberry Therapeutics, commented:  Last year we secured investment that was an extremely significant stepping stone in our journey to deliver new therapies to patients suffering from serious bacterial and fungal infections. The capital will enable Blueberry to progress two anti-fungal programmes to clinical trials this year. In the short-term we are delivering a portfolio of over-the-counter products to generate revenue and thus enable the growth of Blueberry and ensure significant return to our investors.  On the visit from HRH Duke of York, Dr Davies added:  We were delighted to be able to host The Duke and present our goals to develop new anti-infective treatments.

In a study the researchers showed that though metastases from different patients varied widely in their genetic characteristics, metastases within a single patient were remarkably similar. These results suggest not merely that patients with metastatic prostate cancer may benefit from treatment tailored to their particular tumors, but also that a single biopsy may provide enough information to oncologists to guide such therapy.  If you look in multiple metastases within a given patient, they re actually very, very similar,  said Dr. Pete Nelson, the study s lead author and a prostate cancer researcher at Fred Hutch and oncologist at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the Hutch's treatment arm. Unlike initial tumors in the prostate, in which molecular characteristics can vary by location, the tumor cells that break free and travel to distant locations within the body, forming metastases, appear to share characteristics.  They re not identical, but they are very similar  We can feel generally confident, at least with prostate cancer, that if you did sample a single tumor, you could make clinical decisions based on what you find.  An unmet need More than 27,000 men die from metastatic prostate cancer each year in the U.S. according to the American Cancer Society. Men with metastatic prostate cancer are treated with drugs that suppress their testosterone   a therapy that works very well, until it doesn t. Metastatic prostate cancer almost always will develop ways to circumvent the loss of testosterone, recurring and progressing even more aggressively. Despite this phenomenon, this standard of care   also known as androgen deprivation or androgen suppression therapy   has remained almost unchanged for half a century, and patients urgently need new therapies. A deeper understanding of the changes that metastatic prostate cancer can undergo to resist treatment has opened up several potential new therapeutic avenues, but researchers don t yet know which method will work for which patient. Successful precision oncology, in which each patient s therapy is tailored based on the molecular alterations of their cancer, requires both that patients differ dramatically from each other   which bars a one-size-fits-all approach. It also relies on relative uniformity among the tumors within each patient   so the treatment any individual receives is effective against every one of their tumors. Researchers have been gathering evidence that cells within the original, or primary, tumor, which can take decades to develop, can exhibit different molecular features than their neighbors. But scientists had little information about whether this also holds true for the cells that have left their home tumor and taken up residence elsewhere, such as in the bones or the liver. 'Essence of precision medicine' To compare the molecular characteristics of different tumors, Nelson and co-authors Dr. Akash Kumar of the UW and Ilsa Coleman, a researcher working in Nelson's lab, studied metastatic tumors from 176 men who had died of prostate cancer and previously agreed to donate their tumors posthumously to research. The team examined various types of mutations and alterations in how strongly particular genes were dialed up or down.  We found tremendous variation across patients, which is sort of the essence of precision medicine: not every tumor from every person looks the same   so you would want to use a particular therapy in one person and a different therapy in another,  said Nelson. But tumors within individuals were quite similar, he said,  so you could be confident that if you selected a treatment based on what the composition of tumor A was, that the rest of the tumors should respond.  Avenues of exploration In addition to demonstrating that prostate cancer may present just the characteristics needed for precision medicine strategies, Nelson s team identified a few potential leads for specific drug regimens. Cells respond to testosterone via a molecule called the androgen receptor, or AR, which turns on a suite of genes known as the  AR signature.  Though all the men in the study had undergone testosterone-suppressing therapy, more than two-thirds of the men had tumors with a high AR signature. Surprisingly, tumor cells with this specific signature appeared to grow more slowly than tumor cells from other men in which these same genes were active at lower levels. This may be a hint that men whose metastases exhibit a very high AR signature could be candidates for a new strategy currently being tested in a Phase 2 clinical trial at SCCA: alternating high doses of testosterone with suppressive therapy. The hope is that the burst of testosterone will push tumor cells to stop dividing, said Nelson, though he cautioned that it s too soon to know how well the strategy would work. The team also found that in the tumor cells that multiplied more quickly, genes that encode DNA-repair proteins were more likely to be active. These critical proteins keep our DNA from accumulating mutations, and defective versions of DNA-repair enzyme genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been linked to cancer. Nelson previously collaborated on a study showing that almost 25 percent of men with metastatic prostate cancer had tumors with mutations in DNA-repair genes. Drugs aimed at treating other types of tumors that lack the ability to repair DNA are already in the clinic, including PARP inhibitors for ovarian cancer. A recent clinical trial of one PARP inhibitor showed dramatic responses in men whose prostate tumors had DNA-repair defects.  Our [new] study showed that if you biopsied one tumor in that man, and you showed [the cells] had a DNA repair defect, it would be present in the other tumors from that man. And so you could be pretty confident to try that type of drug,  said Nelson, though he noted that PARP inhibitors are not yet approved for patients with prostate cancer. However, drugs currently available for prostate cancer may also be good candidates for tailored use against some of these types of tumors. Nelson and colleagues at UW published acase report in December of 2015 describing three patients with metastatic prostate cancer who all had dramatic responses to a platinum-based drug   a drug also known to be effective against tumors with defects in their ability to repair DNA and used extensively in ovarian cancer treatment.  And that s a drug we can use today because it is approved for prostate cancer,  said Nelson. Next steps Oncologists already have tools to analyze successful biopsies of their patients  tumors.  We have an assay today called UW-OncoPlex that we can order to assess the mutation status of a man s tumor,  said Nelson.  In many situations, this is now a very straightforward procedure and very useful information can be obtained to guide therapy.  However, it s not always easy to get the necessary information from biopsies, Nelson said. He noted that prostate cancer often metastasizes to the bone, and this hard substance can make it difficult to remove tumor cells to analyze. Consequently, information about tumor cells can only be gleaned from about 65 percent of bone biopsy samples. But tumors often shed cells and snippets of DNA into the bloodstream. Nelson and his colleagues are working to develop a much less invasive, blood-based test to detect those free-floating cells or molecules in order to one day replace biopsies of metastases. The researchers will also need to explore how a patient s disease might adapt to a therapy custom-selected based on a biopsy result. The blood-based test that Nelson s team is working on would make this project easier, since repeated biopsies can cause tissue damage to patients. Their newly published analysis  doesn t tell you what will happen over time, under the selective pressure of your treatment. And those are the next studies that need to happen,  said Nelson.","Published: March 1, 2016"

While malaria no longer poses a significant threat in developed countries, it affects millions of people every year around the world. P. vivax malaria is challenging to control because it can be dormant, causing no symptoms, and then become active causing symptomatic malaria weeks to months after initial infection. The vaccine candidate developed by WRAIR and tested jointly with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to prevent vivax malaria infection is the first in-human study of its kind under an investigational new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration. WRAIR investigators immunized 30 volunteers with three doses of the vaccine candidate. Malaria is only transmitted through the bite of a female mosquito. Immunized volunteers took part in WRAIR's well-established controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model where they were bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes. The efficacy of the vaccine candidate was then determined based on whether or not volunteers developed malaria by looking at blood smears or if it took longer for malaria parasites to appear in the blood. ""This study represents the first vaccine study to test the effectiveness of a P. vivax vaccine candidate in humans using controlled human malaria infection,"" said Lt. Col. Jason W. Bennett, the study's lead investigator. The study's results were published today in the journalPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Unlike P. falciparum where a CHMI model is well established, the P. vivax CHMI model must rely on blood donations from infected humans to initiate infections in mosquitoes. For this trial, the WRAIR investigators worked with the WRAIR overseas lab in Bangkok, Thailand, the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), to acquire P. vivax-infected mosquitoes which were then transported to WRAIR for the malaria challenge. The vaccine candidate was well tolerated in all volunteers and generated robust immune responses. While the vaccine candidate did not prevent malaria infection, it did significantly delay parasitemia in 59% of vaccinated subjects. Col. Robert Paris, director of the US Military Malaria Research Program at WRAIR, is optimistic that an improved vaccine can be designed. ""Findings from the analysis of the immune response of vaccinated subjects have given us clues to improve vaccine candidates and studies are now underway at WRAIR to develop next generation vivax vaccines,"" says Dr. Paris, ""Vaccines and antimalarial drugs are both critical needs for the DoD to protect service members from malaria."" Malaria challenge models require effective treatment for any resulting malaria infections. Investigators were also able to demonstrate that individuals with low or absent levels of a specific liver enzyme were unable to convert primaquine to an active drug form to kill the dormant stage of the parasites. These volunteers were more likely to experience vivax malaria relapse. The clinical data in this study is the first to show that differences in a person's genetics can result in primaquine treatment failure. Despite this newly identified limitation, primaquine remains the only FDA-approved drug to treat the dormant stages of vivax malaria. WRAIR remains dedicated to developing vaccines, cures, and other products to eradicate and curb the transmission of infectious diseases. Decades of research at WRAIR have culminated in many effective products, including vaccines for yellow fever, dengue fever, and Japanese encephalitis. This study demonstrates WRAIR's continued dedication to malaria prevention and marks an important step towards an effective P. vivax vaccine.","Published: March 1, 2016"

The study proved that the prostate basal cell layer contains adult stem cells which possess a unique gene expression profile resembling the deadliest form of prostate cancer. The research was led by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with findings published in the Feb. 29, 2016 online issue of Nature Communications. ""It has become very controversial as to whether the human prostate contains adult stem cells or not and where they are located within the basal or luminal cell compartments,"" said Dean Tang, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis. ""Our study provided definitive evidence that the prostate basal cell layer harbors self-renewing adult stem cells that are enriched in stem-cell genes."" Tang and his team headed by Dingxiao Zhang, Ph.D., an instructor in Tang's lab, show that the findings point to a ""theoretical rationale for combining Pol-I and MYC inhibitors to treat highly aggressive forms of prostate cancer which are resistant to endocrine therapy."" Pol-I is an enzyme involved with DNA replication and MYC is a regulator gene that plays a role in cell death and transformation. The prostate gland contains basal and luminal cells, both of which have been identified as ""cells-of-origin"" for prostate cancer in recent mouse studies. However, the question of whether and where stem cells were present in the human prostate has been largely a medical mystery and a constant debate until now. Tang's team completed a genome-wide analysis of human benign prostate basal and luminal cells using RNA sequencing and found that they expressed genes differently and that some basal cells represented self-renewing adult stem cells. ""Strikingly, we found that basal stem cells also expressed a large cohort of 'proneural' genes that are normally involved in regulating the nervous system development,"" said Tang. ""These proneural genes seem to play important functions in conferring stem cell-like properties upon some basal cells."" This finding is important because a subset of prostate cancers (less than 5 percent) are highly aggressive and do not respond to current anti-prostate cancer treatments such as endocrine therapy. ""Surprisingly, these hard-to-treat cancers also express a gene signature that overlaps with our normal basal stem cell gene expression profile, suggesting that basal stem cells may represent the cell-of-origin for these prostate cancers,"" said Tang. ""Of significance, the basal stem cell gene expression profile is also linked to endocrine therapy-resistant cancer which is lethal to virtually all advanced prostate cancer patients."" Tang's team also found that basal stem cells are enriched in a genetic component that is partially regulated by MYC which offers hope that the deadliest of prostate cancers and therapy-resistant prostate cancers may have a new therapeutic option. ""Our studies establish that therapy that combines Pol-I and MYC inhibitors may be a potential new line of treatment for highly metastatic and endocrine therapy-resistant prostate cancer,"" said Tang.","Published: March 1, 2016"

While bank voles are unaffected by the infection, hantaviruses can cause potentially fatal diseases in humans for which no treatments exist. In central and northern Europe, infection is accompanied by fever, headache, or even renal failure. The strain that occurs in East Asia -- the Hantaan virus -- is even more dangerous: up to five percent of infected patients die of hemorrhagic fever, renal failure, or severe respiratory disorders. Dr. Daniel Olal and Prof. Oliver Daumke of the MDC in Berlin have now analyzed the nucleoprotein of the Hantaan virus by means of X-ray crystallography and identified its three-dimensional structure. Olal and Daumke have worked out how individual nucleoproteins oligomerize in the presence of RNA molecules, and they have found hexameric circular complexes. ""We already know about cellular defense mechanisms that inhibit viral growth. We think that the circular structures we have identified could play a part in this,"" says Olal. The nucleoprotein plays an important part in replication of the viral genome. If its function is disrupted, the cell cannot produce functional virus particles. This protein is therefore an ideal target structure for future drugs. ""Our structure could be useful for the design of small molecules that specifically block the nucleoprotein,"" says Olal. The researchers have identified three binding pockets on the surface of the protein that could serve as docking sites for such compounds. Olal is positive that such drugs will be developed in the future: ""After all, the technology for finding candidates for drug development is getting better all the time.""","Published: March 1, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/into-thin-air-198588,Into Thin Air Lower oxygen intake could be used to prevent mitochondrial diseases from forming  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A team led by Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital investigators has found that the controlled induction of the hypoxia response, the body s reaction to a reduced level of oxygen in the bloodstream, may relieve the symptoms of one of the most challenging groups of genetic disorders mitochondrial diseases. Their report describing experiments in cellular and animal models of mitochondrial disease has been published online.  We currently lack effective means of treating mitochondrial diseases, of which there are more than 150 different genetic forms, impacting virtually any organ,  said Vamsi Mootha, HMS professor of systems biology, a researcher in the Mass General Department of Molecular Biology and senior author of the Science report.  We found that activation of the hypoxia response either genetically or pharmacologically in cells, or by placing mice in a low-oxygen environment alleviated mitochondrial pathology,  he said. Many mitochondrial diseases appear in infancy or early childhood, but in others symptoms may not appear until adulthood and are often triggered by external stressors such as infection. Although the mitochondria in many organs are defective in these disorders, disease pathology is manifest only in certain tissues. These observations led the researchers to hypothesize that there might be inborn mechanisms for coping with mitochondrial dysfunction. They created a cellular model in which respiratory chain activity was inhibited by application of a toxin and used the model to test whether disruption of any of about 18,000 different genes alleviated the cellular effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. The top-ranking gene in their analysis was for Von Hippel Lindau factor (VHL), which ordinarily suppresses the cellular response to hypoxia, implying that the body s natural hypoxia response might protect against mitochondrial injury. The researchers then showed that both cells and embryonic zebrafish that lacked VHL exhibited greater survival in the face of respiratory chain inhibition. Treatment with a chemical that increases the expression of genes involved in the hypoxia response also reduced death from respiratory chain inhibition. The researchers next graduated to rodent studies, using an accurate genetic model of a specific mitochondrial disease. Mootha s team partnered with Warren M. Zapol, the HMS Reginald Jenney Professor of Anaesthesia at Mass General. The collaborative team focused on the Ndufs4-knockout mouse, an established model of Leigh syndrome, a neurodegenerative condition that is the most common pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. They first showed that this model could survive brief periods of hypoxia with a relatively normal metabolic response and then tested the effects of keeping the animals in an atmosphere containing 11 percent oxygen similar to high-altitude environments like the mountains of Nepal and Peru for extended periods of time. A control group of Ndufs4-knockout mice was placed in ambient air containing about 21 percent oxygen.  We reasoned that reducing the level of oxygen the mice breathed and delivered to their tissues might serve as nature s perfect solution for mitochondrial disease,  said lead author Isha Jain, a graduate student in the Mass General Department of Molecular Biology.  After all, humans have evolved elaborate responses to cope with energy metabolism at high altitudes and low oxygen levels.  The researchers were pleasantly surprised to discover that breathing 11 percent oxygen approximately half what is normally supplied at sea level dramatically reduced the development of typical disease symptoms, such as restricted growth and neurologic and movement abnormalities, and significantly extended survival in the Ndufs4-knockout mice. While knockout animals breathing air with 21 percent oxygen either died or had symptoms severe enough to require humane euthanasia by 60 days of age, all of those in the low-oxygen environment survived to at least 150 days, and some have survived up to 250 days. In contrast, although normal animals easily tolerated a 55 percent oxygen environment, Ndufs4-knockout mice placed in the same high-oxygen environment died within 2 to 11 days.  Many species of animals live at high altitudes around the world and adapt to low oxygen levels by activating specialized molecular systems,  said Zapol, who is a pioneer in the therapeutic use of gas mixtures.  While it might be expected that mice with a mitochondrial defect would have even more trouble generating ATP for cellular energy in a low-oxygen environment, we were surprised that they seemed healthy and didn t show signs of oxygen starvation,"" he said. ""It s remarkable that, with about half the normal level of oxygen circulating in their blood, they appeared to resist the brain pathology associated with this mitochondrial defect for several months.  Both Zapol and Mootha stress that much more research needs to be done before a hypoxia-based strategy can be tested in patients with mitochondrial disease.  All our work to date has been limited to cells and mice, which are not humans,  said Mootha.  Breathing hypoxic air can be dangerous and could reduce oxygen delivery to major organs as well as produce acute and chronic toxicities. Therefore, it s crucial to perform additional animal studies to determine optimal treatment regimens and long-term safety. Moreover, there are many types of mitochondrial disease, and we have only tested one. Testing additional mouse models will help us determine whether and when it will be feasible to contemplate human trials, Mootha said.","Published: March 1, 2016"

In this case, the invading force is a common cancer drug. In laboratory tests, leukemia cells that had become resistant to the drug absorbed it and died when the drug was hidden in a capsule made of folded up DNA. Previously, other research groups have used the same packaging technique, known as  DNA origami,  to foil drug resistance in solid tumors. This is the first time researchers have shown that the same technique works on drug-resistant leukemia cells. The researchers have since begun testing the capsule in mice, and hope to move on to human cancer trials within a few years. Their early results appear in the journal Small. The study involved a pre-clinical model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has developed resistance against the drug daunorubicin. Specifically, when molecules of daunorubicin enter an AML cell, the cell recognizes them and pumps them back out through openings in the cell wall. It s a mechanism of resistance that study co-author John Byrd of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center compared to sump pumps that draw water from a basement. He and Carlos Castro, assistant professor of mechanical engineering, lead a collaboration focused on hiding daunorubicin inside a kind of molecular Trojan horse that can bypass the pumps so they can t eject the drug from the cell.  Cancer cells have novel ways of resisting drugs, like these pumps, and the exciting part of packaging the drug this way is that we can circumvent those defenses so that the drug accumulates in the cancer cell and causes it to die,  said Byrd, a professor of internal medicine and director of the Division of Hematology.  Potentially, we can also tailor these structures to make them deliver drugs selectively to cancer cells and not to other parts of the body where they can cause side effects.   DNA origami nanostructures have a lot of potential for drug delivery, not just for making effective drug delivery vehicles, but enabling new ways to study drug delivery. For instance, we can vary the shape or mechanical stiffness of a structure very precisely and see how that affects entry into cells,  said Castro, director of the Laboratory for Nanoengineering and Biodesign.

Fluorescent markers show that the nanostructures have been taken deep into the cell, into the organelles that will digest them. Image by Matthew Webber, courtesy of The Ohio State University. In tests, the researchers found that AML cells, which had previously shown resistance to daunorubicin, effectively absorbed drug molecules when they were hidden inside tiny rod-shaped capsules made of DNA. Under the microscope, the researchers tracked the capsules inside the cells with fluorescent tags. Each capsule measures about 15 nanometers wide and 100 nanometers long about 100 times smaller than the cancer cells it s designed to infiltrate. With four hollow, open-ended interior compartments, it looks less like a pill a human would swallow and more like an elongated cinder block. Postdoctoral researcher Christopher Lucas said that the design maximizes the surface area available to carry the drug.  The way daunorubicin works is it tucks into the cancer cell s DNA and prevents it from replicating. So we designed a capsule structure that would have lots of accessible DNA base-pairs for it to tuck into. When the capsule breaks down, the drug molecules are freed to flood the cell.  Castro s team designed the capsules to be strong and stable, so that they wouldn t fully disintegrate and release the bulk of the drugs until it was too late for the cell to spit them back out. In this time-lapse image, drug-resistant leukemia cells glow with fluorescent markers as they absorb DNA nanostructures containing the drug daunorubicin. Within 15 hours after absorbing the nanostructures, the cells begin to disintegrate (starting with the one in the lower left). Image by Patrick Halley, courtesy of The Ohio State University. And that s what they saw with a fluorescence microscope the cells drew the capsules into the organelles that would normally digest them, if they were food. When the capsules broke down, the drugs flooded the cells and caused them to disintegrate. Most cells died within the first 15 hours after consuming the capsules. This work is the first effort for the engineers in Castro s lab to develop a medical application for the DNA origami structures they have been building. Though DNA is stereotypically called the  building blocks of life,  engineers today use natural and synthetic DNA as literal building blocks for mechanical devices. Previously, the Ohio State engineers created tiny hinges and pistons of DNA. As Castro pointed out, DNA is a polymer albeit a naturally occurring one and he and his colleagues shape it into tiny devices, tools or containers by exploiting the physical interactions of the bases that make up the polymer chain. They build chains from DNA sequences that will naturally attract and bind with one another in certain ways, so that long the long polymers automatically fold up, or  self-assemble,  into useful shapes. In the case of this DNA Trojan horse, the researchers used the genome of a common bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria, and synthetic strands that were designed to fold up the bacteriophage DNA. Although the folded-up shape performs a function, the DNA itself does not, explained Patrick Halley, an engineering graduate student who is doing this work to earn his master s degree.  One of the hardest things to get across when you re introducing this technology to people is that the DNA capsule doesn t do anything except hold a shape. It s just a static, rigid structure that carries things. It doesn t encode any proteins or do anything else that we normally think of DNA as doing,  Halley said. In keeping with the idea of DNA origami manufacturing, Castro said he hopes to create a streamlined and economically viable process for building the capsules and other shapes as well as part of a modular drug delivery system. Byrd said the technique should potentially work on most any form of drug-resistant cancer if further work shows it can be effectively translated to animal models, though he stopped short of suggesting that it would work against pathogens such as bacteria, where the mechanisms for drug resistance may be different. Other co-authors on the paper included Emily McWilliams, Matthew Webber, Randy Patton, Comert Kural and David Lucas. Funding for the research came from start-up funds provided to Castro by the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the National Cancer Institute, the D. Warren Brown Foundation, Four Winds Foundation and the Harry T. Mangurian Jr. Foundation.","Published: March 1, 2016"

The technique shows promise in prolonging the effectiveness of levo-dopa, the mainstay treatment for the progressive neurodegenerative condition, by increasing production of a key enzyme essential to convert the drug into the neurotransmitter dopamine. An estimated 7 to 10 million people worldwide have Parkinson s disease, which is caused by degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons, said Mark Richardson, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of neurological surgery, Pitt School of Medicine, and director of Epilepsy and Movement Disorders Surgery at UPMC. Levo-dopa can replace the deficient dopamine for a while, but eventually the drug loses effectiveness, and subsequent increases in dosage may cause disabling side effects. Less dopamine is made as the neurons degenerate, and one reason is that there is a decrease in an enzyme needed to turn levo-dopa into dopamine,  said Dr. Richardson, who is the principal investigator of the Pitt arm of the trial.  By inserting the gene for this enzyme into cells in a specific part of the brain, we hope to make levo-dopa treatment more effective for a longer period of time. In the gene therapy, a harmless virus called adeno-associated virus-2 is used to carry the gene that makes the enzyme   aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)   into neurons. Once in the neurons, cellular machinery kicks into gear to increase production of the AADC enzyme. To deliver the treatment, Dr. Richardson will make a small hole in each side of the patient s skull to insert a thin catheter into the putamen, a brain region that is an important part of the circuit affected by Parkinson s disease. After the gene therapy is infused over several hours, the catheter is withdrawn and the skull is repaired. Different infusion doses will be tested during the course of the study. Up to 20 participants at two sites, Pittsburgh and San Francisco, will be followed for up to three years to have their disease and medication status reassessed. The principal investigator of the trial, which is sponsored by Voyager Therapeutics, is Krystof Bankiewicz, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, who also led an earlier trial that showed the gene therapy can be safely administered. Individuals between 40 and 70 who have had Parkinson s disease for more than five years and have been taking levo-dopa for at least three years may be eligible to participate in the trial.","Published: March 1, 2016"

This image shows the disruption of the tumor cell due to treatment with nanoparticles and visible light. In a four-year study conducted on the mouse model in advanced breast cancer metastasis in the eye s anterior chamber, Dr. Petty and colleagues found that the new nanoparticle not only killed tumor cells in the eye, but also extended the survival of experimental mice bearing 4T1 tumors, a cell line that is extremely difficult to kill.  Previous monotherapies have not extended the lifetimes of mice bearing this type of tumor,  says Dr. Petty.  Our work has shown that we can extend survival of the mice.  The findings of the Kellogg team are detailed in a new paper titled WO3/Pt nanoparticles are NADPH oxidase biomimetics that mimic effector cells in vitro and in vivo published in Nanotechnology on February 19, 2016. Joining Dr. Petty as co-authors of the paper are research associate Andrea J. Clark, and undergraduates Emma L. Coury and Alexandra M. Meilhac.  This treatment offers many advantages,  says Dr. Petty.  The nanoparticle produces about 20 million toxins per hour in each cell. Also, the nanoparticle is activated by light, so it can be turned on and off simply by exposing it to the correct color of visible light.  This nanotechnology also has the potential to be used for multiple applications in ophthalmology and other disciplines.","Published: March 1, 2016"

He and a colleague Andrea Cau, a researcher from the University of Bologna, got permission from the museum to analyse the femur. They discovered that the bone was from a dinosaur called Abelisaur, which roamed the Earth around 95 million years ago during the late Cretaceous period. Abelisauridae were a group of predatory, carnivorous dinosaurs, characterised by extremely small forelimbs, a short deep face, small razor sharp teeth, and powerful muscular hind limbs. Scientists suspect they were also covered in fluffy feathers. The abelisaur in study would have lived in North Africa, which at that time was a lush savannah criss-crossed by rivers and mangrove swamps. This ancient tropical world would have provided the Abelisaur with an ideal habitat for hunting aquatic animals like turtles, crocodiles, large fish and other dinosaurs. By studying the bone, the team deduced that this abelisaur may have been nine metres long and weighed between one and two tonnes, making it potentially one of the largest abelisaurs ever found. This is helping researchers to determine the maximum sizes that these dinosaurs may have reached during their peak. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, co-author of the study from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial, said:  Smaller abelisaur fossils have been previously found by palaeontologists, but this find shows how truly huge these flesh eating predators had become. Their appearance may have looked a bit odd as they were probably covered in feathers with tiny, useless forelimbs, but make no mistake they were fearsome killers in their time.  The fossil originated from a sedimentary outcrop in Morocco called the Kem Kem Beds, which are well known for the unusual abundance of giant predatory dinosaur fossils. This phenomenon is called Stromer s Riddle, in honour the German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer, who first identified this abundance in 1912. Since then scientists have been asking how abelisaurs and five other groupings of predatory dinosaurs could have co-existed in this region at the same time, without hunting each other into extinction. Now the researchers in study suggest that these predatory dinosaur groups may not have co-existed so closely together. They believe that the harsh and changing geology of the region mixed the fossil fragment records together, destroying its chronological ordering in the Kem Kem beds, and giving the illusion that the abelisaurs and their predatory cousins shared the same terrain at the same time. Similar studies of fossil beds in nearby Tunisia, for example, show that creatures like abelisaurs were inland hunters, while other predators like the fish eating spinosaurs probably lived near mangroves and rivers. Chiarenza added:  This fossil find, along with the accumulated wealth of previous studies, is helping to solve the question of whether abelisaurs may have co-existed with a range of other predators in the same region. Rather than sharing the same environment, which the jumbled up fossil records may be leading us to believe, we think these creatures probably lived far away from one another in different types of environments.  Fossilised femora are useful for palaeontologists to study because they can determine the overall size of the dinosaur. This is because femora are attached to the thigh and tail muscles and have scars, or bumps, which tell palaeontologists where the ligaments and muscles were attached to the bone and how big those muscles and ligaments would have been. Andrea Cau, co-author from the University of Bologna, said:  While palaeontologists usually venture to remote and inaccessible locations, like the deserts of Mongolia or the Badlands of Montana, our study shows how museums still play an important role in preserving specimens of primary scientific value, in which sometimes the most unexpected surprises can be discovered. As Stephen Gould, an influential palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist, once said, sometimes the greatest discoveries are made in museum drawers.  The study is published in the journal Peer J. Chiarenza did the underpinning analysis with Cau while at the University of Bologna. The next step will see the team looking for more complete remains from these predatory dinosaurs trying to better understand their environment and evolutionary history.","Published: March 1, 2016"

Researchers in the Reseach Unit Neurobiology of Diabetes led by Dr. Paul Pfluger and at the Institute for Diabetes and Obesity led by Prof. Dr. Matthias Tsch p have now identified a new component in the complex fine-tuning of body weight and food intake. They found that the enzyme histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) has a significant influence on the effect of the hormone leptin. This hormone plays a crucial role in triggering satiety and thus on how the body adapts to a changing food environment. See Also: Obesity is associated with brain s neurotransmitters Leptin is secreted by fat tissue in direct correlation to body fat mass, thereby signaling to neurons in the brain that the fat stores are full. This leads to a negative energy balance whereupon the body reduces food intake, which ultimately leads to a reduction of body weight and fat storage. As a consequence, in the reduced fat stores less leptin is released, food intake is increased, and the fat stores and body weight are increased. Pfluger describes the results as follows: ""HDAC5 is an important link in the communication between our fat tissue and hunger centers in the brain."" Initial experiments have shown that the production and activity of HDAC5 in our control center for energy balance, the hypothalamus, is increased by a high-fat diet, by enlarged fat deposits and by the satiety hormone leptin. Dhiraj Kabra, first author of the study, added: ""HDAC5 is a molecular switch in the brain that helps the body to recognize how full the fat depots are. Without HDAC5, we cannot adapt our food intake or curb our fat deposition."" Specifically, the researchers showed that HDAC5 deacetylates the transcription factor STAT3, whereupon STAT3 can migrate to the leptin receptor. If STAT3 is phosphorylated (activated) there, it migrates back to the cell nucleus and binds to the DNA to activate gene and behavior programs that ultimately cause the reduction of food intake. If HDAC5 is absent (such as here after genetic deletion), STAT3 accumulates as hyper-acetylated and thus inactive protein in the cell nucleus. The leptin signaling pathway is thus switched off, subsequently suppressing the feeling of satiety. This study describes for the first time a direct interaction of the two molecules. Learn More: Obesity and diabetes symptoms in mice improved by reversing brain inflammation According to the scientists, mice unable to produce HDAC5 respond significantly worse to leptin, a condition referred to as leptin resistance. They show a continuously increased food intake and in comparison to mice with intact HDAC5 show increased obesity, i.e. they get fat. Through targeted activation of HDAC5 the team was able to reverse this effect, and thereby enabling obese animals to loose fat mass and body weight. ""The restoration of leptin sensitivity is an important step on the path towards sustainable weight loss and towards combating potential sequelae of obesity such as type 2 diabetes,"" said study leader Pfluger. ""In addition to the essential changes in diet and exercise behavior, in the future the individual components of the leptin effect could be potential drug targets to support the weight loss process."" One of these essential components HDAC5 has already been identified. ""However,"" Pfluger concluded, ""it remains to be seen in the coming years whether this enzyme will be a suitable target for combating obesity in humans.""

These results reveal a promising therapeutic strategy for treating neuropathic pain. Mice with an injury to their sciatic nerve showed less pain after multiple injections of a drug that blocks the activity of a molecule called high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1). Researchers also discovered that a single dose of a drug to block the activity of a different molecule, called matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), could also alleviate pain from the injury. See Also: New treatment for neuropathy? How cone snail venom minimizes pain The chemical pathways that these drugs use to inhibit HMGB1 or MMP-9 are different from common pain relievers, like opioids (morphine) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Therefore, the potential for addiction or negative side-effects may be reduced. The results reveal that the drug to block HMGB1, called anti-HMGB1, has the downstream effect of preventing the increase of MMP-9 that would normally be expected when HMGB1 increases. Therefore, an inhibitor of MMP-9 may be a more direct route to produce the same effect. This is the first study to link HMGB1 and MMP-9 together in the cellular process of maintaining pain. A research team led by Professor Yoshihiro Nakata, PhD, at Hiroshima University's Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences began their investigation of sciatic nerve pain as part of their long term studies of the central nervous system. Sciatic nerve pain, or sciatica, causes pain in the lower back, buttocks, or back of the leg and is often caused by a herniated disc in the spine or a pinched nerve. Similar pain can occur in different nerves in patients with cancer or diabetic neuropathy. Previous studies by other research groups have injected anti-HMGB1 underneath the protective membranes surrounding the nerve. This method, called an intrathecal injection, is more complicated for doctors to perform and has more potential risks. Learn More: Fish oil may help with diabetic neuropathy Prof. Nakata's team demonstrates a pain-relieving effect from injecting anti-HMGB1 into the hip in the slightly broader area around the nerve, called a perineural injection, avoiding the complications of other injection methods. A localized injection also avoids the potential side-effects of delivering the drug through larger body systems, like a pill into the digestive system or an injection into the blood. Blocking HMGB1 lessened pain with no negative impact on healing. Selectively blocking MMP-9 also relieved pain with no obvious changes to the activity of other molecules responding to the injury. The results of this Hiroshima University study show promise for relieving nerve pain with a chemically specific approach that is convenient for patients. Hiroshima UniversityZhang FF et al.

Much as the sci-fi film ""The Matrix"" depicted a device capable of enhancing skill acquisition, researchers at HRL Laboratories, LLC in Malibu, California have discovered that low-current electrical brain stimulation can modulate the learning of complex real-world skills. Dr. Matthew Phillips and his team of investigators from HRL's Information & System Sciences Laboratory used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in order to improve learning and skill retention. ""We measured the brain activity patterns of six commercial and military pilots, and then transmitted these patterns into novice subjects as they learned to pilot an airplane in a realistic flight simulator,"" he says. See Also: Neurostimulation: What is being said in the media and academic literature?

The Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) today released the results of a study highlighting molecular differences in cells that are gaining traction in the field of personalized medicine. The study, titled  Strong Components of Epigenetic Memory in Cultured Human Fibroblasts Related to Site of Origin and Donor Age,  was led by Andrew E. Jaffe, Ph.D., and its relevant findings published in PLOS Genetics. Significant investments are being made worldwide in precision medicine, concentrated in the curation of stem cell lines for the generation of new tissues and organs.  Specialists have primarily relied on skin samples as their source of cells because of the ability of these cells to grow in culture and the relative ease of acquisition and manipulation in the laboratory. As momentum and investment continue to build towards this revolution in personalized medicine, Dr. Jaffe and his team have discovered that both the location and age of cell samples from patients have important considerations when generating patient-specific stem cell lines.   The most popular cell types for generating patient-specific stem cells are skin-derived and therefore receive potentially the highest amount of environmental exposure. LIBD investigators compared fibroblast lines from dura mater of the postmortem brain to those from skin samples in the same individuals. While the cells appear identical under a microscope, this study identified widespread epigenetic and gene expression differences, suggesting strong epigenetic memory from the cell s original location in the body. In addition, researchers discovered sites that were significantly associated with the age of the donor. Dr. Jaffe noted,  These age-related changes are one of the first examples, to our knowledge, of significant age-related changes in a pure cell population that is many divisions from the original cells.    The results of this study show there are significant differences in the cells derived from dura vs skin samples across the lifespan. As the field of personalized medicine continues to grow, this evidence necessitates further exploration into the epigenetic patterns in stem cells used for new tissue and organ generation. Additional research is required to determine which cells to cultivate and when, as researchers question how much epigenetic memory is actually erased when creating stem cell models","Published: February 29, 2016"

It turns out that three different types of transmission histories are possible between two persons who might have infected each other,  said Thomas Leitner of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the corresponding author of a new paper out this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Using phylogenetic inference in the epidemiological investigations of HIV transmission, we ve determined that between two sampled, potentially epidemiologically linked persons, we can now evaluate the possibility that an unsampled intermediary or common source existed, even without a sample from that individual.  Like a detective inferring the existence of an unseen actor in a sequence of events, the Los Alamos team used computational phylogenetic analysis to examine how strains of HIV, both in computer modeling and compared with real-life case studies, would be transmitted. The team s research has broad implications.  The inference of donor-recipient relationships we describe here is not restricted to HIV transmissions; it applies to all situations when an original population seeds a new population with a restricted random draw (a bottleneck) of individuals. We use HIV transmission to illustrate the effects because it helps trace contacts among people and untangle investigations into outbreaks. Also, statistical guidelines are needed for interpreting phylogenetic results in court.  Phylogenetic inference of who infected whom has great value in epidemiological investigations, the authors point out, because it should explain how transmission(s) occurred. Until now, however, there has not been a systematic evaluation of which phylogeny to expect from different transmission histories, and thus interpreting the meaning of an observed phylogeny has remained elusive.  Previously it was thought that it would be impossible to say who infected whom and whether there were unsampled intermediary links in an alleged transmission, or if both persons were infected by an unsampled/unknown third party. We show that this is now possible in many cases,  Leitner said.  This will have large impact on future epidemiological investigations, including forensics and outbreak investigations."" In the paper, the team showed that certain types of phylogenies associate with different transmission histories, which may make it possible to exclude possible intermediary links or identify cases where a common source was likely but not sampled.  Our systematic classification and evaluation of expected topologies should make future interpretation of phylogenetic results in epidemiological investigations more objective and informative,  Leitner said.","Published: February 29, 2016"

The findings only detected P. gingivalis in 12 percent of tissues adjacent to the cancerous cells, while this organism was undetected in normal esophageal tissue.  These findings provide the first direct evidence that P. gingivalis infection could be a novel risk factor for ESCC, and may also serve as a prognostic biomarker for this type of cancer,  said Huizhi Wang, M.D., Ph.D.,  assistant professor of oral immunology and infectious diseases at the UofL School of Dentistry.  These data, if confirmed, indicate that eradication of a common oral pathogen may contribute to a reduction in the significant number of people suffering with ESCC.  The esophagus, a muscular tube critical to the movement of food from the mouth to the stomach, is lined with two main kinds of cells, thus there are two main types of esophageal cancer: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The latter is more common in developing countries. In collaboration with the College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology in Luoyang, China, Wang and his UofL colleagues Richard J. Lamont, Ph.D., Jan Potempa, Ph.D., D.Sc., and David A. Scott, Ph.D., tested tissue samples from 100 patients with ESCC and 30 normal controls. The research team measured the expression of lysine-gingipain, an enzyme unique to P. gingivalis, as well as the presence of the bacterial cell DNA within the esophageal tissues. Both the bacteria-distinguishing enzyme and its DNA were significantly higher in the cancerous tissue of ESCC patients than in surrounding tissue or normal control sites. The researchers also found the presence of P. gingivalis correlated with other factors, including cancer cell differentiation, metastasis and overall survival rate. According to Wang, there are two likely explanations: either ESCC cells are a preferred niche for P. gingivalis to thrive or the infection of P. gingivalis facilitates the development of esophageal cancer. If the former is true, Wang says simple antibiotics may prove useful or researchers can develop other therapeutic approaches for esophageal cancer utilizing genetic technology to target the P. gingivalis and ultimately destroy the cancer cells.  Should P. gingivalis prove to cause ESCC, the implications are enormous,  Wang said.  It would suggest that improving oral hygiene may reduce ESCC risk; screening for P. gingivalis in dental plaque may identify susceptible subjects; and using antibiotics or other anti-bacterial strategies may prevent ESCC progression.

Using this method, they found that only a small portion of synapses may be active at any given time. The study is published in Nature Neuroscience. See Also: Schizophrenia: Impaired activity of the selective dopamine neurons  Understanding how we accomplish complex tasks, such as learning and memory, requires us to look at how our brains transmit key signals across synapses from one neuron to another,  said David Sulzer, PhD, professor of neurobiology in Psychiatry, Neurology, and Pharmacology at Columbia University Medical Center.  Older techniques only revealed what was going on in large groups of synapses. We needed a way to observe the neurotransmitter activity of individual synapses, to help us better understand their intricate behavior.  To obtain a detailed view of synaptic activity, Sulzer s team collaborated with the laboratory of Dalibor Sames, PhD, associate professor of chemistry at Columbia, to develop a novel compound called fluorescent false neurotransmitter 200 (FFN200). When added to brain tissue or nerve cells from mice, FFN200 mimics the brain s natural neurotransmitters and allows researchers to spy on chemical messaging in action. The FFN200 fluorescent molecule tracking neurotransmission of dopamine in mouse synapses. Credit: Sulzer lab, Columbia University Medical Center  Using a fluorescence microscope, the researchers were able to view the release and reuptake of dopamine involved in motor learning, habit formation, and reward-seeking behavior in individual synapses. When all the neurons were electrically stimulated in a sample of brain tissue, the researchers expected all the synapses to release dopamine. Instead, they found that less than 20 percent of dopaminergic synapses were active following a pulse of electricity.  Why are there these large reservoirs of synapses that are silent?  said Dr. Sames, a co-author of the paper.  Perhaps these silent terminals hint at a mechanism of information coding in the brain that s yet to be revealed.  Learn More: Boost for dopamine packaging protects brain in Parkinson's model The study s authors plan to pursue this hypothesis in future experiments, as well as examine how other neurotransmitters behave.  This particular study didn t explain what s causing most of the synapses to remain silent,  said Dr. Sulzer.

However, a blitzkrieg approach can be unfeasible for some patients due to severe side effects. Now a powerhouse team of researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has revealed that an implantable device can deliver a particularly toxic cocktail of drugs directly to pancreatic tumors to stunt their growth or in some cases, shrink them   all while showing signs that the rest of the body would be spared toxic side effects.  We use the device to hit the primary tumor hard,  said UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center member Jen Jen Yeh, M.D., who is also an associate professor in the department of pharmacology and the UNC School of Medicine department of surgery.  It s an exciting approach because there is so little systemic toxicity that it leaves room to administer additional drugs against cancer cells that may have spread in the rest of the body.  The work, published Feb. 8 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights the cocktail FOLFIRINOX, a combination of four chemotherapy drugs that has been shown to shrink tumors or halt their growth in nearly a third of pancreatic cancer patients. It s one of today s first-line treatments for pancreatic cancer, but it is not suitable for all patients due to its degree of toxicity when delivered through the bloodstream. The new device, currently tested in mice, delivers the drugs directly to the tumor, providing a viable alternative to sending this toxic cocktail through the bloodstream, limiting harsh effects throughout the rest of the body. We are striving to get our device into clinical trials within the next several years,  said Joseph M. DeSimone, Chancellor s Eminent Professor of Chemistry in UNC s College of Arts and Sciences and William R. Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering at NC State University.  The prospect of halting tumor growth with our device, and potentially shrinking tumors, could help more patients qualify for surgery.  Surgically removing a tumor is currently the best chance of cure for patients with pancreatic cancer, but only 15 percent of patients have operable tumors. The findings are the latest for the researchers in the testing of the implantable device, which uses electric fields to drive the chemotherapy drugs directly into tumors. In a study published last year in Science Translational Medicine, the team showed, for the first time in animal models, that the device could be implanted on top of pancreatic tumors to increase the amount of the cancer drug gemcitabine reaching them. The tumors stopped growing and shrunk, providing more favorable conditions to remove the tumor and cure the disease. The discovery was hailed as a big advance for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, which has a 75 percent mortality rate within a year of diagnosis   a statistic that has not changed in more than 40 years. The latest study builds on last year s critical advance. Like the previous study, the device increased the amount of drug reaching the tumors, lowered drug concentration in the blood and significantly impacted tumor growth compared to intravenous delivery of the same drugs. But this time, the device was used with a more potent four-drug combination, making the treatment more effective while limiting unbearable side effects. The accumulation of drug in the tumor using the device was at least three times greater than when using IV administration.  The beauty of this device is that all of the drug delivery is focused locally, with low delivery to the rest of the body,  said James D. Byrne, Ph.D., the paper s first author and a current medical student at the UNC School of Medicine.  If this works in humans, we hope the device can be used as a plug-and-play approach to delivering the latest, most promising drug regimens for patients who have a dire need for new and better treatments.

This is according to a study conducted by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center and its Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (NKI), and recently published online in the journal Neuroscience. See Also: Prenatal alcohol exposure alters development of brain function When combined with the findings of past studies in humans, the current study in mice suggests a new treatment approach for individuals suffering from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which is linked to learning, memory and mood problems, and is estimated to affect 1 in 100 adults. According to the authors of the new study, exposure of a developing brain to binge levels of alcohol results in a permanent fragmentation in slow-wave sleep, with the extent of the fragmentation influencing the severity of related cognitive disorders. ""We have known for a long time that sleep fragmentation is associated with impaired cognitive function, attention and emotional regulation,"" says Donald Wilson, PhD, a professor in NYU Langone's Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Neuroscience and Physiology, and a member of the NKI. ""Our study shows for the first time that binge alcohol exposure early in life results in long-lasting slow-wave sleep fragmentation, which, in turn, is associated with learning problems."" ""It appears that some of the consequences of fetal alcohol syndrome stem from changes in the brain's ability to regulate sleep,"" he adds. Using a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome designed to estimate the third-trimester of pregnancy in humans, researchers examined slow-wave sleep in adult mice that were injected once with the equivalent of binge amounts of ethanol (drinking alcohol) seven days after they were born. Mice in a control group were injected with saline. Mouse brains continue to develop after birth, and seven days post birth in mice equates with third trimester brain development in a human fetus. Learn More: Research pinpoints devastating impacts of fetal alcohol syndrome Mice exposed to ethanol were found to spend less time in slow-wave sleep and experience severe sleep fragmentation, both with a significant link to memory impairment. The research team also found that the ethanol-exposed mice were hyperactive, but the mice from the control group were not. The ethanol-exposed mice also displayed reduced and fragmented slow-wave sleep and increased sleep/wake transitions over 24 hour periods. In addition, impaired contextual fear conditioning memory characterized by impairment in memory of events that occurred in specific contexts was seen in the ethanol-exposed mice, but not in the control group. The severity of this memory impairment was directly correlated with the extent of sleep fragmentation. ""Targeting therapeutic interventions toward sleep may help to relieve aspects of the diverse disorders linked to fetal alcohol exposure, and may open new avenues for treatment of this far too common condition,"" says Wilson.

See Also: Portable, Low-Cost Optical Imaging Tool Found to Be Useful in Concussion Evaluation ""All of the approved helmets evaluated in our study performed similarly,"" said Dawn Comstock, PhD, senior author of the study and associate professor of epidemiology at the Program for Injury Prevention, Education and Research (PIPER) at the Colorado School of Public Health. ""Increased cost does not necessarily translate to improved safety."" The study, the first national football concussion research evaluating how helmets performed when worn by young athletes playing the game rather than how helmets performed in laboratory impact testing, also found that older, reconditioned helmets performed similarly to new helmets as long as the reconditioning was done in a timely manner. The researchers examined high school football concussion and helmet data collected from 2008-2009 through 2012-2013 as part of the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance System, High School RIO (Reporting Information Online), directed by Comstock. They found that participating schools reported 2,900 football concussions per 3,528,790 `athletic exposures' (AE) or one athlete participating in one practice or competition. That came out to an overall rate of 8.2 concussions per 10,000 AEs. When comparing concussions sustained by athletes wearing different helmets, the researchers found the average number of concussion symptoms, symptom resolution time and time until the injured athlete was released to return to play were similar among football players wearing the most common make and model of helmet. Helmets that were not new but which had been reconditioned within the 12 months prior to use, performed similarly to new helmets. But players wearing old helmets which had not been recently reconditioned suffered longer concussion symptoms than those wearing new helmets. The data indicated that helmet rating scales may be somewhat misleading to parents or schools considering helmet purchases as higher ratings based on laboratory testing did not necessarily correlate to increased protection ""on the field"" for high school football players. ""We found helmets with high ratings performed similarly to helmets with lower ratings,"" Comstock said. ""At the same time, the most expensive helmet did not appear to provide significantly increased protection compared to less expensive helmets."" Learn More: Comprehensive concussion literature analysis lays foundation for evidence-based guidelines The study found that as long as the helmets had a NOCSAE or National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment seal, a National Federation of State High School Association requirement for high school football, they provided similar protection. Comstock said parents can play an active role in ensuring that the football helmets worn by their children are safe by asking how long it has been since a helmet issued to their child has been reconditioned. Parents should insist that their schools are following the reconditioning guidelines of manufacturers. ""Many parents don't think to ask if the helmet issued to their child is new or previously used or, if not new, when it was last reconditioned,"" Comstock said. ""Parents should be asking questions and not assuming that the helmet assigned to their child is safe."" The study was published online this week in the American Journal of Sports Medicine.

So, attempts to shut down the enzyme that causes the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease often mean side effects, because these therapies prevent the enzyme from carrying out many other functions. A study appearing in Cell Reports presents a new therapeutic strategy: blocking the most harmful behavior enzyme while allowing it to work normally otherwise. This potential approach now needs to be further developed and tested in pre-clinical trials. See Also: Mesh-like scaffold is disordered in Alzheimer's-affected cells In the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid precursor protein is broken apart, and the resulting fragments -amyloid peptides, or A  peptides aggregate to form plaques. A  peptides are produced by the action of two enzymes called beta- and gamma-secretases. Inhibiting either of these enzymes would block the production of toxic A  peptides; however, attempts to inhibit gamma-secretase caused problems in clinical trials because the enzyme also cleaves more than 20 other proteins important for normal physiology.  -secretase is now considered an alternative therapeutic target for AD, and a wide variety of inhibitors have been developed; however,  -secretase also cleaves several other proteins with normal functions in the body. In their latest research, Lawrence Rajendran, of the University of Zurich in Switzerland, and his colleagues discovered that, unlike non-amyloid proteins, the Alzheimer's-associated amyloid precursor protein is cleaved by  -secretase in membrane-bound compartments inside cells, called endosomes. Exploiting this compartmentalization, the team developed an endosomally-targeted  -secretase inhibitor that specifically blocked cleavage of amyloid precursor protein but not non-amyloid proteins. This is the first time such specificity has been achieved, and it thus provides a potentially promising way to treat AD without causing major side effects.

Intense exercise increases levels of two common neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA. Published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the finding offers new insights into brain metabolism and why exercise could become an important part of treating depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders linked with deficiencies in neurotransmitters, which drive communications between the brain cells that regulate physical and emotional health. See Also: Can physical exercise enhance long-term memory? ""Major depressive disorder is often characterized by depleted glutamate and GABA, which return to normal when mental health is restored,"" said study lead author Richard Maddock, professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. ""Our study shows that exercise activates the metabolic pathway that replenishes these neurotransmitters."" The research also helps solve a persistent question about the brain, an energy-intensive organ that consumes a lot of fuel in the form of glucose and other carbohydrates during exercise. What does it do with that extra fuel? ""From a metabolic standpoint, vigorous exercise is the most demanding activity the brain encounters, much more intense than calculus or chess, but nobody knows what happens with all that energy,"" Maddock said. ""Apparently, one of the things it's doing is making more neurotransmitters."" The striking change in how the brain uses fuel during exercise has largely been overlooked in brain health research. While the new findings account for a small part of the brain's energy consumption during exercise, they are an important step toward understanding the complexity of brain metabolism. The research also hints at the negative impact sedentary lifestyles might have on brain function, along with the role the brain might play in athletic endurance. ""It is not clear what causes people to 'hit the wall' or get suddenly fatigued when exercising,"" Maddock said. ""We often think of this point in terms of muscles being depleted of oxygen and energy molecules. But part of it may be that the brain has reached its limit."" To understand how exercise affects the brain, the team studied 38 healthy volunteers. Participants exercised on a stationary bicycle, reaching around 85 percent of their predicted maximum heart rate. To measure glutamate and GABA, the researchers conducted a series of imaging studies using a powerful 3-tesla MRI to detect nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, which can identify several compounds based on the magnetic behavior of hydrogen atoms in molecules. The researchers measured GABA and glutamate levels in two different parts of the brain immediately before and after three vigorous exercise sessions lasting between eight and 20 minutes, and made similar measurements for a control group that did not exercise. Glutamate or GABA levels increased in the participants who exercised, but not among the non-exercisers. Significant increases were found in the visual cortex, which processes visual information, and the anterior cingulate cortex, which helps regulate heart rate, some cognitive functions and emotion. While these gains trailed off over time, there was some evidence of longer-lasting effects. Learn More: Genetic pre-disposition toward exercise, mental development may be linked ""There was a correlation between the resting levels of glutamate in the brain and how much people exercised during the preceding week,"" Maddock said. ""It's preliminary information, but it's very encouraging."" These findings point to the possibility that exercise could be used as an alternative therapy for depression. This could be especially important for patients under age 25, who sometimes have more side effects from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-depressant medications that adjust neurotransmitter levels. For follow-up studies, Maddock and the team hope to test whether a less-intense activity, such as walking, offers similar brain benefits. They would also like to use their exercise-plus-imaging method on a study of patients with depression to determine the types of exercise that offer the greatest benefit. ""We are offering another view on why regular physical activity may be important to prevent or treat depression,"" Maddock said. ""Not every depressed person who exercises will improve, but many will. It's possible that we can help identify the patients who would most benefit from an exercise prescription.""

They discovered that the establishment of white matter in the brain, which is the insulation of the brain nerve fibers, (i.e. axons) is altered from toddler to adult periods of development. This finding was unexpected given the current theory that many changes leading to intellectual disability occur prenatally in DS. They also showed that the white matter changes in the brain are due to specific developmental defects in oligodendrocytes that form the white matter of the brain, and that this causes slower nerve transmission.

A new study suggests that brains also have different traits that affect both anatomical and cognitive factors, such as intelligence and memory. The results are published in the journal NeuroImage.

""We also were able to look at cognitive variables like executive function and working memory all at once."" Using a statistical technique called independent component analysis, the researchers grouped measures that were related to each other into four unique traits. Together, these four traits explained most of the differences in the anatomy of individuals' brains. The traits were mostly driven by differences in brain biology, including brain size and shape, as well as the individual's age. The factors failed to explain differences in cognitive abilities between people. The researchers then examined the brain differences that were unexplained by the four traits.

I ve had the implant for 15 years now and it has done so much for me.

I can now use a phone, I recognize people s voices, I go to films, but music is awful.  See Also: Researchers use DNA therapy in lab mice to improve cochlear implant functionality Cochlear implants are designed to process speech, which is a much simpler auditory signal compared with music. People with severe hearing loss also have lost auditory neurons that transmit signals to the brain. It s not possible to tweak the settings of the implant to compensate for the loss of auditory neurons, says Anil Lalwani, MD, director of the Columbia Cochlear Implant Program.  It s unrealistic to expect people with that kind of nerve loss to process the complexity of a symphony, even with an implant.

After just two intravenous doses in eight weeks of tocilizumab, an immune-suppressing drug regularly prescribed for rheumatoid and juvenile arthritis, study participants had significantly improved cognitive ability, said Dr. Brian J. Miller, a psychiatrist at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. See Also: New biological evidence reveals link between brain inflammation and major depression ""This adds to the growing evidence that inflammation plays a role in patients with schizophrenia and again suggests that targeting inflammation may be a viable therapeutic target, at least for cognitive impairment, which is a huge area of unmet need,"" Miller said. Cognitive problems typically are a major source of dysfunction and disability in these patients and can be among the earliest symptoms of schizophrenia, said Miller, corresponding author of the report in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of patients may have inflammation in the brain contributing to that dysfunction. Problems range from having trouble remembering important numbers to impairment of executive function that enables them to analyze, organize, and generally manage their lives. Tocilizumab targets the receptor for IL-6, a protein which helps regulate inflammation that is often elevated in patients with schizophrenia. Higher IL-6 levels also have been correlated with a smaller hippocampus, a center for learning and memory in the brain, as well as experiencing more psychiatric symptoms. The five study patients did not experience improvement in overall levels of psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, more classic symptoms of schizophrenia, which were already well-controlled with antipsychotics, Miller said. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, have been tried in these patients, but tend to be less potent and have multiple mechanisms of action, Miller said. ""If we see improvements with this drug, then we know it's not due to other effects."" Learn More: Inflammation attacks brain's reward center Increasing evidence of inflammation's role in schizophrenia, means that Miller already routinely tests his patients' blood level of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation and IL-6 levels, and he may try a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs in addition to an antipsychotic. While he did not pretest in these study patients, Miller later learned that while all appeared to benefit from the targeted anti-inflammatory therapy, only half had elevated C-reactive protein level. That finding is another reason a larger, double-blind study is needed, he said. While given intravenously for the study, a newer injectable version of tocilizumab also is now available, Miller said. Drugs that directly target IL-6, rather than its receptor, are now available as well and Miller recently received a grant from the nonprofit Stanley Medical Research Institute to examine the effectiveness of one of these drugs, siltuximab, in patients with blood evidence of inflammation. Since he already sees most of his patients monthly, giving these types of drugs should not be much of an additional burden for them.

In fact, its global trade estimates at about $600 billion. And, with the proliferation of the Internet, this problem can plague almost the whole world. No, it s not the arms race. Rather, it s the trade of pharmaceutical drug counterfeiting that puts millions of patients around the globe at a significant, and sometimes fatal, risk.  It has, unfortunately, grown by leaps and bounds since it was first addressed in the 1995 WHO Conference of Experts on Rational Drug Use at Nairobi, Kenya. The drug counterfeiting market has been fuelled by growing engagement of inadequately regulated wholesalers and re-packagers in the supply chain, the rise of Internet pharmacies that provide cheap and unauthorized medicines, and easy availability of advanced technology to manufacture spurious drugs.  International Institute for Research Against Counterfeit Medicines (IRACM) states that of 331,430 websites monitored by Legitscript, a mind-boggling 94.3% are selling pharmaceuticals illegally. This loosely translates to the fact that anyone, with access to the Internet, can potentially be exposed to counterfeit drugs through  fake online pharmacies.  Hence, the pharmaceutical supply chain is constantly leveraging evolving methods, approaches and technologies to counter the shifting target. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to have spent about $3.4 billion this year on anti-counterfeiting technologies to intensify its battle. Here s how the battle is being drawn up, with prevalent technologies making way for newer, better and more effective solutions. Edible smart tags are one such solutions. Mind the Gap To combat the flooding of counterfeit drugs onto the global market, most of the pharmaceutical drugs are using secured RFID tags on their packaging. The technology enables the pharmacies and wholesalers to track medicines from manufacturers to retailers by verifying the electronic product code, EPC, on their packaging. However, this technology has been vulnerable to replication, with counterfeiters invading the supply chain with easy access to digital printing and packaging duplication equipment. Although barcodes, QR codes and 2D barcodes over packaging do integrate the new  track and trace  requirements, they do not guarantee product legitimacy.  To overcome the gaps of the packaging-level RFID tag technology, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are in search of infallible solutions. On-dose authentication technology sounds promising enough.  Right on Dot  Edible smart tag technology is the industry s newest weapon  to combat counterfeits that promises to bridge potential gaps left by the prevalent RFID technologies,  states S. Kannan, executive director, Aranca.   One of the potential forms of the relatively  new on-dose authentication involves achieving product security by incorporation of edible microtags of the size of dust ( 50 to 100 micrometers), making them virtually invisible to the human eyes. These low-cost micro-tags are etched with a custom-manufactured spectral pattern chosen from a library of over a billion possible combinations.  The spectral pattern on each tag can be read by a portable spectrometer-based optical reader. It can be linked to a secure database where additional information about the item including lot number, expiration date, manufacture date, authorized customer, or country of authorized sale is stored. This is remarkably similar to referencing a future e-pedigree or track-and-trace system. The manufacturing of such edible microtags is simple and cost-effective. The tags comprise of safe and inert material such as silicon wafer that is imprinted with an optically-readable code by a process called etching. The wafer is then divided into smaller micro-sized tags that contain a nanoporous structure, which is programmed during electrochemical synthesis to exhibit a unique reflectivity spectrum.  The crystalline nanoporous silicon tags further undergo high-temperature oxidation for its conversion to amorphous, nanoporous silica tags. This high-temperature bake step stabilizes the unique spectral signature by preventing further oxidation of nanoporous structure and enhances the safety of silicon with its conversion into silica   Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) excipient. Micro Tags. Major Advantages The low-cost microtags-based on-dose authentication, currently under the pilot stage, offers numerous advantages. The use of silica and similar materials for manufacturing microtags makes them completely inert and biocompatible for incorporation into solid and liquid dosage forms.  Moreover, the incorporation of microtags does not require any additional manufacturing equipment as it merely involves embedding it on the surface or mixing it with the other excipients during the manufacturing process. Since both medicine and its appearance have a combined authentication, tampering with either would raise a security flag. The security features of microtags are not replicable and it is difficult for counterfeiters to intrude a product supply chain easily.  The potential of on-dose authentication has drawn the attention of companies providing product authentication technology to several industries.   Several such advantages thus expand the gambit of the application areas to other industries as well including food, cosmetics, and luxury goods where protection of brand value and revenue is of utmost importance,  substantiates Prakash Kailasam, practice lead, technology & patent research, Aranca. Active Collaboration Interestingly, the technology remains niche with moderate patent filing in the last decade. Overall, close to 400 unique inventions were patented with the United States being the major contributor. Some of the notable technology providers include TruTag Technologies, NanoInk, ARmark Technologies, Authentiform Technologies, InkSure Technologies, CertiRx Corporation, and Sicpa Holding.  The domain is witnessing active collaboration, acquisitions and licensing deals. InkSure Technologies, a covert security solution provider, acquired AuthentiForm's patent portfolio on technology surrounding tamper-proof signatures incorporated in formulations. NanoGuardian s nanoscale capsule markers were licensed by Capsugel (a Pfizer division).  Similarly, ARmark Technologies and Colorcon formed an alliance that gives the latter exclusive rights to market ARmark s on-dose authentication technology to the global pharmaceutical companies. WuXi PharmaTech invested in TruTag Technologies  silica-based product security wherein the latter would provide its customer with TruTag s technology to beat the counterfeit.  Well Begun is Half Done The edible microtags do address the majority of the problems associated with conventional counterfeit prevention methods. However, before adoption of on-dose authentication technology, there is a need to understand manufacturing as well as regulatory requirements.  The guidance released by FDA regarding the incorporation of Physical Chemical Identifiers (PCIDs) in solid oral dosage forms in 2011 reflects optimism for the early and widespread adoption of the technology. FDA s guidance states that only well-studied excipients that are GRAS or those listed in the FDA s list of inactive ingredients guide can be used in minimal quantities. Moreover, FDA has cleared its stance on use of the technology in already approved drugs by stating that addition of microtags to these products would not require a re-approval.  However, from the manufacturer s perspective, it is important to understand whether addition of edible microtags would have an impact on the efficacy of the drug product. Furthermore, from an investment standpoint, companies would be curious to determine ROI as well as the sustainability of such a solution. With the technology showing early success, it is certain that microtag-based on-dose authentication technology would be on-board on wide range of products in near future. Hopefully, we would then be en route to a new world of the pharmaceutical products specifically the solid dosage forms that would carry a microtag, which promises to change the landscape of anti-counterfeiting forever.","Published: February 26, 2016"

Now it is time to commercialize, but have you considered the question:  Is my process scalable?  Once the biology of the product has been established, the production process is typically  thrown over the wall  for manufacturing engineers to retrofit scale without any previous input. This disconnected approach is ill-advised, as it is much more efficient to work across multiple disciplines to develop a process from day one with scalability in mind. Cell therapy manufacture: Scale-up vs scale-out  Broadly speaking, there are two paradigms in cell therapy manufacture; off-the-shelf (always allogeneic) and patient-specific (commonly autologous) therapies. Off-the-shelf therapies represent a business model akin to current biopharmaceuticals, where one batch can be manufactured to treat multiple patients. This allows for increasing economies of scale, which drives down the per-dose cost of the final product. A good example of this is the manufacture of antibiotics, which can be produced in batches greater than 100,000 liters, treating many patients at relatively low cost. This means that there is a wealth of engineering knowledge and technology that can be leveraged to support the manufacture of off-the-shelf cell therapies at increasing scale, given a rigorous understanding of the product quality profile .  Patient-specific cell therapies offer a new and exciting challenge for process scalability, where the manufacturing process must be scaled out, in order to produce one batch for each patient. This introduces the concept of  personalized medicine,  where the cost of production per batch cannot be reduced by exploiting an increasing economy of scale by simply producing a larger batch. Reducing the cost of these patient-specific cell therapies must therefore be achieved by advances in engineering and manufacturing technology, reducing the number of complex, labor-intensive and open-process steps that are commonplace in cell therapy production. Given the impressive efficacy profile of a number of patient-specific cell therapies currently in clinical development, it is imperative that these processes can be transferred into a commercial manufacturing setting in a scalable and cost-effective manner so that they present a reasonable value proposition for their developers, increasing the likelihood that the therapies will have a transformative impact for patients. Challenges in developing scale-up manufacturing processes  Scale-up is about more than just making the pot bigger!   Christopher Hewitt, Aston University, UK Conventional scale-up bioprocesses typically use cells to produce therapeutic agents, which can then be isolated and purified without the need to recover the cell. For the manufacture of cell therapies, retention of cell function and quality is of primary importance in order to preserve product efficacy, as the cell is the product of interest. This means that the desired quality profile of the cell must be maintained through the entire manufacturing process, including the harvest, downstream processing, and delivery. Preservation of cellular quality throughout the entire manufacturing process is critical to off-the-shelf cell therapies and will require the development of scalable harvesting, and downstream and formulation technologies to cope with the large batch size produced.  Challenges in developing scale-out manufacturing processes The unique challenge of scaling-out patient-specific cell therapy manufacturing processes is achieving a reduction in the cost per dose, given that there are currently few economies of scale to exploit. Therefore, minimizing the cost of idle capacity will be critical when ramping up towards commercial production. The construction and validation of additional manufacturing capacity must be carefully managed and aligned with projected patient accrual or product sales, to avoid incurring a high cost per dose caused by the large overhead cost of these idle facilities. That said, there are strategies that can be implemented within the labor-intensive scale-out manufacturing model, such as closed systems, automation and process simplification, to control the cost per dose and ensure scalability towards commercial production.  Looking to the future What can you do to ensure scalability in your cell-based therapy manufacturing process? The key is to start as early in the product development cycle as possible and understand how scalability can be achieved for your particular process, be it off-the-shelf or patient-specific, and minimize the cost per dose as the production rate increases. This includes rigorous characterization of bioreactor platforms for off-the-shelf therapies at the small scale, so that comparability of the physical environment can be maintained based on sound engineering parameters as the scale increases throughout development. In addition, you should work closely with your manufacturing partners to leverage their knowledge and expertise to ensure that your process, including supply chain and logistics, is scalable and therefore will be commercially viable for the future. The timing, cost and comparability risk of modifying process steps during clinical development should be carefully managed and balanced against increasing cost advantages, to ensure the future sustainability of the cell therapy product.

Two of these drugs, in a category known as PCSK9 inhibitors, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration last summer for use by some individuals with extremely high cholesterol levels.  If you take the core patients who are at highest risk, it makes you appreciate how important this drug class is,  said Dr. Amit Khera, Director of the Preventive Cardiology Program and Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. Frank Brown of Dallas, grandfather of six and the owner of Frank s Wrecker Service in Dallas, has familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition that causes high levels of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or  bad cholesterol.  High levels of LDL cholesterol are strongly associated with heart disease. Mr. Brown, with a history of two heart attacks, had been aggressively treated with multiple drugs to reduce his cholesterol levels, but they remained stubbornly high. When I first met Mr. Brown, he had a strong family history of heart disease, he had a cholesterol level that was ridiculously high with an LDL of 384, and he was having chest pains,  said Dr. Amit Khera, who is Mr. Brown s cardiologist. Dr. Khera, who holds the Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Hypertension and Heart Disease at UT Southwestern, was treating Mr. Brown with three cholesterol-lowering medications: a statin, which is a class of drugs that works by blocking a substance the body needs to make cholesterol; ezetimibe, a drug that blocks absorption of cholesterol in the intestine; and colesevelam, which sequesters bile acids. Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200. The two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the FDA last year were developed as a result of research done by UT Southwestern geneticists Dr. Helen Hobbs and Dr. Jonathan Cohen. Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a population-based study that gathered extensive medical data on 6,000 Dallas residents, the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein PCSK9 lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood. Further, Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen found a woman who had inherited not one, but two of these mutations in the PCSK9 gene   one mutation from each parent. This woman had stunningly low levels of LDL cholesterol. While anything below 100 is considered good, her LDL cholesterol level was just 14. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe. Their research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab, the two approved PCSK9 inhibitors, which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections. Dr. Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research. Dr. Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and with the McDermott Center, holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research. Mr. Brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new PCSK9 inhibitors and, when the drugs were approved, Dr. Khera began working to get Mr. Brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen. In the world of cholesterol patients, most are well-controlled with statins, and they should stay on those,  said Dr. Khera.  But Mr. Brown is the perfect patient for PCSK9 inhibitors. We knew he could tolerate it because he d been in a clinical trial, he knew how to administer the injections, and he was very high-risk. We d exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol.  Two months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug, Mr. Brown s LDL cholesterol level was down to 111   not quite normal, which is 100 or less   but an almost 50 percent reduction from the level it had been for years. It s a good sign for Mr. Brown, who looks forward to many more years of running his business, watching Dallas Cowboys games, and spending time with his grandchildren.  There are many more Frank Browns out there   patients who can t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,  said Dr. Khera.  It s wonderful to have this option to offer this special set of patients. ","Published: February 26, 2016"

This immune response occurred in all treated individuals within just 2 weeks after a single vaccination. No side-effects were observed. The trial also showed that concomitant standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine) does not impair the immune response in a relevant way. This finding shows that treatment with TYG100 can be initiated in parallel to chemotherapy. Since pancreatic cancer is an extremely aggressive disease where the average time from diagnosis to death is measured in months, not years, an immunotherapy that can be initiated together with, not after, chemotherapy, and that elicits the desired immune response very fast, would fundamentally improve the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients. In this trial, again a clear correlation between dose and immune response was observed. The trial thereby extends what has already been established in other trials that OncoQR ML conducted in different indications with vaccines based on the same S-TIR  technology platform technology as TYG100: the completely controllable modification of the patient's immune system by suspension of the relevant checkpoint control.  We are extremely excited about the characteristics that TYG100 has shown in this trial in a pancreatic cancer model , commented Dr. Geert C. Mudde, CSO of OncoQR ML.  For an immunotherapy to provide maximum clinical value in an aggressive disease such as pancreatic cancer, the immune response must be really strong and be achieved really fast. And it is critical that the suspension of checkpoint control - which allows the immune system to mount a powerful attack against tumor cells as it does not consider them as 'own' cells - is reversible. The data from our recent trials suggest that TYG100 has just these characteristics.   The results from this trial with TYG100 show that this therapy has the potential to bring a huge benefit to patients suffering from a fast-killing disease , commented Christof Langer, MBA, CEO of OncoQR ML.  With all the necessary in-vivo tests concluded and Orphan Drug Designation for TYG100 granted by the FDA, we are now seeking strong partners for the fast track clinical development of this exciting oncology product , Langer concluded. Why Does OncoQR Consider the Immune Response Induced by TYG100 Clinically Relevant? TYG100 is designed to elicit an immune response against gastrin (G17). This target was selected because it was well established in clinical phase III trials with an inferior predecessor vaccine G17DT, that an appropriate immune response against G17 significantly prolongs survival by several months. While this survival benefit compares very favorably against current standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine), in said clinical trials the required immune response was only achieved after several vaccinations and only in a statistically too small subset of patients. The correlation between immune response against G17 and survival benefit was appreciated by drug authorities, but the overall immunogenicity was deemed not sufficient for market approval. By contrast, TYG100 could consistently elicit a clinically relevant immune response which is several orders of magnitude stronger than even in the most favorable cases in the clinical trials in pancreatic cancer mentioned. In contrast to G17DT, TYG100 was confirmed to be immunogenic in all individuals tested just 2 weeks after a single vaccination and did not show any side effects. The data from the study of TYG100 thus showed that OncoQR ML's experimental immunotherapy does elicit a strong and completely controllable immune response against pancreatic cancer in all individuals vaccinated, very fast, and even under concomitant chemotherapy. Clinical development of TYG100 is coordinated by TYG oncology Ltd.","Published: February 26, 2016"

It was domesticated in America thousands of years ago, and together with corn and cassava, have been staples world-wide. According to studies by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), common bean is the most important food pulses, representing 50% of the legume grains consumed in the world, paramount in the diet of more than 500 million people. This crop is produced in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Europe, USA and Canada. The United Nations has designated 2016 as the International Year of pulses to heighten public awareness of the nutritional benefits of pulses as part of sustainable food production aimed towards food security and nutrition. Today an Ibero-American team of scientists, from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Spain at the initiative of the Ibero-American Programme for Science and Technology for Development (CYTED), has deciphered the genome of the Mesoamerican common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The findings are reported in the current issue of the journal Genome Biology. The project has been co-lead by Alfredo Herrera-Estrella from the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity, Irapuato, Mexico, Roderic Guig , programme coordinator at the Centre for Genomic Regulation and lecturer at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and Toni Gabald n, ICREA research professor and group leader at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, The genome contains the hereditary information present in the cells of living organisms and determines their biological characteristics. The systematic investigation of the genome of plants will help improving both traditional and biotechnological approaches to agriculture. It will also contribute to improve crops for key features such as resistance to drought or nutritional quality of edible seeds, and expands the possibilities of using crops not only as food but also in industry. The PhasibeAm team selected a specific MesoAmerican bean line for genomic sequencing (BAT93), given its relevance for the generation of varieties that are currently used commercially. The team established a robust technological platform that culminated with the sequencing and the assembly of the 620 milion base pairs, which would be equivalent to the ""letters"" of the genome. A total of 30,491 genes were identified in the genome and scientists also analyzed their expression patterns, meaning that they studied ""when"" and ""where"" are these genes functional. In addition, they also observed and determined crucial events during evolution that have shaped the bean plant as we know it today. ""The sequence of the bean genome, both from the Andean variety, previously sequenced, and the Mesoamerican one, will definitively contribute to identify genes involved in disease resistance, drought and salt tolerance, nitrogen fixation, formation of reproductive cells and seed quality, among others,"" states Roderic Guig , coordinator of the Bioinformatics and Genomics programme at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain. In a second phase of the project, the genome of at least a dozen other varieties of beans and some of their close relatives will be sequenced. This will allow the identification of genes related to domestication. ""This is an example on how bioinformatics and genome sequencing will thus contribute to produce higher quality and more productive varieties of a crop that has become essential for human consumption"", adds Alfredo Herrera-Estrella, head of the Fungal Development and Gene Expression group at the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico. The PhasIbeAm project, which aimed to sequence the common MesoAmerican bean was launched in 2009 by the Iberoamerican Program of Science and Technology for Development (Programa Iberoamericano de Ciencia y Tecnolog a para el Desarrollo, CYTED), with the main purpose of boosting breeding programs of the species to lead to more productive varieties of the bean and to a more rational conservation of the MesoAmerican gene pool of this species. The total budget of the project was US $ 2.482.000 funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation (MINCyT) of Argentina, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) of Brazil, the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) of Spain, the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) of Mexico, and the Ibero-American Programme of Science and Technology for Development (CYTED).","Published: February 26, 2016"

The technique builds upon the newest version of the Nobel Prize-winning technology from 2007, which allowed researchers to turn skin cells into embryonic-like stem cells. Researchers hailed the possibilities for use in regenerative medicine and drug screening. Now, researchers have found a new use: killing brain cancer.  Patients desperately need a better standard of care,  said Shawn Hingtgen, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy and member of the Lineberger Comprehensive Care Center, who led the study. The survival rate beyond two years for a patient with a glioblastoma is 30 percent because it is so difficult to treat.

CAR T is widely recognized as a breakthrough technology with the potential to become a curative option for certain malignancies. Most CAR T cell therapy technologies isolate cells from cancer patients  blood and re-engineer them to specifically target receptors on tumor cells. The reprogrammed cells are multiplied in a laboratory and then returned to the patient to target the tumor. This approach has had initial success in clinical trials for certain tumor types, but persistent scaling challenges remain based on the highly personalized nature of the therapy. Precision BioSciences  proprietary ARCUS genome editing technology enables the production of CAR T cells derived from healthy donors rather than relying on the patient. This approach aims to overcome the manufacturing-related limitations with existing CAR T therapies and enable a broader range of malignancies to be targeted.  Collaborating with Precision BioSciences enables Baxalta to accelerate innovation in immuno-oncology with a next-generation, donor-derived CAR T strategy using a proprietary combination of genome editing expertise and technology,  said David Meek, executive vice president and president, Oncology, Baxalta.  Combining Precision BioSciences  ARCUS technology with Baxalta s global infrastructure, expertise and growing immuno-oncology portfolio is a synergistic approach that we believe has the potential to make disruptive approaches available to people with a range of underserved cancers.   Baxalta is an ideal partner in CAR T for Precision and our ARCUS genome editing platform because of their global reach, collaborative business model, and long-term commitment to succeeding in immuno-oncology,"" said Matthew Kane, CEO of Precision BioSciences.  We look forward to working closely with the team at Baxalta to develop novel CAR T therapeutics that could transform the treatment of cancer.  Under the terms of the agreement, Baxalta and Precision BioSciences will develop CAR T therapies for up to six unique targets, with the first program expected to enter clinical studies in late 2017. Precision BioSciences will be responsible for performing early-stage research activities up to Phase 2, following which Baxalta has the exclusive right to opt in for late-stage development and commercialization. Precision BioSciences will receive an upfront payment of $105 million fromBaxalta, with additional option fees, developmental, clinical, regulatory, and sales milestones, potentially totaling up to$1.6 billion, in addition to royalties on worldwide sales. Precision also has the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States. Additional terms and initial targets were not disclosed. The agreement follows another recently established Baxalta collaboration to advance novel therapeutics against checkpoint targets, advancing the company s strategic commitment to investing in immuno-oncology and building an innovative portfolio of cancer immunotherapies.","Published: February 26, 2016"

But these emerging tools raise important questions: might there be unintended, even irreversible risks to the resulting child--or even that child's future descendants? Are there potential risks to the mother's health? What about other potential consequences if its use is broadened to include indications beyond strict disease prevention, such as adapting the tools into conception aids for older women? The tools in question, mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRTs), aim to prevent mother-to-child transmission of mitochondrial DNA disease --a complex set of rare disorders caused by defective DNA within the mitochondria, the tiny energy-producing structures existing outside the nucleus of cells. Such disease may present at any age or level of severity, attacking a combination of organs and systems, often fatally. There are no current cures or approved therapies for any of these disorders, which clinicians manage by treating the diverse symptoms that may progressively affect each patient. Earlier this month, an expert panel of national experts formed by the Institute of Medicine at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that research into MRTs should proceed under carefully proscribed guidelines. Three members of that panel co-authored a Perspective article in today's New England Journal of Medicine on MRT's implications for clinicians. The article begins, ""Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disease may be the poster child for highly targeted, 'personalized' medicine."" ""Even though MRTs would not confer health benefits on patients who already have mitochondrial DNA diseases, many patients with a known risk for transmitting such a disease to their offspring are highly motivated to prevent that from occurring,"" said Marni J. Falk, M.D., director of the Mitochondrial-Genetics Clinic at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and first author of the article. ""That motivation is clear when we counsel patients and families affected by mtDNA disease, and recent patient surveys have reinforced that preventing disease transmission is a prevailing concern in this population."" Falk's co-authors are Jeffrey Kahn, Ph.D., M.P.H., of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, and Alan Decherney, M.D., an obstetrician-gynecologist and reproductive endocrinologist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Kahn chaired the Institute of Medicine expert panel. Because the expert panel stated that the child's safety was paramount, it recommended that MRTs should initially be studied only in male embryos, since males do not transmit mitochondrial DNA to their children. The panel further argued that the FDA should make clear policy and that professional societies should issue practice recommendations to limit future MRT usage to appropriate patients. The authors repeat the panel's stipulation that children conceived after MRT should be monitored long-term, ""probably well into adulthood,"" much longer than is done after in vitro fertilization with pre-implantation diagnosis for diseases based in nuclear DNA. Finally, because MRTs require mixing mitochondrial DNA from a female donor with DNA from the nucleus of the mother and father, the authors note that researchers should investigate unanticipated health problems and possibly questions about identity, before regulatory approval or clinical use can occur for the techniques.","Published: February 26, 2016"

The antibody can now advance to testing in humans as a potential treatment for Ebola virus disease. There are currently no licensed treatments for Ebola infection, which caused more than 11,000 deaths in the 2014-2015 outbreak in West Africa.  NIAID researchers obtained and tested blood samples from a survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and discovered the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola. Investigators from the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Switzerland then isolated specific antibodies for potential use as a therapeutic for Ebola infection. Investigators from the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases administered a lethal dose of Zaire ebolavirus to four rhesus macaques, waited five days, and then treated three of the macaques with daily intravenous injections of the monoclonal antibody, known as mAb114, for three consecutive days. The untreated control macaque showed indicators of Ebola virus disease and died on day nine, but the treatment group survived and remained free of Ebola symptoms. NIAID and Dartmouth College researchers then studied how mAb114 neutralizes the Ebola virus and determined that it binds to the core of the Ebola glycoprotein, blocking its interaction with a receptor on human cells. This area of the Ebola glycoprotein, called the receptor binding domain, was previously thought to be unreachable by antibodies because it is well-hidden by other parts of the virus, and only becomes exposed after the virus enters the inside of cells. This is the first antibody to demonstrate the ability to neutralize the virus by this interaction between the virus and its cellular receptor. Together the evidence identifies a novel site of vulnerability on the Ebola virus and suggests mAb114 could be an effective therapy and warrants further exploration, according to the authors.","Published: February 26, 2016"

The discovery might lead to better ways to thwart viruses that kill agricultural crops and interfere with the production of dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. Both RNA and DNA are critical for life. In humans and many other organisms, DNA molecules act as the body's blueprints, while RNA molecules act as the construction crew reading the blueprints, building the body and maintaining the functions of life. The research team found for the first time that bacteria can snatch bits of RNA from invaders such as viruses and incorporate the RNA into their own genomes, using this information as something akin to mug shots. They then help the bacteria recognize and disrupt dangerous viruses in the future. ""This mechanism serves a defensive purpose in bacteria,"" says Alan Lambowitz, director of the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology at UT Austin and co-senior author of the paper. ""You could imagine transplanting it into other organisms and using it as a kind of virus detector."" The newly discovered mechanism stores both DNA and RNA mug shots from viruses in a bacterium's genome. That makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, the researchers say, given that some viruses are DNA-based and some are RNA-based. Lambowitz says that as a next step, researchers can examine how to genetically engineer a crop such as tomatoes so that each of their cells would carry this virus detector. Then the researchers could do controlled laboratory experiments in which they alter environmental conditions to see what effects the changes have on the transmission of pathogens. ""Combining these plants with the environment that they face, be it natural or involving the application of herbicides, insecticides or fungicides, could lead to the discovery of how pathogens are getting to these plants and what potential vectors could be,"" says Georg Mohr, a research associate at UT Austin and co-first author of the paper. Another application might be in the dairy industry, where viruses routinely infect the bacteria that produce cheese and yogurt, causing the production process to slow down or even preventing it from going to completion. Currently, preventing infections is complicated and costly. Lambowitz and Mohr say dairy bacteria could be engineered to record their virus interactions and defend against subsequent infections. This RNA-based defense mechanism is closely related to a previously discovered mechanism, called CRISPR/Cas, in which bacteria snatch bits of DNA and store them as mug shots. That method has inspired a new way of editing the genomes of virtually any living organism, launching a revolution in biological research and sparking a patent war, but the researchers say they do not anticipate this new discovery will play a role in that sort of gene-editing. However, the enzymatic mechanism used to incorporate RNA segments into the genome is novel and has potential biotechnological applications. Researchers discovered this novel defense mechanism in a type of bacteria commonly found in the ocean called Marinomonas mediterranea. It's part of a class of microbes called Gammaproteobacteria, which include many human pathogens such as those that cause cholera, plague, lung infections and food poisoning. Andrew Fire, a professor of pathology and of genetics at Stanford who shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of RNA interference, is the co-senior author of the paper.

The scientists published the method   which uses a high-tech image analysis robot called the Phenovator, designed by Wageningen UR   in the scientific magazine Plant Methods. In addition to photosynthesis, the robot also measures the growth and movements of plants throughout the day and night. Besides plant breeding research, the equipment has major potential for fundamental scientific research into the improvement of photosynthesis in plants. Until now, plant breeders could not select plants with increased photosynthesis in a reliable way. While it has been possible for some time to measure photosynthesis in plants, the existing techniques are too labour intensive and the measuring results overly dependent on the ambient conditions. The Wageningen scientists are the first to publish a technology that will allow a realistic perspective on the selection of plants with better photosynthesis. The method enables the monitoring of 1,440 plants day and night, and involves the plants being photographed at various wave lengths of light, from deep red to blue, several times a day. The extent to which the chloroplasts, which are the cellular units that do the actual photosynthesis, respond to one specific wave length determines the effectiveness of the photosynthesis at that moment. The images captured at other wave lengths are used to measure the size and colour of all plants. Phenovator As all 1,400+ plants in the climate space are measured several times a day, the scientists can also determine the best moment to select plants with better photosynthesis. Moreover, the results are accurate and reliable, and reflecting the genetic potential of each plant, as the ambient conditions in the climate space can be carefully controlled. New measuring in research photosynthesis The measuring equipment also facilitates new fundamental research into issues such as the heredity of photosynthesis. Because so many plants are monitored, it is possible to specifically search for the genes that are relevant to photosynthesis. In addition, the Phenovator can be used to study the influence of other processes on photosynthesis, such as changes in light intensity, temperature or drought, and which genes are involved therein. These issues make the equipment valuable to research focused on improving the photosynthesis process. There is considerable international interest in this type of research as it is expected that better photosynthesis can help produce more food on the same amount of land. This is essential with the global population growing and the amount of suitable agricultural land declining. Phenovation During the development of the Phenovator some of the cooperating scientists established the company Phenovation, a Wageningen UR spin-off that develops and builds equipment for measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, a major indicator for photosynthesis.","Published: February 26, 2016"

The ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by 27 percent in the study population overall and by 61 percent among women ages 25 years and older, who used the ring most consistently. These results were announced at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Boston and simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. Women need a discreet, long-acting form of HIV prevention that they control and want to use,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the primary funder of the trial.  This study found that a vaginal ring containing a sustained-release antiretroviral drug confers partial protection against HIV among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Further research is needed to understand the age-related disparities in the observed level of protection. Women accounted for more than half of the 25.8 million people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa in 2014. Finding effective HIV prevention tools for adolescent girls and young women in particular is critical, as one in four new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occur in this group. The ASPIRE study, also known as MTN-020, aimed to determine whether the experimental antiretroviral drug dapivirine could safely and effectively prevent HIV infection when continuously released in the vagina from a silicone ring replaced once every 4 weeks. The study, which began in 2012, enrolled more than 2,600 HIV-uninfected women ages 18 to 45 years who were at high risk for HIV infection at 15 sites in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The women were assigned at random to receive either the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring. No one knew who received which ring until the end of the trial. All study participants received a package of HIV prevention services at each study visit, including HIV risk-reduction counseling, partner HIV testing, treatment of sexually transmitted infections in participants and their partners, and free condoms. The investigators found that the dapivirine ring reduced the risk of acquiring HIV by 27 percent among all women enrolled in the trial. But when the scientists excluded data from two sites where it was apparent early on that many women were not returning for study visits or using the ring consistently, the ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by 37 percent. Furthermore, the investigators found that the dapivirine ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by 61 percent in women ages 25 and older, but provided no statistically significant protection in women younger than 25 years. These younger women appeared to use the ring less consistently than other participants, based on the amount of dapivirine measured in volunteers  blood during study visits. To explore this age-related effect further, investigators performed analyses that were not originally planned and found that the ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by 56 percent in women older than 21 years, but provided no protection for women ages 18 to 21 years. More research is needed to determine whether behavior, biology or a combination of factors contributed to the lack of significant protection for younger women. Finally, the investigators found that the rate of adverse medical events was similar among women who received the dapivirine ring compared to those who received the placebo ring, as was the frequency of antiretroviral resistance in women who acquired HIV. To help bring about an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, women   especially those in sub-Saharan Africa   need multiple options for HIV prevention,  said Jared Baeten, M.D., Ph.D., who co-led the study for the NIH-funded Microbicide Trials Network (MTN).  The ASPIRE study was an important step towards determining whether the dapivirine ring could become one such option.  Dr. Baeten is a professor of global health, medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington in Seattle.  The ASPIRE study is the first to demonstrate that a sustained drug delivery product that slowly releases an antiretroviral drug over time can offer partial protection from HIV,  added Thesla Palanee-Phillips, Ph.D., who led the study with Dr. Baeten. Dr. Palanee-Phillips is the director of network trials and research center programs at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa. An ongoing large multinational clinical trial called The Ring Study also tested the dapivirine ring for safety and efficacy in women. Similar to ASPIRE, The Ring Study investigators found an overall effectiveness of 31 percent, with a slightly greater reduction in risk of HIV infection among women older than 21 years. The results of The Ring Study also were announced today at CROI. NIAID plans to consult with a panel of outside experts to determine next steps for research on the dapivirine ring, which the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) developed and provided for both studies as their regulatory sponsor. The ASPIRE study was funded by NIAID, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Mental Health, all part of NIH, and conducted by MTN. The Ring Study is being funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the U.S. President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and several European governments and organizations, and is being conducted by IPM.","Published: February 26, 2016"

There is no microscope that allows us to look at living cells with this resolution and precision in a controlled microenvironment. We can now create 3-D images of cancer cells and record how they interact with their microenvironment via signaling,  said Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, Chair of the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics at UT Southwestern and corresponding author of a study detailing the project published this week in Developmental Cell. This approach enables researchers to study cells in controlled microenvironments at a level of detail that should accelerate the pace of discovery in many fields of biology, Dr. Danuser explained. It s a two-photon, light-sheet microscope that allows 3-D time-lapse imaging of cells deep within physiologically realistic microenvironments,  said Dr. Reto Fiolka, an Instructor of Cell Biology at UT Southwestern and fellow corresponding author of the study. Using the new microscope and software, the researchers created 3-D images of the detailed shapes that skin and lung cancer cells develop as they move through tissue. They also created images and movies of the dynamic activation of a key signaling molecule (PI3-kinase) that is involved in many cellular processes. The new microscope was designed to solve a long-standing problem in biology: the need to artificially constrain cells   usually by flattening them onto glass plates in two dimensions   in order to image them clearly. The trade-off between image clarity and environmental realism has existed for centuries, the researchers explained.  It s long been known that the microenvironment profoundly influences how genes are expressed and cells behave, but no mass-produced microscope allows observation of cells under realistic conditions,  Dr. Fiolka said.  The practical utility of medical research depends on how accurately laboratory experiments can recreate biologically realistic environments.  Images viewed with traditional microscopes are sharp in the horizontal plane, but more blurred in a cross section along the third dimension, he added. With this two-photon, light-sheet microscope, researchers can look in any direction and see a crisp image. The researchers call their new approach  microenvironmentally conscious imaging.   This approach will create opportunities for researchers to make observations at the subcellular level without compromising microenvironmental control, which should open a window for addressing fundamental questions in cell biology,  said Dr. Danuser, who holds the Patrick E. Haggerty Distinguished Chair in Basic Biomedical Science. The researchers designed the new microscope so that scientists could carefully control the microenvironment and change that environment to study how cells interact with tissue. It is realistic, but shouldn t be called natural. The only truly natural environment is the one within the body, where there are too many variables for well-controlled experiments, Dr. Danuser explained. The images created by this new approach diverged from previous two-dimensional glass-plated images. For instance, skin cancer cells show thin, elongated protrusions when viewed on glass plates. In 3-D microenvironments, those cells instead show rounded protrusions called blebs, but it is too soon to say if those blebs are involved in cancer cell movement, spread, drug resistance, or something else entirely. Study lead authors were Dr. Erik Welf, Assistant Instructor, and Dr. Meghan Driscoll, a postdoctoral researcher. Both were in the Department of Cell Biology at the time of the study and now work in the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics, which was created to help the University capture and interpret massive amounts of data created by new technology.

The lateral septum, Lin notes, is physically connected to, and receives electrical signals from, the part of the brain that controls emotion and learning the hippocampus. The lateral septum also projects into and receives signals from the brain region most broadly tied to aggression and hormone production the hypothalamus. Lin emphasizes that septal rage is not known to occur in humans, but that studying male aggression in mice might help to map the circuitry involved in controlling other forms of aggression, including violent behavior in humans. Among the study s key findings was that stimulating brain cells in the lateral septum controlled other brain cells, notably in a centrally located region of the hypothalamus, identified anatomically as the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Previous research by Lin had shown this brain region to be highly active during natural aggression but, until now, had not identified the other parts of the brain that interact with it in this context.

Courtesy: Current Biology and Cell Press  By  exciting  selected groups of brain cells with light from a surgically inserted probe, Lin and her colleagues changed the activity of cells in the lateral septum, and found that they could start, stop, and restart aggressive outbursts in the study mice. According to Lin, interrupting the connection between the lateral septum and ventromedial hypothalamus did not affect the mice s sexual behavior, and did not in other experiments stop male mice from attempting to have sex with female mice. This is important, Lin says, because it demonstrates that two innate behaviors, aggression and sexual behavior, can be adjusted separately. Learn More: Does sexual aggression alter the female brain? The scientists also found that when excited, lateral septum cells increased activity in one set of brain cells in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus, even as they decreased activity in another nerve cell set in the same region. Indeed, the cells most active during mice attacks were those suppressed to the greatest degree during septal stimulation, while the cells suppressed during aggression were most active when the lateral septum was stimulated. Lin says this finding suggests that the lateral septum is a  smart  gatekeeper of aggression, suppressing attack-excited cells while activating attack-inhibited cells.

Courtesy: Current Biology and Cell Press   Our research provides what we believe is the first evidence that the lateral septum directly  turns the volume up or down  in aggression in male mice, and it establishes the first ties between this region and the other key brain regions involved in violent behavior,  says Lin. The research team next plans to investigate which specific brain cells in the lateral septum control male aggression, and under what conditions they are activated to promote or halt the behavior. Lin says her long-term goal is to determine whether or not therapeutic means can be found to control aggression without compromising other social and cognitive functions.

This is according to a study led by researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center and the University of Iowa published in the journal Neuron. See Also: Brain area that integrates speech s rhythms found Patients in the study were put under local anesthesia for an initial part of their brain operations, some of which were to remove tumors. This left the patients awake and able to speak as part of an effort to map brain functions, including the speaking ability, to specific brain areas. The research team showed that the combination of cooling and verbal checks during the initial mapping phase of the surgery enabled neurosurgeons to avoid speech centers when removing tissue later in the operation. Also during the mapping phase, researchers were able to run 16 surgical patients through word exercises as the team systematically cooled 42 distinct brain sites, all in regions suggested by past studies to play roles in speech signaling. Once mapping was complete, patients received general anesthesia for the remainder of their operation. ""This study confirms that cooling is a safe and effective means of protecting important brain centers during neurosurgery,"" says study lead investigator Michael Long, PhD, an assistant professor in the Neuroscience Institute at NYU Langone. All study patients safely recovered from their operation with no damage to their ability to speak, says Long. Focal cooling is a ""vast improvement"" over older brain-mapping techniques, he notes, which involved electrical stimulation and came with the risk of triggering epileptic seizures during surgery. ""Our study results also represent a major advance in the understanding of the roles played by the areas of the brain that enable us to form words,"" says Long. ""When we lowered the temperature in specific brain areas during brain surgery and asked people to speak, we saw distinct and complementary roles emerge for specific brain regions."" Learn More: Brain s iconic seat of speech goes silent when we actually talk Building on methods first used to study brain circuits that enable birds to sing, surgeons at the University of Iowa gently placed miniature devices on patients' brains during the operations that cooled areas about the size of a quarter by as much as 10 degrees Celsius in less than a minute. This changed brain function in these spots, slowing and blurring speech as patients recited the days of the week and other simple lists. Differences corresponding to each cooled brain region were clear in recordings and confirmed by statistical analysis. Function returned to normal as each area naturally rewarmed. Specifically, the researchers found that the speech motor cortex directs movement of the muscles, including those in the lips and tongue, which articulate words during speech. The nearby Broca's area was found to plan the actions of the speech motor cortex, including the speed and timing of muscle movements needed to form syllables. Long says the team will next use the cooling technique to better understand how various brain regions help to interpret words. His ultimate goal, he says, is to develop therapies for people who have lost speaking ability to injury or disease.

See Also: Brain navigation can occur without external cues Arne Ekstrom, associate professor at the UC Davis Center for Neuroscience, wants to know how we memorize places and routes, and learn to find our way around. It's long been known that as a rat navigates a maze, its brain gives off a rhythmic oscillation, Ekstrom said. This also happens when humans travel around a virtual landscape on a computer screen. Most models of brain function assume that the oscillations, emanating from the hippocampus deep inside the brain, are at least partly driven by external inputs. Neuroscientist Arne Ekstrom uses virtual mazes to explore how we learn to find our way around. Credit: UC Davis  ""There is this rhythmic firing in the brain during navigation and while remembering things, but we don't know if it is triggered by sensory input or by the learning process,"" Ekstrom said. Ekstrom, postdoc Lindsay Vass and graduate student Milagros Copara were able to solve this problem by working with a group of patients being treated at UC Davis' Department of Neurological Surgery. These patients have a severe form of epilepsy, and surgeon and study coauthor Kia Shahlaie implanted electrodes on their brains, inside the skull, to find out where seizure activity begins and identify treatment options. Learn More: Mazes and brains: When preconception trumps logic In between seizures, the electrodes recorded normal brain activity, and three patients volunteered to take part in the experiment. They were asked to navigate through a streetscape on a computer screen. At some points, they entered a teleporter and jumped to a different, known location in the map. During teleportation, the screen went black for a random period of time. Teleportation did not interrupt the oscillations at all, but the rhythm did change with the distance travelled during teleportation, Ekstrom said. The results show that these oscillations are driven entirely by memory and learning processes in the brain, and do not depend on external senses. They also show that the oscillation carries information about speed and distance travelled, even when that travel is virtual teleportation.

An alternative approach is to bypass the blood brain barrier and directly inject drugs into the intrathecal space of the spinal canal, allowing the therapeutic compound to reach the cerebrospinal fluid.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/high-povertys-effect-on-childhood-leukemia-196915,High Poverty s Effect on Childhood Leukemia Patients more likely to suffer early relapses  which can be harder to treat  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric cancer, those who live in high-poverty areas are substantially more likely to suffer early relapse than other patients, despite having received the same treatment, according to new research from Dana-Farber/Boston Children s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. The findings are significant because ALL that relapses early is more difficult to successfully treat. Although an emerging body of research finds that children from low-income families have lower rates of overall survival than other children with ALL, this study is among the first to explore possible factors contributing to outcome disparities among children who received uniform treatment. Investigators examined outcomes for 575 children, age 1 to 18, with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/ALL Consortium protocols at seven major academic medical centers in the United States between 2000 and 2010. Using U.S. Census Bureau criteria, they defined high-poverty areas as ZIP codes where 20 percent or more of residents have incomes below the federal poverty level. For a family of four, this translates to an annual income of $24,250 or less.  These children are getting the same best possible care at well-resourced institutions from highly trained clinicians, and we re still seeing disparities,  said lead researcher Kira Bona, a pediatric oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children s.  In trying to improve cure rates, we, as a field, have focused almost exclusively on biology. If we want to move forward, we also have to look at social determinants.  In this country, 20 percent of children live in poverty,  Bona added.  Furthermore, we know that the costs of having a child treated for cancer force higher-income families into poverty. If we can devise successful interventions, that s at least 20 percent of children with cancer whose outcomes we can potentially impact. Any  moon shot  to cure cancer must include interventions that target socio-economic disparities in outcomes.  Among the study s findings: Although overall rates of relapse were similar in the two groups, the timing of relapse differed significantly. Ninety-two percent of children from high-poverty areas who relapsed suffered early relapse, defined as the recurrence of disease less than 36 months after first achieving complete remission. By comparison, fewer than half   48 percent   of other children who relapsed did so early. Among children from high-poverty areas, 85 percent survived five years or longer, compared with 92 percent of other children. Although the difference is not statistically significant after adjustment for other variables (p=0.07), it suggests a possible disparity. Earlier population-based studies of children with ALL have found lower rates of overall survival among patients from low-income families. The earlier research, however, included children who had received a variety of treatments. Bona and her colleagues are now undertaking further research designed to delve deeper into the relationship between socio-economic status and outcomes and to allow for development of poverty-targeted interventions. As part of a prospective clinical trial for children with ALL, researchers will identify associations between disease outcomes and the socio-economic status of patients  families, using a targetable measure of socioeconomic status termed material hardship (food, housing and/or energy insecurity). In an earlier study, published in Pediatric Blood & Cancer in September 2015, Bona and her colleagues found that almost one-third of families of children with cancer suffered food, housing, or energy insecurity six months after treatment began   and a quarter lost more than 40 percent of household income. The new study will also investigate possible mechanisms underlying the relationship between socioeconomic status and early relapse, including adherence to oral chemotherapy and delays or dose reductions in chemotherapy due to a child s underlying health. Earlier research indicated that children from low-income families may face particular struggles with adherence to oral chemotherapy regimens, and research from general pediatrics has shown that children from low-income families have worse underlying health than other children. If poorer underlying health makes a child with cancer more susceptible to complications of treatment, this could lead to delays or dose reductions in chemotherapy. In a qualitative study using in-depth interviews with patient families, researchers will probe families  knowledge and experience to pinpoint factors that might explain the disparity in outcome and identify factors that can be targeted with interventions.  Doing these next two studies is incredibly important,  Bona said.  This study told us that simply providing the current best treatment regimen is not good enough if our goal is to cure every child with cancer. At the same time that we develop new drugs and new treatment protocols, we need to address social determinants of health. Findings from these next studies will help us develop specific interventions to address disparities in outcomes. That s an amazing opportunity. ","Published: February 25, 2016"

Among the important requirements for such diagnostic devices is that the results or readouts be robust against a variety of environmental conditions and user errors. To address the need for a robust readout system for quantitative diagnostics, researchers in the Ismagilov lab have invented a new visual readout method that uses analytical chemistries and image processing to provide unambiguous quantification of single nucleic-acid molecules that can be performed by any cell-phone camera. The visual readout method is described and validated using RNA from the hepatitis C virus HCV RNA  in a paper. The work utilizes a microfluidic technology called SlipChip, which was invented in the Ismagilov lab several years ago. A SlipChip serves as a portable lab-on-a-chip and can be used to quantify concentrations of single molecules. Each SlipChip encodes a complex program for isolating single molecules (such as DNA or RNA) along with chemical reactants in nanoliter-sized wells. The program also controls the complex reactions in each well: the chip consists of two plates that move or ""slip"" relative to one another, with each ""slip"" joining or separating the hundreds or even thousands of tiny wells, either bringing reactants and molecules into contact or isolating them. The architecture of the chip enables the user to have complete control over these chemical reactions and can prevent contamination, making it an ideal platform for a user-friendly, robust diagnostic device. The new visual readout method builds upon this SlipChip platform. Special indicator chemistries are integrated into the wells of the SlipChip device. After an amplification reaction a reaction that multiplies nucleic-acid molecules wells change color depending on whether the reaction in it was positive or negative. For example, if a SlipChip is being used to count HCV RNA molecules in a sample, a well containing an RNA molecule that amplified during the reaction would turn blue; whereas a well lacking an RNA molecule would remain purple. To read the result, a user simply takes a picture of the entire SlipChip using any camera phone. Then the photo is processed using a ratiometric approach that transforms the colors detected by the camera's sensor into an unambiguous readout of positives and negatives. Previous SlipChip technologies utilized a chemical that would fluoresce when a reaction took place within a well. But those readouts can be too subtle for detection by a common cell-phone camera or can require specific lighting conditions. The new method provides guidelines for selecting indicators that yield color changes compatible with the color sensitivities of phone cameras, and the ratiometric processing removes the need for a user to distinguish colors by sight. ""The readout process we developed can be used with any cell-phone camera,"" says Jesus Rodriguez-Manzano, a postdoctoral scholar in chemical engineering and one of two first authors on the paper. ""It is rapid, automated, and doesn't require counting or visual interpretation, so the results can be read by anyone even users who are color blind or working under poor lighting conditions. This robustness makes our visual readout method appropriate for integration with devices used in any setting, including at the point of care in limited-resource settings. This is critical because the need for highly sensitive diagnostics is greatest in such regions.""","Published: February 25, 2016"

Bacteria deposited on a surface by one person touching it, or via contaminated body fluids, can be picked up by subsequent users and spread to other surfaces, potentially causing thousands of infections worldwide. There were over 800 cases of MRSA and almost 10,000 cases of MSSA reported by English NHS acute Trusts between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 20151. In previous Southampton studies, simulated 'droplet contamination' of MRSA - representing a sneeze or a splash - showed it was rapidly killed on copper and copper alloy surfaces. However, contamination of surfaces often occurs via fingertips, drying rapidly and potentially being overlooked by cleaning regimes, unlike visible droplets. Dr Sarah Warnes, lead author of the new research, explains: ""Our latest research shows that in simulated fingertip contamination of surfaces with millions of MRSA or MSSA, the cells can remain alive for long periods on non-antimicrobial surfaces - such as stainless steel - but are killed even more rapidly than droplet contamination on copper and copper alloys. Exposure to copper damages the bacterial respiration and DNA, resulting in irreversible cell breakdown and death."" This new paper demonstrates that MRSA die on copper surfaces by a multifaceted attack from copper ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Professor Bill Keevil, Chair in Environmental Healthcare at the University of Southampton and the paper's co-author, explains the significance of these findings: ""It's important to understand the mechanism of copper's antimicrobial efficacy because microorganisms have evolved various mechanisms to convey resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics. Our work shows that copper targets various cellular sites, not only killing bacterial and viral pathogens, but also rapidly destroying their nucleic acid genetic material so there is no chance of mutation occurring and nothing to pass on to other microbes, a process called horizontal gene transfer. Consequently, this helps prevent breeding the next generation of superbug."" Touch surfaces made from solid antimicrobial copper are already used by hospitals, schools, mass transit hubs, sports facilities and offices around the world to reduce the spread of infections, supporting key infection control measures such as good hand hygiene and regular surface cleaning and disinfection.","Published: February 25, 2016"

ATTR is a rare degenerative disease that mainly affects the nervous system and heart muscle tissue (myocardium), and which is usually passed on from parents to children. It originates when the liver and other areas of the organism produce mutations of the protein transthyretin (TTR), which lose their functional structure. This causes toxic aggregates of amyloid fibres to build up, which, depending on the mutation involved, are deposited in different organs, such as the brain, the kidneys, the nerves, the eyes or the myocardium, causing them to malfunction and bringing on the various forms of the disease. To prevent the disease from progressing, a liver transplant or liver and heart transplant is needed. the study that has just been published, the researchers conducted biophysical trials - in vitro in cell cultures and ex vivo in human plasma and in mouse models of the disease - to show that tolcapone is a powerful inhibitor of the aggregation of amyloid fibres by TTR, stabilising the structure of the protein and thus slowing down the advance of the disease. This is a hitherto unknown property of the drug, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease. The compound turns out to be four times more effective than the only medicine currently available for treating the polyneuropathic variant of ATTR. The results were positive for all variants of the disease that were studied: familial amyloid polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy (which affects the peripheral nerves and the myocardium, respectively) and senile systemic amyloidosis, a sporadic form that appears in a very high percentage of men over 60 years of age (and also affects the myocardium). In addition, the treatment was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, making it the first to tackle the variants that affect the central nervous system. According to the researchers, this molecule has the potential to become an effective drug for preventing the protein depositions that cause the disease and slowing down its progress, one that could be on the market within five years, as it has already been tested in a clinical trial with persons affected by the neuropathic variant. This trial, led by Dr Josep G mez, from the Research Institute of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, in collaboration with SOM Biotech, was a proof-of-concept test to assess the efficacy and safety of the compound, and it demonstrated the latter's ability to stabilise 100% of TTR in plasma in all the patients treated, to a high degree of safety.","Published: February 25, 2016"

Even though enormous advances have been made in HIV treatment, a complete cure from the disease is still not possible. Indeed, the propagation of the virus in the body can nowadays be held in check through medication, but the provirus remains present in cells of the body. A team of researchers from the Department of Medical Systems Biology at the TUD as well as the research unit Antiviral Strategies at the HPI in Hamburg employed directed molecular evolution to generate a designer recombinase (Brec1), which can precisely remove the provirus from the majority (>90%) of clinical HIV-1 isolates found in humans.  The team now demonstrated for the first time, that the approach works on cells directly isolated from HIV-1 patients. Importantly, the antiviral effects were accomplished without measurable cytotoxic or genotoxic side effects. Based on these findings, Brec1 represents a promising candidate for possible applications in improved HIV therapies.  The generation of molecular scalpels, such as the Brec1 recombinase, will change medical practice. Not only HIV patients will likely benefit from this development, but also many other patients with genetically caused diseases. We are about to witness the beginning of the genome surgery era , predicts the head of the Dresden group, Prof. Frank Buchholz. Brec1 recombinase was developed in close collaboration at the department of Medical Systems Biology (Prof. Frank Buchholz), TU Dresden and the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology (Prof. Joachim Hauber).","Published: February 25, 2016"

Ubiquigent also announced the launch of a new website to provide improved access to the Drug Discovery Services, Research Tools, Chemistry and expertise to support ubiquitin system-focused drug discovery and basic research programmes. John Harris founded BioFocus, a highly successful preclinical stage contract research organisation (now part of Charles River).  As interest in kinase inhibitors took off, he conceived the focused library as a fast track to clinical development candidates and designed a portfolio of small molecule libraries for screening, leading to many patents in the kinase and subsequently other areas. Now it is becoming increasingly clear that the small molecule modulation of other major cell signalling processes, such as protein ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation, possess the potential for further breakthroughs of similar therapeutic magnitude to kinase inhibition.  Along with the major advances in the high-quality biological assays being developed by Ubiquigent, John believes that the stage is now set for a similar impact of focused medicinal chemistry targeting ubiquitin system proteins; starting at Ubiquigent with targeting deubiquitylase enzymes.  Laurence Ede is the former Managing Director and co-owner of Tocris Bioscience, where he gained significant experience within the life science industry.  Following a Management Buyout in late 2006, Laurence focused on developing Tocris to be an increasingly significant player within the life science arena, which in turn led to the successful trade sale of the business to US buyer R&D Systems (Techne) in April 2011. Jason Mundin began his career as a research scientist at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), before joining the team that founded Pharmagene Laboratories, which focused on drug discovery through the application of human-tissue-based approaches.

It focuses on five key areas of strategic importance:   Accelerating industrialisation and commercialisation   Maximising the capability of the innovation pipeline   Building an expert workforce   Developing a supportive business environment, and   Building value from national and international partnerships. It builds on the recommendations made in the Synthetic Biology Roadmap for the UK, which was first published by Innovate UK in 2012. The roadmap led directly to major funding and policy activities, including the establishment of new synthetic biology research centres, the Innovation and Knowledge Centre at SynbiCITE, DNA synthesis facilities, training centres and a seed fund for innovative companies. In addition, the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council (SBLC) was founded to manage the continued growth of this field. During 2015, the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council (SBLC) consulted a broad cross-section of businesses and the research community to develop this new strategic plan, building upon the successes of the 2012 roadmap. Life Sciences Minister George Freeman MP said:  Synthetic biology involves designing and adapting biological systems to deliver new solutions to key challenges across the bioeconomy including global health and clean energy production. With help from government investment in world-class research facilities, including  50m for dedicated research centres, DNA facilities and training, UK capability in synthetic biology has made rapid progress in recent years and we are now in pole position to capitalise on this potential. This strategy sets out a clear plan to ensure the UK maintains its position as a global leader by taking our world-leading research and turning it into commercial opportunities. Professor Lionel Clarke, Co-Chair of the SBLC said:  We are extremely fortunate to have such a vibrant and committed community within the UK that has drawn upon its collective experience and contributed so effectively to shaping the next steps forward.   The 2012 UK Synthetic Biology Roadmap helped establish firm foundations of technical excellence, responsibility in research and innovation, proportionate regulation and governance. Guided by the additional recommendations captured in this strategic plan, I am confident that synthetic biology enabled biodesign will deliver a broad range of valuable products and services of clear public benefit, making an increasingly significant contribution to the UK bioeconomy for many years to come.  Dr Tim Fell, CEO of Synthace, Chairman of the UK Bioindustry Association s Synthetic Biology Advisory Committee and member of the SBLC said:  With this tremendously insightful strategic plan there can be no doubt the UK is committed to embracing the power of biology to address global challenges. This document s vision of an expert workforce able to employ the digitisation of biology through software, standards and flexible automation, all within a supportive business and regulatory framework is a credit to the UK synthetic biology community who came together to create it, and who are already driving towards it.  Dr Ted Fjallman, CEO of Prokarium Ltd, said:  Prokarium has benefited greatly from the first SynBio roadmap in terms of R&D projects launched in the UK as well as national and international relationships that have been built as a result of our R&D within SynbiCITE and the trade missions and conferences organised by the BIA, UKTI and SynbiCITE. For Prokarium this has led to direct investment from Sweden, which has allowed us to develop several vaccines to preclinical proof of concept; some of which are sought after in fast growing markets in Asia. We look forward to being a part of the second roadmap!  Dr David Venables, CEO of Synpromics, a provider of cutting edge synthetic biology tools, said:  Synpromics welcomes the publication of this strategic plan and the acknowledgement that, whilst synthetic biology has huge potential for improving biological processes, for the UK to remain at the forefront of innovation it will require translation of ground breaking research into new businesses and novel products and services. Therefore, the actions identified to promote investment in research and translation, and to create a supportive business environment are to be welcomed."" Dr Ruth McKernan, Chief Executive of Innovate UK, the UK s innovation agency said:  Business-led innovation in synthetic biology creates industries for the future. We need to commercialise this technology and drive growth in the bioeconomy   this area is ripe for investment. Turning excellent research into commercial success is what Innovate UK is all about.

Whilst bumblebees have relatively simple brains compared to our own human brain, they are able to perform complex learning tasks, such as remembering the best places to forage for nectar and pollen. Given their importance as pollinators for crops and wild flowers, understanding how damage to bees' brains affects their behaviour can help researchers understand what causes bee brains to malfunction. Until now, scientists studying insect brains had to remove them and slice them up, causing damage to the structures and preventing accurate measurement of their size and shape. However the new study, led by researchers from Imperial College London and published in Scientific Reports, uses non-destructive techniques by applying micro-CT. The technique they use is similar to CT scanning of the human brain, but at a much higher resolution. ""It's a fantastic way to look inside insect brains. We can look at the brain as it naturally sits in the bee's head, without the human error of having to extract it,"" said Dr Richard Gill, one of the paper's authors from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial. ""The 3D structures can also be explored as you wish - from looking at the whole organ down to each separate structure, piece by piece."" Micro-CT scanning uses X-rays to provide hundreds of image slices of an object, in this case the bee's head. These slices can then be united to form a virtual 3D model in incredible resolution. Bee brains are less than two cubic millimetres in volume, which is only about 0.0002 per cent of the human brain. The researchers teamed up with Dr Farah Ahmed who runs the micro-CT scanner facility at the Natural History Museum in London to help scan the brains of 19 bumblebees. Bumblebees can be successfully kept in labs and given controlled behavioural tasks. The team hope to be able to use the micro-CT scanning technique to probe the brains of trained bumblebees to investigate the connection between behaviour and brain changes. For example, changes in the size of certain brain structures, such as the so-called mushroom bodies found in insect brains, are thought to be linked to increased learning and memory abilities. Dylan Smith, the lead author also from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial said: ""With older techniques, the sizes of these structures could not be accurately measured and compared between bees. ""The structures are so small that tiny errors in measurement can lead to wrong conclusions. This new technique allows structures to be isolated, examined, and measured in greater detail than ever before."" The team also hope to be able to use the technique to study the effects of trauma on the brains of bees and whether certain influences affect the memory and learning centres, affecting their ability to forage and pollinate effectively. ""We know in humans that small differences in structures can lead to large effects on behaviour. We can now investigate whether even the most minimal deformations can have knock-on effects to behaviour in these simple brains,"" said Smith. This sort of research requires accuracy but also the ability to reproduce results quickly and cost-effectively, which the team say can now be done, by combining micro-CT scanning with a 3D-rendering software that is freely available.","Published: February 25, 2016"

How safe is our food given the globalised nature of food production, and what challenges does this pose for consumer health protection? At the symposium ""Risks along global food commodity chains"" organised by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR) and held in Berlin on 18 and 19 February 2016, experts will be discussing this and other questions. ""For consumers, the increasing globalisation of the food trade means that almost any type of food can be consumed anywhere in the world at any time"", says BfR President Professor Dr. Dr. Andreas Hensel. ""However, the worldwide commodity chains can be confusing in some cases, and they pose entirely new c hallenges to consumer health protection. Together with our international partners we want to further intensify and promote our research and assessment work in this area."" The global food trade plays an important role for Germany. In the year 2014, Germany imported food and beverages worth Euro 75.5 billion. Approximately three quarters of these imports come from other European countries. However, imported foods from North and South America and Asia are becoming more and more important. The growing complexity and internationalisation of commodity chains which to an ever growing extent are characterised by network-like structures necessitate more and more extensive tasks for participating food and feed enterprises. Suitable procedures and systems need to be established to ensure the safety of the products despite the differing legal and structural frameworks across the globe. The competent public food safety agencies are faced with similar challenges, since they are mandated to assess and control the effectiveness of the measures and processes employed by companies. The focus of the two-day BfR symposium is on the development of the increasingly complex global commodity chains over the last decade. Participating experts will discuss the requirements on various actors resulting from the worldwide trade, covering everything from primary agricultural production to on-site distribution and also potential new problems for public health. Another focal point of the conference are the concrete activities to ensure safe food and feed. In this context, the specific risks in the area of primary production (feed and livestock) and / or food production will be analysed as a basis for discussing intervention strategies to minimise potential health risks. In addition, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) will, on the occasion of the symposium, present its work and proposed solutions in the area of global commodity chains. The research efforts of the BfR have focused, among other things, on the development of various software systems aiming to enable risk assessment even in complex circumstances. A further research focus is on new analytical approaches to guarantee the authenticity of foods. It is hoped that so-called goal-unspecific procedures will make it possible to record characteristic fingerprints of a food or feed and then to check these against a reference library. This should in future provide answers even to analytically complex questions such as the geographical origins of products.","Published: February 25, 2016"

But a new study co-authored by an MIT professor suggests otherwise: Technology-driven cost reductions in fossil fuels will lead us to continue using all the oil, gas, and coal we can, unless governments pass new taxes on carbon emissions.  If we don t adopt new policies, we re not going to be leaving fossil fuels in the ground,  says Christopher Knittel, an energy economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management.  We need both a policy like a carbon tax and to put more R&D money into renewables.  While renewable energy has made promising gains in just the last few years   the cost of solar dropped by about two-thirds from 2009 to 2014   new drilling and extraction techniques have made fossil fuels cheaper and markedly increased the amount of oil and gas we can tap into. In the U.S. alone, oil reserves have expanded 59 percent between 2000 and 2014, and natural gas reserves have expanded 94 percent in the same time.  You often hear, when fossil fuel prices are going up, that if we just leave the market alone we ll wean ourselves off fossil fuels,  adds Knittel.  But the message from the data is clear: That s not going to happen any time soon.  This trend   in which cheaper renewables are outpaced by even cheaper fossil fuels   portends drastic climate problems, since fossil fuel use has helped produce record warm temperatures worldwide.The study concludes that burning all available fossil fuels would raise global average temperatures 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100; burning oil shale and methane hydrates, two more potential sources of copious fossil fuels, would add another 1.5 to 6.2 degrees Fahrenheit to that.  Such scenarios imply difficult-to-imagine change in the planet and dramatic threats to human well-being in many parts of the world,  the paper states. The authors add that  the world is likely to be awash in fossil fuels for decades and perhaps even centuries to come.  The paper,  Will We Ever Stop Using Fossil Fuels?,  is published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. The authors are Knittel, who is MIT s William Barton Rogers Professor in Energy; Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman Professor in Economics and the College at the University of Chicago; and Thomas Covert, an assistant professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. The scholars examine costs over a time frame of five to 10 years, stating that further forecasts would be quite speculative, although the trend of cheaper fossil fuels could continue longer.","Published: February 25, 2016"

The research, published in the journal Science, demonstrates that astrocytes, which play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of brain function, can be adjusted by neurons in response to injury and disease. The discovery, which shows that the brain has a far greater ability to adapt and respond to changes than previously believed, could have significant implications on epilepsy, movement disorders, and psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Astrocytes, the star-shaped cells in our brain that surround neurons and neural circuits, protect them from injury and enable them to function properly. In essence, one of their main roles is to  baby-sit  neurons. Additionally, communications between brain cells is highly dependent on the behavior of astrocytes. Until now, the mechanisms that create and maintain differences among astrocytes, and allow them to fulfill specialized roles, has remained poorly understood. Learn More: First look at how astrocytes function in humans  It was believed that astrocytes acquired their properties during the development of the brain and then they were hardwired in their roles,  says senior study s author Dr. Keith Murai, director of the Centre for Research in Neuroscience at the RI-MUHC, associate professor of the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University.  We have now discovered that astrocytes are actually incredibly flexible and potentially modifiable, which enables them to improve brain function or restore lost potential caused by disease.  The researchers discovered that there is a little dial-like mechanism on astrocytes that enables neurons to adjust astrocytes to ensure they provide the right kind of support.  This  dial  is likely used to tune the astrocyte s response in the normal brain but also in different diseases like Alzheimer s or Parkinson s or injuries such as stroke and trauma, for example,  explains Dr. Todd Farmer, the study s first author and a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Murai s laboratory at the Montreal General Hospital of the MUHC.  Our findings help us to better understand the complexity of the brain and also grasp mechanisms that can be used to reduce brain injury and disease.  Researchers conducted most of their experiments on mouse models and studied a specific pathway called the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is well known in brain development and cancer. By using a combination of advanced genetics, molecular approaches, and microscopy techniques they found that this signaling pathway is used in the adult brain in a completely novel way. The SHH pathway was found to induce disparate changes in astrocytes in different brain regions.   This is an extraordinary mechanism in the healthy, mature brain that creates diversity of brain cells,  says Dr. Murai.  Now, our goal is to see how this mechanism is affected in different brain diseases and determine if it can be harnessed to protect neurons and ultimately preserve brain function.  See Also: Astrocytes hold keys to brain organization and disease  Dr. Murai and his team have made a remarkable discovery that will advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms that play a role in brain disease,  says Inez Jabalpurwala, president and CEO of Brain Canada Foundation.  We are pleased to support this kind of transformative research which will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes.

Their study, published in Frontiers in Oncology, compared the two different devices in brain radiosurgery. Six patients, each with three or four brain metastases, were studied. See Also: Hyperfractionated radiation therapy improves local-regional control for patients with head, neck cancer The Gamma Knife was slightly more effective than RapidArc at focusing the beam of radiation, thus limiting spread to normal tissue, and RapidArc offered much quicker treatment compared to the Gamma Knife, researchers say. Gamma Knife treatment usually take 60-100 minutes, about 3-5 times longer than RapidArc, they say. ""In the end, using one or the other doesn't make a significant clinical difference and that is important to know because physicians and patients now know they have a choice of treatments,"" says the study's senior author, associate professor Wenyin Shi, MD, PhD, co-director of the Jefferson Brain Tumor Program. Thomas Jefferson University was one of the first institutions in the US to treat patients with RapidArc technology. Its physicians have been using Gamma Knife technology for 21 years. Understanding the benefits of advanced radiosurgery technology is essential because there has been, and will continue to be, an increase in cases of brain metastases tumors that spread to the brain from cancer somewhere else in the body, says co-author Adam Dicker, MD, PhD, Chair and Professor of Radiation Oncology, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. ""As drug therapy for cancer becomes better at controlling systemic cancer, disease in the brain increases over time. The brain is a sanctuary for cancer -- chemotherapies and targeted agents can't reach the brain and the central nervous system because of the blood-brain barrier,"" Dr. Dicker says. ""The results are that a number of different cancers are now showing up in the brain."" Learn More: Human stem cells repair damage caused by radiation therapy for brain cancer in rats Radiosurgery delivers a focused dose of radiation on tumors in order to shrink or kill the cancer, while sparing normal brain tissue. The Gamma Knife, invented in Sweden, features a circular array of 201 beams of gamma radiation that meet at a single point. The downside of the treatment, which is very accurate, is that patients wear a helmet that is fixed to the skull, Dr. Shi says. The procedure can also take a long time, he says.

For some time scholars have widely accepted the view that neurons, the cells that specialize in processing and transmitting information and contribute to brain plasticity, continue to be generated in the brains of animals even when they are adults. After being created in one part of the brain, the neurons then migrate to those regions of the brain that need them most. See Also: 'Conjunction junction' for brain's navigation function identified The international research team, which included scientists from the University of Oxford, focused on the role played by neurons in two species, turtle doves and reed warblers, making their way from Africa to the Middle East or Europe. In both species, the researchers found that the proportion of new neurons increased in line with the migration distance. Interestingly, however, there was a distinct difference between the two species in the areas of the brain that incorporated the new neurons. In reed warblers, birds that migrate as individuals at night, new neurons were found mainly in the hippocampus a brain region associated with navigation. In turtle doves, a species that migrates as a group, the new neurons were found mainly in the nidopallium caudolateral, an area associated with communication skills. The researchers caught 12 turtle doves and six reed warblers in nets in the Jordan Rift Valley in Israel. All the birds were on a migratory flight from Africa, but the researchers were able to estimate the flight distance already taken by each individual by measuring the isotopic signatures on the birds' feathers. The known values of isotopes of carbon and hydrogen, found in the water, soil and plants, differ according to which part of the world they are located. The researchers matched the known local values of isotopes with the particular values found on the feathers when the bird was captured. When birds lose their old feathers (through moulting) and grow new ones, they incorporate the isotopic signature of where they have been through the food and water they have ingested. Reed Warbler.

This was done by selectively coloring brain cells in several relevant regions: once for identifying new cells, and then a few weeks again for identifying neuron cells. Those colored twice were identified as new neurons. The researchers discovered that both species show a trend of increasing new neurons in line with migration distance and that different brain regions were affected.

In the long term, there are implications for how species evolve. For example, other research already suggests that birds that hoard food in particular periods incorporate new neurons in brain regions responsible for memory and spatial orientation. This latest paper builds on that work, suggesting that birds that need greater navigational help have more new neurons in that part of the brain while those that need to keep up with the flock incorporate new neurons in a different area.""

See Also: Protein clusters targeted by medications for neurodegenerative diseases actually serve to protect brain cells ATTR is a rare degenerative disease that mainly affects the nervous system and heart muscle tissue (myocardium), and which is usually passed on from parents to children. It originates when the liver and other areas of the organism produce mutations of the protein transthyretin (TTR), which lose their functional structure. This causes toxic aggregates of amyloid fibres to build up, which, depending on the mutation involved, are deposited in different organs, such as the brain, the kidneys, the nerves, the eyes or the myocardium, causing them to malfunction and bringing on the various forms of the disease. To prevent the disease from progressing, a liver transplant or liver and heart transplant is needed. In the study, the researchers conducted biophysical trials in vitro in cell cultures and ex vivo in human plasma and in mouse models of the disease to show that tolcapone is a powerful inhibitor of the aggregation of amyloid fibres by TTR, stabilizing the structure of the protein and thus slowing down the advance of the disease. This is a hitherto unknown property of the drug, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease. The compound turns out to be four times more effective than the only medicine currently available for treating the polyneuropathic variant of ATTR. The results were positive for all variants of the disease that were studied: familial amyloid polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy (which affects the peripheral nerves and the myocardium, respectively) and senile systemic amyloidosis, a sporadic form that appears in a very high percentage of men over 60 years of age (and also affects the myocardium). In addition, the treatment was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, making it the first to tackle the variants that affect the central nervous system. Learn More: Promising Alzheimer s treatment moves toward clinical trials According to the researchers, this molecule has the potential to become an effective drug for preventing the protein depositions that cause the disease and slowing down its progress, one that could be on the market within five years, as it has already been tested in a clinical trial with persons affected by the neuropathic variant. This trial, led by Dr. Josep G mez, from the Research Institute of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, in collaboration with SOM Biotech, was a proof-of-concept test to assess the efficacy and safety of the compound, and it demonstrated the latter's ability to stabilise 100% of TTR in plasma in all the patients treated, to a high degree of safety. Tolcapone acts by imitating the process by which the thyroid hormone T4 or thyroxine binds to TTR in the bloodstream. Just like the hormone, the drug binds closely to the protein, tying together the four protein sub-units that form the protein's structure. This binding has been proven to stabilise the protein, preventing the sub-units from separating and then forming aggregates. ATTR is the most common form of familial amyloidosis in the world. In Spain, though the disease can appear anywhere, it is especially prevalent in Palma de Mallorca and Valverde del Camino (Huelva). Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona  press release Sant'Anna R et al.

Using a mix of instinct and sensory cues, they pursue potential mates. But how do they decide when to make their move? New findings answer that question, at least for the tiny soil-dwelling worms known as Caenorhabditis elegans. Research conducted at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has found that where and when a male worm will pursue a mate is determined by four male-specific sensory neurons that communicate with synaptic feedback loops to form a decision-making network. The team reports their findings in a paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. See Also: Vienna neuroscientists decode the brain activity of the worm ""With just four sensory neurons the male is able to make a sophisticated calculation about the concentration of certain pheromones that are secreted by other C. elegans seeking to attract a mate,"" said Jagan Srinivasan, PhD, assistant professor of biology and biotechnology at WPI and a corresponding author of the new paper. ""The worm, essentially, calculates a derivative of the concentration curve and uses that information to decide where to move for the best chance at finding a suitable mate."" Noted Paul Sternberg, PhD, professor of biology at Caltech, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and co-corresponding author of the paper, ""our data imply that we found not only the primary sensor for these sex pheromones, but also an apparently novel mechanism of neural coding to efficiently process information."" This is Jagan Srinivasan, PhD, assistant professor of biology and biotechnology at WPI. Credit: WPI  An adult C. elegans is about 1 millimeter long and has approximately 1,000 cells, about a third of which are dedicated to their nervous system. Despite its small size, the worm is a complex organism able to do all of the things animals must do to survive, including foraging for food and seeking out mates, making it one of the most powerful research models in molecular biology. Most C. elegans worms are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, carrying both egg and sperm cells. Male worms account for less than 1 percent of the population. As hermaphrodites deplete their sperm cells they secrete pheromones to attract males. A male worm must mate with a hermaphrodite to fulfill its evolutionary goal of passing along its genes to the next generation. In the current study, researchers analyzed the electrical activity of four sensory neurons located near the male worm's head (two on each side). In a controlled environment, they released varying concentrations of the attractive pheromones and monitored the individual responses of the four neurons. Based on previous research in the field, Srinivasan and the team assumed the four anatomically identical neurons would respond the same way, at the same time, to the same environmental cues. Surprisingly, the sensory neurons reacted in very different ways, and for different durations, depending on the concentration of the pheromones and the synaptic activity with other neurons. In some cases, a neuron would react quickly to the scent of the pheromone, and in other cases the same neuron would essentially turn off and stop sending sensory signals, even in the presence of a heavy concentration of pheromones. ""Our data suggests a strategy for pheromones, where the same set of four (neurons) encode different concentrations in excitatory and inhibitory responses...,"" the authors wrote. ""Encoding different concentrations within a single neuronal class appears to be another method by which nematodes, with their compact nervous system, break symmetry to increase coding capacity,"" allowing the worm to glean more information from its environment than if the neurons simply switched off and on. Learn More: Infertile worms resist infection-induced neurodegeneration The team also found that the level of synaptic activity, meaning the communication between neurons, was related to the worm's decision to move toward a scent. In healthy worms, this sensory circuit led most of the worms toward an intermediate concentration of the pheromones, not the strongest concentration. High concentrations of the pheromones can indicate overcrowding or other stresses in the environment that make it less conducive to successful mating, the authors noted. Conversely, a small concentration of the scent would mean too few hermaphrodites were nearby to justify moving in that direction. When the team disabled three of the four sensory neurons, or purposely decreased the overall the level of synaptic activity, those worms with just one functional sensory neuron no longer showed a preference and instead moved directly towards any concentration of the pheromone. ""For the intact worm, there is an optimal concentration of the pheromones, and that can differ from one worm to another,"" Srinivasan said. ""You can think of it as a personal preference. It's not just a matter of following any scent, or the strongest concentration."" This newly observed circuit likely involves molecules called neurotransmitters that need to be further characterized, Srinivasan said. ""This opens up many new questions to explore, and we expect that some of the neurotransmitters involved may play a role in the human brain.""

Now, immunotherapy treatment that harnesses the patient's immune system to combat the disease represents the future of cancer treatment, with its efficacy being demonstrated in even the most aggressive types of cancer. Brain cancer comes in many forms, ranging from more easily treatable benign forms that may trigger gradual loss of brain functions, to malignant forms that can in many cases prove fatal. While there have been improvements in the current standard treatments, patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive form of brain tumor, still suffer from a median survival rate of only 14.6 months and 5-year overall survival rates of less than 10%. There is therefore pressing need for novel therapies that improve the outcomes.

A recent report published in Neuron has shown that cocaine administration increases dopamine levels in the striatum, activating a signaling pathway that was previously unknown. Dopamine activates a protein called PKA in striatal neurons, which activates many additional substrates to regulate neuronal excitability and control behavior. However, the identities of these PKA substrates are not known. Recently, a research team at Nagoya University has uncovered the answers. See Also: Sensation-seeking, reward sensitivity and early cannabis use ""We stimulated PKA in mouse brain slices to activate these unknown substrates,"" explains corresponding author Kozo Kaibuchi of the University of Nagoya's Department of Cell Pharmacology. His research team was able to extract these activated proteins from brain slices and identify them. ""Using this screening approach, we identified more than 100 candidate substrates of PKA,"" continues Kaibuchi. One of these novel candidates was Rasgrp2, a protein that is highly expressed in striatal neurons. Rasgrp2 positively regulates another protein called Rap1 and the authors were intrigued to find out whether Rap1 was activated by Rasgrp2 in striatal neurons. Through a range of experiments, the Nagoya research group found the answer; they demonstrated that cocaine treatment increased the phosphorylation of Rasgrp2 by PKA, which in turn activated Rap1 in striatal neurons. ""We speculated that the Rap1 pathway is involved in the regulation of neuronal functions by dopamine,"" says lead author Taku Nagai at the university's Department of Neuropsychcopharmacology. By measuring neuronal activity directly in mouse brain slices, Nagai and colleagues discovered that activated Rap1 can increase the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. In addition, the rewarding effects of cocaine were higher when Rap1 was activated in mouse brains.

The study identifies a new mechanism for controlling HIV replication and its interaction with the host immune system.  We and other colleagues at pharmaceutical companies have worked over the years to develop drugs targeting HIV s genetic material, its RNA, but we never made it to the clinic,  said senior author Tariq Rana, PhD, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  Now we know why   we were developing drugs using RNA targets that didn t have these modifications, when in reality the RNA was different.  In human cells, RNA is the genetic material that carries instructions from the DNA in a cell s nucleus out to the cytoplasm, where molecular machinery uses those instructions to build proteins. In contrast, HIV s entire genome is made up of RNA, not DNA. The virus hijacks its host s cellular machinery to translate its RNA to proteins. Cells can chemically modify RNA to control or alter its function. One of these modifications, known as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is common in humans and other organisms. But little was known about the role m6A plays in the human immune system, or in the interactions between our cells and invading pathogens, such as HIV. In the study, Rana s team discovered m6A modifications in HIV RNA for the first time. They also examined m6A s effect on function in both HIV and human host RNA during infection of human immune cells. ""M6A had always been considered a steady modification of cellular RNA. Instead, it turned out to be extremely dynamic and highly responsive to external stimuli, such as viral infections"" said Gianluigi Lichinchi, a graduate student in Rana s lab and first author of the study.  In the future, these findings could aid in improving the design and efficacy of HIV/AIDS vaccines.  One of the proteins encoded by HIV s RNA genome is Rev. After Rev proteins are built in the human host cell s cytoplasm, they move back into the nucleus, where they assemble at a particular point on HIV RNA called the Rev responsive element (RRE). There, Rev helps transport newly produced HIV RNA transcripts into the host cytoplasm. This is an essential step in viral replication. The team determined that m6A modification of both human and viral RNA influences the interaction between the HIV Rev protein and the RNA RRE. When the researchers silenced the enzyme that removes m6A from RNA, HIV replication increased. Conversely, when they silenced the enzyme that adds m6A to RNA, HIV replication decreased   a finding the researchers say could be exploited pharmacologically to combat the infection.  The HIV field has missed this modification in physiological RNA structure and HIV genome for more than 30 years,  Rana said.  I will not be surprised if other viruses with RNA genomes also exploit this m6A modification mechanism to evade immune surveillance and control their replication in human cells. These viruses include, for example, influenza, Hepatitis C, Ebola and Zika, just to name a few. ","Published: February 24, 2016"

Named AmBeR, the device could help patients with a number of chronic diseases and conditions who regularly need to check their ammonia levels through blood testing. The technology will allow patients to test their ammonia levels painlessly with greater accuracy, on a more frequent basis and even while at home when a self-testing version of the device is developed. Professor Killard, head of biomedical sciences at UWE Bristol, said:  Ammonia blood testing is inaccurate and ineffective. There are problems doing this with some conditions, especially where it involves children who have learning difficulties. With those types of patient, it is a major challenge.  This will give clinicians a tool they don't currently have and it changes where and how often they can do the testing. You can do a test every day if necessary or you could do a test at home   it's quite transformative.  No one has been able to do ammonia breath testing in a way which is accurate without using a large piece of equipment. There are instruments in existence which can do it but they are not economically viable. The AmBeR device will be more like glucose testing strips where you use the sensor test strip once and throw it away when finished. We are trying to make this a game-changer commercially.  Professor Killard, who has formed a company called BreathDX to market his innovation, has secured funding to explore the application of AmBeR in specific conditions. The device, which is smaller than a shoe box, is now in production and will go into clinical studies in May. Professor Killard said he was 'humbled' when he realised the impact his work could have. He said:  We went to some conferences and really saw the daily challenges people and their families with these conditions have. I was humbled by it. We had spent the whole time thinking about the scientific objective but then the human focus comes into sight and you start to think differently - about the value to other people.  With the feedback we had, we realised how important it could be to them   that places a responsibility on you to deliver something for them.  Professor Killard came up with the idea for the device while investigating new sensor materials based on novel nanomaterials technology. He developed a new ammonia sensing material using polyaniline, a polymer which can conduct electricity. By forming it into nanoparticles, he discovered it was extremely sensitive and be could deposited in very thin layers only thousandths of a millimetre thick using low-cost printing technology. Of his discovery, he said:  That was kind of the eureka moment. What we had was a cluster of new characteristics which allowed us to do new things we couldn't do before. Before, this material (polyaniline) was just a laboratory curiosity to scientists and you would play around with this stuff.  Now we are looking at commercialising it, which has always been key to our activities - having a societal and economic impact.  Professor Killard said the technology could eventually be used to measure other trace breath gases for the non-invasive monitoring of further diseases, including potentially diabetes.","Published: February 24, 2016"

Vaccines can go bad if stored improperly. If this happens and no one detects it, you run the risk of delivering ineffective vaccines to patients,  she explains.  The other danger is thinking that a vaccine goes bad when it doesn t. And if that happens then you waste the cost,* and you potentially delay vaccines getting to the intended patients.  Fortunately, a standard is on the way. Chojnacky is one of about 30 members of a multi-institution committee whose goal is to define a set of performance standards for vaccine refrigerators, freezers, and other storage devices, to help providers choose the best equipment for the job. The committee, formed in 2015 and run by NSF International (formerly the National Sanitation Foundation), includes representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state health department immunization programs, non-profit organizations, and vaccine storage equipment manufacturers.  It is not always clear whether a particular refrigerator or freezer will meet a health care provider s needs,  Chojnacky says.  The creation of an NSF standard for vaccine storage equipment will serve to demystify this selection process for the nurses, pharmacists, and other health workers who administer vaccines.  To create the new standard, the committee needs to know how providers use their vaccine storage units. But as it turns out, there are no reliable answers to even basic questions about daily usage. To give the committee some data to work with, Chojnacky and Alexandra Rodriguez, a third-year chemical engineering undergraduate student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Penn., have been conducting an exploratory study with a sampling of clinics around the country. They are asking a simple question: how often do vaccine providers open their refrigerator doors? Chojnacky and Rodriguez are completing round one of their study, which includes about 35 vaccine storage refrigerators from two dozen pediatric clinics around the country. The clinics were given a data logger per fridge. Each logger records when the refrigerator door is open using either a light sensor inside the fridge or, for glass-front units, a device that records when contact is broken between fridge and door. (The loggers do not document temperature changes.) Participants used the loggers for about 2 weeks each and filled out a questionnaire, which included information about the site and how many vaccines were distributed each day. Though their sample size is small, the information is already helping Rodriguez and Chojnacky refine their ideas for future studies. For example, the results so far show that in daily use, fridges are open for an average of 7 seconds at a time, which is less than they d expected. At the busiest of clinics, units were accessed as many as 33 times in one hour, though the average time between door openings was about 3 and a half minutes. Previously, the PML team had done some general temperature tests in which fridge doors were open for 30 seconds every five minutes. Using this new information, the PML researchers can repeat their tests in their own lab with what may be a more realistic open-door duration and frequency.  The strange and unique thing we found working on this was that there aren t   as far as we know   a lot of people doing testing like this,  Chojnacky says. Much more often, research is focused on pre-distribution vaccine environments, or strategies for keeping vaccines cold when no refrigeration is available. The NSF committee s ultimate goal is to create a protocol that will be used to test refrigerators and freezers to make sure they are appropriate for vaccine storage. Storage units that pass the tests would be granted an NSF certified seal. In March, the PML team will meet with the rest of the NSF committee to discuss their results and make plans for round two of the fridge door study, which will include vaccine storage units in commercial pharmacies and other types of outpatient clinics.","Published: February 24, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/lipidomics-could-bring-fast-cancer-diagnosis-199763, Lipidomics  Could Bring Fast Cancer Diagnosis Researchers have developed a new analytical tool for medical applications and biological research that might be used to diagnose cancer more rapidly than conventional methods  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The research has implications for the field of lipidomics, which involves the identification and quantification of cellular lipid molecules, how they interact with other components in cells and their role in biological systems. ""Lipidomics is a big field because changes of the lipid profile are related to the disease state or different stages of cells, so this is an important tool for either diagnostics or for systems biology,"" said Yu Xia, an associate professor in Purdue University's Department of Chemistry.  The new approach is the first to easily pinpoint the location of double bonds between carbon atoms in lipid molecules, allowing the identification of ""isomers,"" a capability that could lead to the early diagnosis of cancer.  ""The ratio of these isomers in normal tissue and tumor tissue can be different, significantly different,"" Xia said. ""The location of double bonds is related to the biosynthetic pathway, or how the lipid was generated in your body, and this is related to the disease status and also the status of the cell biology,"" said Zheng Ouyang, a professor in Purdue's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Chemistry and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The research paper was authored by postdoctoral research associate Xiaoxiao Ma; doctoral students Leelyn Chong and Ran Tian; Riyi Shi, a professor of neuroscience and biomedical engineering; Tony Y. Hu, an assistant professor of nanomedicine at the Houston Methodist Research Institute and the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University; Ouyang; and Xia. Lipids are important components of living cells and include fats, oils and waxes. They may exist as isomers, which have identical mass but possess subtle structural differences not easily detected by conventional analytical technologies. The new tool uses techniques called tandem mass spectrometry and the Patern B chi photochemical reaction. In tandem mass spectrometry, charged molecules are fragmented into pieces, which are then measured and identified by their mass. ""Mass spec shows isomers as exactly the same molecular mass, so you are not able to see how much of which isomers are in tissue. But now we have a way to solve that problem,"" Ouyang said. ""And we have found that the ratio of these isomers can be different between normal tissue and diseased tissue."" The researchers used a so-called ""shotgun lipidomics"" analysis enhanced by the Patern B chi photochemical reaction, which modifies double bonds into rings that can then be easily cleaved into two parts. This allows the bonds to be measured and identified using mass spectrometry. ""Then we can derive the location of the double bond,"" Ouyang said. ""That's why this reaction is so important."" The system was demonstrated with brain tissue from rats and also was applied to breast cancer tissue from mice. The researchers also used the method to study liver and kidney tissue and plan to include prostate cancer tissue in future research. This method has two primary benefits. ""One is as a new tool for biologists, to relate the isomeric ratio to the system biology and cell biology,"" Ouyang said. ""The second is to identify biomarkers for fast diagnosis of disease."" The method can be completed within hours, starting with small amounts of tissue - tens of milligrams - compared to weeks and hundreds of milligrams using conventional analytical techniques. ""More importantly, traditionally there has not been a good method for quickly distinguishing the unsaturated lipid isomers regardless of the amounts of tissue used,"" Ouyang said. ""We believe that the research community may now use this approach to discover biomarkers and eventually apply it to diagnosis."" Although the research was conducted using a conventional laboratory mass spectrometer, the same operation could be carried out with a new miniature mass spectrometer. Whereas conventional mass spectrometers are relatively heavy, bulky instruments, Purdue researchers have recently developed miniature mass spectrometers, including the Mini 12, which weighs 40 pounds, is 12.5 inches wide and 16 inches high. ""Direct analysis using ambient sampling methods will further speed up the analysis process from hours to a minute,"" Ouyang said. ""We want to apply this to imaging to study tissue, and we currently are integrating this method into miniature mass spectrometry systems. Eventually we hope to have biologists and medical professionals using it."" The system was used to identify 96 unsaturated fatty acids and glycerophospholipids in the brain tissue of rats, revealing that 50 percent of the lipids were mixtures of isomers characterized by the location of their carbon-carbon double bonds.","Published: February 24, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/measuring-oxygen-levels-in-3d-cells-200462,Measuring Oxygen Levels in  D Cells  Scientists at Plymouth University and AstraZeneca assessed the gradient of oxygen concentration within  D cell cultures  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) oximetry, scientists assessed the gradient of oxygen concentration within spheroids, 3D cell cultures typically used for testing the chemical toxicity within liver and tumour models. It had previously been suggested that the centre of spheroid cultures becomes devoid of oxygen leading to cell death that may limit their use, but until now there has been no way of measuring the precise levels. Work by PhD researcher Laura Langan and Senior Research Fellow Dr Nicholas Dodd demonstrated smaller spheroids with a diameter of less than 120 micrometres ( m), and containing fewer than 2,500 cells, lose less than 12 per cent of their oxygen concentration after one week decreasing to less than 50 per cent two weeks after their creation. Overall, the study recommends the use of smaller spheroids to allow comparable oxygen concentrations to native tissues, with scientists believing the research provides further evidence of the appropriateness of these in vivo studies as a tool to elucidate fundamental biological processes in the spheroid systems and aid in the reduction of whole animal experiments. The study was led by Professor Awadhesh Jha, from the School of Biological Sciences, andProfessor Simon Jackson, from the School of Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences, at Plymouth University. They said:  It is widely accepted that the biological activities present in spheroids more closely reflect key characteristics of the living organism, and as such may offer a more relevant alternative to in vivo exposure in biological research. EPR oximetry has provided insights into the size and cell seeding densities at which oxygen gradients play a confounding role in subsequent exposure applications and thus enable the wider use of the spheroid model to non-tumour based biological studies.  Over the past three decades, the use of three dimensional cell culture has gained increased recognition as an important tool in biological research and pre-clinical trials over conventional organs and animal models. Spheroids are one example of these, and are typically used to assess the chemical toxicity and evaluation of environmental samples in biological and ecotoxological studies. Plymouth University has previously perfected the technique of coaxing cells from the liver of rainbow trout and then manipulating them to form a three-dimensional spheroid. This ball of cells behaves much more like normal animal tissue than cells grown in traditional ways in the lab and so can give researchers a more accurate picture of how an animal s body would respond to a chemical in the environment.","Published: February 24, 2016"

A tumour's properties can be examined by injecting a small amount of sugar into it, and then measuring how much sugar the tumour consumes. The more sugar the tumour consumes, the more malignant it is. Linda Knutsson is working with a team from Johns Hopkins University in the USA, which has developed a new imaging technique for magnetic resonance tomography. The collaboration has resulted in the new imaging technique being combined with the testing of natural sugar as a replacement for metal in contrast agents. There is no similar clinical research in this area. It is the first time a non-synthetic contrast agent has been used in human magnetic resonance tomography examinations, and the results are promising. The uptake of sugar is higher in the tumour than in healthy tissue according to the results of tests carried out by Linda Knutsson and the Johns Hopkins team in the USA. The tests were carried out on three persons with a brain tumour and four healthy persons and published in the research journal Tomography in December last year. A more detailed study on a large group of patients is to commence soon in Lund. ""Metal-based contrast agents cost more than sugar-based agents. Accordingly, this could lead to a reduction in medical care costs,"" says Linda Knutsson. A disadvantage is that sugar-based contrast agents cannot be used in examinations of diabetes patients.","Published: February 24, 2016"

The phenomenon is known as reverse speciation and researchers witnessed it in Enos Lake on Vancouver Island where two similar species of threespine stickleback fish disappeared within three years.  When two similar species are in one environment, they often perform different ecological roles,  said Seth Rudman, a PhD student in zoology at UBC.  When they go extinct, it has strong consequences for the ecosystem.  Two species of endangered three spine stickleback fish lived in the lake. One lived in the middle of the lake and ate mostly zooplankton while the other lived closer to the shore, eating insects that spent their larval stage in the water. In the mid-1990s, crayfish were introduced to the lake. Between 1994 and 1997, researchers documented how both species disappeared as a result of interbreeding, leaving only a hybrid species. In this study researchers document how the shift from two distinct species to one hybrid species has impacted the ecosystem. The new stickleback fish does not perform all of the functions as its predecessors. The hybrid spends more time near the shore of the lake and eats more large insects. As a result, the number of small insects coming out of the lake has increased, showing how the changes in the lake can also cause changes to the terrestrial ecosystem. With the new hybrid, researchers have also found that the leaves that fall into the lake do not decompose as quickly. Rudman and co-author Dolph Schluter, a professor in UBC s department of zoology, said this is just one example of reverse speciation and that it is becoming a more common phenomenon, particularly in environments that have been altered by humans. They also say Canada is at greater risk for these events because  young species  are prone to reverse speciation.  Much of Canada s biodiversity, particularly fish in lakes and rivers, are considered to be  young  species that formed in the last 12,000 years or so,  said Rudman.  This type of evolution, known as reverse speciation, happens remarkably quickly and can cause alterations to the ecology of the ecosystem. It means we need to consider evolution in our conservation efforts. ","Published: February 24, 2016"

Other terms of the deal were not disclosed. ""As a company committed to innovation in the field of oncology, this collaboration with AbbVie enables us to use our proprietary companion diagnostics to advance care for patients with lung cancer,"" said Jerry Lanchbury, chief scientific officer, Myriad Genetics. ""If we are successful, our companion diagnostics will identify more patients who may benefit from treatment with the combination of veliparib and chemotherapy."" This expanded agreement builds on an existing companion diagnostic research collaboration established in November 2014, in which Myriad has been working with AbbVie to support Phase 3 clinical studies of veliparib for patients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Veliparib is an investigational oral poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor being evaluated in multiple tumor types. PARP is a naturally-occurring enzyme in the body involved in the repair of DNA damage to cells. Veliparib is being investigated in combination with DNA-damaging therapies like chemotherapy or radiation. Veliparib is currently being studied in multiple cancers and tumor types, including Phase 3 studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Veliparib is an investigational compound and its efficacy and safety have not been established by the FDA or any other health authority. Myriad's myChoice HRD is the first homologous recombination deficiency test that can detect when a tumor has lost the ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging drugs such as platinum drugs or PARP inhibitors. High myChoice HRD scores reflective of DNA repair deficiencies are prevalent in all breast cancer subtypes, ovarian and most other major cancers. In previously published data, Myriad showed that the myChoice HRD test predicted drug response to platinum therapy in certain patients with triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers. It is estimated that 1.8 million people in the United States and Europe who are diagnosed with cancers annually may be candidates for treatment with DNA-damaging agents.","Published: February 24, 2016"

""The answer to the question is usually 'no,' but there are exceptions,"" according to Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University.  An expert on the health impacts of fossil-fuel extraction, Jackson has studied groundwater quality at oil and gas fields throughout the United States.  ""We have found a number of homes near active wells with very high levels of natural gas in the tap water,"" said Jackson, a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and at the Precourt Institute for Energy. ""Where the chemistry suggests contamination, the problem usually lies with the integrity of the well, either the cementing used to isolate it from the surrounding rock and water or the steel casing that allows gas and oil to flow upwards."" Jackson recently presented his findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C. Most documented cases of groundwater contamination were the result of poorly constructed wells, he said, pointing to a widely publicized case in Parker County, Texas.  ""At that site, the company cemented very near the surface and deep underground, but they put no cement for 4,000 feet in between,"" he explained. ""The gap allowed gases to move up and down freely like a chimney and contaminate the drinking-water supply. Here we are five years later and we're still talking about it. That situation should have been fixed. These people have been left unprotected."" It is in the industry's best interest to address the contamination problem in Parker County, he added. Threats from fracking Besides structural issues, Jackson and his colleagues have identified problems associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking: pumping pressurized sand, water and chemicals underground to crack open rocks and release trapped reservoirs of oil and gas. Fracking wells are often installed a mile or more below the surface, far from underground sources of drinking water. But in a recent study, Jackson found that at least 2,600 wells in the United States have been fracked at depths shallower than 3,000 feet, some just hundreds of feet below the surface. ""We found a surprising number of places where companies are fracking directly into shallow freshwater aquifers,"" he said. ""In no other industry would you be allowed to inject chemicals into a source of drinking-quality water. Should it be allowed? In my opinion, no."" Jackson cited a high-profile case in Pavillion, Wyo., where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that shallow fracking operations had released natural gas and other toxic compounds into freshwater aquifers. ""At Pavillion, they were fracking less than 1,000 feet deep, while people were getting drinking water at 750 feet,"" Jackson said. ""Contamination is more likely to occur when there isn't enough separation between the hydraulic fracturing activity and the drinking-water sources."" Shallow wells in California In California, Jackson has identified hundreds of fracking wells drilled into aquifers located less than 2,000 feet below the surface. In the U.S., hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by individual states. ""Some states, like Texas and Pennsylvania, generally have pretty strong environmental regulations,"" Jackson said. ""Others, like West Virginia and Arkansas, don't. Only Texas and Colorado have restrictions or additional safeguards in place for shallow hydraulic fracturing."" The 2010 documentary Gasland sparked controversy with footage of a kitchen tap catching fire at a home located near a natural gas well. ""That doesn't happen often, but we have seen it,"" Jackson said. ""We've also documented peoples' water change from clean to contaminated over the course of a year."" Natural gas consists primarily of methane, a greenhouse gas that's more than 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Concerns about global warming and the potential impacts of natural gas on drinking water have led several European countries to take a much more cautious approach to hydraulic fracturing, Jackson said. ""In Germany, France, and many other countries, officials are under pressure to invest in solar, wind and other renewables instead of a technology that produces greenhouse gases,"" he said.","Published: February 24, 2016"

Plasticell will screen Pierre Fabre s  Nature Open Library  collection, one of the most important private plant libraries in the world numbering over 15000 phytochemical extracts, to identify natural products that increase the metabolic activity and other specific functions of BAT. In addition, Plasticell scientists may collaborate with Pierre Fabre botanists, phyto-chemists and regulatory specialists in the further development of products. The collaboration will focus initially on screening extracts derived from the edible parts of plants, with the aim of developing functional foods or nutraceuticals.  This first collaboration with  Nature Open Library  in UK demonstrates that our open innovation initiative can really promote new uses of plant extracts in many areas or domains, worldwide. We are confident and will do our best with Plasticell s team to succeed in this project . said Laurent Audoly Director R&D Pierre Fabre Pharmaceuticals.  Obesity is the leading preventable cause of death, however only a handful of drugs exist to treat this condition   these have at best modest efficacy and potentially serious side effects. We aim to discover safe natural products that act on a newly discovered subtype of adipose tissue to increase the body s energy expenditure, promoting weight loss without dieting and exercise , commented Dr Yen Choo, the Chairman of Plasticell. BAT is a highly specialised fat tissue that burns excess calories to produce heat. Though abundant in new-born babies, where it is essential to maintain body temperature, the levels of brown fat decline with age, making the tissue difficult to source for medical research. Using its stem cell differentiation platform (CombiCult ), Plasticell has developed a robust and highly efficient method of producing rare BAT cells directly from human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which are easily sourced and relatively abundant. Higher levels of BAT are correlated with leaner individuals and increased glucose tolerance, suggesting that BAT activation may protect against weight gain, obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.","Published: February 24, 2016"

When tragedy strikes and there are casualties, understanding the scent profile of decomposition may help to ensure resources are used in the right way. New research reveals the scent profile of decaying pig carcasses during the first 72 hours after death. By analyzing compounds present in decomposition odor, scientists determined that the odor profile changes drastically at the 43-hour mark. Their findings add to a growing body of research on the odor profile of decomposition. Following a mass disaster, urban search and rescue teams use human scent dogs that are trained to find survivors and human remains detection dogs that are trained to find dead bodies. Knowing the right time to deploy these dogs to look for survivors or remains can be challenging. One way to improve the efficiency of scent detection dogs is to recognize the change in the odor of a recently deceased victim. In the new study, researchers from the University of Technology Sydney analyzed the change in the odor of decomposition during the first 72 hours after death. Since pigs are physiologically similar to humans, the authors of the study conducted their research using pig carcasses. ""Our motivation for this study came from information local law enforcement agencies gave us about using scent-detection dogs to help them find living and deceased victims after mass disasters like earthquakes,"" explained Prue Armstrong, lead author of the study from the University of Technology Sydney. ""We hope our findings give rescue teams the information they need about the optimal time frame in which to deploy human scent dogs versus human remains detection dogs to best ensure the recovery of victims following a mass disaster."" Armstrong and her colleagues placed three domestic pig carcasses on the soil surface during the Australian summer and let them decompose naturally. They sampled the smell coming from the carcasses several times a day as they started to decompose. They used a relatively new technology called ""comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography - time-of-flight mass spectrometry"" (GC GC-TOFMS) to analyze the odor samples. The researchers identified 105 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contributed to the odor during decomposition. The VOCs they identified belong to several different chemical classes, and the most abundant contained either nitrogen, sulfur or ester compounds. The make-up of the VOCs changed by the hour, and the odor profile up to 43 hours after death was very different to the odor profile after 43 hours. The researchers believe 43 hours marks the point at which the odor changes from a ""living"" (antemortem) odor to a ""deceased"" (postmortem) profile. ""We were quite surprised to be able to identify so many volatile organic compounds during the early postmortem period,"" said Ms. Armstrong. ""We believe this was possible because we used GC GC-TOFMS to analyze our decomposition odor samples; previous studies using more simple chromatography techniques did not identify as many - or any - VOCs."" The researchers hope they will be helpful for rescue teams in disaster situations, and for other search and rescue scenarios such as the search for lost bushwalkers, or the search for hidden graves. While the findings are preliminary and only relevant to the environmental conditions under which this study was conducted, the researchers have since widened the environmental conditions in which the odor profile is analyzed. The team has conducted another trial of the same format during the Australian winter.","Published: February 24, 2016"

This new footwear analysis technique could also pave the way for other applications such as clinical studies of gait analysis or measuring how athletes interact with surfaces during high impact activities such as jumping, running or changing direction. We all have our own individual footprint Government policy, increasing crime rates and budget controls are increasing the pressure on forensics to speed up and make evidence gathering more efficient. So demand for low-cost imaging technology is increasing.  Much like fingerprints we all leave behind our own individual footprint. Our gait determines weight distribution as we walk. This, in turn, leads to specific wear and tear on the soles of our shoes. Conventional FTIR maps the imprint of bare feet on a hard surface by shedding light through a transparent sheet of material as the foot hits the ground and reflecting it back at an angle. Using the same technique Dr Sharp s research group has created more detailed images of the ridges on the sole of a shoe and how these contact a hard surface. Low cost, easy and quick Although specific wear patterns would not necessarily be able to identify a person as the perpetrator of a crime as readily as a fingerprint of DNA it could be used to link them, or at least their shoes, to a particular location-information that could be vital to those involved in law enforcement. Dr Sharp said:  This technique uses ideas taken from A level physics to form images of regions where shoes contact surfaces. The low cost and ease of implementation of the technique make it particularly appealing for forensic applications. We are currently in the process of working with local police forensic laboratories and the Home Office to try to develop this work further.  Practical applications for forensic services  Watch your step! A frustrated total internal reflection approach to forensic footwear imaging  was carried out in collaboration with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit   Forensic Services (EMSOU-FS). The EMSOU-FS were looking for a device that would allow them to collect images of contact regions of shoes to compare them with footprints at crime scenes   in much the same way as they compare fingerprints. Charlotte Chester, Footwear Service Delivery Manager, EMSOU Forensic Services said:  The EMSOU-FS Footwear Unit is excited to be working in partnership with The University of Nottingham to develop an innovative solution to a very practical problem. Between us there is real potential to develop a footwear imaging device that would have huge impact on the forensic footwear service EMSOU-FS can provide to the five East Midlands Police Forces, an impact which ultimately affects the outcomes of criminal investigations. As a partnership we hope to work closely in the coming months to produce and test a finished product within a criminal justice setting and leading innovation in the area at a national level.  Dr Sharp is one of a number of academics at The University of Nottingham providing criminal justice expertise.

See Also: Is the amyloid hypothesis the right path to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease? The researchers discovered this when Alzheimer s disease mice genetically modified to lack these key immune cells in their blood developed the distinctive brain plaques associated with the neurodegenerative disorder much more quickly. According to Mathew Blurton-Jones, assistant professor of neurobiology & behavior, and doctoral student Samuel Marsh, their findings could lead to the creation of new techniques to help identify, or perhaps even treat, individuals at risk of developing the disease. Alzheimer s is the leading cause of age-related dementia and is thought to be driven by the accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins that aggregate to form amyloid plaques in the brain. Microglia, immune cells that reside in the brain, attempt to clear this buildup, but in Alzheimer s, they appear to be fighting a losing battle. While many studies have explored the role of microglia in Alzheimer s, very few researchers have asked whether a different set of immune cells called T-cells and B-cells that reside outside the brain and play a large part in autoimmune diseases might also impact Alzheimer s. To test this idea, Blurton-Jones and Marsh bred genetically modified Alzheimer s disease mice to lack three key immune cell types: T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells. Six months later, when the brains of these mice were compared to those of Alzheimer s mice with intact immune systems, the scientists found a more than twofold increase in beta-amyloid accumulation.  We were very surprised by the magnitude of this effect,  Blurton-Jones said.  We expected the influence of the deficient immune system on Alzheimer s pathology to be much more subtle.  To understand how the loss of these immune cells was increasing beta-amyloid, he and Marsh examined the interactions between these peripheral cells and microglia within the brain. Learn More: Engineering self-assembling amyloid fibers  We found that in Alzheimer s mice with intact immune systems, antibodies which are made by B-cells accumulated in the brain and associated with microglia. This, in turn, helped increase the clearance of beta-amyloid,  Marsh said. To further confirm the importance of this interplay between immune cells in the blood and those in the brain, the researchers transplanted healthy bone marrow stem cells into the immune-deficient Alzheimer s mice. Since T-, B- and NK-cells develop from bone marrow stem cells, this transplantation led to a reconstitution of the missing immune cells. This allowed the B-cells to produce antibodies that once again reached the brain and aided microglia in eradicating the beta-amyloid.  We know that the immune system changes with age and becomes less capable of making T- and B-cells,  Blurton-Jones said.  So whether aging of the immune system in humans might contribute to the development of Alzheimer s is the next big question we want to ask.

Although researchers have long suspected links between sleep and depression, the new study published in PNAS is the first to identify a specific molecular-genetic mechanism connecting the two and has the potential to spur new treatments for seasonal depression. See Also: Genetic links to the seasonal clock Senior authors Ying-Hui-Fu, PhD and Louis Pt cek, MD, who are both professors of neurology in UCSF s School of Medicine, have been studying the genetic basis of sleep for decades, interviewing and genotyping hundreds of families with unusual sleep issues. They ve studied hyper-efficient sleepers who need just a few hours of shut-eye a night and people with major inherited sleep disturbances, as well as extreme night owls and irredeemable morning larks. Previously, the team had discovered various mutated genes that cause a rare sleep behavior in which people have a ""fast"" biological clock. People with this condition, called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP), go to bed as early as 7:30 p.m. and often wake up by 4:30 a.m. Now, by studying three members of a family in which many members experience both FASP and seasonal depression, also called seasonal affective disorder (SAD),  the researchers have identified a specific gene mutation that occurs in family members who experience both conditions, suggesting that the gene PER3, a member of the Period family of circadian genes appears to sit at the nexus of sleep and mood.  This is the first human mutation directly linked to seasonal affective disorder, and the first clear sign of a mechanism that could link sleep to mood disorders,  Pt cek said. SAD is one of the world s most common mood disorders, affecting approximately 3 percent of Americans and as many as 9 percent of the population in countries of far northern and southern latitudes, where the shortening of winter days is more extreme. It is not yet known why some people are particularly sensitive to the shortening winter days, but the brain s light-sensitive circadian clock is thought to be a factor. Previous research has pointed to a link between sleep and depression more generally: Patients suffering from major depression often begin to sleep much more or less than usual, while disturbed sleep can also be a risk factor for developing depression.  So far, the evidence has all been circumstantial,  Fu said.  These were all clues, but it was still a big puzzle.  To understand how the mutated version of PER3 affects circadian rhythms and depression in the wintertime, Fu and Pt cek introduced the mutated form of the gene found in the human FASP family into genetically engineered mice and simulated the effects of changing seasons by altering the length of  day  and  night  mice experienced in the lab. Learn More: New  reset  button discovered for circadian clock Remarkably, the mutant mice behaved in many ways like humans with FASP, appearing quite normal when day and night were equal, but shifting their circadian rhythms and developing mild depression-like symptoms when exposed to 4-hour days and 20-hour nights. This shadow of human seasonal depression became even more extreme in the mice when the researchers deleted the PER3 gene completely, but they responded well to antidepressant drugs. The researchers acknowledge that it s impossible to determine if a mouse is actually experiencing  depression  like a human with SAD would.  Of course, we can t do an interview. There s no questionnaire we can give,  Pt cek said. On the other hand, he said, long-established rodent corollaries of depression   like giving up quickly when placed in adverse circumstances  are still a useful research tool to hint at how this gene may impact mood in humans. Related: Researchers untangle the biological effects of blue lightTo find out how the mutated PER3 gene might actually impact circadian rhythms and mood at a cellular level, the team introduced the mutation into isolated cells in petri dishes, where they found that the mutated gene produced significantly less PER3 protein than the normal gene. Among the many likely domino effects of this change, the researchers say, is the destabilization of the related PER2 protein, which is known to set the 24-hour period of the biological clock. Loss of this protein, the researchers reasoned, is likely what speeds up the circadian rhythms of in the FASP family.   Why the PER3 mutation affects mood remains an open question, however, one which the researchers are eager to follow up in their seasonally-sensitive mutant mice by studying how brain circuits known to be connected to mood and depression are impacted when the mice are exposed to either long or short days.  It s an exciting time,  Fu said.  People have known for decades that light and mood were linked, but this is our first real finger-hold on the problem.

But when someone behind you says your name, you hear it and quickly turn in that direction. The same sort of thing happens with bats, leading Johns Hopkins University researchers to discover how a bat's brain determines what's worth paying attention to. The findings, which have implications across animal systems, were published this month online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. See Also: New insights into underlying cellular mechanisms of information processing ""With so many stimuli in the world, the brain needs a filter to determine what's important,"" said Melville J. Wohlgemuth, the lead author and a postdoctoral fellow in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. ""The bat brain has developed special sensitivities that allow it to pick out sounds from the environment that are pertinent to the animal. We were able to uncover these sensitivities because we used the perfect stimulus the bat's own vocalizations."" To navigate as they hunt in the dark, bats use echolocation. This means that bats make certain high frequency sounds as they fly and then listen for echoes bouncing off objects in front of them to orient themselves. The bat pays attention to some of these echo sounds, but not all of them, researchers say. Wohlgemuth and co-author Cynthia F. Moss, a Johns Hopkins professor and neuroscientist, wanted to figure out which sounds would be deemed ""important"" enough to evoke responses from neurons that are involved in orienting behaviors, such as turning towards a sound. The researchers experimented with five big brown bats, playing them a variety of sounds while monitoring their midbrain activity. They played recordings of natural chirps, the actual sounds bats made as they hunt. They also played artificial white noise and sounds between the two extremes. All of the sounds were identical in amplitude, duration and bandwidth. Although sensorimotor neurons in the bat midbrain reacted to all of the sounds, the neurons involved in stimulus selection, those that guide orienting behaviors, responded selectively to a subset of the natural chirps. Learn More: Insight into organizational principles of sensory cortex ""That's really important because it showed that if a neuron reacts to all stimuli, any sound in the environment, it doesn't do an animal any good,"" Wohlgemuth said. ""You need the selectivity."" Because all mammals share a basic brain organization, these findings suggest for the first time how mammals, including humans, likely choose which stimuli deserve attention. ""Bats produce the sounds that guide their behaviors, and consequently, we know what signals are important to them,"" Moss said.

New findings by researchers at University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine report that not only is rehabilitation vital   in an animal model, rats with cortical injury that did not receive intensive rehab did not rebuild brain structure or recover function   but that a longer, even more intense period of rehabilitation may produce even greater benefit. See Also: Link between intensive post-stroke rehabilitation and recovery demonstrated in rats  This has implications for medical practice and medical insurance,  said senior study author Mark Tuszynski, MD, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurosciences and director of the Center for Neural Repair at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and a neurologist with the VA San Diego Healthcare System.  Typically, insurance supports brief periods of rehab to teach people to get good enough to go home. These findings suggest that if insurance would pay for longer and more intensive rehab, patients might actually recover more function.  In recent years, numerous studies have documented the surprising plasticity or ability of the adult central nervous system to recover from injury. The emerging question has been how to best encourage the repair and regrowth of damaged nerve cells and connections. To better understand what happens at the molecular and cellular levels and how rehabilitation might be made more effective after brain injury, researchers studied rats relearning skills and physical abilities. They found rats that received intensive therapy for an extended period of time showed significant restructuring of the brain around the damage site: Surviving neurons sprouted greater numbers of dendritic spines, which made more connections with other neurons. The result, said Tuszynski, was a dramatic 50 percent recovery of function. Animals that did not undergo intensive rehabilitation did not rebuild brain structure or recover function. Learn More: Scientists find brain plasticity assorted into functional networks Additionally, the researchers found that a key system in the brain the basal forebrain cholinergic system is critical to rehabilitation. Structures in this part of the brain, such as the nucleus basalis, produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Specifically, motor neurons release acetylcholine to activate muscles. Damage to the cholinergic system, which can occur naturally during aging, completely blocks brain plasticity mediated by rehabilitation and significantly reduces functional recovery. Tuszynski said the finding suggests that a class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors, which boost the levels and persistence of acetylcholine and are used in some treatments for Alzheimer s disease, might further improve functional outcomes after brain injury.  We did not try to do this in our study,  said Tuszynski,  but we did suggest future studies could be done to look at this possibility.

Desktop Genetics will use the funds to develop software tools that selectively design CRISPR/Cas9 targets against cancer cell lines that are characterized at the epigenetic level, with the objective of improving chemotherapy and overcoming drug resistance. Professor Bob Brown, who leads the Epigenetics Unit of Imperial College London, will use this novel approach to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underpinning resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer cell lines. The CRISPR software tools that Desktop Genetics will develop as a result of this project, aim to combine data-driven, intelligent, predictive biomodelling capabilities with the analysis of heterogeneous genomic and epigenomic data. The novel approach taken by Desktop Genetics will be to translate omics-based information, such as whole genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets, into precise CRISPR targets. The Epigenetics Unit will provide biological evidence that this model-driven tool can be used to identify, target and functionally study DNA regions that are critical to cancer progression and drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Given the key role of epigenetics in all tumor types, this research has wide potential applications across all histological types of cancer.  Leigh Brody, PhD, Director of Genomic Services at Desktop Genetics, commented:  There has been a great deal of excitement over the potential to use CRISPR in the clinic. We hope that an integrated omics approach to epigenetic CRISPR will support target validation of small-molecule therapies modifying the epigenetic landscape.  Professor Brown, Chair of Translational Oncology in the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London commented:  This project will combine the best elements of epigenetic research, bioinformatics and CRISPR to create a tool that solves a real problem in the field of oncology. We have recently shown specific epigenetic differences in ovarian tumors that respond poorly to treatment compared to those that do respond [1]. The approach of epigenetic editing using CRISPR can potentially target precise epigenetic changes in a personalized manner to specific genes to make tumor cells more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs. Such targeting will avoid some of the non-specific side effects in cancer and normal cells caused by current epigenetic therapies.   References 1: Bonito NA,et al.

The use of sonographically guided Botulinum Toxin Type A (Dysport) injections into the Tensor Fasciae Latae for the treatment of Lateral Patellofemoral Overload Syndrome (LPOS). This type of chronic knee pain, lateral patellofemoral overload syndrome (LPOS), is believed to affect up to one in five of the active population and can be caused by under-use of the buttock muscles (gluteal) and over-use of the muscles at the front of the hip (tensor fascia lata). Symptoms include inflammation and a sharp localised pain which can take many days to recover from.  This is the first trial of its kind in the UK and has proved that treatment with botulinum toxin can provide better and longer lasting pain relief than conventional therapies. One injection and a few weeks of physiotherapy will see nearly seven out of ten sportsmen and women with this knee condition return to an active life, free from pain , said Mr Sam Church, Consultant Knee Surgeon, Fortius Clinic, London. The study involved injecting Dysport, a type of botulinum toxin, into the hip muscle to  switch it off  for 12 weeks, so the buttock muscles (glutes) were forced to work harder and thus enable physiotherapy to have a greater effect on the affected knee area. Patients involved in the study underwent at least six weeks of personalised physiotherapy treatment, following the initial injection.  Many of the patients enrolled in our study had exhausted all other treatment options and this was their last resort. By  switching off  the hip muscle, the effects of physiotherapy on the glutes and knee were greatly enhanced following a single injection of a type of botulinum toxin,  explained lead author of the study, Dr Joanna Stephen, researcher at Fortius Clinic and Imperial College. Andy Goode, former England rugby professional, who has come out of retirement to play for Newcastle Falcons explained:  I had the injection treatment at Fortius two years ago when I had chronic knee pain mid-season and it enabled me to carry on playing week-in week-out, without pain. I retired from professional rugby because of shoulder and knee injuries and thought my rugby days were over forever. But when I got offered a fantastic opportunity of playing for Newcastle, I knew this treatment was my only chance. I returned to my knee specialist, Mr Church at Fortius, and now I m back in the game and winning big points for the Newcastle Falcons . Preliminary investigations had shown that the patients displayed a weakness in their buttock (gluteal) muscles and had long-standing pain. To compensate for this weakness, more effort was being placed on the muscles at the front and side of the hip. This imbalance at the hip in turn altered the loading at the knee, which created persistent pain brought on by activity. Symptoms included pain at the front or on the outside of the knee which manifests during activity. Up to 80% of this population continued to have symptoms five years after conventional (physiotherapy and steroids) treatment. Lateral patellofemoral overload syndrome (LPOS) affects people from a host of sporting activities including running, cycling, horse riding, football, tennis, rugby, gym work outs and many others. LPOS is known to affect more female athletes (1 in 5) than male athletes (1 in 8) but the cause is not yet defined. The research of 45 adults from across the UK started seven years ago at Fortius Clinic and was conducted in conjunction with Imperial College, London.","Published: February 23, 2016"

The finding fills a need identified by the World Health Organization, which in 2014 challenged researchers to develop better diagnostic tests for active TB. WHO estimates that 9.6 million people got sick with TB in 2014 and that 1.5 million people died of the disease that year. Yet it remains difficult to diagnose.   One-third of the world s population is currently infected with TB. Even if only 10 percent of them get active TB, that s still 3 percent of the world s population   240 million people,  said Purvesh Khatri, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and senior author of the paper. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as the skin prick test and interferon assays, can t separate patients with active TB from those who are no longer sick or have merely been vaccinated against TB (and most countries vaccinate everyone against TB). These older diagnostics can miss a case of TB in patients with HIV. A sensitive test A common way to test for TB is to look for the disease-causing bacterium in sputum samples coughed up by patients. But sometimes it s hard for people to produce sputum on demand, said research associateTim Sweeney, MD, PhD, first author of the paper.  If someone can t produce adequate sputum, or if you have a kid who can t follow directions,  it s hard to diagnose them, he said. And the sputum test is almost useless for monitoring how someone is responding to treatment. As people start to get better, they can t produce sputum for the test. The new test developed in the Khatri lab works on an ordinary blood sample and removes the need to collect sputum. It can signal a TB infection even if the individual also has HIV. And it won t give a positive response if someone only has latent TB or has had a TB vaccine. It also doesn t matter which strain of TB has infected a person, or even if it has evolved resistance to antibiotic drugs. The test works in both adults and children. WHO has called for a test that would give a positive result at least 66 percent of the time when a child has active TB. The Khatri test is 86 percent sensitive in children. And if the test comes up negative, it s right 99 percent of the time. That is, of 100 patients who test negative with the Khatri test, 99 do not have active TB. The requirements of the test are simple enough that it can potentially be done under relatively basic field conditions in rural and undeveloped areas of the world. Any hospital should be able to perform the test. Villages without electricity could likely use ordinary blood samples and a solar-powered PCR machine, which multiplies strands of DNA, to accurately test people for active TB. Chain reaction When pathogens infect the cells of the body, the infection sets off a chain reaction that changes the expression of hundreds of human genes. Khatri s team identified three human genes whose expression changes in a consistent pattern, revealing the presence of an active tuberculosis infection. The team validated the new three-gene test in a separate set of 1,400 human samples from 11 different data sets, confirming the diagnostic power of the test. The new test not only accurately distinguishes patients who have active tuberculosis, it could also be used to monitor patients to see if they are getting better and how well they are responding to different treatments. Thus, it can be used not only for diagnosis and to inform treatment, but also to study the effectiveness of different treatments. The test s hugely accurate negative response would be especially helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatments during clinical trials, said Khatri. He has already begun collecting funding to develop the test for widespread use, both to diagnose TB in patients and to monitor recovery in clinical trials, allowing for more rapid development of better and cheaper treatments. The work is an example of Stanford Medicine s focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.","Published: February 23, 2016"

We developed a mathematical model to estimate the rates of mutation as a function of the nearby sequences of DNA  letters  -- called nucleotides -- in the human genome,  said senior author Benjamin F. Voight, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics and the department of Genetics.  This new model not only provides clues into the process of mutation, but also helps discover possible genetic risk factors that influence complex human diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder.  This study focuses on the probability that any given nucleotide in the human genome -- one of the four letters (A, C, G or T for adenine, cytosine, guanine or thymine) of the DNA alphabet -- is changed. Voight focused on the simplest type of mutation, a  point  mutation in which a single letter is changed in a given sequence. Most of these changes -- often called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or  snips  -- are usually not harmful to the functioning of the human body. Nevertheless, Voight examined why some sequences are more prone to mutate, whereas others are not.  The crux of the paper examines the dependency of mutation rate on which nucleotides are one, two, or three bases away from either side of a SNP,  Voight said.  We already know about one situation in which this placement matters: DNA sequences in the genome where methyl groups are attached to the cytosine nucleotide, also known as CpG sites, are hotspots for mutation. But are there other types of local sequences that matter beyond these?  To address this question, Voight and graduate student Varun Aggarwala, a doctoral candidate from the Genomics and Computational Biology graduate group, devised a mathematical model applicable to SNP data found in humans. Their approach took advantage of publicly available data from thousands of human subjects sampled from across the globe, namely from the 1000 Genomes Project. These individuals were sequenced as part of an international initiative to characterize the genetic variation that naturally occurs in human populations. What they found was surprising: Knowing the three nucleotides flanking either side of a given SNP, for a total of seven nucleotides, predicted up to 93 percent of the variability in the chance of finding a SNP in a given sequence in individuals whose genome sequences are in the 1000 Genomes Project database. In addition, their model uncovered several distinctive sequences of local nucleotides that were not previously known to be prone to mutation.  It turns out there are indeed DNA sequences beyond CpG sites that are also prone to mutation,  Voight said.  What is not immediately obvious is why. The initial rates and our model need to be investigated more deeply to decipher the basic mechanisms that induce mutation in human genomes.  Another finding questioned the assumption that methylated CpG sites always have the same rate of mutation.  I think it is commonly assumed that all CpG sequences mutate at the same rate, though our results indicate far more variability that we expected,  Voight said. Using another publicly available database that measured the methylation states at CpG sites across several individuals, Voight and Aggarwala found that the frequency in which different sequence contexts were methylated could not fully explain differences in mutation rates at these sites.  This certainly indicates the possibility of additional genetic mutation phenomenon at CpG hotspots that change how prone these sites are to mutate, for example how well DNA-repair machinery can correct new mutations that might arise,  Voight said. Beyond gleaning clues for different ways mutations occur, Voight and Aggarwala also examined applications of their model to human disease, providing ways to rank which newly discovered mutations identified from clinical genetics studies are the most likely to result in disease. Computational predictive measurements such as these are used to help prioritize rare or new gene variants discovered from these studies for follow-up investigation. Voight and Aggarwala focused on a set of autism sequencing studies by looking for genes with an excess of new mutations in children with autism not otherwise found in parents. When they applied their model to these data, they found an improvement over existing methods for predicting which rare or new mutations were associated with human disease.  We were able to refine the focus somewhat on likely pathogenic variants for follow-up work, though we ll need quite a bit more work to correctly pinpoint the right variants and genes for autism or even Alzheimer s disease where sequencing data is readily available,  Voight said. He credits not only the large amount of publicly available data, but careful and dedicated efforts over an extended period as major contributing factors to be able to evaluate and refine their proposed mathematical model.  The exciting part of this work is not just what we ve found, but the spectrum of new questions that we will be able to systematically address in the next few years. While building solid foundations takes time, the next set of scientific  skyscrapers  built on these foundations will absolutely persist longer and reach higher as a result.

A Berlin research group led by Wolfgang Uckert, Thomas Blankenstein and Matthias Leisegang has been collaborating with U.S. researcher Hans Schreiber in a project to use immune components called T cells to target mutant proteins produced by cancer cells. T cells are ""special forces"" of the immune system that patrol the body and are equipped with T cell receptors molecules. The receptors scan the surfaces of all body cells for protein fragments called antigens. Antigens are produced within cells and are usually derived from pathogens. If their foreign origins are recognized, T cells will kill these cells. Antigens may also arise from abnormal proteins resulting from mutations in the genes of cancer cells, which may also be recognized as ""foreign"" by T cells. Even though T cells migrate into tumors and potentially can recognize their antigens, the defense mechanism seems to fail during the formation of tumors. T cells in the tumors are usually inactive and therapeutically almost useless, Matthias Leisegang says. ""But it is possible to obtain fresh T cells from a patient's blood and transfer tumor-specific T cell receptors into them,"" Leisegang says. ""The transfer of the T cell receptor is carried out using genetically modified and functionally inactivated viruses that can insert their genetic material into millions of T cells. When these modified cells are infused into the patient, they are able to fight the tumor."" Hans Schreiber's research team at the University of Chicago analyzed gene therapy with T cell receptors in mice. The scenario mirrored the situation that would be faced in the clinic. First the scientists analyzed the genes of an individual mouse tumor. They identified a mutation that occurred in all regions of the tumor and also found its way to the surface as an antigen. T cells were taken from the mouse, armed with a T cell receptor that would target this antigen, and were then administered to the animal. The cells almost completely destroyed the tumor. However, T cell therapy had to be combined with local radiation to eliminate the tumor in the long term. The results of the study were published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research. Now the Berlin researchers show the importance of preliminary animal studies to ensure the final success of mutation-specific therapies. Even if some mutations appear to be suitable targets for therapy after tests in cell cultures, they can have disappointing results in the real context of a patient's body. The research group of Thomas Blankenstein and Wolfgang Uckert were able to analyze the antigens and clearly distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" T cell targets by using a humanized mouse model. ""This means that we have developed an animal model to test the therapeutic suitability of T cell receptors and antigens, which is an important prerequisite for clinical applications,"" Leisegang said. Although the efforts of Matthias Leisegang and his colleagues to train immune cells to fight cancer by targeting mutations were successful in mice, he emphasized that the patient individualized treatment is not yet ready for use in humans. Clinical tests based on similar methods are currently underway, but so far targeting only antigens without mutations. In those cases, the T cells may also attack healthy tissue. Targeting cancer-specific mutations, the researchers say, would cause fewer side effects. But the new method is also much more complex because it has to be individualized for each individual patient. With support from the BIH, the groups are now working with other teams at the MDC and Charit  to apply their research to the clinic.","Published: February 23, 2016"

Nutlins, which are in early clinical trials for treating blood cancers, sparked interest worldwide for their ability to stop cancer growth by activating the body's natural cancer-suppressing mechanism - a gene called P53 - while at the same time avoiding some of the damaging effects of chemotherapy. However, until now, it was unknown whether nutlins were killing the cancerous cells, or just suppressing them temporarily. Dr Liz Valente, Dr Brandon Aubrey, Professor Andreas Strasser and colleagues from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute have found the answer to the long-standing question of how nutlins work by discovering that nutlins cause cancer cells to self-destruct and not just go to 'sleep'. The research, published in the journal Cell Reports, revealed that nutlins activated P53 to trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) of blood cancer cells. This was identified through the presence of a protein called PUMA. Dr Aubrey, who is also a clinical haematologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery not only reinforced that nutlins were a promising new treatment for blood cancer, but also that it provided invaluable information for a more tailored approach to patient care. ""Our findings will help identify which patients are most likely to benefit from nutlins and which types of cancers are most likely to respond to nutlins as a treatment,"" Dr Aubrey said. ""Understanding in detail how the drugs work will help in the design of better clinical trials and bring the world closer to more precise and personalised medical treatments for cancer."" Professor Strasser said previous research around P53 showed the gene was like a natural 'guardian' of healthy cells in the body and was a major barrier to developing cancer. ""When functioning properly, P53 is activated in response to early cancerous changes in the cell,"" Professor Strasser said. ""P53 acts by either halting the cell while repairs are made or by forcing the cell to die if it cannot be repaired. ""Without the 'help' of P53, a damaged cell can be allowed to multiply, leading to cancer development. P53 lies dormant in many types of cancer - that do not have mutations in P53 - and the nutlins work through re-awakening its activity."" Professor Strasser said knowing more information about what nutlins were capable of by identifying how nutlins were activating P53 to trigger cell death in cancers was a critical step towards developing more sophisticated treatments for cancer. ""By understanding how nutlins are killing cancer cells, we can begin to formulate their best possible use, including choosing the best partner drugs to combine the nutlins with,"" Professor Strasser said. Dr Aubrey is a PhD student at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute enrolled through The University of Melbourne's Department of Medical Biology. Professor Strasser is a joint division head in the Molecular Genetics of Cancer division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. The research was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Cancer Council Victoria, the Leukaemia Foundation of Australia, the Victorian Cancer Agency and the Victorian Government Operational Infrastructure Support Scheme.

Leading microbiome researchers recently came to UC San Francisco to share the newest insights about how improving our relationship with our bodies  microbial ecosystems could be the next big breakthrough in treating metabolic disease. One major theme of the symposium   hosted by the University of California Sugar, Stress, Environment, and Weight (SSEW) Center   was the question of whether the troubling modern epidemic of metabolic disease may arise in part because our civilization has not been kind to our microbes.  In Western industrialized nations, we have dramatically changed our interaction with microbes in last several decades,  said Susan Lynch, PhD, who studies links between the microbiome and chronic inflammatory diseases at UCSF.  Particularly in urbanized areas, we have less contact with the soil and with animals. We have changed our diets dramatically and waged war on our microbes with antibiotics.  The idea that changes in modern lifestyle have increased our risk of disease by altering our microbiomes is still fundamentally hypothetical, but animal studies do suggest that altering the microbiome can have significant physiological effects. For instance, when researchers give lean mice gut microbial transplants from either a skinny donor or an obese donor, the ones that received an  obese  microbiome began to put on excess body fat. Many of the environmental factors that researchers worry may be harming our microbiomes are difficult to change, but the symposium speakers emphasized that there s one way we can all affect our microbes immediately: our diet. The foods we eat are thought to give competitive advantagesto certain species of microbes in our gut, especially those that digest complex carbohydrates, according to UCSF microbiologist Peter Turnbaugh, PhD.  As a result,  he said,  your gut microbes are what you eat.  In a recent study, Turnbaugh and his colleagues placed human volunteers on either a plant-based or animal-based diet and found that eating only meat, eggs and cheeses for just five days resulted in reduced numbers of many of the volunteers  fiber-digesting bacteria. Other studies have found that high-fat diets promote the growth of bacteria that may cause inflammatory bowel disease. In mice, such so-called  Western  diets significantly change microbial diversity throughout the digestive tract within just a day. However, Turnbaugh cautioned that firm links between diet, microbes and disease have yet to be proven.  Many diseases have recently been linked to the microbiome, including metabolic syndrome, malnutrition, inflammatory bowel disease and even cancer,  he said.  The next step will be to test whether these diet-dependent changes we see in the microbiome are actually contributing to these diseases.  In the meantime, researchers expressed hope that our growing insight into how our diets shape our microbiomes could be used to design simple dietary interventions to improve our health.  The microbiome is not static, but malleable,  said UCSF pediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig, MD, MSL, who recently demonstrated that just 10 days without sugar could significantly improve metabolic health in children.  This growing body of research suggests that what you eat could change your gut microbiome, and therefore change your risk of disease,  he said.  It turns out there are many opportunities to change the microbiome and potentially improve your health,  saidElissa Epel, PhD, director of SSEW and the UCSF Center for Obesity, Assessment, Study and Treatment (COAST), which co-sponsored the symposium.  As our understanding grows, the invisible world of the microbiome is becoming tangible.  Following December s symposium, Epel and her SSEW Center colleagues announced plans to lobby their home universities to adopt bans on sugar-sweetened beverages, such as the one that has been in place at UCSF since July 2015.  As we learn more and more about how what we eat affects our health,  Epel said,  We agreed that it s time for us all to take action in our own communities. ","Published: February 23, 2016"

By homing in on two proteins that allow pathogenic yeast called Candida glabrata to evade standard antifungal treatment, the team found a compound that prevents the proteins from interacting with each other and re-sensitizes the yeast to the antifungals in animal models.  We found the Achilles heel in the drug resistance pathway,  said Haribabu Arthanari, lecturer on biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at HMS and one of three senior authors of the study. Although only a small percentage of compounds that show promise in preclinical studies ultimately become successful treatments in humans, the findings offer a potential solution for treating C. glabrata.  Eventually this may help save lives, and I would be very happy if it succeeds in doing so,  said co-senior author Gerhard Wagner, the Elkan Blout Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at HMS. The work provides evidence that, despite previous skepticism from some scientists, proteins that activate gene transcription can be targeted by drugs.  We have identified a weak link in a gene activation pathway that could be therapeutically exploited,  said Anders N r, HMS professor of cell biology at Mass General and the third co-senior author of the study.  This approach may potentially be applied to other transcriptional regulatory pathways implicated in human diseases.  Flushed away People with Candida infections are typically given antifungal drugs called azoles. But with increasing frequency, the yeast cells are able to make molecular pumps that flush out the drug. C. glabrata is especially resistant to treatment. The HMS and Mass General team wanted to prevent production of the so-called efflux pumps. One way to do it was to disrupt the pathway that turns on the pump genes. When azoles enter a resistant yeast cell, a sentry protein in the nucleus called Pdr1p senses the drugs and recruits a large protein complex called Mediator. Together, they switch on the efflux pump genes by allowing RNA polymerase II to read the genes and start efflux pump production. In 2008, the HMS and Mass General team discovered that Mediator attaches to Pdr1p via a specific structure called KIX and found that by genetically deleting the KIX structure they reduced the yeast s efflux pump production. This gave researchers a potential drug target. Weakest link In the new study, Arthanari, working closely with Andras Boeszoermenyi, HMS research fellow in the Wagner lab, used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to gain a detailed molecular understanding of the KIX structure. Solving the structure allowed them to devise a method to search a library of 150,000 small molecules for one that would attach to KIX and thus prevent Mediator from binding to Pdr1p breaking the chain of events that activate the efflux pumps. They got a hit. Joy Nishikawa, HMS instructor of cell biology in the N r lab and first author of the paper, along with colleagues in Switzerland, Italy, Bulgaria and India, conducted in-depth functional studies to evaluate the compound in antifungal-resistant yeast. They revealed that the compound was able to lower drug resistance in yeast cell cultures and in animal models of fungal disease. The compound didn t have much effect on its own, nor did azoles alone. But when the two were given in combination, the efflux pumps didn t turn on and the yeast succumbed to the azoles. The researchers named the compound iKIX1, short for  inhibitor of KIX, compound number 1.  Hope for human health The next step, Arthanari said, is to use chemistry to improve iKIX1 to make it a better drug candidate and then advance it to human clinical trials as a combination therapy with existing azoles. Drug-resistant C. glabrata often have mutations in the PDR1 gene that permanently turn on their efflux pumps. The researchers hope that compounds such as iKIX1 that target multidrug resistance will ultimately help treat infections such as these, where even high doses of azoles alone don t work. More broadly, the work opens the possibility of targeting other transcription activators associated with human disease. The team is now exploring whether it can take a similar approach to find inhibitors of a human protein that turns on cholesterol and fat genes.  Such compounds could serve as novel therapeutics for cardio-metabolic diseases and cancers,  N r said.","Published: February 23, 2016"

Those that manage to escape the immune system can be killed by antibiotics, but bacteria are becoming more and more resistant to more and more antibiotics.  Meet Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a bacterial predator that is an efficient killer of Gram-negative bacteria, such as the prevalent E. coli bacterium. It is present in soil and, just like E. coli, it can also be found in the human gut, where a complex ecosystem of bacterial inhabitants exists. This ferocious bacterial predator enters its prey and devours it from the inside while dividing into four or six progenies. It then bursts open its prey and starts its hunt for the next. B. bacteriovorus is a formidable opponent: It is not only an efficient killer, but it is also extremely fast. Although the bacterium itself is hardly one micrometer long, it can reach speeds of 160 micrometers per second, making it the ""world champion"" in speed swimming and ten times faster than the E. coli. ""Knowledge of defense and attack mechanisms in bacteria is crucial for future development of potential alternatives to antibiotics,  explains Dr. Daniel Koster, from the department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. ""B. bacteriovorus kills bacteria by a whole different mechanism of action than classical antibiotics, and as such, predatory bacteria might in the future constitute a viable alternative to these antibiotics,"" Koster says. Koster led the research together with scientists from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at TU Delft in The Netherlands. In order to understand how E. coli is able to survive in the presence of such an effective predator, the researchers created two different environments for the bacteria. The first one mimicked the micro-scale features of soil, consisting of 85 chambers, each 100x100x15 micrometers in size, linked by a narrow channel. The second environment was an open space of a similar size, without the thin channel. These environments were made in a controlled fashion using micro-fabrication techniques. The team of researchers, comprised of experts from various fields -- from microbiology to nanotechnology, from ecology to biophysics -- published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: In the open environment, which can be compared to a bare open surface, E. coli did not stand a chance to survive. Most of the population was eliminated within a couple of hours.  But it proved surprisingly able to maintain a healthy population in an environment with many small chambers. Koster explained how E. coli was able to survive in the fragmented environment:  It seems that groups of E. coli  hide  in the many corners of the fragmented environment, where they readily stick as bio-films that probably protect them against B. bacteriovorus. Our findings provide important information because in natural environments, such as our gut, the bacterium also lives in fragmented spaces.  It is not yet known precisely how E. coli is able to defend itself against predatory bacteria, but the research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of the predatory bacteria, which could become a possible alternative to antibiotics in the future.  In the future, predatory bacteria might for example be genetically modified to specifically target harmful bacteria, while leaving benign bacteria untouched. As such, B. bacteriovorus might be more selective than the antibiotics currently in use, and anti-bacterial treatment might not require the widespread extermination of the gut flora that is of importance to human health.""","Published: February 23, 2016"

As demand for such equipment grows, EPFL researchers have developed a low-cost and portable microfluidic diagnostic device. It has been tested on Ebola and can be used to detect many other diseases. Over the past several years, microfluidic devices have shown extraordinary potential in the area of diagnostics. They are composed of silicone rubber with minuscule channels the width of a hair. Microfluidic devices, and can rapidly detect a number of different biomarkers in very small quantities of blood. At EPFL, a new type of microfluidic platform has come out of the Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization (LBNC), headed by Sebastian Maerkl. It is a portable device that runs on battery power and is completely self-sustained. It operates seamlessly with inexpensive microscopes and provides very high levels of accuracy and detection. The platform, which is described in a recent ACS Nano article, can quantify up to 16 different molecules - or biomarkers - in a tiny amount of blood (less than 0.005 milliliters). The biomarkers are usually enzymes, proteins, hormones or metabolites and the concentration of these molecules in the blood provides precise information on the patient's health condition. Two detection readouts in one platform The device is unique in that it is composed of both analog and digital detection mechanisms, while conventional devices hitherto only integrated one or the other. Digital detection is highly sensitive and can detect the presence of a single biomarker. However, it is less effective when the concentration of biomarkers is too high, due to signal saturation. Analog measurements, on the other hand, function best at higher biomarker concentrations. Using these two detection mechanisms simultaneously, the composition of a drop of blood can be thoroughly analyzed in a short amount of time. The analysis provides precious medical information: it could help doctors make an early diagnosis or determine the stage of a disease. Initial testing has been successfully carried out on a sample containing anti-Ebola antibodies, which indicate the presence of the virus in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The device could potentially work with a large number of other protein biomarkers and molecules. No need to pre-treat blood samples There is more good news. Researchers at EPFL found that they could load the blood sample directly onto the device and perform on-chip biomarker quantitation without requiring any sample pre-treatment. ""For researchers, it is quite interesting to be able to avoid having to separate the blood,"" said Francesco Piraino, the article's lead author. Blood plasma separation requires centrifuges, large volume samples and a long processing time. For diagnoses in resource-limited regions  Says Piraino: ""The platform will lead the development of new kinds of tests to meet the increasing demand for on-site diagnostic testing. It will prove very useful for medical staff working in resource-limited regions."" The device could, for example, be used to monitor endemic, epidemic, and pandemic disease outbreaks.","Published: February 23, 2016"

In the OPuS-2 study, HAE patients with a historical attack frequency of greater than 0.45 attacks per week were randomized to treatment with either 500 mg or 300 mg of avoralstat, or placebo, administered three times daily for 12 weeks. The primary goals of the trial were to characterize the efficacy of avoralstat in reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of avoralstat treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was angioedema attack frequency. Thirty-eight subjects received avoralstat 500 mg, 36 subjects received avoralstat 300 mg, and 36 subjects received placebo. Treatment with 500 mg and 300 mg of avoralstat three times daily failed to demonstrate a statistically significantly lower mean attack rate versus placebo. The mean (standard deviation) attack rates per week were 0.63 (0.57) on avoralstat 500mg, 0.71 (0.66) on avoralstat 300mg, compared to 0.61 (0.41) on placebo.

Our other opportunity to achieve higher exposure of an oral kallikrein inhibitor is with BCX7353 - we expect results from the BCX7353 APeX-1 dose ranging study in HAE patients by year end."" Secondary efficacy endpoints included measures of quality of life, attack duration and attack severity. Statistically significant improvements in duration of attacks and in the Angioedema Quality of Life total score, and its domains, were observed comparing the 500 mg three times a day avoralstat arm to placebo.

According to ESCMID experts, researchers need to find evidence on how the Zika virus affects the body, why it is spreading rapidly in the Americas, how else it can be transmitted apart from mosquito bites, and whether it is linked with congenital defects in babies and nervous system diseases. Published late last week, researchers including the ESCMID network discussed the rapid spread of Zika virus in the Americas and concluded that the virus and other arboviruses may not only pose a threat to residents of Brazil, but also to attendees of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games in Rio de Janeiro. Meanwhile, ESCMID researchers are also working hard on the development of better diagnostic tools and on improving the monitoring of the virus  spread, as they are preparing for a possible outbreak in Europe and the return of the virus to the African continent where it was first isolated in the Zika Forest inUganda in 1947. An international research team led by Prof. Eskild Petersen from Aarhus University in Denmark   executive committee member of the ESCMID Study Group on Infections in Travellers and Migrants (ESGITM)   and Prof. Alimuddin Zumla, University College London, United Kingdom, published the review on the Zika virus in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The paper concludes that  molecular analyses of the virus are most urgently needed to understand whether a change in the virus can explain the rapid spread and the association with microcephaly in babies exposed to the virus during pregnancy.  Research into rapid diagnostics, treatments and vaccines are underway, the review authors said. Specific and rapid diagnostic tests for the virus will allow better surveillance and assessment of the risk for microcephaly, Guillain-Barr  syndrome, and other complications, Prof. Petersen explained.  The emergence of Zika virus soon after the Ebola outbreak is yet another reminder for the urgent need for a coordinated global effort to have sufficiently resourced rapid response groups for proactive surveillance and conduct of priority research in emergency situations, Prof. Petersen concludes. Prof. Hakan Leblebicioglu, chairperson of ESGITM, added: ""Emerging and re-emerging infections usually arise from resource-limited countries and since the infrastructure for diagnostics is not well-established, the timely diagnosis and control of outbreaks are usually late. For this reason, an international collaboration for capacity building of the laboratories and technology transfer is essential."" ESGITM board member Dr. Nick Beeching from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine notes that Aedes mosquitoes are widespread in the tropics, including both Aedes aegypti, implicated in the outbreak in Latin America and Aedes albopictus, which is increasingly found in southern Europe. These mosquitoes are already responsible for huge epidemics of fevers due to dengue and chikungunya viruses in the tropics and for smaller outbreaks in Italy and France, so there may be potential for transmission of Zika in parts of Europe too. It is not known whether other types of mosquito that are more common in Europe can act asvectors for Zika virus and research on this is urgently needed. Dr. Beeching points out that only one in five people infected with the virus show any symptoms, so that many people will be unaware that they have been infected. He thinks it is very likely that the virus will return to sub-Saharan Africa soon, as it is already present in an archipelago just off the coast of Western Africa, in the island country Cape Verde.  The next stage for the virus might be to move from Cape Verde to Guinea-Bissau, and from there to neighbouring countries in West Africa. It could also be exported to Madeira, which is part of Europe, and which experienced a dengue fever outbreak in 2012, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that were already established there.  Dr. Beeching speculates. One of the main questions to be answered is why the virus was able to spread so rapidly now and why such huge outbreaks did not occur before. The problem with current prevention techniques is that researchers are working with empirical and epidemiological data, and until the RNA of the virus is analyzed   which will take several months   we will not know if it is a mutation in the virus or other factors that play a role in the apparent increased occurrence of microcephaly and Guillain-Barr  syndrome in the affected regions, according to researchers. Investigations into the associations with central nervous system complications may prove particularly important, including follow-up of patients and babies born to infected mothers to detect other possible sequelae.For European residents there is an infection risk if they travel to affected countries or if they have unprotected sexual contact with someone who has recently returned from an affected area. There is also a risk from transfusion of blood donated by those recently infected. Perhaps more alarming would be if the virus manages to reach southern Europe. Experts are concerned that countries like France, Spain and Italy, which in the past have registered cases of dengue transmission, may be at risk. Dr. Rogelio L pez-V lez, ESGITM member from the Spanish national referral centre for tropical medicine of the Hospital Ram n y Cajal in Madrid, added  Even in Brazil 25% of the cases of microcephaly showed no symptoms of Zika. If the virus spreads to Africa and Southern Europe, we urgently need rapid diagnostic tests and more information on how long the risk of microcephaly exists after infection. For now however, particularly among female migrants from South America or Europeans visiting Latin America, we need to ensure they remain vigilant when travelling between the two continents.  ESCMID researchers also support monitoring of the virus outbreak. The society is a partner in the PREPARE project, where researchers develop tools including clinical research protocols and case report forms, which are systematically used to collect essential data and laboratory results for clinical studies on the virus. In cooperation with PREPARE, ESCMID organizes an educational course entitled PREPAREing for (Re-)Emerging Arbovirus Infections in Europe from 7   9 March 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece.","Published: February 23, 2016"

This analysis, entitled Gas Sensor Technology & Market, announces a US$ 920 million market in 2021, with +7.3% CAGR during the 2014-2021 period.  An upside market of almost $65 million in 2021 is possible if gas sensors are widely adopted in consumers products,  adds Dr Benjamin Roussel, Activity Leader, Medical Technologies at Yole. Consumer applications including wearables and smartphones are driving new gas sensors development to reduce cost, power consumption and size, especially with MEMS technologies. According to Yole gas sensors are part of the combo sensors family: not only considered as a product itself, gas sensors are more and more combined with other sensors and so increase the functionalities and value of the system. The  More than Moore  market research and strategy consulting company Yole, proposes a clear understanding of gas sensor applications through an outstanding segmentation. Aim of this new report is to provide technical and economic requirements per market segment. Moreover, within this new report, Yole reviews several scenarios for the integration of gas sensors in smartphones. Air quality is becoming a major concern, and therefore gas sensors are increasingly attracting interest. Gas sensing technologies are not new:  Gas sensors embedded in gas detectors for defense and industrial safety applications form a highly regulated and mature market , explains Dr Eric Mounier, Senior Technology & Market Analyst, MEMS & Sensors at Yole. And he adds:  But the growing awareness of the air quality is creating new applications and opportunities.  These include gas sensors in consumer products like home devices, wearables and smartphones, or for buildings and cars, including indoor/in-cabin air quality monitoring. According to Yole s team, there are numerous drivers that will contribute to the gas sensor market growth:  Driven by better energy management, the building market will experience 13.6% CAGR for a total market estimated at US$237 million in 2021.   The medical industry is looking for very high sensitivity for asthma attack sensors or oxygen sensors for breath control.   Consumer applications such as wearables and smartphones are driving the development of new gas sensors to reduce cost, power consumption and size with MEMS technologies.   Driven by the desire for better outdoor air quality control, the environmental market will grow at almost 19% CAGR.  The transport market is driven by oxygen sensors and future depollution applications. The consumer market is very attractive as it can drive very large volumes depending on user case adoption, cost and technical maturity,  comment Dr Roussel. The smartphone industry has revolutionized the sensor industry as mobile applications today aggregate ever more sensors. Gas sensors could be the next to be integrated in smart phones and/or wearables. As Yole s analysts believe that user cases are crucial for wide adoption of gas sensors in consumer products, they have built a list of potential applications and benchmarked them. Yole s gas market report describes in detail three different scenarios for the consumer application:  Realistic scenario: for the next few years, Yole s team foresees slow adoption of gas sensors by mobile manufacturers. Only Tier 2 and 3 smartphone manufacturers will embed gas sensors in mobiles.  Optimistic scenario: Yole assumes integration of gas sensors in a major smartphone model in 2016 and growing adoption for the next five years. This scenario is dependent on technical maturity and cost. At Yole, we think that there are still some required improvements: reducing the cost and form factor for optical-based solution, increasing the sensitivity for semiconductor-based solutions  are part of the challenges,  details Dr Mounier from Yole.  Rollercoaster  scenario: Yole simulates integration of gas sensors in a major smartphone model in 2016. But, one year later, the sensor will be removed by the company due to the absence of a clear user case. This case study is similar to the adoption and removal of the humidity sensor in the Samsung Galaxy S4.

For labs undertaking purification using Normal Phase HPLC, SFC or Flash chromatography   removal of organic solvents can be simply, productively and safely carried out in a Genevac centrifugal evaporator (EZ-2, ROCKET, Rocket Synergy or HT Series III). Where the nature of the sample being concentrated can lead to solvent bumping (e.g. natural products) - Genevac's DriPure  technology is proven to completely eliminate this troublesome and time-consuming problem. The evaporation of aqueous acetonitrile (or methanol / ethanol) fractions resulting from Reverse Phase HPLC is a widely carried out application on many Genevac evaporator systems. A multiple stage method has been developed for the EZ-2 evaporator to remove the organic solvent without freezing the water, remove the water, and then dry any remaining stubborn solvent. Alternatively, the unique LyoSpeed  fast lyophilisation method can be used in Genevac HT series evaporators to produce dry (solvent-free) powders from samples that previously could only be produced as gums and oils. Recent advances in condenser technology, in particular the high power -75 C cold trap, available on HT Series III and Rocket Synergy evaporators, has led to significant advances in lyophilisation success rates. During post purification handling - samples typically need to be reformatted from fraction tubes or flasks, into a small vial for compound storage.

The company believes that it can rapidly advance a vaccine candidate to human clinical testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the Zika virus and its suspected complications in newborns an international public health emergency. The Zika epidemic, currently in 24 countries in the Americas, is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito and is expected by the WHO to reach most of the Western Hemisphere, infecting up to 4 million people by year s end. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel advisory for people traveling to regions within the Zika virus outbreak, which include popular vacation destinations. Brazil, the site of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, is included in the advisory. More than 30 cases have been reported in the United States, imported by travelers visiting affected regions. Zika virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. There is an alarming association between Zika infections and severe birth defects, including over 4000 cases of microcephaly in Brazil since fall 2015, 270 of which show confirmed evidence of infection. Microcephaly is a congenital condition marked by an abnormally small head and incomplete brain development. A potential link to Zika infection is also suspected in adults diagnosed with Guillain-Barr  syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis. Other than mosquito control, no approved preventive or therapeutic products are currently available to fight Zika infections. Public health officials recommend avoiding exposure to Zika, delaying pregnancy, and following basic supportive care after infection. A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent a Zika pandemic. GeoVax s Senior Vice President of Research and Development, Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, will lead the company s effort in developing a Zika virus vaccine. Dr. Guirakhoo played pivotal roles in the development and licensure of human vaccines against Flaviviruses including dengue and Japanese encephalitis. His extensive experience and expertise with Flavivirus vaccine development gives the company an advantage over competitors and will shorten the time until a Zika vaccine can be brought to market by GeoVax and its partners. Dr. Guirakhoo stated,  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to develop a Zika vaccine. We will draw on lessons learned on the decades-long path to a successful dengue vaccine and develop a vaccine against Zika in the shortest time possible.  Robert McNally, PhD, GeoVax s President and CEO, commented,  We believe our MVA-VLP vaccine platform is uniquely suited to apply to the Zika virus. Our platform has been proven to produce in vivo non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) for both our HIV and Ebola vaccines, and we are confident we can demonstrate the same with Zika. Producing VLPs in the very person being vaccinated mimics a natural infection, stimulating the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system to recognize, prevent, and control the target infection. As an additional advantage, our vaccine platform has already been proven safe in humans through multiple clinical trials involving over 500 individuals in our HIV program.  GeoVax has also entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with the University of Georgia to speed development of the vaccine. UGA infectious disease researchers, led by Ted Ross, PhD, director of UGA s Center for Vaccines and Immunology, will develop vaccine antigens that elicit broadly reactive immunity against Zika viruses from different lineages and test those vaccines in pre-clinical models. Ross, professor and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Infectious Diseases at the College of Veterinary Medicine, joined UGA last fall.  Our group in the Center for Vaccines and Immunology has been focusing on developing vaccines to emerging viral agents. We are excited to partner with GeoVax and merge our technologies to develop an efficacious vaccine against Zika virus,  said Dr. Ross.","Published: February 23, 2016"

This represents a follow-on investment from the Foundation based on the achievement of predefined, success-based milestones with the development program for a novel pneumococcal vaccine based on Affinivax s Multiple Antigen Presentation System (MAPS) platform. Proceeds from the funding will be used by Affinivax to advance its lead MAPS vaccine targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) towards clinical testing. Affinivax is utilizing its novel Multiple Antigen Presentation System (MAPS) vaccine technology, developed initially at Boston Children s Hospital, to develop and commercialize a MAPS vaccine targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae. MAPS overcomes the limitations of current conjugate vaccine technology, in which protection is limited to only 13 pneumococcal serotypes (or strains). In addition to offering a much simpler and cost-efficient manufacturing process, the MAPS vaccine is designed to provide broader protection against both invasive disease as well as colonization and disease transmission   offering the potential to protect against all pneumococcal serotypes. These advantages have been confirmed in early product development and preclinical testing.  This additional investment from the Gates Foundation validates the excellent progress we have made since we founded the company last year,  said Steven B. Brugger, CEO of Affinivax.  Based on the robust data from preclinical trials, demonstrating protection against both invasive disease and colonization, we will now advance our final vaccine candidate towards IND submission and proof-of-concept in clinical testing. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the Gates Foundation to develop vaccines that can have a potential global impact on infectious disease.  Affinivax received an initial $4 million investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in October 2014 which was announced in conjunction with the launch of Affinivax. Proceeds from the initial funding, along with the additional investment announced today, will be used to develop Affinivax s MAPS technology platform and enable the development of novel vaccines for global impact to protect children and adults in both the developed and developing worlds, with an initial focus on the company s lead pneumococcal vaccine. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a bacterium frequently found in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children and adults, and can cause serious infections ranging from pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, representing a major global health problem. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.6 million people, including more than 800,000 children under 5 years old, die every year from pneumococcal infections, with most of these deaths occurring in low-resource countries. The U.S. Center for Disease Control estimates that about 900,000 cases occur in the U.S. alone, resulting in up to 400,000 hospitalizations and 50,000 deaths annually.

In fact, when the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), were eliminated after 10 days, the risk of metastasis of the primary tumor to the lungs and bones of mice increased dramatically. Scientists used bioengineered CAFs equipped with genes that caused those cells to self-destruct at defined moments in tumor progression. The study, published in Scientific Reports on Feb. 19, was conducted by researchers funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). NIBIB is part of the National Institutes of Health. What causes cancer to grow and metastasize is not well understood by scientists. CAFs are thought to be fibroblast cells native to the body that cancer cells hijacks and use to sustain their growth. However, because fibroblasts are found throughout the human body, it can be difficult to follow and study cancer effects on these cells.  This work underscores two important things in solving the puzzle that is cancer,  said Rosemarie Hunziker, Ph.D., program director for Tissue Engineering at NIBIB.  First, we are dealing with a complex disease with so many dimensions that we are really only just beginning to describe it. Second, this approach shows the power of cell engineering   manipulating a key cell in the cancer environment has led to a significant new understanding of how cancer grows and how it might be controlled in the future.  Biju Parekkadan, Ph.D., assistant professor of surgery and bioengineering at MGH, and his team designed an experiment with the goal of better understanding the cellular environment in which tumors exist (called tumor microenvironment or TME), and the role of CAFs in tumor growth. In an effort to understand whether targeting CAFs could limit the growth of breast cancer tumors implanted in mice, they bioengineered CAFs with a genetic  kill switch.  The cells were designed to die when exposed to a compound that was not toxic to the surrounding cells. Parekkadan and his team chose two different stages of tumor growth in which the CAFs were killed off after the tumor was implanted. When the CAFs were eliminated on the third or fourth day, they found no major difference in tumor growth or risk of metastasis compared with the tumors where the CAFs remained. However, there was an increase in tumor-associated macrophages   cells that have been associated with metastasis   in this early stage. When the team waited to eliminate the CAFs until the 10th or 11th day, they discovered that in addition to the increase in macrophages, the cancer was more likely to spread to the lungs and bones of the mice. The unexpected results from this experiment could spur more research into the role of CAFs in cancer growth and metastasis.  The simplistic thinking about CAFs is that we should probably try to destroy them,  said Parekkadan.  There is evidence to support this idea, and until recently, I would have been in that camp as well. But now when looking at the selective removal of CAFs over time using this engineered approach, these results may be a signal that we should more fully investigate the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment and the timing of intervention in cancer treatment.  More research may reveal whether or not there is a scientific basis for targeting CAFs for destruction   and if so, the awareness that timing matters when it comes to the response of the tumor. While neither treatment affected the growth of the initial tumor, it is important to understand that most cancer deaths result from metastases to vital organs rather than from the direct effects of the primary tumor. This work was also funded by a training grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, also part of NIH. NIBIB s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. The Institute is committed to integrating the physical and engineering sciences with the life sciences to advance basic research and medical care. NIBIB supports emerging technology research and development within its internal laboratories and through grants, collaborations, and training. The NIDDK, part of the NIH, conducts and supports basic and clinical research and research training on some of the most common, severe and disabling conditions affecting Americans.

RayCare  is a next-generation OIS that is designed to meet the future challenges of cancer care. In this partnership, RayCare  will enable UCSF Radiation Oncology to push the envelope in delivering world-class, highly specialized cancer care. At the same time, important input will be provided for the development of RayCare . RayCare  will support complex procedures and analyses that are out of reach with current information management systems. UCSF has ongoing projects on genomics and big data, which strive to increase knowledge about cancer and cancer care. The RaySearch/UCSF partnership is intended to develop a step-wise and comprehensive approach to provide data infrastructure to be used for clinical decision support and individualization of cancer care within radiation oncology. If the collected data is sufficiently structured, advanced tools for analyzing enormous amounts of data, so called big data analysis, can help discover new causal relationships, such as between genomic profile, delivered dose and outcome. RayCare  will become a key component in collecting and structuring treatment and follow-up data and enable pooling of data and analysis using other systems. In delivering a complete cancer treatment, hundreds of steps have to be performed by a team of several different specialists, all in a carefully orchestrated fashion. To increase efficiency and safety, it is necessary for RayCare  to present the right amount of information in an intelligible way and allow the users to take necessary action with minimal effort. Streamlining the usability of RayCare  is an integral part of the partnership. Another key feature of RayCare  is to optimize the use of resources in the clinic. The resources include treatment machines, accessories and imaging systems, etc., as well as human resources represented by physicists, therapists, oncologists and other members of the care team. The choice of, for instance, treatment technique, target localization and treatment delivery system determines the resource requirements while also influencing the treatment plan quality. RayCare  is built to integrate resource utilization, plan quality assessment and scheduling in one system.  UCSF is an ideal partner for this exciting project. It is not only a world-leading institution in terms of quality of care, UCSF Radiation Oncology also offers a diverse environment of treatment machines and other systems, making it a formidable proving ground for RayCare . But perhaps even more important is the inspiration and motivation we get from working with the devoted and skilled team at UCSF,  says Johan L f, CEO of RaySearch.  There is a strong need for a new approach to information management within cancer care. The Radiation Oncology department is a natural place to start this development since we are involved in cancer treatment for virtually all types of cancer. Already today, Radiation Oncology has a very complex flow of information, which is difficult to manage with current systems. Our goal is to find a system that will provide higher efficiency in our clinic and enable us to support future initiatives within adaptive radiation therapy and precision medicine that would otherwise be impossible,  says Catherine Park, M.D., professor in residence and Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology, UCSF.","Published: February 23, 2016"

The URMC signed a three-year agreement with Indivumed; financial details were not disclosed. Approximately 15 other research institutions have formed similar partnerships with the company including Georgetown University s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington, D.C., the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, and several medical centers in Europe enabling a worldwide network for researchers to access the biological specimens.  Collecting and properly preserving human tissue is critically important to cancer research, but it s difficult to fund and requires a specialized set of skills and expertise to build such a program,  said David C. Linehan, M.D., the Seymour I Schwartz Professor and Chair of the URMC Department of Surgery, and director of clinical operations at the Wilmot Cancer Institute. Linehan will be the supervising investigator for the URMC-Indivumed partnership.  Our collaboration allows this to occur in an organized, coordinated way that will benefit all cancer researchers here at Wilmot and the URMC,  Linehan said. Top-quality tissue-banking is an invaluable resource for both cancer treatment and research. When it comes to deciding on cancer treatment, more often doctors are considering a tumor s unique gene characteristics and whether those pathways can be targeted with newer drugs. But in order to run the sophisticated tests that reveal a cancer s precise genomic fingerprint, very high quality tumor specimens and tissue samples must be properly preserved with protocols designed to support genomic analysis. And in cancer research, it s challenging to collect and reproduce meaningful data without a reliable bank of tissue that has been preserved in a consistent way. Importantly, Linehan said, the URMC-Indivumed tissue bank will include information that correlates with patient survival, response to treatment, and whether the tumor was resistant to certain therapies, for example.  This partnership allows us to engage in precision medicine in a much more substantive way,  said Stephen Dewhurst, Ph.D., Vice Dean for Research at the UR School of Medicine and Dentistry.  Indivumed is a world-class operation and is very interested in collaborating with our researchers to drive innovation. By participating in the Indivumed global network, we ll have access to a critical mass of biological samples and clinical data for use in unique clinical trials for our community.  The program starts immediately, and includes collection of many types of cancerous tissues such as pancreatic, colorectal, lung, and breast. Wilmot patients will be asked to consent to having their tissue included in the bank for research purposes.  Attaining individualized cancer diagnosis and treatment for every patient based on reliable clinical data and molecularly intact bio specimens is our goal,  said Hartmut Juhl, M.D., founder and CEO of Indivumed, and a cancer researcher.  Our tool for achieving this goal is the establishment of a unique cancer data base using molecular information from tissues collected under stringent protocols. The University of Rochester Medical Center and its Wilmot Cancer Institute are world leaders in cancer research and clinical-care delivery and the perfect partners to change the paradigm in cancer research, making possible precision medicine for all patients.  Added Carolyn Compton, M.D., Ph.D., chair of Indivumed s scientific advisory board, chief medical officer of the National Biomarker Development Alliance and a former director of the National Cancer Institute Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research:  We are facing a crisis of global proportion in the clinical and scientific community regarding reproducibility of biomedical research data, to which wide variability in the collection and utilization of biological samples for research contributes. Factors such as how long it takes to freeze samples after they are removed from the body can affect both molecular composition and quality of a tissue sample being studied. The URMC and Indivumed have positioned themselves well through this collaboration to address this most important challenge to scientific and clinical innovation. ","Published: February 23, 2016"

Their results showed for the first time that giving ASX to mice for four weeks promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampus in a concentration-dependent manner, and elevated the learning and memory capacity of the hippocampus. See Also: Large doses of antioxidants may be harmful to neuronal stem cells With the recent rise in popularity of naturally-derived supplements to maintain a healthy body, there has been a great deal of attention toward development of the so-called ""brain foods"", which can enhance brain function. Of particular importance is the natural red pigment astaxanthin, abundant in both salmon and in crustaceans such as shrimp and crab. ASX has a powerful antioxidant effect, and it holds promise as a next-generation natural supplement. ASX is capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier,entering the brain, where it acts directly on nerve cells. ASX is also known to have a neuroprotective effect in neurological animal disease model. However, there are many unanswered questions as to the effects of ASX on hippocampal function, especially whether or not it can increase the neuroplasticity of the hippocampus. When the research team investigated the molecular mechanism of the ASX activity on the hippocampus using high-throughput DNA microarray technology and bioinformatics analyses such as IPA, it brought to the fore specific molecular pathways that could contribute to improved memory capacity.

Senses such as smell or sight can help guide us to good food sources, but the final decision to eat or reject a potential food is controlled by taste. While the tongue is the main taste organ in humans and other mammals, insects not only have taste organs inside their mouthparts, but also on the body. Their legs, wings and ovipositor (the organ with which females lay eggs) can contain taste receptor neurons. See Also: Fruit flies remember a good meal The need for so many taste organs in insects is not understood very well. However, a clue for understanding their function comes from examining the anatomy of the taste-sensing neurons. These neurons send projections to different parts of the central nervous system of the fly. This suggests that taste information received from different parts of the body is processed differently in the brain. Therefore, different taste organs may have different functions. Left: Sweet taste neurons in the fly brain (upper panel; blue) and ventral nerve cord (lower panel; blue). Leg neurons initially project to the ventral nerve cord and can be grouped into two classes. One class terminates in the ventral nerve cord (yellow in lower panel) whereas the other continues projecting to the brain (red in upper and lower panel). Sweet taste neurons from the mouthparts can also be seen (yellow in upper panel). Right: Schematic of the function of leg neurons. As soon as a fly steps on food, sweet taste leg neurons terminating in the ventral nerve cord stop movement, while the brain-projecting neurons initiate feeding. Credit: Vladimiros Thoma  To test this idea, Thoma et al. used the fruit fly Drosophila as a model for insects. With Drosophila, it is possible to target small numbers of neurons and to block them or activate them with genetic tools. The scientists blocked different groups of sweet-sensing neurons and measured sugar choice, the first step in feeding behavior. Normally, hungry flies choose sugar very quickly, but the flies which had all sweet-sensing neurons in their legs blocked could not choose sugar. The scientists then examined the sweet taste neurons in the legs and found two populations of neurons. One group of neurons connected directly to the brain of the fly. The remaining neurons connected to the ventral nerve cord, a structure analogous to the spinal cord in humans. Learn More: Cracking the function of the fly olfactory system to understand how neural circuits work The researchers blocked each population separately and found that they have specialized functions. While the brain-projecting neurons are important for the initiation of feeding, the ventral nerve cord-projecting neurons are important for stopping the fly's movement as soon as it steps on food. Both of these functions are important for correctly choosing sugar. These results show how feeding, a complex behavior with many steps, is organized by the specialized contributions of different groups of neurons. The role of the taste neurons in other organs is only partially understood, but it is possible that they are important for the later stages of feeding. Additionally, popular insect repellents such as DEET rely on chemicals that smell and taste bad to insects. Therefore, a better understanding of insect choice behavior and feeding may also contribute to the development of more effective pest control. Tohoku University  press release Thoma V et al.

An article by Ruhr University Bochum (RUB) philosopher Prof. Dr. Albert Newen provides the answer. See Also: Brain balances perception and action when caught in an illusion There is a thing on the desk. It is open, grey on the outside and black on the inside, has many small square bumps on its horizontal side, and on its vertical side a smooth, reflecting surface. A laptop. But do we really see that thing as a laptop? Or do we see shapes, colors, edges etc., while our brain completes our perception by making use of rational inferences to reach the conclusion that the thing is a laptop? In other words: how intelligent are our perception processes? Prof. Dr. Albert Newen from the Institute for Philosophy II at RUB investigates this question in his latest article which was published in the journal Synthese. His conclusion: our perception processes are organized in such a manner that they can construct complex contents. Accordingly, we do not initially perceive a laptop as a conglomeration of shapes and colors, but instantly see it as the object that it is. Newen's explanation: the lack of certain features in a drawing, for example, does not prevent us from seeing the item. During the perception process, our brain is able to integrate a few typical features to a complex pattern. ""This takes place immediately when the object is spotted. Consequently, if an individual is trained in recognizing patterns, their perceptions may become richer and richer,"" says Newen. A chess expert would see the chessboard in a different way than a beginner, because he activates relevant structured patterns automatically as background knowledge, and that knowledge affects the perception process. This also takes place during social perception of other people. Learn More: Study helps fill in gaps in our visual perception But where is the evidence that we actually see complex contents as such and that they are not merely an element of our linguistic judgement? Newen: ""Perceiving certain contents is of such vital evolutionary importance for us that it is even present in infants who lack concept formation and language."" Such contents include emotions such as fear and anger. The ability to quickly perceive emotion patterns based on the facial expression and body language of another person is crucial for social animals like humans. Prof Newen described further evidence indicating that complex contents are perceived as such in neuroscientific studies. ""The structure and speed of information processing suggest that they are aspects of perception rather than aspects of a judgment,"" concludes the philosophy professor.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-approach-identifies-genetic-risk-factors-for-complex-human-diseases-202320,New Approach Identifies Genetic Risk Factors for Complex Human Diseases New mathematical model explains variability in mutation rates across the human genome  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It turns out that the type, how frequent, and where new mutations occur in the human genome depends on which DNA building blocks are nearby, found researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in an advanced online study published this week in Nature Genetics.    We developed a mathematical model to estimate the rates of mutation as a function of the nearby sequences of DNA  letters  -- called nucleotides -- in the human genome,  said senior author Benjamin F. Voight, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics and the department of Genetics.  This new model not only provides clues into the process of mutation, but also helps discover possible genetic risk factors that influence complex human diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder.  This study focuses on the probability that any given nucleotide in the human genome -- one of the four letters (A, C, G or T for adenine, cytosine, guanine or thymine) of the DNA alphabet -- is changed. Voight focused on the simplest type of mutation, a  point  mutation in which a single letter is changed in a given sequence. Most of these changes -- often called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or  snips  -- are usually not harmful to the functioning of the human body. Nevertheless, Voight examined why some sequences are more prone to mutate, whereas others are not.  The crux of the paper examines the dependency of mutation rate on which nucleotides are one, two, or three bases away from either side of a SNP,  Voight said.  We already know about one situation in which this placement matters: DNA sequences in the genome where methyl groups are attached to the cytosine nucleotide, also known as CpG sites, are hotspots for mutation. But are there other types of local sequences that matter beyond these?  To address this question, Voight and graduate student Varun Aggarwala, a doctoral candidate from the Genomics and Computational Biology graduate group, devised a mathematical model applicable to SNP data found in humans. Their approach took advantage of publicly available data from thousands of human subjects sampled from across the globe, namely from the 1000 Genomes Project. These individuals were sequenced as part of an international initiative to characterize the genetic variation that naturally occurs in human populations. What they found was surprising: Knowing the three nucleotides flanking either side of a given SNP, for a total of seven nucleotides, predicted up to 93 percent of the variability in the chance of finding a SNP in a given sequence in individuals whose genome sequences are in the 1000 Genomes Project database. In addition, their model uncovered several distinctive sequences of local nucleotides that were not previously known to be prone to mutation.  It turns out there are indeed DNA sequences beyond CpG sites that are also prone to mutation,  Voight said.  What is not immediately obvious is why. The initial rates and our model need to be investigated more deeply to decipher the basic mechanisms that induce mutation in human genomes.  Another finding questioned the assumption that methylated CpG sites always have the same rate of mutation.  I think it is commonly assumed that all CpG sequences mutate at the same rate, though our results indicate far more variability that we expected,  Voight said. Using another publicly available database that measured the methylation states at CpG sites across several individuals, Voight and Aggarwala found that the frequency in which different sequence contexts were methylated could not fully explain differences in mutation rates at these sites.  This certainly indicates the possibility of additional genetic mutation phenomenon at CpG hotspots that change how prone these sites are to mutate, for example how well DNA-repair machinery can correct new mutations that might arise,  Voight said. Beyond gleaning clues for different ways mutations occur, Voight and Aggarwala also examined applications of their model to human disease, providing ways to rank which newly discovered mutations identified from clinical genetics studies are the most likely to result in disease. Computational predictive measurements such as these are used to help prioritize rare or new gene variants discovered from these studies for follow-up investigation. Voight and Aggarwala focused on a set of autism sequencing studies by looking for genes with an excess of new mutations in children with autism not otherwise found in parents. When they applied their model to these data, they found an improvement over existing methods for predicting which rare or new mutations were associated with human disease.  We were able to refine the focus somewhat on likely pathogenic variants for follow-up work, though we ll need quite a bit more work to correctly pinpoint the right variants and genes for autism or even Alzheimer s disease where sequencing data is readily available,  Voight said. He credits not only the large amount of publicly available data, but careful and dedicated efforts over an extended period as major contributing factors to be able to evaluate and refine their proposed mathematical model.  The exciting part of this work is not just what we ve found, but the spectrum of new questions that we will be able to systematically address in the next few years. While building solid foundations takes time, the next set of scientific  skyscrapers  built on these foundations will absolutely persist longer and reach higher as a result.

To speed up identification of the most efficient producers, researchers at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering describe new approaches to this process and demonstrate how genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can enable the generation and testing of billions of individual variants of a metabolic pathway in record time. The discussion and findings are reported in Trends in Biotechnology and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Biotechnologists engineer microorganisms to produce commodities by iterating the design-build-test cycle until, via continuously improving intermediates, the highest producers are found. While the design and build capacities of the cycle are already almost unlimited, the addition of genetically encoded biosensors that can identify superior producers also endows the test phase of the cycle with high-throughput potential and enables scientists to evaluate billions of designs in a day. Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard University. Biotechnologists that tinker with the metabolism of microorganisms to produce valued products look at the engineering process through the lens of the so-called 'design-build-test cycle.' The idea is that multiple iterations of this cycle ultimately allow the identification of combinations of genetic and metabolic elements that produce the highest levels of a desired drug or chemical. Key to the cycle s efficiency, however, is the ability to construct and test the largest number of variants possible; in the end, only a few of these variants will produce the product in industrially attractive amounts. In the Trends in Biotechnology article, Wyss Institute scientists George Church, Ph.D., and Jameson Rogers, Ph.D., lay out the current state-of-the-art for designing, building and testing many variants at a time, a methodology that bioengineers call 'multiplexing'. Church is a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member and Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Rogers, currently with the Boston Consulting Group, performed his work as a Harvard Pierce Fellow and Doctoral Student mentored by Church. Bioengineers thoroughly understand how metabolic pathways work on the biochemical level and have a plethora of DNA sequences encoding variants of all of the necessary enzymes at their disposal. Deploying these sequences with the help of computational tools and regulating their expression with an ever-growing number of genetic elements, gives them access to an almost infinite pool of design possibilities. Similarly, revolutionary advances in technologies enabling DNA synthesis and manipulation have made the construction of billions of microorganisms, each containing a distinct design variant, a routine process. ""The real bottleneck in achieving high-throughput engineering cycles lies in the testing step. Current technology limits the number of designs scientists can evaluate to hundreds, or maybe even a thousand, different designs per day. Often the assays necessary are painstaking and prone to user error,"" said Rogers. Church and Rogers discuss how genetically encoded biosensors can help bioengineers overcome this hurdle. Such biosensors work by coupling the amount of a desired product produced within a microorganism to the expression of an antibiotic resistance gene such that only high producers survive. Alternatively, the expression of a fluorescent protein can be used for high-speed sorting of rare but highly productive candidates from large populations of less productive microbes. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors allow researchers to follow product accumulation in individual bacteria in real time and to filter the best producers out of cultures with billions of bacteria, each carrying a specific design. ""Now, by having developed both types of genetically encoded biosensors we can close the loop of a fully multiplexed engineering cycle. This enables exploration of design spaces for specific metabolic pathways in much greater breadth and depth. Fluorescent biosensors, in particular, enable a brand new type of pipeline engineering in which we can observe metabolic product levels at all times during the process with extraordinary sensitivity and ability to further manipulate the engineering cycle,"" said Church. Earlier work by Church s team at the Wyss Institute already demonstrated that the levels of commercially valuable chemicals produced by bacteria could be raised through several rounds of a design-build-test cycle that employed an antibiotic selection-based biosensor. Now, Church and Rogers report in PNAS the unique advantages that fluorescent biosensors provide to bioengineers. ""Our fluorescent biosensors are built around specialized proteins that directly sense commercially valuable metabolites. These sensor proteins switch on the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein, resulting in cellular brightness that is proportional to the amount of chemical produced within the engineered cells. We can literally watch the biological production of valuable chemicals in real-time as the synthesis occurs and isolate the highest producers out of cultures with billions of candidates,"" said Rogers, who was named one of Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" in Science for opening new perspectives in bioengineering. Using this strategy, the Wyss researchers have established fluorescent biosensors for the production of super-absorbent polymers and plastics like the coveted acrylate from which a range of products is made. In fact, the study established the first engineered pathway able to biologically produce acrylate from common sugar, rather than the previously required petroleum compounds. ""This newly emerging biosensor technology has the potential to transform metabolic engineering in areas ranging from industrial manufacturing to medicine, and it can have a positive impact on our environment by making the production of drugs and chemicals independent from fossil fuels,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

The research, published in Nature Communications, found that after one generation of hatchery culture, the offspring of wild fish and first-generation hatchery fish differed in the activity of more than 700 genes. A single generation of adaptation to the hatchery resulted in observable changes at the DNA level that were passed on to offspring, scientists reported. This research was conducted at Oregon State University in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife. Scientists say the findings essentially close the case on whether or not wild and hatchery fish can be genetically different. Differences in survival and reproductive success between hatchery and wild fish have long offered evidence of rapid adaptation to the hatchery environment. This new DNA evidence directly measured the activity of all genes in the offspring of hatchery and wild fish. It conclusively demonstrates that the genetic differences between hatchery and wild fish are large in scale and fully heritable.  A fish hatchery is a very artificial environment that causes strong natural selection pressures,  said Michael Blouin, a professor of integrative biology in the OSU College of Science.  A concrete box with 50,000 other fish all crowded together and fed pellet food is clearly a lot different than an open stream.  It s not clear exactly what traits are being selected for, but the study was able to identify some genetic changes that may explain how the fish are responding to the novel environment in the hatchery.  We observed that a large number of genes were involved in pathways related to wound healing, immunity, and metabolism, and this is consistent with the idea that the earliest stages of domestication may involve adapting to highly crowded conditions,  said Mark Christie, lead author of the study. Aside from crowding, which is common in the hatchery, injuries also happen more often and disease can be more prevalent. The genetic changes are substantial and rapid, the study found. It s literally a process of evolution at work, but in this case it does not take multiple generations or long periods of time.  We expected hatcheries to have a genetic impact,  Blouin said.  However, the large amount of change we observed at the DNA level was really amazing. This was a surprising result. With the question put to rest of whether hatchery fish are different, Blouin said, it may now be possible to determine exactly how they are different, and work to address that problem. When the genetic changes that occur in a hatchery environment are better understood, it could be possible to change the way fish are raised in order to produce hatchery fish that are more like wild fish. This research is a first step in that direction.","Published: February 22, 2016"

Due to its high invasive capacity and uncontrolled, infiltrating growth, it is particularly difficult to manage. Currently, the treatment for this disease consists of a combination of surgery (when possible), radiation and chemotherapy. Although current therapy raises the overall survival of patients by around 15 months, it remains inefficient at eradicating tumour cells and, unfortunately, recurrences are another of this cancer's characteristics. A team of researchers from the Institute of Neuroscience at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB), together with the Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge - ICO, have identified a common molecular alteration in glioblastoma. The researchers observed that the cells of this type of tumour harbour a common intrinsic defect that prevents them from degrading their genetic material during apoptosis, the most important form of programmed cell death induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. See Also: Modified poliovirus therapy for glioblastoma This defect is related to an enzyme: the endonuclease DFF40/CAD (Death Fragmentation Factor, 40 kDa subunit / Caspase-Activated DNase). This enzyme, which is essential for degrading DNA during apoptosis, appears both downregulated and improperly located inside the tumour cells when compared with non-tumoural cells. The researchers observed that overexpression of the enzyme allows the glioblastoma cells to properly degrade their DNA content as expected in an apoptotic cell death. DNA degradation during apoptosis is an essential step that facilitates the subsequent proper removal of cellular debris from malignant cells. In fact, the lack of degradation and removal of genetic material from malignant cells could have detrimental consequences for the organism, such as new tumour processes, often more aggressive than the original one. Despite the efforts made in the last decade to understand the biology of these tumours, until now no common genetic or biochemical defect had been found in glioblastoma cells. The low levels of expression observed in the enzyme endonuclease DFF40/CAD and the deficiency in degrading and properly compacting its genetic material constitute a potential molecular marker in this tumour. In addition, the fact that this alteration was observed in all the cases studied points to its importance as a possible explanation for the aggressiveness of this cancer. The researchers hope these new results will improve our understanding of what goes on inside the tumour, and perhaps enable new, more effective therapies to be designed in the future for this lethal disease.

While some may recover completely, the majority of survivors will experience some form of impairment that requires a lengthy process toward partial or full recovery of functioning. Therefore, continuous improvement of rehabilitation methods is needed to ensure more positive long-term outcomes among survivors. Researchers at Japan's National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS) and Nagoya City University (NCU) have identified the increase of the ""cortex-to-red nucleus"" pathway via post-stroke focused rehabilitation and its connection to the recovery of functioning in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model rats. This crucial finding could pave the way for better rehabilitative methods for humans. See Also: New research supporting stroke rehabilitation Stroke often causes hemiplegia by lesioning the corticospinal tract, which connects the motor cortex and spinal cord. Intensive rehabilitation is known to be a promising method of promoting functional recovery via the reorganization of lesioned brain circuits. However, the causal relationship between rehabilitation-induced changes of the brain circuits and functional recovery remains unproven. To validate this relationship, the NIPS-NCU team used an ICH rat model to investigate the mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of intensive rehabilitative training. ""We found substantial functional recovery of the paralyzed forelimb when applying forced impaired limb use (or FLU) as rehabilitation,"" first author Akimasa Ishida explains. ""We also uncovered the abundant newly formed connections from the motor cortex to the red nucleus in FLU-treated rats.""

The results demonstrate that the rehabilitation-induced reorganization of the damaged brain circuits (i.e., robust increase of the cortex-to-red nucleus connections) is responsible for functional recovery.

In a recent study in Scientific Reports, lead author Tracey Shors, professor in the Department of Psychology and Center for Collaborative Neuroscience in the School of Arts and Sciences, discovered that prepubescent female rodents paired with sexually experienced males had elevated levels of stress hormones, could not learn as well, and expressed reduced maternal behaviors needed to care for offspring. See Also: Key molecular process in brain is different in males and females ""This study is important because we need to understand how sexual aggression affects all species,"" said Shors. ""We also need to know the consequences of this behavior in order for us to determine what we can do to help women learn to recover from sexual aggression and violence."" Thirty percent of women worldwide experience some kind of physical or sexual assault in their lifetime and adolescent girls are much more likely than the general public to be victims of rape, attempted rape or assault, according to the World Health Organization. Recent surveys indicate that as many as one in five college women experience sexual violence while on campus. Women who experience sexual violence are more likely to suffer with depression, PTSD and other mood disorders. Still, despite the undeniable connection between sexual trauma in women and mental health disorders, little is known about how aggression affects the female brain. That's because there has been no established laboratory animal model for studying the consequences of sexual aggression and behavior on brain function in females, Shors said. ""Laboratory models used to measure stress in animals have traditionally looked at how stress affects males and have not reflected the kind of stress that young women experience,"" she said. Bringing gender balance to research, Shors said, is why the National Institutes of Health is now requiring both male and female animals to be included in research studies in order to receive federal funding. In this new Rutgers study, Shors and her colleagues developed the Sexual Conspecific Aggressive Response (SCAR) model to determine how stress associated with sexual aggression affected female rodents. Learn More: Honing in on why female newborns are better protected from brain injury Even though it is normal for female rats to care for their offspring, as well as the offspring of other rodents, Shors said the females in this study that were exposed to the adult male throughout puberty did not exhibit as much maternal behavior as females that did not have the social interactions. Fewer newly generated brain cells were present in the females that had minimal maternal behavior when compared to females that did learn to care for offspring. While scientists don't know if this type of sexual aggression would have the same effects in humans, studies have shown that sexual aggression and violence is one of the most likely causes of PTSD in women, which is associated with decreased brain functions related to learning and memory. The children of women who experience sexual violence are also at greater risk for suffering traumatic experiences themselves as they grow up. ""We know very little about the brain mechanisms that account for the increase in depression and mood disorders among women who experience sexual trauma and aggression,"" Shors said.

Spinal muscular atrophy is a debilitating disease that causes weakness and wasting of the muscles. The disease ranges in severity with patients experiencing different symptoms, from the inability to sit up and stand, to trouble walking. In its severest form, the disease results in difficulty breathing and leads to death.

In a recent study published in Human Molecular Genetics, Dr. Gangwani and his team of researchers at TTUHSC El Paso describe how mice with spinal muscular atrophy saw great improvement when the JNK3 enzyme was genetically inhibited to eliminate its activity. The finding suggests that patients with spinal muscular atrophy could also see improvement if treated with a drug that suppresses the activity of JNK3. ""We saw less muscle degeneration, more muscle growth and better muscle strength, and improvement in overall movement,"" says Gangwani.

Gangwani is studying how inhibition of the JNK3 enzyme could reduce muscle degeneration associated with the disease. Credit: Raul de la Cruz / Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso  Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a genetic mutation that triggers the loss of spinal cord motor neurons neurons that help control the body's movements. As the neurons deteriorate, so does one's ability to control their own movement.

When your biological (epigenetic) age is older than your chronological age, you are at increased risk for getting and dying of cancer, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study. And the bigger the difference between the two ages, the higher your risk of dying of cancer.   This could become a new early warning sign of cancer,  said senior author Dr. Lifang Hou, who led the study.  The discrepancy between the two ages appears to be a promising tool that could be used to develop an early detection blood test for cancer.  Hou is chief of cancer epidemiology and prevention in preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and co-leader of the cancer prevention program at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.   People who are healthy have a very small difference between their epigenetic/biological age and chronological age,  Hou said.  People who develop cancer have a large difference and people who die from cancer have a difference even larger than that. Our evidence showed a clear trend.  A person s epigenetic age is calculated based on an algorithm measuring 71 blood DNA methylation markers that could be modified by a person s environment, including environmental chemicals, obesity, exercise and diet. This test is not commercially available but is currently being studied by academic researchers, including a team at Northwestern. In DNA methylation, a cluster of molecules attaches to a gene and makes the gene more or less receptive to biochemical signals from the body. The gene itself -- your DNA code -- does not change. This is the first study to link the discrepancy between epigenetic age and chronological age with both cancer development and cancer death using multiple blood samples collected over time. The multiple samples, which showed changing epigenetic age, allowed for more precise measurements of epigenetic age and its relationship to cancer risk. Other studies have looked at blood samples collected only at a single time point. The study was a longitudinal design with multiple blood samples collected from 1999 to 2013. Scientists used 834 blood samples collected from 442 participants who were free of cancer at the time of the blood draw. For each one-year increase in the discrepancy between chronological and epigenetic ages, there was a 6 percent increased risk of getting cancer within three years and a 17 percent increased risk of cancer death within five years. Those who will develop cancer have an epigenetic age about six months older than their chronological age; those who will die of cancer are about 2.2 years older, the study found.  Our results suggest future researchers should focus on the epigenetic-chronological age discrepancy for its potential to show a big picture snapshot of human health and disease at a molecular level,  said first author Yinan Zheng, a predoctoral fellow at Feinberg. Northwestern scientists now are studying whether individuals can lower their epigenetic age through lifestyle improvements such as increasing exercise and having a healthier diet, noted Brian Joyce, co-first author and predoctoral fellow at Feinberg.","Published: February 19, 2016"

The overall 5-year survival is 17%, which is mainly driven by the fact that 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed after the disease has spread, with a 5-year survival of only 4% in this advanced disease setting. If lung cancer is detected in its earliest stage, the 5-year survival jumps to 55%. LDCT is one method to detect lung cancer early in those at high risk, as defined by age and smoking history, and has been shown to reduce mortality by 20%. However LDCT detects a number of lesions (nodules) that are in fact not, nor will be, cancerous.

They are formed by mixtures in which large amounts of liquid, usually water, are confined within a flexible network of polymer chains or colloidal particles. Among the different types of gels, all with different properties and applications, nanogels are sub-micrometer sized cross-linked polymer particles that can carry or incorporate macromolecules in their network structure. This property, coupled with their  soft  character and the ability to introduce stimuli-responsive characteristics, means that they have many attractive applications, including within pharmaceuticals, in particular drug delivery. A new study published in Nanoscale by an international team of scientists from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL, London*) and the Institut Laue-Langiven (ILL, France**) provides important missing information into the behaviour of nanogels at interfaces, and may lead to a more patient and user-friendly drug administration route than current methods.  Nanogels based on NIPAM (N-isopropylacrylamide) are considered to be  smart  or  switchable  materials because of the fact that they undergo a phase transition at a critical temperature close to that of the physiological temperature   the normal human temperature of 37 C. This means that they have the potential as an intelligent drug delivery vehicle where the release of an active agent or drug can be triggered by changes in temperature. This can be used by simple contact, for example, in transdermal delivery systems via our skin. The development of such systems based on polymers requires a better understanding of the complex dynamic structure of such nanomaterials and currently there is a lack of experimental data about how these materials actually behave at interfaces.  Neutrons are the ideal tool to investigate the microscopic structure of nanogels, thus helping to understand how their properties can be controlled. In particular, neutron reflectometry is the technique of choice for the study of surfaces and interfaces. As such, the ILL reflectometer FIGARO was chosen as the principal experimental platform for this study.  The QMUL ILL team used NIPAM-based nanogels synthesised with different percentages of MBA (N,N -methylenebisacrylamide) as a cross-linker in the range 10 30%, and characterised them at human physiological temperature. Detailed structural studies of these systems on a molecular length scale have not been attempted before now.  In this work, it was shown that a large conformational change for the nanogels occurs at the air/water interface. The three-layer model has been found to describe these systems at the surface; a first densely packed collapsed layer in contact with air, a second layer of solvated polymer and a third layer of diffuse polymer chains extending into the bulk solution. This study also provides the first experimental evidence of structural changes of nanogels as a function of the degree of cross-linking at the air/water interface.  As the percentage of cross-linker incorporated in the nanogels was increased, more rigid matrices were obtained and the amount of adsorbed nanogels increased. The non-equilibrium nature of these systems means that it is not possible to apply a normal surface tension analysis to estimate the amount at an interface. Instead neutron reflectivity measurements with isotopic contrast variation provide a sensitive means to determine the adsorbed amount. It also allows the changes in the volume fraction of nanogels at the interface to be followed with time as more and more material reached the interface. The technique also highlights changes in conformation which is important in relating the structure-to-function for this class of materials. Because neutron interactions vary in an irregular fashion with atomic numbers (i.e. different isotopes), the technique allows different aspect of the structure to be highlighted using isotropic substitution. The analysis of measurements recorded in different isotopic contrasts leads to resolution of complex structures.  FIGARO is a neutron reflectometer at the ILL that is optimised for measurements at free liquid surfaces. It is a versatile instrument, which in its six years since commissioning has already generated more than 70 peer reviewed publications. It has a high intensity configuration for dynamic measurements as materials assemble at interfaces, which was exploited in this research, as well as the ability to record data over a broad dynamic range required to resolve diffuse interfacial structures.  Dr Richard Campbell, the ILL s first responsible scientist on the FIGARO instrument, said:  Surface tension measurements are most sensitive to the material assembled right at the air surface while the penetrating power of neutron reflectivity results in sensitivity to more diffuse structures. This structural study was possible due to the ability to carry out fast measurements of the dynamic interfacial assembly as well as more detailed measurements to access the diffuse structures present in the nanogels using an optimised high intensity configuration of FIGARO.  The neutron reflectivity and volume fraction profiles can be seen in the Figure. Three distinct regions of the surface structure with respect to the depth are shown. There is a first layer in contact with the air that is rather dense with a volume fraction of about 60% followed by two more gradually diffusing layers. Interestingly, the content of water in the first layer increases with amount of MBA   this can be attributed to a reduction in the ability to change conformation (and thus repel water from polymer network) of the gels with a higher degree of cross-linking.  The structural data also suggest an extensive rearrangement of the conformation of the nanogel particles at the interface during the adsorption process, resulting in structural deformation   the degree of deformation diminishes with increasing percentage of cross-linker. Although the differences in conformations between the bulk and the liquid/liquid interface for NIPAM-based microgels have been previously hypothesised, this study is the first to provide experimental supporting evidence.  Dr Ali Zarbakhsh, of QMUL s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences said:  The data presented provide important missing information into the behaviour of gel particles at interfaces. We believe that they may lead to achievement of the rational, smart design of novel materials for specific applications. Our research, combined with the insight gained from additional studies on related systems in the future, may lead to a promising platform that has the characteristics of a more patient and user-friendly drug administration route than current alternatives.  * Dr Katarzyna Zielinska, Professor Marina Resmini and Dr Ali Zarbakhsh ** Dr Richard A.

Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), have created the first comprehensive, cross-species genomic comparison of all 20 known species of Leptospira, a bacterial genus that can cause disease and death in livestock and other domesticated mammals, wildlife and humans. The resulting analyses reveal novel adaptations and traits in infectious species of Leptospira that not only help illuminate its evolutionary history, but may also provide new preventive and treatment approaches. The data comes from representative Leptospira strains obtained from four international labs and isolated from 12 countries. The work involved researchers at Yale University, UCLA, Cornell University and institutions in Australia, France, England, The Netherlands, Canada, Uruguay, Brazil, Peru and Thailand. ""Leptospira is the most complex genus of bacteria that infects humans,"" said Joseph M. Vinetz, MD, professor of medicine and director of the UC San Diego Center for Tropical Medicine and Travelers Health. ""This work compares the complete genome sequences of all known species of Leptospira to discover which genes make this bacterium a pathogen. It provides a roadmap for future research, including finding new ways to diagnose infection and vaccine development."" This project was initiated and led by first author Derrick Fouts, PhD, JCVI associate professor. ""The bioinformatics tools have matured to the point that we can now find the proverbial 'needle in a haystack,' meaning we can now identify genes and pathways that are unique to pathogenic microbes, which will focus future research efforts on these key pathogen-specific features,"" Fouts said. JCVI president Karen E. Nelson, PhD, who helped coordinate the initial phase of the project points out that the success of this study was based, in part, on the dedication and excitement of the Leptospira research community. ""The comprehensive nature of this study serves as a model for emerging infectious diseases."" Some species of Leptospira are non-infectious, deriving nourishment from dead or decaying organic matter. Other species are infectious with different, sometimes dire, consequences. In infected rats and mice, for example, the bacterium colonizes in the kidneys, but does not produce disease symptoms. In livestock, such as cattle, sheep, horses and pigs, and companion animals, such as dogs, leptospirosis may cause acute kidney, liver and lung damage and provoke fetal loss. Humans can become infected with leptospirosis in ways similar to animals, through direct contact or ingestion or inhalation of contaminated water or soil. Humans are also vulnerable through direct contact with the urine of infected animals. In infected humans, the disease provokes a range of effects. It may result in asymptomatic infection, mild, flu-like symptoms or jaundice, or lead to severe damage of the liver, kidney or central nervous system - and death. Globally, leptospirosis is the most important bacterial disease transmitted from animals to humans, with more than 1 million cases annually and 60,000 deaths. Examples of Leptospira pathogen-specific features identified in the study include:   Discovery of proteins unique to pathogenic Leptospira that will accelerate vaccine development in humans, dogs, and livestock   Key adaptations of infectious Leptospira to mammals, such as biosynthesis of sialic acid, a type of sugar that allows these organisms to hide within the body so as to avoid destruction and which allows disease to progress   Infectious Leptospira evolutionarily acquired the ability to synthesize vitamin B12 from a simple amino acid precursor, which non-infectious Leptospira cannot ""One fascinating finding was discovering the CRISPR-Cas genetic machinery only in pathogenic Leptospira, but not in the intermediate or non-infectious groups of the genus. The evolutionary acquisition of novel CRISPR elements, which are only in pathogenic Leptospira, probably hastened adaptation to human infection. The significance of this observation remains to be explored,"" said Vinetz. CRISPR-Cas is a molecular immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements, and provides a form of acquired immunity. Recent biotechnological advances have made it possible to alter the germline of many species, including mammals and disease-carrying mosquitoes, through CRISPR. Vinetz said the next step will be to begin exploiting the genomic information ""for vaccine and diagnostics development, experimental approaches to understanding mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and how Leptospira persist in the environment, all critical for developing new public health interventions aimed at reducing the global impact of this important but neglected zoonotic disease.""","Published: February 19, 2016"

""It is known that infiltration of natural killer (NK) immune cells can control and regulate the size of tumors, but nobody had looked at how exercise regulates the system,"" says senior study author Pernille Hojman, at the University of Copenhagen. ""In our experiments, we tried to inject our mice with adrenaline to mimic this increase you see during exercise, and when we do that we see that the NK cells are mobilized to the bloodstream, and if there's a tumor present then the NK cells will find the tumor and home to it."" Hojman and her colleagues next used mice depleted of NK cells to show that the increase in number of NK cells at the site of the tumor was directly contributing to the reduction in size. Even with exercise and a full suite of other immune cells, without the NK cells these mice experienced the normal rate of cancer growth. Blocking the function of adrenaline also blunted the cancer-killing benefits of the running wheel. The research group also discovered that an immune signaling molecule called IL-6 was the link between adrenaline-dependent mobilization of NK cells and tumor infiltration. It's known that IL-6 is released from muscle tissue during exercise, but Hojman presents evidence that adrenaline specifically hails IL-6 sensitive NK cells and that the IL-6 molecules helped guide the immune cells to the tumors. ""That was actually a big surprise to us,"" she says, adding that IL-6 and its role in tumor biology can be a controversial topic. ""In this study we show that the exercise-induced IL-6 seems to play a role in homing of NK cells to the tumor and also in the activation of those NK cells."" While the research is hopeful for patients looking for inexpensive ways to manage their cancer, more needs to be learned about the effects of exercise on metastasis and longevity, as well as if the observations hold true in humans. Hojman also wants to explore the combined impact of anti-cancer treatments and exercise on tumors. ""As someone working in the field of exercise and oncology, one of the main questions that cancer patients always ask is: how should I exercise? Can we do anything?"" she says. ""While it has previously been difficult to advise people about the intensity at which they should exercise, our data suggest that it might be beneficial to exercise at a somewhat high intensity in order to provoke a good epinephrine surge and hence recruitment of NK cells.""","Published: February 19, 2016"

About 130 million people are living in areas that exceed the National Ambient Air Quality standard,  said Michael Jerrett, chair of environmental health sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and study co-author.  While ozone has decreased in the U.S., the reductions are not nearly as big as decreases in other pollutants, and elsewhere in the world, ozone is a growing problem.  The authors analyzed data from nearly 670,000 records in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study (CPS-II). Begun in 1982, the study enrolled participants from all 50 states; the average age at enrollment was 55. The researchers matched cause of death over 22 years with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control air quality data. During that time, more than 237,000 participants died. Researchers took into account fine particulate (PM2.5) pollution, an established cause of premature mortality, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution, which has been linked to premature mortality. They adjusted for 29 behavioral and demographic factors, including smoking, alcohol use, body weight, occupational exposures, diet, poverty and race. Researchers found the association between ozone and mortality began at 35 ppb, based on the annual 8-hour average. They said that many communities are above this level, suggesting further reductions in ozone would have immediate health benefits. Jerrett added that reducing ozone, a potent greenhouse gas, would also provide future health benefits by reducing climate change. Researchers were surprised by one finding: near-source PM2.5, largely attributable to traffic, was more strongly associated with death from cardiovascular disease than regional PM2.5, largely attributable to fossil-fuel burning and secondary formation of the particles in the atmosphere. With each 10-ppb increase in near-source PM2.5, mortality rate rose 41 percent, compared to 7 percent for regional source. The study has some limitations, which include a lack of updated data on residential history, selection bias stemming from the exclusion of participants with missing or invalid residence data and a lack of historical ozone data. But the findings still give a clearer picture of air pollution s harmful effects, said Michelle C. Turner, lead author and a research fellow at the McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment in Ottawa, Canada and the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology ISGlobal Alliance in Barcelona, Spain. A previous study with fewer participants, shorter follow-up and less detailed exposure models found ozone was associated with a smaller (4 percent) increase in respiratory deaths. In this larger study, researchers were also able to focus on specific causes of mortality.  The burden of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality from ozone may be much greater than previously recognized,  she said.","Published: February 19, 2016"

This discovery which builds upon decades of early-stage research could lead to more effective therapies for the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder that affects more than 21 million people worldwide. Scientists at Columbia s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute,Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) as well as the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) used a chemical compound to regrow connections between brain cells, or neurons, which in turn restored memory deficits. The abnormal or stunted growth of neurons in the brain s memory centers is a key indicator of schizophrenia. The study was performed in mice with a specific genetic mutation known as the 22q11.2 microdeletion. This mutation, which occurs in one percent of people with schizophrenia, is the single largest genetic risk factor for the disease.  With these findings, we showed that restoring cellular connections reversed memory deficits a symptom of schizophrenia for which there is no effective treatment,  said Joseph Gogos, MD, PhD, a principal investigator at the Zuckerman Institute, professor of physiology and neuroscience at CUMC and a senior author of the paper.  This represents an invaluable new strategy for treating schizophrenia and highlights the critical importance of basic biological research in psychiatric disorders. Understanding how schizophrenia originates in our model lends critical insight into the disorder as a whole, paving the way for improved treatment options that have thus far remained elusive.  Paranoia, auditory hallucinations and delusions are some of schizophrenia s most well known symptoms and can often be controlled with antipsychotic medication. However, other symptoms like severe disruptions to short-term and verbal memory, reduced attention and a decrease in IQ have remained largely untreatable. Memory deficits can interfere with an individual s ability to maintain relationships or a job essentially cutting them off from the world around them.  Memory deficits are now considered a core feature of schizophrenia and are believed to be strongly tied to the disorder s underlying biology,  said Joshua Gordon, MD, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at CUMC, a research scientist at NYSPI and a senior author of the paper.  Until we can shed light on that biology, these symptoms remain virtually impossible to treat.  To address this, Dr. Gogos has spent nearly 20 years working to uncover the biological basis of schizophrenia. He and his collaborators developed a laboratory mouse model that exhibited the 22q11.2 microdeletion.  Schizophrenia affects about one in every 100 people, but for those with a 22q11.2 microdeletion, that chance jumps to one in three,  said Dr. Gogos.  22q11.2 microdeletions remain the single greatest genetic risk factor for developing schizophrenia. This is why our model has proved invaluable in allowing us to trace schizophrenia back to its beginnings.  In a study published last year, Drs. Gogos, Gordon and their research team revealed how the 22q11.2 microdeletion leads to weaker connections between neurons in key brain regions, resulting in schizophrenia s memory deficits.  Normally, neurons grow long branches that connect across long distances, forming tightly interconnected circuits,  said Dr. Gordon.  However, in our mouse models, these branches were stunted in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex two regions crucial for memory. Further experiments revealed why: a protein called Gsk3  was clogging the brain.  Last year s study showed that the 22q11.2 microdeletion kickstarts a chain reaction that boosts Gsk3  activity right from birth. Overactive Gsk3  stunts the growth and development of neurons in the brain s memory centers. Over time, this hampers their ability to form strong connections. In the new study, the researchers tested whether suppressing Gsk3  activity could reverse the damage that ultimately leads to schizophrenia s memory deficits. In a series of experiments, the researchers treated their mouse models at a young age (between seven and 28 days after birth), with a chemical compound that blocked Gsk3  activity. Almost immediately, they began to see a difference. As Gsk3  activity dropped, the neurons branched out and formed connections with their neighbors. Communication between brain regions was restored, and importantly the mice showed no memory deficits.  Our work suggests that Gsk3  could be considered a potential target for treating some symptoms of schizophrenia though there are limitations,  said Dr. Gordon.  For example, whether the same treatment might work in other models of schizophrenia that do not have the 22q11.2 microdeletion. Also, we treated the mice at a young age, but schizophrenia normally presents in adolescence and young adulthood.   We re currently planning to test whether blocking Gsk3  during that equivalent age in our models would also have the same positive effect,  added Dr. Gogos.  Schizophrenia is a complex disorder there is no single cause but disrupted communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex may be a common thread running through many of them,  said Vikaas Sohal, MD, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study.  The findings presented here by Drs. Gogos, Gordon and their team could lead to additional ways of restoring normal communication between these two brain regions and thus provide effective treatments for schizophrenia that arise from a variety of causes.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cell-marker-for-leukemiainitiating-capacity-190067,Cell Marker for Leukemia Initiating Capacity  University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers have found a marker on blood cells that may help the most pressing problem in chronic myelogenous leukemia  or CML  today   an inability to get patients off treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. To do that, we have to be able to maintain their remission after stopping treatment,  said Ravi Bhatia, M.D., division director of hematology and oncology in the UAB Department of Medicine, and deputy director of the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Treatment using drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, do not eliminate leukemia-initiating cells.  In most patients, residual leukemia-initiating cells result in regeneration of leukemia, necessitating lifelong treatment with these drugs. Only a small proportion of CML patients stay in remission after stopping TKI treatment. Two keys to containing remission may be the ability to identify those patients who will be able to successfully stop their TKI, without later relapse and, second, the ability to identify patients who may benefit from an additional drug regimen besides TKI to achieve treatment-free remission. Research by Bhatia and colleagues shows that the leukemia-initiating stem cells in the bone marrow are not uniform. Instead, evidence points to a mixed, or heterogonous, population of cells that can be distinguished by several cell markers, significantly Mpl gene expression. Cells with high Mpl gene expression are prone to initiating the disease-causing profusion of white blood cells when tested in a mouse model of chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML. The low Mpl gene expression group engrafts in the bone marrow without producing disease. Thus, among the long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LTHSC) found in CML, the Mpl marker distinguishes a group that appears to be leukemic and a group that appears to be non-leukemic. Similar cell-marker differences were seen for LTHSC studied from human CML patients. These findings imply that, among CML LTHSC, it is the leukemic LTHSC that will cause disease relapse if TKI therapy is stopped.  This shows that not all leukemia stem cells are equal,  Bhatia said.  Some are more prone to causing leukemia and relapses, while some others may just hang around without potential for contributing to relapse.  Over the past 15 years, chronic myelogenous leukemia has had a marked improvement in five-year survival, from about 30 percent to nearly 90 percent today. This improvement comes from TKI drugs. However, the drugs have to be taken every day for a patient s lifetime, and their yearly cost can be $100,000 to $150,000. This is a societal burden, and for some patients the drug co-payments can exceed their ability to pay. Identifying patients who could safely stop TKI treatment would be a boon. Study details  This shows that not all leukemia stem cells are equal. Some are more prone to causing leukemia and relapses, while some others may just hang around without potential for contributing to relapse.  In their experiments, the Bhatia team used an inducible transgenic mouse model of CML, where the BCR-ABL gene fusion of CML is under the control of a tetracycline-regulated enhancer. This model creates a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that resembles chronic phase CML. Previous work had shown that only the cells with an LTHSC phenotype were capable of long-term repopulation and leukemia-initiating capacity after transplantation to another mouse. When the researchers transplanted LTHSC from CML-model mice to other mice, 11 of 20 recipients developed CML, and nine of 20 showed engraftment with CML cells but did not develop leukocytosis characteristic of leukemia. When the LTHSC from the primary-recipient mice were transferred to secondary recipients, seven of 17 mice receiving cells from leukemic mice developed CML, and none of the secondary-recipient mice receiving cells from the non-leukemic mice developed CML. These two groups of LTHSC were then tested for differences in gene expression. Significant differences were seen between the leukemic and non-leukemic LTHSC for the genes Mpl, c-Myc, CD47, Pten, Sirt1, Ptch1 and Tie2. Bhatia s group focused on the Mpl marker. They used flow cytometry to select bone marrow LTHSC with either high or low Mpl expression from CML-model BCR-ABL mice. Seven of 16 mice receiving MplHi LTHSC developed leukemia after transplantation, compared with one of 17 receiving MplLo LTHSC. This showed an increased leukemogenic capacity for the MplHi LTHSC. The researchers also investigated the impact of cell cycle status. They found that CML MplHi LTHSC that were in a resting stage of the cell cycle had enhanced long-term engraftment and leukemogenic capacity compared with cycling MplHi LTHSC. The researchers used virus vectors and shRNA to create Mpl knockdown BCR-ABL LTHSC and showed that the knockdown cells had a greatly reduced ability to develop leukemia in recipient mice. The Mpl knockdown cells, after stimulation by the Mpl ligand thrombopoietin, also had reduced expression of the activated transcription factors p-STAT3 and p-STAT5, compared with controls. Finally, human CML cells were examined for differences between MplHi LTHSC and MplLo LTHSC, and similar differences were seen. Among these, the human MplHi LTHSC had a higher rate of engraftment into bone marrow than the human MplLo LTHSC, as tested in a xenograft model using immunodeficient mice. Also, the human MplHi LTHSC had reduced sensitivity to the TKI nilotinib compared with MplLo LTHSC. Furthermore, for human MplHi LTHSC, a Jak/STAT inhibitor significantly reduced cell growth and significantly increased the programmed cell death called apoptosis. Altogether, the researchers write,  These results identify MPL expression as a marker as well as a key regulator of leukemogenic potential and drug sensitivity of CML LTHSC  Our findings support further investigation of approaches to antagonize MPL signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy to eliminate leukemia-initiating LTHSC.

With this conditional approval, RosettaGX Reveal is now available in all 50 states. In making the assay available pending final approval, the NYSDOH requires the Company to provide any additional information that it may request within 60 business days.   We are very pleased to have approval to market this important cancer diagnostic for the benefit of physicians and patients in the vast New York market,"" stated Kenneth A. Berlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rosetta Genomics.  It is estimated that nearly 550,000 FNAs are performed on thyroid nodules each year in the U.S. and that approximately 740,000 are performed annually in Europe. Interpretation of FNA samples is not always straightforward, leading to an indeterminate result in up to 30% of the samples. Many patients with indeterminate results undergo surgery as a precaution despite the fact that up to 80% of these cases are benign. This exposes patients to unnecessary surgical risk and costs the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars. Through an analysis of our validation study data, we believe we can help prevent up to 75% of unnecessary thyroid surgeries.   In addition to this expanded geographic access, recent managed care contracting initiatives have resulted in covered lives for RosettaGX Reveal exceeding 150 million in the U.S. These increases in geographic and health insurance access, along with the potential health economic benefits the RosettaGX Reveal assay can bring by avoiding unnecessary surgeries, should enhance adoption into a market valued at more than $350 million annually in the U.S. alone.

The agreement provides Capsugel exclusive rights to manufacture clinical trial and commercial batches of iSPERSE -based inhaled therapeutic candidates being developed by Pulmatrix and its potential development partners. Capsugel will combine its spray drying process development, scale-up expertise and commercial manufacturing capabilities at its Bend Research facility in Bend, Ore. with Pulmatrix s iSPERSE (inhaled small particles easily respirable and emitted) technology.  This strategic partnership with Pulmatrix puts our companies at the forefront of bringing unique inhalation products to the market to deliver better patient outcomes,  said Dan Dobry, Head of Alliance Strategy at Bend Research, a division of Capsugel Dosage Form Solutions.  We look forward to working with Pulmatrix to help advance its pipeline of proprietary and partnered products utilizing our spray dry technology and infrastructure, and to jointly explore opportunities to collaborate with the broader pharmaceutical industry to develop next-generation inhalation therapies.  Pulmatrix s iSPERSE dry powder technology is a small, dense and dispersible engineered particle technology that enables pulmonary delivery of drugs with high delivery efficiency, dose reproducibility and flow-rate independence. Several products leveraging the iSPERSE platform are in development, including a lead clinical stage bronchodilator (PUR0200) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an inhaled anti-fungal (PUR1900) for cystic fibrosis (CF) and a pipeline of products for use in the treatment of rare pulmonary diseases, CF and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  This collaboration provides us with access to Capsugel s spray dry technology, scale-up capabilities, and equipment to support our growing pipeline of internal and partnered development programs,  said Pulmatrix CEO Robert Clarke, Ph.D. Pulmatrix s chief scientific officer, David Hava, Ph.D., added:  In the near term, Capsugel will fulfill manufacturing needs for our planned clinical trial activities in cystic fibrosis and, longer term, will enable us to manufacture iSPERSE-based products at commercial scale. With this partnership, we can achieve these goals cost-effectively and without the risk or required capital to build and maintain these essential capabilities.  Capsugel and Pulmatrix have played leadership roles in the development of spray drying as an enabling technology to address the limitations of conventional lactose blending dry powder inhaler (DPI) and metered dose inhaler (MDI) technologies. Spray drying technology provides fewer formulation dependencies, the ability to deliver either crystalline or amorphous drugs, and tighter particle size distribution than that provided by lactose blend technology. This engineered particle approach and expertise applied to the iSPERSE technology translates into significantly improved delivery efficiency, flow-rate independence and drug dosing for patients. The proprietary iSPERSE technology is backed by a strong intellectual property estate extending into the 2030s. Capsugel continues to make significant investments to maintain and build its premier spray drying capabilities and capacity. In June 2015, Capsugel completed a two-year, more than $25 million investment to expand Bend Research s spray drying commercial manufacturing facility, providing the company with the largest integrated pharmaceutical spray drying technology capability in North America. Capsugel is also investing to expand its late-stage inhalation offering to include full cGMP analytical services and large-scale encapsulation for DPI applications.","Published: February 19, 2016"

The WorldStar competition is one of the major events of the WPO, and its award represents the pre-eminent international award in packaging. Vetter has now won four internationally recognized awards for a product only released in July 2015. Two of the awards, won prior to the products launch, include the IF Design Award, and the Red Dot Design Award. Recently, Vetter-Ject  won the  German Packaging Award 2015 .At the same time, Vetter is proud to have also been awarded a CMO Leadership Award 2016 in four categories. The WorldStar competition is open to any pack or packaging material that has won a recognized or domestic international award related to packaging in either 2014 or 2015. Winning of the German Packaging Award 2015 assured Vetter s submission to the WorldStar competition. Representatives from 19 packaging associations judged 293 projects entered into the competition from 35 countries. The judging session took place over 2 days in October, 2015 as part of the 95th WPO Board Meeting activities. Vetter had previously won the WorldStar award in 1998 for the Vetter Lyo-Ject  dual chamber syringe.  The winning of this award, certainly one of the most prestigious in the field of global packaging, is very gratifying to Vetter, and yet another affirmation of the value that Vetter-Ject  brings to the biopharmaceutical industry,  said Dr. Claus Feussner, Senior Vice President, Vetter Development Service.  The three awards we had already received, combined with the WorldStar Award, are a validation of the novel design and technological advances of Vetter-Ject .  Since its introduction in July, Vetter has had positive feedback both from the market and our customers about this system. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are increasingly developing drugs that incorporate sensitive and complex compounds. Administering these drugs requires an injection system that can be used flexibly while being safe and simple to handle. Vetter-Ject  is such a system, consisting of a needle hub and a needle shield. Due to the baked-in siliconization process for the glass barrel, less silicon oil than commonly used is necessary, making Vetter-Ject  particularly suitable for silicone-sensitive drug products. The silicon content of the syringe can also be adjusted according to the requirements of the customer. Thus, the amount of silicon used; as well as the related particle load, can be reduced by up to 80% when compared to the standard siliconization process applied to conventional syringe systems.

During development, the body drastically prunes back the excess cutting the axons that branch from nerve cell bodies, as well as entire neurons. Scientists have long assumed that the decision whether to cull or keep an axon was coordinated by the axon itself, rather than by the cell body from which it extends. In recent years, tantalizing clues from several research groups have challenged that assumption. Now researchers at The Rockefeller University have proven that the cell body actively controls axon degeneration, and have uncovered many of the molecular details that allow this long-range communication. See Also: Nerve cells use each other as maps In an article published today (February 18) in Cell, they report that the instructions telling axons in developing embryos whether to live or die come from the cell body, not the axon. ""This is a surprising finding,"" notes senior author Marc Tessier-Lavigne, President of Rockefeller University and the Carson Family Professor in the Laboratory of Brain Development and Repair. ""When the axon senses a 'distress signal' a lack of a growth factor called NGF it doesn't make the decision to degenerate by itself. It actually sends the information to the cell body, which is quite far away, and the cell body sends its decision back down the axon."" The survival of some axons depends on the presence of NGF in their local environment, a sign that there are plenty of nutrients around. ""Because NGF is present at the tips of axons, far from cell body, it has been hard for scientists to envision that the cell body played a central role in axon degeneration,"" says co-first author David Simon, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Tessier-Lavigne. ""And indeed, our study confirmed that all the cellular machinery that is needed to die is present in axon. However the axon needs the message from the cell body to know when to degenerate."" Tessier-Lavigne, Simon, co-first author Jason Pitts, and their colleagues followed a fairly straightforward procedure. They severed the connection between axons and the cell body in mouse neurons. When they removed NGF to mimic the distress signal that normally informs neurons that an axon should degenerate, they saw that only axons that remained connected to their cell bodies would do so. ""When axons have been isolated from their cell body, the internal cell process that normally leads to their degeneration won't turn on,"" says Simon Looking closer, the researchers saw that when NGF levels fall, the cell body activates a gene that makes a protein known as Puma, which is associated with cell death and is present in the cell body. They suspect that once Puma gets activated, it triggers a message within the cell that ultimately instructs the axon to die. Learn More: Shedding new light on nerve cell growth The idea that the cell body coordinates the degeneration signal in axons may be new to neuroscientists, but it does make biological sense, the researchers note. While axons only detect signals in their immediate environment, the cell body receives multiple cues about growth conditions from different directions. For instance, the Cell experiment used sensory neurons that convey pain in the skin's surface, where NGF levels can fluctuate periodically. ""Our findings show the axon won't make the decision to die based on an immediate lack of NGF,"" Simon says. By leaving the decision up to the cell body, the neuron has a ""fail safe"" that prevents it from degenerating unnecessarily, the researchers propose. The findings have potential implications for researchers studying certain conditions in which axons degenerate excessively, the authors note. In some neurodegenerative diseases, the affected neurons adopt some of the same pathways that drive axon pruning during normal embryonic development. The new findings suggest that some of these diseases may be caused by problems in signaling from the cell body, which keeps mistakenly green-lighting axon degeneration. ""If researchers could find a way to interfere with the expression or function of Puma, that could be very neuroprotective, and potentially protect neurons from degenerating,"" says Simon.

The work, published in Stem Cell Reports, is the first to link the release of alpha-synuclein, a naturally occurring protein that plays a central role in the development of Parkinson's, with its most common genetic risk factor, GBA-1, shedding new light on its role in the progression of the devastating neurological condition and its symptoms. See Also: Parkinson s disease: New insights into a traveling protein The study, carried out at the Parkinson's UK-funded Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, studied cells from two groups of participants - a group with Parkinson's carrying the GBA1 genetic mutation and a control group without the condition. By studying stem cells and brain cells created from the skin of participants, scientists discovered for the first time that the GBA1 mutation creates problems with how proteins, in particular alpha-synuclein, are processed and recycled in cells. When someone has a GBA1 mutation, protein recycling does not work properly in the cell, creating a build-up of alpha-synuclein, which is released into the brain, contributing to the spread of Parkinson's. The physical and motor symptoms of Parkinson's emerge when around 70 percent of cells have been lost in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Physical symptoms can include a tremor, slowness of walking and stiffness. When the condition spreads to other areas of the brain, Parkinson's dementia and cognitive problems develop. These new findings offer an insight into how and why excess alpha-synuclein is released into the brain and opens up new pathways of investigation into targeting treatments that could stop this process - with the goal of halting or minimizing the severity of the condition. ""Our brain cells work like a complex manufacturing unit, building new proteins to carry out activities and recycling proteins that get damaged. We already know that Parkinson's may spread when alpha-synuclein escapes from affected cells into the brain, where it can then get taken up by other cells,"" said Professor Richard Wade-Martins, Head of Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, and lead researcher on the Parkinson's UK-funded study. ""Thanks to this study, for the first time we know how the protein is released, giving us new clues on how this spread happens. ""Most importantly, these findings open up new avenues into investigating potential new therapies or treatments that could stop the spread of alpha-synuclein and slow the condition's progression.""

""This study is a good example of how studying a genetic form of the condition can provide important insights into what is thought to be a fundamental feature of all forms of Parkinson's.

Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are a group of environmental contaminants that were banned in developed countries 20-30 years ago. But since they accumulate through the food chain and remain for a very long time in the human body, especially adipose tissue, high levels can still be found in a majority of the population of Sweden, as well as in most other industrial countries. The most commonly known of these compounds is the pesticide DDT. See Also: Air pollution harmful to young brains: study The research group at Uppsala University has previously shown associations between environmental contaminants and diabetes, atherosclerosis and stroke. Using the same large data set they have now shown that the OCPs are related to future cognitive impairment. The so-called PIVUS study (Prospective Investigation of Uppsala Seniors) comprises around 1,000 70-year-olds in Uppsala who have been studied over a longer period of time. The researchers measured three different OCPs in plasma from the individuals and investigated who received a diagnosis of cognitive impairment over the coming 10-year period. Learn More: Coffee consumption habits impact the risk of mild cognitive impairment The results show that individuals with high levels of three OCPs (p,p -DDE (a metabolite of DDT), transnona-chlordane and hexachlorobenzene) had about 3 times higher future risk of cognitive impairment than elders with low levels of OCP. These results are independent of factors such as sex, smoking, diabetes, exercise habits, alcohol intake, weight change and high blood pressure.  Even though OCPs are well-known neurotoxins, our findings are surprising because current exposure levels of these chemicals are very low. However, our study subjects were the first generation with almost life-time exposure to these chemicals. Thus, we found evidence that low-dose, but chronic, exposure of OCPs can be harmful to the human brain , says Lars Lind, Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University.

The paper describes a new set of rules, derived intuitively by players of a video game called Eterna, for determining the difficulty of designing desired structures composed of RNA molecules. Unlike previous crowdsourcing efforts for which scientific experts have reached out to online gamers, the gamers themselves took the lead in this paper. Three experienced Eterna gamers distilled their community s ideas into online Google documents and then contacted expert researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine and elsewhere to independently test their ideas using high-performance supercomputers. The final paper is a condensed version of the gamers  own documents. Once dismissed as a relatively boring component of living cells, RNA is now understood to underlie virtually every critical process in biology and is increasingly appreciated as a potential medical and industrial tool. While each RNA molecule begins its existence as a linear chain of subunits, it quickly folds into a thermodynamically stable shape that depends on the molecule s particular sequence of component subunits. That shape, in turn, dictates which cell components the RNA molecule will interact with and how. Scientists  improving ability to computationally model and design RNA raises the promise of a new generation of RNA-based therapies customized to specific cancers, viruses, neurological abnormalities and inherited disorders. Crowdsourcing scientific discovery The paper, which will also appear in March in a special print issue of the journal devoted to RNA design, signifies an evolution of how crowdsourcing can impact scientific discovery, said its senior author, Rhiju Das, PhD, associate professor of biochemistry at Stanford. The paper s research was not guided or collated by expert scientists, as has been the case in prior work from Eterna and other scientific discovery projects, but by the non-experts in the gaming community.  It s important to capture these insights and make them both public and credible via publication in peer-reviewed journals,  he said. One striking finding of the Eterna consortium (known as the Eterna Massive Open Laboratory): RNA molecules that are symmetrical, pleasing to the eye and that fold stably are also hard to design; the more symmetrical the desired shape, the more difficult to achieve it. It s important to capture these insights and make them both public and credible via publication in peer-reviewed journals. Launched in 2011 by Das and Adrien Treuille, PhD, an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University, Eterna now boasts more than 100,000 registered players, said Das. The interactive online video game challenges players to design chemical sequences of RNA that fold stably into desired shapes. Sequences that look promising in terms of their thermodynamic stability   as predicted by algorithms whose job it is to assess this feature   are synthesized in Das  laboratory and tested to see what structure the RNA sequences actually assume. Anyone age 13 or older can register to play by going to the game s official website, Eternagame.org. No special skills or biochemistry training of any sort are required.  It s not even necessary to know what RNA is or does,  Das said. Rating RNA-design difficulty Until now, there has been no established rating scale for RNA-design difficulty, Das said. A biomedical researcher is not able to easily assess the difficulty of designing an RNA structure for a diagnostic or therapy, and therefore may waste significant time and money trying to create difficult or near-impossible shapes for an RNA molecule to assume. Even though attaining a rating scale for RNA design was not the mission of Eterna, experienced Eterna gamers noted how useful such a difficulty rating would be in guiding new players from easier to harder  puzzles.  These experienced gamers took it upon themselves to compile a list of particular features that render RNA shapes difficult to design sequences for. They carried out tests using their own personal computers. They then contacted scientists in Das  lab with a set of predictions to test their ideas   a set of 100 hypothetical RNA shapes that experienced Eterna players rated from relatively  designable  to nearly  intractable.  The scientists used Stanford supercomputers to test these predictions against a half-dozen standard algorithms developed for the purpose of supplying RNA sequences that fold into specified shapes, and they found that the players  rankings correlated strongly with the algorithms  ability to solve these puzzles. Indeed, the hardest puzzles, which could be solved by experienced Eterna players, were not solvable by any of the algorithms even when given numerous days of computer time. In some cases, these now-confirmed intuitions overthrow conventional thinking in the RNA-design community about which designs are likely to be attainable and which intractable, Das said. For instance,  the players discovered on their own, and the algorithms independently confirmed, that the more symmetrical a requested structure is, the harder it will be to design,  he said.","Published: February 18, 2016"

Together with other recent findings, the discovery enriches a critical new dimension to the  Central Dogma  of molecular biology: the epitranscriptome.  This discovery further opens the window on a whole new world of biology for us to explore,  said Chuan He, the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and senior author of the study.  These modifications have a major impact on almost every biological process.  The central dogma of molecular biology describes the cellular pathway where genetic information from DNA is copied into temporary RNA  transcripts,  which provide the recipe for the production of proteins. Since Francis Crick first postulated the theory in 1956, scientists have discovered a multitude of modifications to DNA and proteins that regulate this process. Only recently, however, have scientists focused on investigating dynamic modifications that specifically target the RNA step. In 2011, He s group discovered the first RNA demethylase that reverses the most prevalent mRNA methylation N6-methyladenosine, or m6A, implying that the addition and removal of the methyl group could dramatically affect these messengers and impact the outcome of gene expression, as also seen for DNA and histones. Subsequently, scientists discovered that the dynamic and reversible methylation of m6A dramatically controlled the metabolism and function of most cellular messenger RNA, and thus, the production of proteins. In the new study, researchers from UChicago and Tel Aviv University describe a second functional mRNA methylation, N1-methyladenosine, or m1A. Like m6A, the small modification is evolutionarily conserved and common, and present in humans, rodents and yeast, the authors found. But its location and effect on gene expression reflect a new form of epitranscriptome control and suggest an even larger cellular  control panel.   The discovery of m1A is extremely important, not only because of its own potential in affecting biological processes, but also because it validates the hypothesis that there is not just one functional modification,  He said.  There could be multiple modifications at different sites where each may carry a distinct message to control the fate and function of mRNA.  The researchers estimated that m1A was present on transcripts of more than one out of three expressed human genes. Methylated genes exhibited enhanced translation compared to unmethlyated genes, producing protein levels nearly twice as high in all cell types. This increase suggests that m1A, like m6A, may be a mechanism by which cells rapidly boost the expression of hundreds or thousands of specific genes, perhaps during important processes such as cell division, differentiation or under stress.  mRNA is the perfect place to regulate gene expression, because they can code information from transcription and directly impact translation; you can add a consensus sequence to a group of genes and use a modification of the sequence to readily control several hundred transcripts simultaneously,  He said.  If you want to rapidly change the expression of several hundred or a thousand genes, this offers the best way.  However, despite their complementary effects, m1A and m6A exert their influence on mRNA through different pathways. While studies have found that m6A localizes predominantly to the tail of messenger RNA molecules, increasing their translation and turnover rate, m1A was found largely near the start codon of mRNA transcripts, where protein translation begins. The different mechanisms could allow for finer tuning of post-transcriptional gene expression, or the selective activation of particular genes in different physiological situations.  This study represents a breakthrough discovery in the exciting, nascent field of the  epitranscriptome,  which is how RNAs are regulated, akin to the genome and the epigenome,  said Christopher Mason, associate professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was not affiliated with the study.  What is important about this work is that m6A was recently found to enrich at the ends of genes, and now we know that m1A is what is helping regulate the beginning of genes, and this opens up many questions about revealing the  epitranscriptome code  just like the histone code or the genetic code.  Future studies will examine the role of m1A methylation in human development, diseases such as diabetes and cancer, and its potential as a target for therapeutic uses.","Published: February 18, 2016"

Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, developed a test called the Ecosystem Diversity Index which combines methods used by ecologists with a powerful cancer imaging technique to pick out cancerous cells from normal cells in tumours. The test identified several particularly aggressive subgroups of breast cancer and was a stronger predictor of survival than many established markers for the disease. It was effective at predicting survival chances in high-grade tumours. Researchers combined software taken from the study of ecology with image analysis and examined 1,026 samples of untreated breast tumours from three different hospitals. They analysed three distinct cell types   cancer cells, immune system lymphocytes and stromal cells, which produce connective tissue   in place of species of animals and plants in natural ecosystems. Predictive score Patients with high-grade tumours larger than five centimetres in diameter whose tumours scored high on the Ecosystem Diversity Index had a 16% chance of surviving five years, compared with 50% for tumours with low diversity scores. The ICR researchers also looked at the Ecosystem Diversity Index in addition to genetic factors   the first time a study has analysed the impact of different cell types around a tumour together with genetic information. They found that patients who had tumours with a high diversity score together with mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene had especially poor survival chances. Study leader Dr Yinyin Yuan, Team Leader in the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at the ICR, said:  Our findings show that mathematical models of ecological diversity can spot more aggressive cancers. By analysing images of the environment around a tumour based on Darwinian natural selection principles, we can predict survival in some breast cancer types even more effectively than many of the measures used now in the clinic.  In the future, we hope that by combining cell diversity scores with other factors that influence cancer survival, such as genetics and tumour size, we will be able to tell apart patients with more or less aggressive disease so we can identify those who might need different types of treatment.  Dr Rachael Natrajan, Team leader in the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at the ICR, said:  We have known for a while that genetic diversity between cancer cells in tumours is associated with more aggressive disease, and our new results also show that diversity of cells within the tumour microenvironment also contributes to aggressive breast cancer. Integration of our new measure with genetic alterations can actually provide additional prognostic information from just genetics alone, and may pave the way for a new wave of diagnostic biomarkers.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of the ICR, said:  This ingenious study has combined techniques developed in ecology and cell biology with computer vision technology to develop a totally new predictive test which could ultimately be used for patients in the clinic.  It teaches us a valuable lesson   we should always remember that cancer cells are not developing and growing in isolation, but are part of a complex ecosystem that involves normal human cells too. By better understanding these ecosystems, we aim to create new ways to diagnose, monitor and treat cancer. ","Published: February 18, 2016"

These do not lead to a change in the protein sequence but which may still have major negative effects on the ability of bacteria to survive. New research from Uppsala University has now shown that an organism can efficiently compensate for the negative effects.  For a long time it has been believed that synonymous mutations are 'silent', i.e. that they have no effect - positive or negative - on the gene product (protein) or on the growth and survival of the organism. However, in recent years several studies have shown that these mutations still often cause problems for the organism even though they do not change the protein sequence. ""An important question for evolutionary biologists and geneticists is therefore why these mutations have a negative effect. Our study shows why they are deleterious and how efficiently and rapidly a bacterium can genetically compensate for the negative effects of such mutations by means of additional new mutations,"" says Dan I. Andersson, senior author of the study. For the present study, researchers looked more closely at four synonymous but costly mutations in the gene for a ribosomal protein. They observed that the main problem with these mutations was that they caused a decrease in production of the mutated ribosomal protein. The cells entered into a vicious circle in which low protein levels resulted in defective ribosomes that in turn caused further problems with protein synthesis. By allowing these low fitness bacteria to grow for many generations it was possible to see that evolution solved the problem of synonymous mutations by creating compensatory mutations that restored the level of ribosomal protein to normal. In this way, the researchers have gained a greater understanding of why silent mutations might reduce fitness was and how bacteria could compensate for them. ""It is probably possible to find similar effects of 'silent' mutations in many other genes and organisms, especially in the genes which code for proteins which participate in the cell's central information flow,"" says Anna Kn ppel, a doctoral student at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology at Uppsala University.","Published: February 18, 2016"

""We want to stay one step ahead of these clandestine laboratories making illegal opioids for black market demand,"" said Kim Janda, the Ely R. Callaway Jr. Professor of Chemistry and member of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI. ""The importance of this new vaccine is that it can block the toxic effects of this drug, a first in the field."" The Need for Treatments The new vaccine targets an opioid called fentanyl, a painkiller 50 to 500 times more potent than morphine. Over the years--to skirt U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration detection--many illicit laboratories have tweaked fentanyl's molecular structure, selling fentanyl variants under names such as ""China white"" and acetyl fentanyl, the latter of which was responsible for a cluster of deaths recently in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. With so many variants on the market, users have no way of knowing the strength of the drugs they are using, which can lead to fatal overdoses. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 200-percent increase in overdose deaths involving opioids from 2000 to 2014, citing the availability of fentanyl and fentanyl variants as a major contributor. While there are treatments such as naloxone for opioid overdose or methadone for addiction, Janda noted that many people still relapse. ""These treatments are working for some people, but there is clearly a gap that needs attention,"" he said. A Potential Vaccine The new vaccine takes advantage of the body's own immune system. The vaccine cocktail contains a molecule that mimics fentanyl's core structure. When given the vaccine, the immune system is ""trained"" to produce antibodies to neutralize it. The idea is that when a person then tries to get high from fentanyl or its variants, their antibodies bind to the drug and keep it from reaching the brain. In theory, blocking the ability to feel a high could stop drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. Janda and his colleagues tested the vaccine in mouse models of fentanyl addiction and overdose. Mice were given three vaccinations, each two weeks apart--like a series of booster shots. By studying antibodies in the blood, the researchers saw that the immune system was successfully neutralizing fentanyl for months after the last injection. In further tests, the researchers observed that vaccinated mice given fentanyl did not demonstrate ""high"" behavior (such as ignoring discomfort). In fact, a 30-fold greater-than-normal dose of fentanyl was necessary for the drug to activate neural circuits in vaccinated mice. Remarkably, antibodies generated by the vaccine protected against overdose, neutralizing lethal levels of fentanyl. ""To the best of our knowledge, our active vaccine is the first to ablate lethal doses of any drug of abuse,"" said TSRI Research Associate Atsushi Kimishima, co-first author of the new study with TSRI graduate student Paul Bremer. ""This surprised us the most,"" added Bremer. Importantly, the potential vaccine protects against virtually all fentanyl derivatives and does not cross-react with other drug classes, such as oxycodone. This means those vaccinated would still have painkiller options in medical situations. The researchers said the next step in this research is to design an even more potent vaccine, perhaps a combined anti-fentanyl and heroin vaccine. ""Since heroin is often cut with fentanyl derivatives, a combination vaccine targeting both opioids would be worth investigating,"" said Bremer.","Published: February 18, 2016"

Collected in Denmark - where antibiotics were banned in agriculture from the 1990s for non-therapeutic use - the soil archives provide an 'antibiotic resistance timeline' that reflects resistant genes found in the environment and the evolution of the same types of antibiotic resistance in medicine. Led by Newcastle University, UK, the study also showed that the repeated use of animal manure and antibiotic substitutes can increase the capacity of soil bacteria to mobilise, or ready themselves, and acquire resistance genes to new antibiotics. Publishing their findings today in the academic journal Scientific Reports, the study's authors say the data highlights the importance of reducing antibiotic use across all sectors if we are to reduce global antibiotic resistance. Lead author David Graham, Professor of Ecosystems Engineering at Newcastle University, said: ""The observed bridge between clinical and agricultural antibiotic resistance means we are not going to solve the resistance problem just by reducing the number of antibiotics we prescribe in our GP clinics. ""To reduce the global rise in resistance we need to reduce use and improve antibiotic stewardship across all sectors. ""If this is not done, antibiotic resistance from imprudent sectors will cross-contaminate the whole system and we will quickly find ourselves in a situation where our antibiotics are no longer effective."" Antibiotics have been used in medicine since the 1930s, saving millions of lives. Two decades later they were introduced into agricultural practices and Denmark was among the leaders in employing antibiotics to increase agricultural productivity and animal production. However, a growing awareness of the antibiotic resistance crisis and continued debate over who and which activities are most responsible led to the EU calling for the use of antibiotics in non-therapeutic settings to be phased out and Denmark led the way. The Askov Long-Term Experiment station in Denmark was originally set up in 1894 to study the role of animal manure versus inorganic fertilisers on soil fertility. Analysing the samples, the team - involving experts from Newcastle University, the University of Strathclyde and Aarhus University - were able to measure the relative abundance of specific  -lactam antibiotic resistant genes, which can confer resistance to a class of antibiotics that are of considerable medical importance. Prior to 1960, the team found low levels of the genes in both the manured soil and that treated with inorganic fertiliser. However, by the mid 1970's, levels of selected  -lactam genes started to increase in the manured soils, with levels peaking in the mid 1980's. No increase or change was detected in the soil treated with inorganic fertiliser. ""We chose these resistant genes because their appearance and rapid increase in hospitals from 1963 to 1989 is well-documented,"" explains Professor Graham. ""By comparing the two timelines, we saw the appearance of each specific gene in the soil samples was consistent with the evolution of similar types of resistance in medicine. So the question now is not which came first, clinical or environmental resistance, but what do we do about it?"" Following the ban on non-therapeutic antibiotic use in Danish agriculture, farmers substituted metals for antibiotics, such as copper, and levels of the key  -lactam genes in the manured soils declined rapidly, reaching pre-industrialisation levels by 2010. However, at the same time the team measured a 10-fold rise in Class 1 Integrons. These are gene carrier and exchange molecules - transporters which allow bacteria to readily share genes, including resistance genes. These findings suggest the application of manure and antibiotic substitutes, such as copper, may be 'priming' the soils, readying them for increased resistance transmission in the future. ""Once antibiotics were banned, operators substituted them with copper which has natural antibiotic properties,"" explains Professor Graham. ""More research is needed but our findings suggest that by substituting antibiotics for metals such as copper we may have increased the potential for resistance transmission. ""Unless we reduce use and improve stewardship across all sectors - environmental, clinical and agricultural - we don't stand a chance of reducing antibiotic resistance in the future.""","Published: February 18, 2016"

A single generation of adaptation to the hatchery resulted in observable changes at the DNA level that were passed on to offspring, scientists reported. This research was conducted at Oregon State University in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife. Scientists say the findings essentially close the case on whether or not wild and hatchery fish can be genetically different. Differences in survival and reproductive success between hatchery and wild fish have long offered evidence of rapid adaptation to the hatchery environment. This new DNA evidence directly measured the activity of all genes in the offspring of hatchery and wild fish. It conclusively demonstrates that the genetic differences between hatchery and wild fish are large in scale and fully heritable. ""A fish hatchery is a very artificial environment that causes strong natural selection pressures,"" said Michael Blouin, a professor of integrative biology in the OSU College of Science. ""A concrete box with 50,000 other fish all crowded together and fed pellet food is clearly a lot different than an open stream."" It's not clear exactly what traits are being selected for, but the study was able to identify some genetic changes that may explain how the fish are responding to the novel environment in the hatchery. ""We observed that a large number of genes were involved in pathways related to wound healing, immunity, and metabolism, and this is consistent with the idea that the earliest stages of domestication may involve adapting to highly crowded conditions,"" said Mark Christie, lead author of the study. Aside from crowding, which is common in the hatchery, injuries also happen more often and disease can be more prevalent. The genetic changes are substantial and rapid, the study found. It's literally a process of evolution at work, but in this case it does not take multiple generations or long periods of time. ""We expected hatcheries to have a genetic impact,"" Blouin said. ""However, the large amount of change we observed at the DNA level was really amazing. This was a surprising result."" With the question put to rest of whether hatchery fish are different, Blouin said, it may now be possible to determine exactly how they are different, and work to address that problem. When the genetic changes that occur in a hatchery environment are better understood, it could be possible to change the way fish are raised in order to produce hatchery fish that are more like wild fish. This research is a first step in that direction.","Published: February 18, 2016"

If MYC is turned off in mice, embryonic stem cells and early embryos enter a reversible biochemical state of dormancy. However, this does not affect their ability to differentiate into any cell type of the body. When MYC is reactivated, the dormant embryos are able to develop into healthy animals.  After a gestation period of around ten months, fawns are born in early summer   when the weather is warm and food is plentiful for the mother. Six months would actually be enough for the embryo s development, but then offspring from mating in the later portion of summer would be born in winter. Therefore, nature prolongs the gestation period by a hormone-regulated pause in the development of the early embryos. Many animal species use this process, called diapause, to adjust their reproduction to environmental conditions. In their research on embryonic stem cells, Andreas Trumpp and colleagues have now discovered the factor that controls this developmental pause. Trumpp is head of a research department at the DKFZ and of Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM), which is based at the DKFZ and supported by the Dietmar Hopp Foundation. It is known in many types of cancer that the more MYC they produce, the more aggressively the tumors grow. The scientists had noticed that MYC is also active in embryonic stem cells. In order to explore the role that the gene plays in these cells, the investigators obtained embryonic stem cells from mice whose MYC genes (c-MYC and N-MYC) they could selectively deactivate. The resulting embryonic MYC-depleted stem cells strongly reduced the activity of genes that play a role in cell division, cellular growth and metabolism. However, the dormant cells stayed alive and retained their identity as stem cells: they continued producing the important ""stem cell factors"" that enable them to differentiate into the more than 200 cell types of the body. Using a chemical substance that inhibits MYC, the scientists were able to show that this biochemical dormancy is reversible. When they stopped giving the inhibitor, the cells immediately resumed RNA, protein and DNA synthesis and were able to proliferate infinitely. Inhibiting MYC activity arrests embryonic development  The biochemical dormancy of MYC-depleted stem cells reminded us strongly of the process of diapause, which has remained completely elusive so far,  says Roberta Scognamiglio, who is the first author of the study.  In this process, too, embryos in the early development state, called blastocysts, enter a dormant state without growth and almost without metabolism prior to nidation in the uterus.  In order to find out whether these two phenomena have the same cause, the researchers compared the activity of all genes in MYC-depleted embryonic stem cells with those in diapaused mouse blastocysts. In both cases, the groups of genes that were inactive besides MYC primarily controlled protein synthesis and cell growth. The stem cell factors, however, continued to be produced unchanged. When the researchers treated normal blastocysts in the Petri dish with the MYC inhibitor, they fell into a diapause-like state. These dormant embryos were subsequently transferred into surrogate mother mice and grew to become normal young animals.  To induce diapause or to put embryonic stem cells into a dormant state, it is therefore sufficient to deactivate the MYC oncogene,  Trumpp summarizes.  This does not affect the potential of stem cells. This is a very special property of stem cells, because all other cell types die after MYC inhibition.  Trumpp thinks that MYC can also have a disastrous effect on cancer stem cells, particularly on dormant metastasis stem cells. When they migrate through the bloodstream to distant organs, they may come under the influence of signaling molecules that form, for example, in inflammatory processes. These might stimulate their MYC production and thus cause them to grow into metastases.  We now try blocking MYC as a strategy to control these dangerous sleepers,  the stem cell researcher says.","Published: February 18, 2016"

Friedreich's ataxia results from modifications to DNA sequences that prevent cells from producing enough of a needed protein called frataxin. The lack of frataxin can result in a variety of problems that include loss of muscle control, fatigue, vision or hearing impairment, slurred speech, and serious heart conditions. See Also: Genetic defect underlying a rare disease identified Using synthetic RNA or DNA, researchers have identified a way to allow normal frataxin production to resume. ""The synthetic DNA or RNA prevents the mutant sequence from bending back and blocking the frataxin gene. This action activates the frataxin gene, which then makes frataxin RNA and protein at normal levels,"" said Dr. David Corey, Professor of Pharmacology and Biochemistry. ""In addition, our approach is selective for targeting the frataxin gene FXN and does not affect other genes."" In contrast to the CRISPR genomic editing technique, which requires modifications to genes, the molecules in this study are synthetic. The DNA and RNA belong to classes of molecules that already are being used clinically, making development of a new therapy more straightforward, said Dr. Corey, who holds the Rusty Kelley Professorship in Medical Science. For use in Friedreich's ataxia, the remaining challenge will be to adequately deliver the synthetic molecules to tissues that are affected by the disease, but those challenges are being addressed by existing clinical programs targeting Huntington's disease and spinal muscular atrophy, Dr. Corey said. Learn More: Cerebellar ataxia can't be cured, but some cases can be treated About one in 50,000 people have Friedreich's ataxia, and typical onset is between 5 and 18 years of age, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The disease is caused by cells making too little of the protein frataxin, although the proteins that are made are considered normal. ""The problem arises because of a mutation within the frataxin gene FXN that does not code for protein. In this case, the mutation causes the synthesis of a longer piece of RNA. This longer sequence binds the DNA and gums up the works, blocking RNA production needed to produce the frataxin protein,"" Dr. Corey said.

The proof-of-concept feat, described in the Journal of Neural Engineering, represents a potential advance in technologies to restore refined hand function to those who have lost arms to injury or disease, the researchers say. The young man on whom the experiment was performed was not missing an arm or hand, but he was outfitted with a device that essentially took advantage of a brain-mapping procedure to bypass control of his own arm and hand. See Also: Research grasps how the brain plans gripping motion ""We believe this is the first time a person using a mind-controlled prosthesis has immediately performed individual digit movements without extensive training,"" says senior author Nathan Crone, MD, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""This technology goes beyond available prostheses, in which the artificial digits, or fingers, moved as a single unit to make a grabbing motion, like one used to grip a tennis ball."" For the experiment, the research team recruited a young man with epilepsy already scheduled to undergo brain mapping at The Johns Hopkins Hospital's Epilepsy Monitoring Unit to pinpoint the origin of his seizures. While brain recordings were made using electrodes surgically implanted for clinical reasons, the signals also control a modular prosthetic limb developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Prior to connecting the prosthesis, the researchers mapped and tracked the specific parts of the subject's brain responsible for moving each finger, then programmed the prosthesis to move the corresponding finger. First, the patient's neurosurgeon placed an array of 128 electrode sensors all on a single rectangular sheet of film the size of a credit card on the part of the man's brain that normally controls hand and arm movements. Each sensor measured a circle of brain tissue 1 millimeter in diameter. The computer program the Johns Hopkins team developed had the man move individual fingers on command and recorded which parts of the brain the ""lit up"" when each sensor detected an electric signal. In addition to collecting data on the parts of brain involved in motor movement, the researchers measured electrical brain activity involved in tactile sensation. To do this, the subject was outfitted with a glove with small, vibrating buzzers in the fingertips, which went off individually in each finger. The researchers measured the resulting electrical activity in the brain for each finger connection. After the motor and sensory data were collected, the researchers programmed the prosthetic arm to move corresponding fingers based on which part of the brain was active. The researchers turned on the prosthetic arm, which was wired to the patient through the brain electrodes, and asked the subject to ""think"" about individually moving thumb, index, middle, ring and pinkie fingers. The electrical activity generated in the brain moved the fingers. ""The electrodes used to measure brain activity in this study gave us better resolution of a large region of cortex than anything we've used before and allowed for more precise spatial mapping in the brain,"" says Guy Hotson, graduate student and lead author of the study. ""This precision is what allowed us to separate the control of individual fingers."" Learn more: New prosthetic arm controlled by neural messages Initially, the mind-controlled limb had an accuracy of 76 percent. Once the researchers coupled the ring and pinkie fingers together, the accuracy increased to 88 percent. ""The part of the brain that controls the pinkie and ring fingers overlaps, and most people move the two fingers together,"" says Crone. ""It makes sense that coupling these two fingers improved the accuracy."" The researchers note there was no pre-training required for the subject to gain this level of control, and the entire experiment took less than two hours. Crone cautions that application of this technology to those actually missing limbs is still some years off and will be costly, requiring extensive mapping and computer programming. According to the Amputee Coalition, over 100,000 people living in the US have amputated hands or arms, and most could potentially benefit from such technology.

Recent studies show it to be an effective vehicle for shuttling functional proteins, such as active enzymes, into the spinal cord after a muscle injection. The findings suggest TAxI holds promise for carrying biologic drugs into this pharmaceutically hard-to-reach location. See Also: Enhancing neuronal activity promotes axon regeneration in adult CNS Peptides short chains of amino acid building blocks can be useful in specific biological jobs. TAxI stands for the work of this particular peptide: targeted axonal import. By taking an unusual route to deliver its cargo, TAxI doesn't confront the natural barrier between the blood and the spine and brain. This barrier guards against damaging substances, but it also locks out helpful medications. A study published this February 16 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that, in mice, a muscle injection of TAxI could transport a recombinant protein into spinal motor neurons. These nerve cells are stationed within the spinal cord, but extend their fibers to innervate muscles and control their movement.

Credit: University of Washington  ""Biologic therapeutics, such as proteins or nucleic acids, are notoriously difficult to get into the central nervous system,"" said Suzie Hwang Pun, the Robert F. Rushmer Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington (UW) and senior author of the work. ""Our group initiated this work to develop delivery vehicles that access the spinal cord by mimicking the route some viruses and toxins take."" Other labs have been attempting to design delivery systems with vectors derived from denatured human viruses, such as herpes simplex, to tap into the propensity of those viruses to enter brain and spine nerve cells. The TAxI peptide approach avoids the use of engineered viruses which have associated safety concerns, high costs of production, dosage control issues, and immune reactions. ""We believe that TAxI could be a significant advance in developing treatments for motor neuron diseases,"" noted Pun. An example of a motor neuron disorder is Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In ALS the muscles can become progressively weaker, until breathing and swallowing are affected. Drew Sellers, the lead author and a University of Washington research assistant professor of bioengineering, discovered TAxI's transit powers by screening a huge library of peptide sequence options from genetically modified bacteriophages - viruses that infect bacteria. The researchers were trying to overcome a major obstacle in treating neurodegenerative diseases: the lack of an effective, minimally invasive technology for delivering macromolecular drugs into the brain and spinal cord. Sellers became interested the repair of damage to the spinal cord from illness or injury while conducting regenerative medicine research with Philip Horner, director of neurodegenerative medicine at Houston Methodist Research Institute and formerly of the UW. Horner is co-senior author on the TAxI study. Learn More: New discovery gives hope that nerves could be repaired after spinal cord injury TAxI circumvents the blood/spinal cord barrier by transiting from the injection site in a muscle into nerve axons - the long, fingerlike projections of the motor neuron controlling that muscle. The injection site in the mouse would be roughly analogous to the calf muscle in a person. TAxI then accumulates selectively in the lumbar section of the spinal cord, which is near the lower back. When introduced to human spinal cord samples in the lab, the peptide labeled the motor neurons. Sellers said that he didn't expect TAxI to work as well as it did. Now that it has passed early proof of concept experiments, the next steps, he said, are to elucidate its mechanism of action, to apply it in models of motor neuron disease, and, if additional tests continue to be successful, to develop it for clinical applications. The research on TAxI is opening the door to targeting a variety of neurodegenerative diseases via techniques that are gentler on patients than are catheters into the spine or other painful procedures. ""There is now the possibility that peptides may be designed to direct drugs for uptake to specific areas of the spine and brain,"" Sellers said.

Results show that a high percentage of participants reported clinically significant insomnia symptoms (52.7 percent), depression symptoms (39.6 percent) and nightmare problems (19.2 percent). Further analyses revealed that the indirect effects of overall emotion regulation difficulties were significant both for the relationship between insomnia and depression and nightmares and depression. Limited access to emotion regulation strategies such as problem-solving skills and the ability to decrease negative emotions emerged as the strongest, most significant indirect effect for both relationships. See Also: Expert panel recommends new sleep durations ""Our study findings suggest that firefighters with sleep difficulties are likely to experience greater struggles accessing strategies to regulate their emotions, especially when feeling upset. This, in turn, may lead to or worsen feelings of depression and low mood,"" said lead author Melanie Hom, a doctoral candidate in the Laboratory for the Study and Prevention of Suicide-Related Conditions and Behaviors within the department of psychology at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. ""These results are important because they provide a plausible explanation for why and how sleep problems may contribute to depression, which are critical questions for prevention and intervention."" Study results are published in Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, transient insomnia symptoms occur in 30 to 35 percent of the population. Chronic insomnia, which occurs at least three times per week for at least three months, affects about 10 percent of adults. Approximately 2 to 8 percent of the general population has a current problem with nightmares, and trauma-related nightmares are the most consistent problem reported by people who have post-traumatic stress disorder. Led by Hom and under the supervision of Dr. Thomas Joiner, the research team analyzed responses from 880 current and retired United States firefighters between the ages of 18 and 82 years. Participants completed a web-based survey of behavioral health. Self-report measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, PTSD Checklist, and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. ""Firefighters are typically faced with many demands, including difficult work schedules, and they often both witness and experience traumatic events,"" said Hom. ""It is not surprising that firefighters may experience sleep problems and depression, but it is critical that greater efforts be made to prevent and treat these problems.""

Over the last few years, sales in the pharmaceutical supply chain have accelerated across commercial supply and final dosage forms, where more complex solutions and higher margin products are common. Pharma companies seeking partners with new formulations, and the rise in complex and difficult to formulate compounds are driving the growth in this market.  Additionally, CPhI stated, generics and the increasing use of out-licensed formulations are a key factor behind its decision. In fact, since the introduction of the FDF zone at CPhI Worldwide in 2011, it has quickly grown to be the third largest part of the show totalling over 11,000 m2 in 2015.  Dosage forms represented will cover all types of solid dose, semi-solids, liquids, sprays and steriles from both pharma and biologics companies, including tablets, capsules, gels, parenteral drugs, vials, patches, creams, inhalation, nasal, sublingual and suppository. Rutger Oudejans, Brand Director Pharma at UBM EMEA, commented:  Finished dose formulations are already a huge part of CPhI Worldwide. And, both within the wider market and in terms of exhibitor numbers, it is one of the fastest growing areas in pharma. Our aim in 2016 is to cement FDF s reputation as the essential platform for launching and conducting business in the global finished dose market.  Jos  Escaich, Chief Executive Officer at Bioberica S.A., added:  Being at FDF is an incredible opportunity for Bioib rica to nurture new and previous business relations. We are the leading Western producer of heparin (the world's most commonly used anticoagulant and antithrombotic) and leaders in osteoarthritis and joint health. This year s CPhI Worldwide will be special to us for three reasons: it will be held  at home , in Barcelona; it is the celebration of the Centenary of the discovery of Heparin   we deliver 1/5 of the heparin doses in the world; and we are positioning our stand at the centre of the new co-located Finished Dosage Formulation event. Bioib rica has been present at CPhI Worldwide since its beginning, and this year FDF provides a great opportunity for us to present our products to a dedicated audience . FDF will be supported by its own dedicated content, and a more prescriptive 1-2-1 matchmaking platform   which will enable professionals within this supply chain to explore the latest developments, strategies and market analysis. Topics will include everything from the regulatory approvals, processes and changes, to key growth markets, new formulation technologies, distribution and commercialisation.  Cara Turner, Event Manager at UBM EMEA for FDF, added:  Whilst a number of our attendees do indeed work across both API and commercialised products, we took the decision to dedicate a co-located event to those looking to concentrate on finished product supply. In practical terms, this means we have created new content, sessions, networking and the best new business opportunities in one place. This way our attendees and exhibitors can more quickly identify leads through our company matchmaking platform and move between potential clients and customers. By launching FDF, we are creating the ideal set of conditions for exploring this thriving sector. So beyond the customers and potential clients attendees arrange meetings with, there is undoubtedly a wealth of further opportunities available from just exploring this part of the exhibition floor.

To speed up identification of the most efficient producers, researchers at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering describe new approaches to this process and demonstrate how genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can enable the generation and testing of billions of individual variants of a metabolic pathway in record time.  Biotechnologists that tinker with the metabolism of microorganisms to produce valued products look at the engineering process through the lens of the so-called 'design-build-test cycle.' The idea is that multiple iterations of this cycle ultimately allow the identification of combinations of genetic and metabolic elements that produce the highest levels of a desired drug or chemical. Key to the cycle s efficiency, however, is the ability to construct and test the largest number of variants possible; in the end, only a few of these variants will produce the product in industrially attractive amounts. In the Trends in Biotechnology article, Wyss Institute scientists George Church, Ph.D., and Jameson Rogers, Ph.D., lay out the current state-of-the-art for designing, building and testing many variants at a time, a methodology that bioengineers call 'multiplexing'. Church is a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member and Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Rogers, currently with the Boston Consulting Group, performed his work as a Harvard Pierce Fellow and Doctoral Student mentored by Church. Bioengineers thoroughly understand how metabolic pathways work on the biochemical level and have a plethora of DNA sequences encoding variants of all of the necessary enzymes at their disposal. Deploying these sequences with the help of computational tools and regulating their expression with an ever-growing number of genetic elements, gives them access to an almost infinite pool of design possibilities. Similarly, revolutionary advances in technologies enabling DNA synthesis and manipulation have made the construction of billions of microorganisms, each containing a distinct design variant, a routine process. ""The real bottleneck in achieving high-throughput engineering cycles lies in the testing step. Current technology limits the number of designs scientists can evaluate to hundreds, or maybe even a thousand, different designs per day. Often the assays necessary are painstaking and prone to user error,"" said Rogers. Church and Rogers discuss how genetically encoded biosensors can help bioengineers overcome this hurdle. Such biosensors work by coupling the amount of a desired product produced within a microorganism to the expression of an antibiotic resistance gene such that only high producers survive. Alternatively, the expression of a fluorescent protein can be used for high-speed sorting of rare but highly productive candidates from large populations of less productive microbes. ""Now, by having developed both types of genetically encoded biosensors we can close the loop of a fully multiplexed engineering cycle. This enables exploration of design spaces for specific metabolic pathways in much greater breadth and depth. Fluorescent biosensors, in particular, enable a brand new type of pipeline engineering in which we can observe metabolic product levels at all times during the process with extraordinary sensitivity and ability to further manipulate the engineering cycle,"" said Church. Earlier work by Church s team at the Wyss Institute already demonstrated that the levels of commercially valuable chemicals produced by bacteria could be raised through several rounds of a design-build-test cycle that employed an antibiotic selection-based biosensor. Now, Church and Rogers report in PNAS the unique advantages that fluorescent biosensors provide to bioengineers.""Our fluorescent biosensors are built around specialized proteins that directly sense commercially valuable metabolites. These sensor proteins switch on the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein, resulting in cellular brightness that is proportional to the amount of chemical produced within the engineered cells. We can literally watch the biological production of valuable chemicals in real-time as the synthesis occurs and isolate the highest producers out of cultures with billions of candidates,"" said Rogers, who was named one ofForbes' ""30 Under 30"" in Science for opening new perspectives in bioengineering. Using this strategy, the Wyss researchers have established fluorescent biosensors for the production of super-absorbent polymers and plastics like the coveted acrylate from which a range of products is made. In fact, the study established the first engineered pathway able to biologically produce acrylate from common sugar, rather than the previously required petroleum compounds. ""This newly emerging biosensor technology has the potential to transform metabolic engineering in areas ranging from industrial manufacturing to medicine, and it can have a positive impact on our environment by making the production of drugs and chemicals independent from fossil fuels,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

Recent studies show it to be an effective vehicle for shuttling functional proteins, such as active enzymes, into the spinal cord after a muscle injection.  The findings suggest TAxI holds promise for carrying biologic drugs into this pharmaceutically hard-to-reach location. Peptides   short chains of amino acid building blocks   can be useful in specific biological jobs.  TAxI stands for the work of this particular peptide, Targeted Axonal Import.  By taking an unusual route to deliver its cargo, TAxI doesn t confront the natural barrier between the blood and the spine and brain.  This barrier guards against damaging substances, but it also locks out helpful medications. A study showed that, in mice, a muscle injection of TAxI could transport a recombinant protein into spinal motor neurons.  These nerve cells are stationed within the spinal cord, but extend their fibers to innervate muscles and control their movement.  Biologic therapeutics, such as proteins or nucleic acids, are notoriously difficult to get into the central nervous system,  said Suzie Hwang Pun, the Robert F. Rushmer Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington and senior author of the work.  Our group initiated this work to develop delivery vehicles that access the spinal cord by mimicking the route some viruses and toxins take.  Other labs have been attempting to design delivery systems with vectors derived from denatured human viruses, such as herpes simplex, to tap into the propensity of those viruses to enter brain and spine nerve cells. The TAxI peptide approach avoids the use of engineered viruses which have associated safety concerns, high costs of production, dosage control issues, and immune reactions.  We believe that TAxI could be a significant advance in developing treatments for motor neuron diseases,  noted Pun.   An example of a motor neuron disorder is Lou Gehrig s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In ALS the muscles can become progressively weaker, until breathing and swallowing are affected.   Drew Sellers, the lead author and a University of Washington research assistant professor of bioengineering, discovered TAxI s transit powers by screening a huge library of peptide sequence options from genetically modified bacteriophages   viruses that infect bacteria. The researchers were trying to overcome a major obstacle in treating neurodegenerative diseases:  the lack of an effective, minimally invasive technology for delivering macromolecular drugs into the brain and spinal cord. Sellers became interested the repair of damage to the spinal cord from illness or injury while conducting regenerative medicine research with Philip Horner, director of neurodegenerative medicine atHouston Methodist Research Institute and  formerly of the UW. Horner is co-senior author on the TAxI study. TAxI circumvents the blood/spinal cord barrier by transiting from the injection site in a muscle into nerve axons   the long, fingerlike projections of the motor neuron controlling that muscle.  The injection site in the mouse would be roughly analogous to the calf muscle in a person. TAxI then accumulates selectively in the lumbar section of the spinal cord, which is near the lower back.  When introduced to human spinal cord samples in the lab, the peptide labeled the motor neurons.  Sellers said that he didn t expect TAxI to work as well as it did.  Now that it has passed early proof of concept experiments, the next steps, he said, are to elucidate its mechanism of action, to apply it in models of motor neuron disease, and, if additional tests continue to be successful,  to develop it for clinical applications. The research on TAxI is opening the door to targeting a variety of neurodegenerative diseases via techniques that are gentler on patients than are catheters into the spine or other painful procedures.   There is now the possibility that peptides may be designed to direct drugs for uptake to specific areas of the spine and brain,  Sellers said.","Published: February 17, 2016"

Located on Penn Medicine s campus amidst both clinical care and laboratory facilities, the CACT is poised to become an epicenter for research and early development of personalized cellular therapies for cancer, expanding on Penn s groundbreaking research using Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) technology, which enables a patient s own immune cells to be reprogrammed outside of their body and re-infused to hunt for and potentially destroy their tumors.  In only a few years, we have generated significant achievements that have moved the field of personalized cellular therapies forward, opening clinical trials to test these treatments not only for patients with blood cancers, but also those with solid tumors,  said Carl June, MD, the Richard W. Vague Professor in Immunotherapy in the department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine.  The CACT will allow us to leverage this progress to develop and test new approaches more quickly and expand our ability to manufacture personalized cell therapies for a greater number of trials.  The new facility is a marquee component of Penn's translational science efforts to expedite the development of novel therapies for many types of disease.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/beiging-white-fat-cells-to-fight-diabetes-187913, Beiging  White Fat Cells to Fight Diabetes Penn Study reveals a signaling pathway required for beige fat formation  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers are getting closer to learning how to turn white fat cells into brown fat cells, in a process called  beiging,  to bring down blood sugar levels and fight diabetes. The team, led by Joseph Baur, PhD, an assistant professor of Physiology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania published their findings this month.  Beiging of white fat could be harnessed to fight diabetes by burning excess calories to cause a decrease in blood sugar,  Baur said.  Our work suggests that activation of the mTOR pathway plays a critical role in this process.  Induction of beige fat cells is considered a promising strategy to combat obesity because of this cell type s ability to metabolize glucose and lipids, dissipating the resulting energy as heat. Brown and white fat cells, or adipocytes, play different roles in the body. While white adipocytes store energy as large fat droplets, brown adipocytes contain smaller fat droplets and are specialized to burn fat to produce heat. To do this brown adipocytes are packed with the powerhouses called mitochondria that contain iron, which gives them their brown color. In fact, babies are born with brown fat along the upper back and shoulders to keep warm. In adult humans, the recent discovery of brown fat  depots  is also associated with lower body weight. Brown-like fat cells, called beige adipocytes, also appear within white fat deposits in response to cold and other signals. The energy balance within the body is influenced by brown and beige adipocytes, which are stimulated into action by cold temperatures and other signals to burn fat and carbohydrates. The primary tool used in these studies was rapamycin, a drug that inhibits the protein mTOR (mechanistictarget of rapamycin), which can be found in two distinct protein complexes. It was first discovered as a byproduct of Streptomycin hygroscopicus, a bacterium found in a soil sample from Easter Island, an island also known as Rapa Nui, hence the name. Rapamycin is currently used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplant, but has recently attracted attention when it was discovered to extend lifespan in mice.   Interestingly, in 2012, Baur s lab discovered that rapamycin also causes insulin resistance due to its ability to inhibit both arms of the mTOR signaling pathway controlled by the protein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. They showed in an animal model that these two arms could, in principle, be separated to dissect which pathway controls longevity versus endocrine effects. In terms of physiology, mTOR signaling is involved in the control of blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and its inhibition increases the risk of diabetes. While previous studies suggested that mTORC1 inhibition would promote beiging of white fat cells, Baur s present work supports the notion that mTORC1 activity is actually required for cold-induced beiging of white fat cells. If activating mTORC1 directly can bring about the same result, then this approach could potentially be applied to combat diabetes.   In the Diabetes study, the team shows that rapamycin blocks the ability of cold or drugs that activate a specific neurotransmitter pathway to induce the appearance of beige fat cells. Accordingly, rapamycin-treated mice are cold-intolerant and fail to maintain body temperature and weight when moved to a colder environment. The findings demonstrate a positive role for mTORC1 in the recruitment of beige fat cells to white fat depots, which could explain some of the negative metabolic effects of mTOR inhibition.  Our study highlights the complex interconnection between mTOR signaling and metabolism,  said first author Cassie Tran, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Baur lab.  It will be critical in moving forward to determine the specific targets downstream of mTOR that are causing the negative metabolic effects in order to create better drugs and one day drugs that might also extend heathspan. The discovery of a critical signaling pathway for beige-fat formation also suggests the opportunity to target this pathway to therapeutically increase the number of heat-producing cells in obese or diabetic patients.

Stem cell-based replacement strategies could open new and much needed therapeutic avenues. Such approaches, using either patient-derived or donor-derived stem cells, have been taken in clinical trials but thus far have not fulfilled their early promises. To eventually be able to design more appropriate treatments, many cardiologists and regenerative biologists have come to think that novel assays are needed to better understand the basic science behind stem cell therapy. A new study by Kit Parker s research team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at Harvard University suggests that stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have weaker contractile strength than their biological counterparts isolated from heart tissue. The findings could help explain critical shortcomings of stem cell-derived heart muscle cells in clinical trials. ""Our study suggests the utility of basic, in vitro cell biology studies in explaining clinical observations and pointing to potential pitfalls of cell therapies. These kinds of studies, coupled with appropriate clinical approaches, may offer a unique strategy to vet new therapeutic opportunities,"" said Parker, Ph.D., who is a Core Faculty member of the Wyss Institute and the Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at SEAS. To study stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and compare their chemical and mechanical properties to those of cardiomyocytes in actual heart tissue, Parker s team made use of a previously engineered heart muscle on-a-chip platform that supports the growth and maturation of cardiomyocytes in two-cell microtissue constructs. Pairing up stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with each other (homogenous pairs) or with primary cardiomyocytes (heterogenous pairs) revealed surprising differences. ""We found that different types of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes form the expected cell-cell junctions between each other and with primary cardiomyocytes. Through these junctions, cardiomyocytes aligned their contractile machineries and contracted synchronously. However, when we investigated the contractile strengths of homogeneous and heterogeneous pairs with traction force microscopy, we found stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to be significantly weaker,"" said Francesco Pasqualini, Ph.D., who together with Yvonne Aratyn-Schaus, Ph.D., is a co-first author of the study. Both performed their work as Postdoctoral Fellows in Parker s team and Pasqualini was recently appointed a Senior Scientist at the newly founded Wyss Translational Center Zurich to continue his work in heart regenerative research. Interestingly, the team also noticed increased numbers of compensatory substrate adhesions between stronger and weaker cardiomyocytes in heterogenous pairs whose role it is to keep the pair from rupturing, but which might also transmit mechanotransductive signals. ""So far, these differences in contractility and adhesion have not been considered before the initiation of pre-clinical and clinical studies,"" said Pasqualini. ""And yet an equilibrated contractile strength may be necessary for cardiac cell therapy to work, independently from the exact type of transplanted cell"". In addition, the team built a computational model that can simulate the force imbalances present in heterogenous cell pairs of both murine and human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. ""This work is a nice example of the power of the beating heart-on-a-chip technology to gain greater insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie stem cell function in a tissue and organ context. It also could be used to select for more highly functional stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, or identify pharmacological or genetic interventions that can facilitate their use in regenerative medicine,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

We aim to start and report a number ofclinical studies with additional compounds in the CF portfolio throughout 2016.  SAPHIRA 2, an open-label study of two doses of GLPG1837 in at least six CF patients with theS1251N mutation, was first dosed in a patient last week. SAPHIRA 1, an open-label study of threedoses of GLPG1837 in at least 12 patients with the G551D mutation, is expected to begin dosingsoon. The SAPHIRA Phase 2 program will explore the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and medicinelikeproperties of GLPG1837 in patients in six EU countries and Australia.  Primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability; secondary objectives are to assess changes in sweat chloride from baseline as the biomarker of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel function and to explore the changes in pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) from baseline. Both studies will include subjects treated with Kalydeco 1 as well as those who are na ve to this drug. In each study, different doses of GLPG1837 tablets will be administered twice daily for a total duration of four weeks.","Published: February 17, 2016"

Originally formed by GSK, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the CTTV fosters deep, ongoing interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting and validating novel targets in drug development. The CTTV uses advances in genetic research and computational biology to help scientists with the crucial first step in exploring new medicines: finding where to start. Target validation, an exercise that clearly defines the role that a biological process plays in a disease, is a key initial phase of drug discovery. Currently, an estimated 90 percent of compounds entering clinical trials fail to demonstrate the necessary efficacy and safety requirements, never reaching patients as medicines. This is often because the biological target chosen is not well understood.  We are committed to advancing evidence-based target discovery and opening up the field for researchers to create innovative methods and tools to accelerate the development of new medicines,  says Sally John, vice president, Computational Biology & Genomics at Biogen.  Being part of the CTTV helps us realize this vision and provides a practical, harmonized way to share data with the scientific community.  Biogen s new membership follows the launch of the new CTTV Target Validation Platform which helps researchers identify therapeutic targets for new medicines. Underscoring its utility for drug discovery, the platform has had over 9000 visits since its launch in December 2015. Philip Ma, vice president, Digital Health Technology & Data Sciences at Biogen, adds:  The importance of accessing and managing searchable, structured data is critical to sharing knowledge on target validation. We look forward to combining our expertise in data sciences with the leading capabilities of GSK, the Sanger Institute and EMBL-EBI.   The CTTV is proud to announce the addition of Biogen to our collaboration to improve the process of identifying and validating targets,  elaborates Jeffrey Barrett, CTTV Director.  The pre-competitive nature of CTTV is critical: the collaboration of our members allows us to make the most of commercial R&D practice while making the data and information available to everyone. It is truly exciting to apply so many different areas of expertise, from cell biology to large scale genome analysis, to the challenge of creating better medicines.  The CTTV covers all aspects of human health and disease. The cornerstone of the collaboration is an agreement that experimental data and information gathered within the CTTV will be shared to benefit the broader scientific community, after basic quality control checks to ensure consistency with the data-sharing guidelines of both institutes. The CTTV welcomes new interest from companies and academic institutions that wish to accelerate the discovery of drug targets through open innovation.","Published: February 17, 2016"
