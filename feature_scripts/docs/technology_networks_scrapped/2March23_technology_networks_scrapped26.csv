Around you are a million tiny distractions: someone rustling in their bag; a door opening for latecomers; a phone vibrating or lighting up; another listener having a snack; a pen dropping on the floor. However, you remain focused, concentrating on the speaker, listening and engaging with the talk. See Also: How the brain ignores distractions But, how do you do that? New research shows that when we're paying attention to something, that information is processed in a continuous manner. But when we're trying to ignore something, we perceive and experience information in waves or frames, like scenes in a movie. Cognitive neuroscientist Kyle Mathewson and Sayeed Kizuk, graduate of the bachelor of science program in honours psychology and current master of science student, both of the University of Alberta (UofA), recently published research explaining the phenomena. ""We are better at prioritizing certain times when we are not attending to that space in the world,"" explains Mathewson, assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at UofA and Neuroscience and Mental Health institute affiliate. ""This research shows that the two processes for attending to space and attending to time interact with one another."" Our brains oscillate at many different frequencies, explains Mathewson, and each frequency has a different role. Learn More: Faster brain waves make shorter gaps in the visual stream ""This study examined 12 hertz alpha oscillations, a mechanisms used to inhibit, or ignore, a certain stimulus thereby allowing us to focus on a particular time or space that we are experiencing, while ignoring others,"" says Mathewson. For example, if there is a repetitive stimulus in the world, such as the sound of someone's voice in a lecture theatre, the alpha waves lock onto the timing of that stimulus, and the brain becomes better at processing things that occur in time with that stimulus. The new findings show, surprisingly, that this happens more in places we are ignoring. ""We are bombarded with so much information and stimulation that we can't possibly process it all at once. Whether it be commuting, engaging in our work, studying for a class, or working out, our brains select the useful information and ignore the rest, so that we can focus on a single or a few items in order to make appropriate responses in the world. This research helps explain how,"" says Mathewson. Mathewson is now working on stimulating the brain at alpha frequencies in order to understand how to improve brain function in meaningful ways. For instance, improving one's ability to focus and perform in real-world situations, such as working on a project or riding a bike.

Bacterial meningitis happens when bacteria infect the central nervous system (CNS), causing a serious disease that can be life-threatening and difficult to diagnose and treat. Patients who survive often have permanent brain damage. See Also: Meningitis model shows infection s sci-fi-worthy creep into the brain Salmonella typhimurium is one of the most common causes of food-borne disease in the United States and often causes a self-limiting gastrointestinal (GI) infection. However, in people with impaired immune responses, Salmonella typhimurium can cause severe systemic infections, spreading through the blood to other organs. In some cases, the bacteria spread to the CNS, causing meningitis. People at risk include the very young and the elderly, people with advanced HIV/AIDS, and those with sickle cell disease. Salmonella meningitis, which was rare globally, is now one of the most common forms of bacterial meningitis in parts of Africa and has a high case fatality rate. Researchers at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) infected mice orally with Salmonella typhimurium to mimic food-borne infection. They found that Salmonella moved from the GI tract to the blood and then to the brain, resulting in meningitis. Damage observed in the brains of Salmonella-infected mice resembled that observed with human meningitis, providing a new model for investigators to study human disease. Collaborators include Salmonella and neuroimmunology experts at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories and biologists at the University of Colorado. Read Next: Pilot study successfully uses DNA sequencing to diagnose brain infections They plan to use the model to determine how Salmonella typhimurium infects and causes damage in the brain, including which immune cells are involved.

Many analysis products support traditional DNA typing, however, emerging methods, such as high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, require a collection of bioinformatics capabilities not supported by existing forensic applications. The platform created under this contract, referred to as ""Keystone,"" will provide an open architecture that allows bioinformatic data from any forensic science instrument to be analyzed via software plugins that integrate existing analytical tools or implement novel analytical methods. Parabon will develop plugins supporting common workflows, but Keystone's architecture will also enable third parties to develop plugins for particular instruments or analysis. Dr. Steven Armentrout, CEO at Parabon, says, ""New DNA technologies like next-generation sequencing and DNA phenotyping have the potential to revolutionize the forensics field, and Keystone will be the first comprehensive forensics software platform able to analyze the gamut of genomic datasets."" The Institute of Advanced Genetics (IAG) at the University of North Texas Health Science Center will assist the effort. Led by Dr. Bruce Budowle, an internationally recognized leader in DNA forensics, IAG has developed some of the bioinformatics tools that will be included. Dr. Budowle stated, ""The analytical tools developed by the forensic research community for next-generation DNA analysis are not designed to interoperate, and they require considerable expertise. Keystone will integrate these tools, under a common software infrastructure, facilitating the use of these powerful methods of DNA analysis."" The contract, funded by the Department of Defense Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capabilities and Prototyping, is in response to a DoD Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) solicitation. The RIF seeks to facilitate the rapid insertion of innovative technologies into military systems or programs that meet critical national security needs. The goal of this effort is to provide DoD DNA laboratories with the latest forensic DNA analysis tools under a single, easy-to-use platform, but Parabon also plans to commercially license Keystone to DNA laboratories around the globe.","Published: December 9, 2016"

It uses fluid dynamics and entrainment to increase its aerodynamic reach to sample vapors at increasingly large distances. Applying this bio-inspired design principle could lead to significantly improved vapor samplers for detecting explosives, narcotics, pathogens even cancer.  Following nature s lead, Staymates and colleagues from NIST, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Lincoln Laboratory and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fitted a dog-nose-inspired adapter to the front end of a commercially available explosives detector. Adding the artificial dog nose made on a 3-D printer to enable active sniffing improved odorant detection by up to 18 times, depending on the distance from the source. Trace detection devices now used at points of entry and departure such as airports and seaports, and other sensitive locations, typically employ passive sampling. Examples include equipment that requires swabbing hands or other surfaces and then running the sample through a chemical detector typically an ion mobility spectrometer. Wand-like vapor detectors accommodate more sampling mobility, but unless the detector scans immediately above it, the chemical signature of a bomb-making ingredient will go unnoticed. Aiming to uncover clues on how to improve trace detection capabilities, the researchers turned to one of nature s best chemical detectors: the dog. Through their review of previous studies, the team distilled what occurs during sniffing. Five times a second, dogs exhale to reach out, pull and then inhale to deliver a nose full of aromas for decoding by some 300 million receptor cells.  Using a 3-D printer, Staymates replicated the external features of a female Labrador retriever s nose, including the shape, direction, and spacing of the nostrils. Moving air through the artificial nose at the same rate that a dog inhales and exhales allowed them to mimic the air sampling or sniffing of dogs. With schlieren imaging a technique widely used in aeronautical engineering to view the flow of air around objects and high-speed video, the team first confirmed that their imitation nose could indeed sniff much like the real thing, a property documented in previous studies of live dogs. With each sniff, air jets exit from both nostrils, moving downward and outward. Though it might seem counterintuitive, the air jets entrain or draw in vapor-laden air toward the nostrils. During inhalation, the entrained air is pulled into each nostril. The team s first set of experiments compared the air-sampling performance of their  actively sniffing  artificial dog nose with that of trace-detection devices that rely on continuous suction. The head-to-head comparison with an inhalation system used with a real-time monitoring mass spectrometer found that sampling efficiency with the sniffing artificial dog nose was four times better 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) away from the vapor source and 18 times better at a stand-off distance of 20 centimeters (7.9 inches). On the basis of those results, the team chose to outfit a commercially available vapor detector with a bio-inspired 3D-printed inlet that would enable it to sniff like a dog, rather than to inhale only in 10-second intervals, the device s normal mode of operation. The switch resulted in an improvement in odorant detection by a factor of 16 at a stand-off distance of 4 centimeters (1.6 inches).  Their incredible air-sampling efficiency is one reason why the dog is such an amazing chemical sampler,  Staymates said.  It s just a piece of the puzzle. There s lots more to be learned and to emulate as we work to improve the sensitivity, accuracy, and speed of trace-detection technology.

Photographs and manual measurements are taken of all injuries during autopsies, but ordinary photography projects a 3D wound on a 2D space. Using technologies such as photogrammetry, it is possible to create 3D detailed, to-scale, true-color documentation of skin injuries from 2D pictures. A comparison between the measurements of 165 lesions taken during autopsies and on photogrammetrically processed pictures was performed. Different types of lesions were considered: 38 blunt force injuries, 58 sharp force injuries, and 69 gunshot injuries. In all cases, very low differences were found with mean   0.06 cm and median   0.04 cm; a mean difference of 0.13 cm was found for the blunt force injuries. Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed no statistically significant differences between the two measurement methods (p > 0.05). The results of intra- and inter-observer tests indicated perfect agreement between the observers with mean value differences of   0.02 cm. This study demonstrated the validity of using photogrammetry for documentation of injuries in a forensic pathological context. Importantly, photogrammetry provides a permanent 3D documentation of the injuries that can be reassessed with great accuracy at any time. Such 3D models may also be combined with 3D reconstruction obtained from post-mortem CT scans for a comprehensive documentation of the lesion (internal and external information) and ultimately used for virtual reconstruction.

See Also: Relief of dystonia symptoms is sustained in pediatric patients undergoing deep brain stimulation Described in the journal Neuron, the research has also led to the development of a new cell-based screening test that is being deployed on a large scale to identify new drug candidates to treat dystonia. ""We're excited to have found not only a new potential therapeutic inroad for multiple forms of dystonia, but also a mechanism that we think causes the disease,"" said Nicole Calakos, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurology at Duke University and a clinician who specializes in the care of patients with dystonia and other movement disorders. Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder, after Parkinson's disease and tremors. It is believed to affect 300 to 400 people per million population, and is more common in the elderly. The spectrum of dystonia's many distinct forms include rare inherited cases like DYT1 dystonia, which is caused by a specific mutation in a single gene and leads to a severe disorder that arises in childhood. A larger proportion of cases, grouped into non-familial dystonia, have no known cause and tend to occur during adulthood. In the study, the team uncovered a mechanism for dystonia that links together rare inherited dystonia with the more common non-familial cases. Learn More: 3-D computer model may help refine target for deep brain stimulation therapy for dystonia The path leading to this discovery started with a clinical observation more than six years ago. In 2009, Calakos became intrigued by a patient she had seen who had non-familial dystonia and harbored a rare variation in the same gene that causes childhood-onset DYT1 dystonia. This variant wasn't exactly the same as the DYT1 mutation, but the research team wanted to figure out whether it could have contributed to the patient's symptoms. The mutation seemed to cause the DYT1 protein to be stuck near the cell's nucleus, rather than where it should be in the cell's protein-making factory, the endoplasmic reticulum. That's the same misplacement of DYT1 found in childhood-onset dystonia. They published that case in the Journal of Medical Genetics in late 2009. The coincidence of finding the same protein displacement in the two different kinds of dystonia planted the seed for a new way of thinking about the disorder, Calakos said. In the new study, Duke neurobiology research analyst Zachary Caffall reasoned that if the DYT1 protein's proper location within the cell meant the difference between health and disease, then it might be possible to search for new treatments using the mutant protein's misplacement as tool for studying the disorder. The idea was risky but it worked. Caffall was able to engineer a human cell line in which the DYT1 protein is misplaced near the nucleus with the flick of a chemical switch. Using these cells, the team silenced each of 23,000 genes in the genome one by one to see which genes, when turned off, would correct the DYT1 protein's location to the endoplasmic reticulum. Their tests hit a handful of genes that pointed to a molecular pathway called eIF2-alpha. Read Next: Genetic cause of spinocerebellar ataxia identifiedThis pathway and related proteins respond to cell stress, such as that caused by misfolded proteins. And in the brain, eIF2-alpha is involved in adapting to experience by changing the strength of connections between brain cells. Problems with handling cell stress and brain adaptability are both thought to contribute to dystonia. In another rare dystonia known as DYT16, the activity of the eIF2-alpha pathway is weaker than usual. And in the new study, Calakos's team found that eIF2alpha activity is also lower in DYT1 patient samples. Another piece of evidence connected non-familial dystonia with both DYT1 and DYT16 dystonia. Calakos happened to have additional data on her desk from several years earlier: sequences of protein-coding genes from a small group of patients with non-familial dystonia. Her team looked at these data again, spotting rare variations in an eIF2-alpha pathway gene in several patients who had a form of dystonia called torticollis, which causes the neck to twist. Fortunately, numerous research groups and a (U.S.) National Institutes of Health- (NIH-) sponsored patient repository had already collected DNA from patients with torticollis. Pooling these data allowed Calakos's team to quickly determine that the eIF2alpha pathway gene was much more frequently altered in individuals with dystonia than in the general population. Calakos's team is now collaborating with NIH scientists to deploy their cell-based assay to identify drug-like chemicals that correct the DYT1 protein's location. So far, the researchers have screened more than 40,000 compounds. Calakos's lab is also developing better animal models of dystonia to understand how eIF2alpha pathway dysfunction affects the brain to cause dystonia. Calakos said the screen would not have been possible without seed funding and continued support from a disease foundation started by an affected family that was willing to support ""out-of-the-box"" ideas. Tyler's Hope Foundation for a Dystonia Cure was started in 2006 by Rick and Michelle Staab, whose firstborn Tyler (now a 19-year-old college student) was diagnosed with dystonia at age 7. The couple's daughter Samantha, now 15, was diagnosed on her seventh birthday. Their youngest, 11-year-old Luke, does not show symptoms but he has a 50% chance of having the gene. If he does have the gene, he has a 30% chance of having dystonia. Don't Miss: Targeting upper motor neurons to treat ALS ""We want to find a cure for our kids,"" Rick Staab said. Of the money Tyler's Hope raises, 97% funds high-risk, high-reward research. The Foundation is now supporting Calakos's research in looking for new drugs with the screening assay.

Studies suggest that it exhibits anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in humans. One of the main substances present in the beverage is harmine, a beta-carboline which potential therapeutic effects for depression has been recently described in mice. See Also: Healthy intestinal flora keeps the mind sharp with some help from the immune system ""It has been shown in rodents that antidepressant medication acts by inducing neurogenesis. So we decided to test if harmine, an alkaloid with the highest concentration in the psychotropic plant decoction ayahuasca, would trigger neurogenesis in human neural cells"", said Vanja Dakic, PhD student and one of the authors in the study. In order to elucidate these effects, researchers from the D'Or Institute for Research and Education and the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro exposed human neural progenitors to this beta-carboline. After four days, harmine led to a 70% increase in proliferation of human neural progenitor cells. Researchers were also able to identify how the human neural cells respond to harmine. The described effect involves the inhibition of DYRK1A, which is located on chromosome 21 and is over activated in patients with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease.

The work could have implications for our understanding of neurodevelopmental processes or traumatic brain injuries in humans. Troy Ghashghaei, associate professor of neurobiology at NC State, studies the ways neurons develop and integrate into the ""circuitry"" of the brain. Mice are an excellent model for study, because even in adulthood they continue to produce neurons in two regions, one of which deals with the smell, or olfactory, centers of the brain. See Also: Decoding characteristic food odors Working with a population of young adult mice, Ghashghaei and his team looked at olfactory neurons that were generated when the mice were either newborn or young adults. The team wanted to know if there was a difference between the function of neurons that developed at different life stages. ""One way to study the function of different populations of neurons is to shut them off during different behavioral paradigms,"" says Ghashghaei. To shut off neurons, they introduced a gene into olfactory stem cells in the mice. The gene encoded a protein that would respond to a particular drug by turning off those olfactory neurons after they had matured. Thus the researchers could shut off neurons that were generated at different developmental time points. Related: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells In young adult mice, stopping activity of adult-born neurons affected their ability to recognize and develop memories for novel food odors. In contrast, if the odor was aversive, or indicated danger like the scent of a fox, for example shutting off the adult-generated neurons had no effect; the mice responded normally by freezing in place. The adult-generated neurons, therefore, did not appear to have a role in mediating the innate response the mice had to aversive odors. Puzzled by this finding, Ghashghaei and the team wondered if neurons generated immediately after mice are born were connected with responses to aversive odors. So they shut off 'early-born' neurons in the mice and found that the usual response to aversive odors was interrupted: the mice seemed unaffected by presence of a fox odor. ""Developmentally, there is a progression of neuronal addition to the olfactory system in mice,"" Ghashghaei says. ""What this study demonstrates is that there are developmentally defined circuits generated at specific points in time that regulate different values of new sensory stimuli, and how sensory responses are processed and learned. Read Next: Humans  built-in GPS is our 3-D sense of smell ""The next questions to explore are how specific sets of neurons, generated at specific points in time, work together in complex behaviors, and how they may or may not be working in neurodevelopmental diseases or in conditions such as autism.

While previous studies have shown a link between heart disease and brain disease, less is known about the association between NT-proBNP and the entire spectrum of imaging markers of subclinical brain damage, like brain volume and white matter integrity. Researchers from the Netherlands recently investigated this association in 2,397 community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly non-demented people without a clinical diagnosis of heart disease. The patients were drawn from the landmark Rotterdam Study, an ongoing, population-based study of more than 10,000 people from a suburb of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. When the researchers compared serum levels of NT-proBNP with MRI findings, they discovered a clear association between higher NT-proBNP levels and brain damage. Learn More: Development of psychosis: Gray matter loss and the inflamed brain""We found that higher serum levels of NT-proBNP were associated with smaller brain volumes, in particular with smaller gray matter volume, and with poorer organization of the brain's white matter,"" said Meike W. Vernooij, MD, PhD, the study's lead author and a neuroradiologist at Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam. The findings imply a close link between the heart and brain even in presumably healthy individuals, Dr. Vernooij said. There are several hypotheses to explain the link between cardiac dysfunction and subclinical brain damage, according to Dr. Vernooij. For instance, decreases in blood flow could lead to cerebral microvascular damage or problems in the function of the blood-brain barrier, a network of blood vessels that allow essential nutrients into the brain while blocking potentially harmful substances. Inflammatory factors associated with cardiac stress could also harm the barrier, leading to increased permeability and damage to the brain. While NT-proBNP is currently used in a clinical setting to rule out heart failure, it is too early to say if it can play a similar role for subclinical brain damage, as the new study only looked at people at one point in time. Related: Imaging test may identify biomarker of Alzheimer's disease""We cannot rule out that the observed subclinical brain damage led to increased levels of NT-proBNP,"" Dr. Vernooij said. ""However, from a biological perspective, and based on animal studies, it is more likely that cardiac dysfunction affects brain changes rather than vice versa."" Further research, including follow-up brain MRI studies and measurements of NT-proBNP, will be needed to clarify the relationship between cardiac dysfunction and subclinical brain disease, the researchers said.

The findings could one day lead to improved treatments for people undergoing common therapies for cancer such as chemotherapy and radiation.  Blood-forming stem cells, or hematopoietic stem cells, are found in the bone marrow. These cells have two unique properties: They can self-renew and, through a process called differentiation, they can form any type of blood cell. A healthy immune system depends on the regenerative abilities of hematopoietic stem cells. Common cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation can eliminate cancer by killing cancer cells. But these treatments also damage hematopoietic stem cells, which can impede the cells  ability to regenerate blood, slowing the immune system and resulting in a longer, more complicated recovery for people with cancer. Previous research indicated that certain genes may alter hematopoietic stem cells  regenerative capacity by either accelerating or hindering the cells  ability to restore the immune system, but more research was needed to pinpoint the specific genetic activity and effects. One of the new studies focused on a gene called Grb10 that is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells. Grb10 s function was previously not known, so to better understand its role, the scientists deleted Grb10 from hematopoietic stem cells in lab dishes and in mice that had received radiation. They found that deleting Grb10 strongly promotes hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. In the other study, researchers analyzed a protein called DKK1. DKK1 is produced by a gene expressed by a specific  bone progenitor  cell that is present in the  niche,  or cellular environment, that surrounds the hematopoietic stem cell. Typically, bone progenitor cells regenerate bone, but scientists had previously hypothesized that these cells also play an important role in regulating hematopoietic stem cells  ability to self-renew and differentiate into other blood cells.  The cellular niche is like the soil that surrounds the stem cell  seed  and helps it grow and proliferate,  said Dr. John Chute, professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology Oncology in the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine and the study s senior author.  Our hypothesis was that the bone progenitor cell in the niche may promote hematopoietic stem cell regeneration after injury.  The researchers showed that adding DKK1 to hematopoietic stem cells in lab dishes and mice that had received radiation produced a cascade effect within the cell niche that greatly enhanced hematopoietic stem cells  ability to self-renew and differentiate into other blood cells. Taken together, the studies uncover two molecular mechanisms that could potentially be manipulated to increase the regenerative properties of hematopoietic stem cells and improve cancer therapy. Scientists can now test drugs that inhibit Grb10 or test the effectiveness of administering DKK1 intravenously to promote immune regeneration in people who have received chemotherapy and radiation or those undergoing bone marrow transplants.

This treatment appears to work by inducing brain waves known as gamma oscillations, which the researchers discovered help the brain suppress beta amyloid production and invigorate cells responsible for destroying the plaques. Further research will be needed to determine if a similar approach could help Alzheimer s patients, says Li-Huei Tsai, the Picower Professor of Neuroscience, director of MIT s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and senior author of the study, which appears in the Dec. 7 online edition of Nature.  It s a big  if,  because so many things have been shown to work in mice, only to fail in humans,  Tsai says.  But if humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it s so noninvasive, and it s so accessible.  Tsai and Ed Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at the MIT Media Lab and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, who is also an author of the Nature paper, have started a company called Cognito Therapeutics to pursue tests in humans. The paper s lead authors are graduate student Hannah Iaccarino and Media Lab research affiliate Annabelle Singer.  This important announcement may herald a breakthrough in the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a terrible affliction affecting millions of people and their families around the world,  says Michael Sipser, dean of MIT s School of Science.  Our MIT scientists have opened the door to an entirely new direction of research on this brain disorder and the mechanisms that may cause or prevent it. I find it extremely exciting.  Brain wave stimulation Alzheimer s disease, which affects more than 5 million people in the United States, is characterized by beta amyloid plaques that are suspected to be harmful to brain cells and to interfere with normal brain function. Previous studies have hinted that Alzheimer s patients also have impaired gamma oscillations. These brain waves, which range from 25 to 80 hertz (cycles per second), are believed to contribute to normal brain functions such as attention, perception, and memory. In a study of mice that were genetically programmed to develop Alzheimer s but did not yet show any plaque accumulation or behavioral symptoms, Tsai and her colleagues found impaired gamma oscillations during patterns of activity that are essential for learning and memory while running a maze. Next, the researchers stimulated gamma oscillations at 40 hertz in a brain region called the hippocampus, which is critical in memory formation and retrieval. These initial studies relied on a technique known as optogenetics, co-pioneered by Boyden, which allows scientists to control the activity of genetically modified neurons by shining light on them. Using this approach, the researchers stimulated certain brain cells known as interneurons, which then synchronize the gamma activity of excitatory neurons. After an hour of stimulation at 40 hertz, the researchers found a 40 to 50 percent reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus. Stimulation at other frequencies, ranging from 20 to 80 hertz, did not produce this decline. Tsai and colleagues then began to wonder if less-invasive techniques might achieve the same effect. Tsai and Emery Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience, a member of the Picower Institute, and an author of the paper, came up with the idea of using an external stimulus   in this case, light   to drive gamma oscillations in the brain. The researchers built a simple device consisting of a strip of LEDs that can be programmed to flicker at different frequencies. Using this device, the researchers found that an hour of exposure to light flickering at 40 hertz enhanced gamma oscillations and reduced beta amyloid levels by half in the visual cortex of mice in the very early stages of Alzheimer s. However, the proteins returned to their original levels within 24 hours. The researchers then investigated whether a longer course of treatment could reduce amyloid plaques in mice with more advanced accumulation of amyloid plaques. After treating the mice for an hour a day for seven days, both plaques and free-floating amyloid were markedly reduced. The researchers are now trying to determine how long these effects last. Furthermore, the researchers found that gamma rhythms also reduced another hallmark of Alzheimer s disease: the abnormally modified Tau protein, which can form tangles in the brain.  What this study does, in a very carefully designed and well-executed way, is show that gamma oscillations, which we have known for a long time are linked to cognitive function, play a critical role in the capacity of the brain to clean up deposits,  says Alvaro Pascual-Leone, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research.  That s remarkable and surprising, and it opens up the exciting prospect of possible translation to application in humans.  Tsai s lab is now studying whether light can drive gamma oscillations in brain regions beyond the visual cortex, and preliminary data suggest that this is possible. They are also investigating whether the reduction in amyloid plaques has any effects on the behavioral symptoms of their Alzheimer s mouse models, and whether this technique could affect other neurological disorders that involve impaired gamma oscillations. Two modes of action The researchers also performed studies to try to figure out how gamma oscillations exert their effects. They found that after gamma stimulation, the process for beta amyloid generation is less active. Gamma oscillations also improved the brain s ability to clear out beta amyloid proteins, which is normally the job of immune cells known as microglia.  They take up toxic materials and cell debris, clean up the environment, and keep neurons healthy,  Tsai says. In Alzheimer s patients, microglia cells become very inflammatory and secrete toxic chemicals that make other brain cells more sick. However, when gamma oscillations were boosted in mice, their microglia underwent morphological changes and became more active in clearing away the beta amyloid proteins.  The bottom line is, enhancing gamma oscillations in the brain can do at least two things to reduced amyloid load. One is to reduce beta amyloid production from neurons. And second is to enhance the clearance of amyloids by microglia,  Tsai says. Source: Story from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Original piece written by Anne Trafton.

The product of a long-term collaboration among investigators at the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the vaccine stimulated powerful immune responses against AML cells and resulted in protection from relapse in a majority of patients, the team of researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.   Immunotherapy strategies leverage the body s own defense systems to fight cancer cells,  said senior author David Avigan, HMS professor of medicine, chief of the Hematological Malignancies/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program and director of the Cancer Vaccine Program at the Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center.  By creating a personalized vaccine, we use the power of the immune system to selectively target each patient s cancer and avoid the side effects of chemotherapy.  Patients with AML may achieve remission following standard chemotherapy; yet relapse is common, and most patients ultimately succumb to the disease. In this study, the team of collaborators from Beth Israel Deaconess and Dana-Farber generated personalized vaccines for 17 patients with AML who were in remission after undergoing standard chemotherapy. Despite an average age of 63, more than 70 percent of trial participants remained in remission at an average follow-up period of more than four years. After receiving a series of injections of the vaccine, patients demonstrated an increase in the number of leukemia-specific T cells in the blood and bone marrow. T cells are immune cells critical to the body s ability to recognize and remember pathogens like viruses, or in this case, cancer cells. Present only in low numbers prior to vaccination, T cells recognizing AML cells were expanded after vaccination, potentially providing long-term protection against the leukemia.  With the vaccine, we use the immune system to target the whole tumor including cells that may be resistant to chemotherapy,  stated lead author Jacalyn Rosenblatt, HMS associate professor of medicine and co-director of the Cancer Vaccine Program at the Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center.  We were really excited to see that the vaccine generated a broad and durable immune response without significant side effects.  This vaccine platform has been the product of collaboration among Beth Israel Deaconess and Dana-Farber investigators, including the initial seminal work done by Donald Kufe, HMS professor of medicine at Dana-Farber, subsequent development and clinical translation by Kufe, Rosenblatt and Avigan, and the contributions of clinical investigators including Richard Stone, HMS professor of medicine and program director of the Adult Leukemia Program at Dana-Farber, and Lynne Uhl, HMS associate professor of pathology and director of the Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess.  The development of this personalized vaccine by our team was based on the premise that effective treatment of established cancers would require the induction of immunity against multiple antigens, including neoantigens, specifically expressed by the patient s own cancer cells,  stated co-author Donald Kufe. Based on these encouraging results, researchers are also testing this vaccine approach in other types of cancers. Avigan and colleagues are leading a national study to test the effectiveness of the vaccine in patients with multiple myeloma, another common blood cancer. Source: Story from Harvard Medical School.

The goal of the new endeavor is to deepen our understanding of the brain   the most powerful biological and chemical computing machine   and how it works at the most basic level as well as how it fails because of disease or through the aging process. Central to the initiative is the creation of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience at Caltech, where research investigations will span a continuum, from deciphering the basic biology of the brain to understanding sensation, perception, cognition, and human behavior, with the goal of making transformational advances that will inform new scientific tools and medical treatments. The Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute at Caltech will be supported through the Chens' investment, which includes endowed funds to be used at the discretion of Caltech's leadership to support activities such as seeding new lines of research and supporting promising early-career faculty and scholars. In addition, as part of the neuroscience initiative, Caltech will construct a $200 million biosciences complex named in honor of the Chens that will include state-of-the-art facilities for the Chen Institute at Caltech. Involving faculty from across the university's six academic divisions, the Chen Institute at Caltech will catalyze a campus-wide interdisciplinary community of neuroscientists, biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers, computer scientists, and social scientists, all with the shared goal of understanding the fundamental principles that underlie brain function. The new building will be a nexus for neuroscience research on campus. It will comprise shared lab spaces and centralized areas that foster interaction and collaboration, amplifying and extending Caltech's long traditions in molecular, cellular, and systems neuroscience. As part of the commitment to the partnership, Caltech will also co-invest significant resources to be deployed for the Chen Institute at Caltech's operations. ""It is a privilege to launch this vital collaborative effort with Tianqiao Chen and Chrissy Luo,"" says Caltech president Thomas Rosenbaum, the Sonja and William Davidow Presidential Chair and professor of physics. ""We share a vision with our cornerstone partners, the Chens, of translating insights into the fundamental biology, chemistry, and physics of the brain into a deeper understanding of how human beings perceive and interact with the world, and how technological interventions can improve the human experience."" ""Our involvement in the Internet and entertainment industries allowed us to witness the ability for technology advancements to influence human perception, as well as to observe the resultant meaningful effects on human behavior,"" says Tianqiao Chen, co-founder of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute. ""However, there is little understanding about how the brain processes and connects what lies in between   sensation, perception, cognition, and action. We believe uncovering how the brain perceives, interprets, and interacts with the world is pivotal in so many aspects. It can shape groundbreaking industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual reality. It also plays a critical role in addressing social issues such as aging and behavioral deficiencies. It can even help answer many ultimate questions about life, such as its origin, purpose, and ending. This is the mission of our philanthropy, and we are dedicating an initial one billion dollars to this cause."" Chrissy Luo, co-founder of Shanda and the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute, adds, ""We spent two years learning the subject from highly regarded global universities with whom we continue to have conversations. We chose Caltech as our first partner not just for their strong reputation as a leading research institution, but also for the admiration in their natural alignment with Shanda's culture, which is focused on creating excellence and discovery. We have enjoyed the strong working relationship with Caltech and are firmly confident of this partnership."" David J. Anderson, the Seymour Benzer Professor of Biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, will serve as the director of the new neuroscience institute, which will comprise five interdisciplinary research centers including four new centers, founded through the gift from the Chens, and one existing center. Anderson will be named the inaugural holder of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience Leadership Chair. ""Modern neuroscience is one of the most interdisciplinary fields of human intellectual endeavor in the 21st century, and no single researcher or laboratory can master all of the diverse approaches necessary to solve the challenging problems of brain structure, function, and dysfunction,"" Anderson says. ""The Chen Institute at Caltech provides an unprecedented opportunity for Caltech faculty and students in different fields to join forces to take on these challenges, by creating new collaborations at the interface between traditional scientific disciplines. Computational approaches grounded in Caltech's traditional strength in the physical sciences will provide a common glue that binds these collaborations together."" Adds Anderson, ""Caltech's traditional strengths in basic biology and the physical sciences provide an ideal crucible in which to forge new tools that will crack the most fundamental problems of brain function, such as perception, emotion, cognition, and communication, as well as to develop radical new therapies for currently intractable brain disorders.""

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/rhythm-breathing-affects-memory-and-fear-284804,Rhythm of breathing affects memory and fear  Breathing is not just for oxygen  it is also linked to brain function and behavior  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Breathing is not just for oxygen; it is also linked to brain function and behavior - Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine scientists have discovered for the first time that the rhythm of breathing creates electrical activity in the human brain that enhances emotional judgments and memory recall. These effects on behavior depend critically on whether you inhale or exhale and whether you breathe through the nose or mouth. See Also: Tracing the scent of fear In the study, individuals were able to identify a fearful face more quickly if they encountered the face when breathing in compared to breathing out. Individuals also were more likely to remember an object if they encountered it on the inhaled breath than the exhaled one. The effect disappeared if breathing was through the mouth. ""One of the major findings in this study is that there is a dramatic difference in brain activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during inhalation compared with exhalation,"" said lead author Christina Zelano, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""When you breathe in, we discovered you are stimulating neurons in the olfactory cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, all across the limbic system."" The study is published in the Journal of Neuroscience. The senior author is Jay Gottfried, professor of neurology at Feinberg. Related: EEG study findings reveal how fear is processed in the brain Northwestern scientists first discovered these differences in brain activity while studying seven patients with epilepsy who were scheduled for brain surgery. A week prior to surgery, a surgeon implanted electrodes into the patients' brains in order to identify the origin of their seizures. This allowed scientists to acquire electro-physiological data directly from their brains. The recorded electrical signals showed brain activity fluctuated with breathing. The activity occurs in brain areas where emotions, memory and smells are processed. This discovery led scientists to ask whether cognitive functions typically associated with these brain areas in particular fear processing and memory could also be affected by breathing. The amygdala is strongly linked to emotional processing, in particular fear-related emotions. So scientists asked about 60 subjects to make rapid decisions on emotional expressions in the lab environment while recording their breathing. Presented with pictures of faces showing expressions of either fear or surprise, the subjects had to indicate, as quickly as they could, which emotion each face was expressing. Learn More: Maturing brain flips function of amygdala in regulating stress hormones When faces were encountered during inhalation, subjects recognized them as fearful more quickly than when faces were encountered during exhalation. This was not true for faces expressing surprise. These effects diminished when subjects performed the same task while breathing through their mouths. Thus the effect was specific to fearful stimuli during nasal breathing only. In an experiment aimed at assessing memory function tied to the hippocampus he same subjects were shown pictures of objects on a computer screen and told to remember them. Later, they were asked to recall those objects. Researchers found that recall was better if the images were encountered during inhalation. The findings imply that rapid breathing may confer an advantage when someone is in a dangerous situation, Zelano said. ""If you are in a panic state, your breathing rhythm becomes faster,"" Zelano said. ""As a result you'll spend proportionally more time inhaling than when in a calm state. Thus, our body's innate response to fear with faster breathing could have a positive impact on brain function and result in faster response times to dangerous stimuli in the environment."" Read Next: Researchers switch emotion linked to memory Another potential insight of the research is on the basic mechanisms of meditation or focused breathing.

Currently, Alzheimer's diagnoses rely on clinical neuropathologic assessment of amyloid-  (A ) peptide aggregates (plaques) and neurofibrillary tangles. But in ACS Central Science, researchers reveal that an enzyme already implicated in a host of neural disorders could someday serve as a biomarker. See Also: Research discovers neuroprotective protein in blood is biomarker of Alzheimer's disease In the brains of patients with Alzheimer's, amyloid peptides aggregate to form oligomers and plaques that are thought to be responsible for the disease symptoms. It is difficult to monitor A  aggregation in living animals and patients, and current methods to track it in patient brains are costly, have low resolution or require radiation. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is involved in many neurological disorders, such as depression. In addition, MAO is known to be associated with Alzheimer's, but studies establishing this relationship were only conducted in lab dishes and test tubes.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system characterized by tremors or trembling and stiffness in the limbs, impaired balance and coordination. It affects about 10 million people worldwide. As PD progresses, many patients develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a decline in cognitive abilities, including thinking, memory and language. MCI can be identified in approximately 25 percent of newly diagnosed PD patients, and patients with MCI progress to dementia more frequently than those with normal cognitive performance. See Also: Altered brain communication could be predictive marker of dementia in Parkinson's disease For the new study, lead investigator Massimo Filippi, MD, from the Neuroimaging Research Unit at San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy, coauthors Federica Agosta, MD, PhD, and Sebastiano Galantucci, MD, and other colleagues used an MRI technique called diffusion tractography to look for differences in the neural networks of PD patients with and without MCI. Increasingly, the human brain is understood as an integrated network, or connectome, that has both a structural and functional component. By applying an analytical tool called graph analysis to the imaging results, researchers can measure the relationships among highly connected and complex data like the network of connections in the human brain. ""Cognitive impairment in PD is one of the major non-motor complications of the disease, as well as one of the major concerns of patients and caregivers at the time of diagnosis,"" Dr. Agosta said. ""Study of the changes related to cognitive impairment in PD is imperative in order to be able to answer patients' questions and finally be able to predict the future development of this condition."" Learn More: MRI brain scans detect people with early Parkinson's The study group was made up of 170 PD patients, including 54 with MCI and 116 without, and 41 healthy controls. Analysis of imaging results showed that only PD patients with MCI had significant alterations at the brain network level. Measurements of the movement and diffusion of water in the brain, an indicator of the condition of the brain's signal-carrying white matter, differentiated PD patients with MCI from healthy controls and non-MCI PD patients with a good accuracy. Researchers said the results show that cognitive impairment in PD is likely the consequence of a disruption of complex structural brain networks rather than degeneration of individual white matter bundles. The results may offer markers to differentiate PD patients with and without cognitive deficits, according to Dr. Agosta. ""If confirmed and replicated by other studies, these results would suggest the use of MRI in PD to support the clinicians in monitoring the disease and predicting the occurrence of cognitive complications,"" she said.

Cain University Professor John Wikswo report that they have developed a microfluidic device that overcomes the limitations of previous models of this key system and have used it to study brain inflammation, dubbed the ""silent killer"" because it doesn't cause pain but contributes to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Recent research also suggests that it may underlie a wider range of problems from impaired cognition to depression and even schizophrenia. The project is part of a $70 million ""Tissue Chip for Drug Testing Program"" funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. Its purpose is to develop human organ-on-a-chip technology in order to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs in a faster, cheaper, more effective and more reliable fashion. The importance of understanding how the blood-brain barrier works has increased in recent years as medical researchers have found that this critical structure is implicated in a widening range of brain disorders, extending from stroke to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease to blunt force trauma and brain inflammation. Learn More: Bioengineers create circuit board modeled on the human brain Despite its importance, scientists have had considerable difficulty creating faithful laboratory models of the complex biological system that protects the brain. Previous models have either been static and so have not reproduced critical blood flow effects or they have not supported all the cell types found in human blood-brain barriers. The new device, which the researchers call a NeuroVascular Unit (NVU) on a chip, overcomes these problems. It consists of a small cavity that is one-fifth of an inch long, one-tenth of an inch wide and three-hundredths of an inch thick - giving it a total volume of about one-millionth of a human brain. The cavity is divided by a thin, porous membrane into an upper chamber that acts as the brain side of the barrier and a lower chamber that acts as the blood or vascular side. Both chambers are connected to separate microchannels hooked to micropumps that allow them to be independently perfused and sampled. To create an artificial blood-brain barrier, the researchers first flip the device over so the vascular chamber is on top and inject specialized human endothelial cells. They found that if they maintain a steady fluid flow through the chamber during this period, the endothelial cells, which left to themselves form shapeless blobs, consistently orient themselves parallel to the direction of flow. This orientation, which is a characteristic of the endothelial cells in human blood-brain barrier, has been lacking in many previous models. Don't Miss: Futuristic brain probe allows for wireless control of neurons After a day or two, when the endothelial cells have attached themselves to the membrane, the researchers flip the device and inject the two other human cell types that form the barrier astrocytes and pericytes that wrap around endothelial cells as well as excitatory neurons that may regulate the barrier. These all go into the brain chamber that is now on top. The porous membrane allows the new cells to make physical and chemical contact with the endothelial cells just as they do in the brain. The researchers were able to purchase the human endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes that they need from commercial sources. For the excitatory neurons required, they turned to Vanderbilt University Medical Center collaborators M. Diana Neely, research associate professor of pediatrics, and Aaron Bowman, associate professor of pediatrics, neurology and biochemistry. Starting with human induced pluripotent stem cells that are generated directly from adult cells they were able to produce the specialized neurons that the project needed. ""This is one of the most exciting projects I'm involved with,"" said Neely. ""Although it's still in its infancy, it has tremendous potential."" According to Bowman, one potential application is to develop tissue chips that contain cells from individual patients, making it possible to predict their personal reactions to different drugs. ""Once we had successfully created the artificial barrier, we subjected it to a series of basic tests and it passed them all with flying colors. This gives us the confidence to state that we have developed a fully functional model of the human blood-brain barrier,"" said VIIBRE staff scientist Jacquelyn Brown, who is first author of the paper that described this achievement in the journal Biomicrofluidics. Learn More: 'Missing link' found in the development of bioelectronic medicines ""The NVU has reached the point where we can begin using it to test different drugs and compounds,"" observed team member Donna Webb, associate professor of biological sciences who is interested in studying how different substances affect synapses. ""There is an urgent need for us to understand how various substances affect cognitive processes. When we do, we will be in for a number of surprises!"" Already, the VIBRE team has used the NVU to overcome a basic limitation of existing studies of brain inflammation, which have only produced snapshots of the process at various stages. Because the NVU can be continuously monitored, it has provided the first dynamic view of how the brain and blood-brain barrier respond to systemic inflammation. These results are summarized in a paper titled ""Metabolic consequences of inflammatory disruption of the blood-brain barrier in an organ-on-chip model of the human neurovascular unit"" accepted for publication in the Journal of Neuroinflammation. The scientists exposed the NVU to two different compounds known to induce brain inflammation: a large molecule found on the surface of certain bacteria called lipopolysaccharide and a ""cocktail"" of small proteins called cytokines that play an important role in immune response to inflammation. ""One of our biggest surprises was the discovery that a critical component in the blood-brain barrier's response to these compounds was to begin increasing protein synthesis,"" said Brown. ""Next will be to find out which proteins it is making and what they do."" Read Next: Why inflammation leads to a leaky blood-brain barrier: MicroRNA-155 The researchers also found that the blood vessels in the barrier respond to inflammation by pumping up their metabolic rate while the metabolism of the brain cells slows down.

The results, published in PLOS Pathogens, reveal the processes that lead to fatal outcomes of the disease and suggest an antibody therapy that may treat it.  By looking into the living brain, we were able to watch the chain of events that cause cerebral malaria to kill thousands of people every year,  said Dorian McGavern, Ph.D., scientist at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  Our study also suggests there may be a simple treatment available to stop this deadly disease.  Malaria is a parasitic infection that is spread by mosquitoes, primarily in the developing world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2015, there were more than 200 million cases of malaria worldwide and 400,000 deaths from the disease, mainly in children under five years old. Although many people experience mild symptoms, in some individuals the parasite affects the brain and causes cerebral malaria, which kills 15 to 30 percent of patients with that form of the disease. Individuals who survive cerebral malaria often experience long-term neurological symptoms including cognitive impairment and limb paralysis. The cause of death from cerebral malaria is often due to brain swelling and bleeding, but the mechanisms leading to these outcomes are not completely understood. Previous studies in the rodent model of this disease indicated CD8+T cells played a key role in the development of CM so Dr. McGavern s team focused its cameras on those cells. Dr. McGavern and his colleagues peered inside the brains of mice infected with a parasite that causes CM, using an imaging technology known as intravital microscopy, which allowed them to watch cells in action. The findings of this study showed that as red blood cells containing the parasite adhere to cerebral blood vessels (a hallmark of CM), the immune system attempts to clean them off.  Despite these efforts, endothelial cells making up the walls of cerebral blood vessels shed bits of the parasite, which CD8+ T cells recognize, causing those immune cells to attach to and attack the vessels. Once the CD8+T cells amassed on the surface of brain blood vessels, the vessels began to leak. The subsequent leaking led to swelling and increased pressure in the brain, which was fatal. Results also showed that the CD8+ T cells preferentially interacted with blood vessels in the brain and not in other parts of the body.   To determine which parts of the brain were affected by these events, the researchers injected mice with dyes that marked dead cells and blood vessel leakage. The results indicated that the brain regions with the most damaged vessels and cell death were the olfactory bulb (the area involved in sensing smell) and crucially, the brainstem, an area that controls such vital functions as breathing and heart rate. In another set of experiments, Dr. McGavern s group tested a potential therapy to see if it could be used to remove the CD8+ T cells from vessel walls. Initially, they watched as CD8+ T cells began to interact with the cerebral blood vessels in the CM mice. Then, they treated the mice with two FDA-approved, intravenous drugs that block the molecules that CD8+ T cells use to attach to blood vessels. Within 30 minutes of the treatment, the CD8+ T cells broke off from the blood vessels and could not stick to them, preventing the fatal brain swelling in all of the treated mice. These findings suggest that the interactions between CD8+ T cells and blood vessels lead to death from CM and preventing that binding may increase survival from the disease.  These movies show us a terrible side effect sometimes associated with malaria   the parasite can fool the body s immune system into attacking the blood vessels within its own brain,  said Dr. McGavern.

0,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/stand-corrected-276820,Stand Corrected Posture mediated low blood pressure could mask cognitive deficits in Parkinson s  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a new study published online in the journal Neurology, a research team led by neurologists at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and neuropsychologists at Boston University has shown that when patients with Parkinson s disease experience a drop in blood pressure upon standing up   a condition known as orthostatic hypotension (OH)   they exhibit significant cognitive deficits. These deficits reverse when they lie down and their blood pressure returns to normal. These cognitive impairments may go unnoticed by physicians assessing patients with Parkinson s who are lying down or seated, and the impairments could lead to difficulty in daily activities performed while standing and walking, such as tracking conversations, counting change and interpreting traffic signals.  Cognitive impairment is a common symptom of Parkinson s disease,  said co-senior author Roy Freeman, HMS professor of neurology and director of the Center for Autonomic and Peripheral Nerve Disorders at Beth Israel Deaconess.  In this study, we demonstrated that the upright posture in patients with Parkinson s disease exacerbated cognitive deficits and that this effect is transient and reversible. Based on these results, we encourage clinicians to include cognitive testing in a variety of postures in their assessments of patients.  Marked by characteristic tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement, Parkinson s disease is a progressive degeneration of parts of the nervous system. It affects many aspects of movement and can cause a masklike, expressionless face; rigid limbs; and problems with walking and posture. Parkinson s is also associated with cognitive defects attributed to breakdowns in connectivity between regions of the brain. Up to 50 percent of people with Parkinson s disease may also have orthostatic hypotension. In a previous study, Freeman and colleagues demonstrated that orthostatic hypotension is linked to reversible cognitive impairment in patients with a rare neurological disorder called autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. In this new study of the far more prevalent Parkinson s disease, the researchers investigated whether OH is linked to reversible cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson s as well. Freeman and colleagues including lead author Justin Centi, research assistant in the Center for Autonomic and Peripheral Nerve Disorders, and co-senior author Alice Cronin-Golomb, director of the Vision and Cognition Laboratory, director of the Center for Clinical Biopsychology, and professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, divided 55 volunteers into three study groups: 18 patients with both Parkinson s and OH, 19 patients with Parkinson s but without OH, and 18 control participants with neither Parkinson s nor OH. All participants were given a series of cognitive tests, with the tests administered while supine and again while tilted to 60 degrees. Researchers measured and recorded the participants  blood pressure before and during each round of cognitive testing to ensure that participants were never at risk for fainting.  As we suspected, people with both Parkinson s disease and orthostatic hypotension showed posture-related impairments when upright relative to supine on nearly all measures of cognition,  said Centi, who noted that study participants with Parkinson s disease without orthostatic hypotension demonstrated deficits on only two cognitive tests. There was no difference between upright and supine scores for the control group. When the three groups  relative performances were compared to each other, postural changes had no significant impact on participants with Parkinson s without OH, compared to the control group. However, participants with both Parkinson s and OH were far more susceptible to posture-related impairment on several tests, including those that measured math skills and abilities such as producing words easily, keeping information in mind while working on it, paying sufficient attention so that later memory is efficient, and searching for items quickly and accurately.  Essentially all neuropsychological tests are given to patients in the seated position in the clinic as well as during most research studies   with the exception of imaging studies in which the patient is lying down,  said Cronin-Golomb.  The cognitive performance that we see in those patients with Parkinson s disease who are tested when seated or lying down in fact may underestimate their cognitive problems in real life, when they are standing up and going about their business of daily activities. Also, the patterns of brain activity that we see on imaging when they are lying down may not be the patterns that the brain produces during normal upright activity.

But insertion of new genes has generally been limited to dividing cells, like those in the skin and gut, because the techniques depend on processes that are only active during cell division. Most of the body s cells, however, are non-dividing, including those in the eye, brain, and heart. To address this limitation, a group of researchers led by Dr. Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego set out to develop a more versatile approach. Their goal was to develop a technique that could insert new genes even into cells that weren t dividing. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Results were published in Nature on December 1, 2016. The researchers focused on a DNA-repair mechanism called NHEJ (non-homologous end-joining). NHEJ repairs DNA breaks by rejoining broken DNA ends. It s active in both dividing and non-dividing cells. This makes it a useful partner to the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool, which can snip out DNA pieces at precise locations. The scientists tailored the NHEJ machinery for use along with CRISPR/Cas9. They named the new approach HITI (homology-independent targeted integration). With HITI, a gene is targeted using CRISPR/Cas9 and replaced by a new gene using the cell s routine NHEJ repair mechanism. To test the approach in non-dividing cells, the researchers used a harmless virus to deliver the specialized HITI package into a sample of neurons. This led to site-specific insertion of the new gene into these neurons. The team next tested the HITI-enabled gene insertion method in non-dividing cells in mice. They were able to incorporate the new gene into the brain, muscle, kidney, heart, and liver of adult mice. The scientists next explored whether HITI might be used as a gene-replacement tool to treat disease. They tested a rat model of retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited eye disorder that causes retinal degeneration and eventual blindness in humans. The team used HITI to replace the mutated Mertk gene that causes blindness in these rats with a functional copy of the gene. The functional gene became incorporated into the rat genome. After 4 weeks, MERTK protein expression was observed in the retina. Light-sensitive eye tests showed improved responses, indicating a partial rescue of vision. Although the researchers chose to use the CRISPR/Cas9 tool along with HITI in this study, other gene-editing techniques could also be coupled with HITI to insert new genes into the genome.  We now have a technology that allows us to modify the DNA of non-dividing cells, to fix broken genes in the brain, heart, and liver,  Izpisua Belmonte says.  It allows us, for the first time, to be able to dream of curing diseases that we couldn t before, which is exciting.  Source: Story from the National Institutes of Health.

This means more plantings per growing season and thus higher yield. In this case, it also means that the plant can be grown in latitudes more northerly than currently possible an important attribute as the earth s climate warms.  Our work is a compelling demonstration of the power of gene editing CRISPR technology to rapidly improve yield traits in crop breeding,  says CSHL Associate Professor Zachary Lippman, who led the research. Applications can go far beyond the tomato family, he says, to include many major food crops like maize, soybean, and wheat that so much of the world depends upon. Lippman clarifies that the technique his team publishes today in Nature Genetics is about more than simply increasing yield.  It s really about creating a genetic toolkit that enables growers and breeders in a single generation to tweak the timing of flower production and thus yield, to help adapt our best varieties to grow in parts of the world where they don t currently thrive.  At the heart of the method are insights obtained by Lippman and colleagues, including plant scientists at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, NY and in France led by Dr. Jos  Jim nez-G mez, about the evolution of the flowering process in many crops and their wild relatives as it relates to the length of the light period in a day. Genetic research revealed why today s cultivated tomato plant is not very sensitive to this variable compared to wild relatives from South America. Somehow, it does not much matter to domesticated plants whether they have 12 hours of daylight or 16 hours; they flower at virtually the same point after planting.A well-known hormonal system regulates flowering time and hence the time when the plant will generate its first ripe fruit. The hormone florigen and a counteracting  anti-florigen  hormone called SP (Self Pruning) act together, in yin-yang fashion, to, respectively, promote or delay flowering. In one phase of the newly reported research, the investigators studied a wild tomato species native to the Galapagos Islands   near the equator, with days and nights close to 12 hours year-round. They wanted to learn why, when grown in northern latitudes with very long summer days, this plant flowered very late in the season and produced few fruits. The wild equatorial tomato, they learned, was extremely sensitive to daylight length. The longer the day, the longer the time to flowering, whereas  when you have a shorter light period, as in the plant s native habitat, they flower faster,  Lippman says. This suggested there was a genetic change in tomato plants that occurred at some point before or during the domestication of wild tomato plants. Lippman suspects these changes likely had already occurred when the Spanish conquistador Cortez brought tomatoes to Europe from Mexico in the early 16th century, beginning the era of the plant s widespread adoption in mid-northern latitudes. Lippman and colleagues traced the loss of day-length sensitivity in domesticated tomatoes to mutations in a gene called SP5G (Self Pruning 5G). It s a member of the same family of florigen and anti-florigen genes that were already known to regulate flowering time in tomato. Growing the wild tomato plant from the Galapagos in greenhouses and fields in New York, Lippman and colleagues observed a sharp spike in the expression and activity of the anti-florigen hormone encoded by the SP5G gene, causing flowering to occur much later. In domesticated tomato plants, in contrast, that surge of anti-florigen is much weaker.  The team s principal innovation generating varieties of cherry and roma tomatoes that flower much earlier than the domesticated varieties on which they are based arises from the observation that while domesticated plants are notably insensitive to day length,  there was some residual expression of the anti-florigen SP5G gene,  Lippman says. This led the team to employ the gene-editing tool CRISPR to induce tiny mutations in the SP5G gene. The aim was to inactivate the gene entirely such that it did not generate any anti-florigen protein at all. When this tweaked version of SP5G was introduced to popular roma and cherry tomato varieties, the plants flowered earlier, and thus made fruits that ripened earlier. Tweaking another anti-florigen gene that makes tomato plants grow in a dense, compact, shrub-like manner made the early-flowering varieties even more compact and early-yielding a trait the team calls  double-determinate.   What we ve demonstrated here is fast-forward breeding,  Lippman says.  Now we have a simple strategy to completely eliminate daylight sensitivity in elite inbred and hybrid plants that are already being cultivated. This could enable growers to expand their geographical range of cultivation, simply by using CRISPR to rapidly  adapt  tomato and other crops to more northern latitudes, where summers have very long days and very short growing seasons.

Now a new study suggests that cancer cells may exploit a normal function of neutrophils, the most common form of white blood cell, to help form metastatic tumors.  Cancer cells, the study suggests, can induce neutrophils to release special traps, which these immune cells typically use to capture and destroy pathogens. For cancer cells that escape from the original tumor and travel to a distant location in the body, these so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) appear to help the cancer cells form tumors, or metastases, in other tissues, the research team reported. Led by investigators at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, the researchers also developed a nanotechnology-based therapy that disintegrates NETs. The treatment, they showed, could prevent or greatly diminish the formation of metastatic tumors in the lungs of mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Although the team has some theories about how NETs facilitate metastasis, exactly how this happens is still unclear, said the study s lead author, Mikala Egeblad, Ph.D. But the findings suggest that  NETs are critical for metastatic colonization,  the researchers wrote in the October 19 Science Translational Medicine, and  raise the exciting possibility of targeting NETs to prevent metastasis.  Casting NETs As the first responders to potentially harmful bacteria and other pathogens, neutrophils are an important component of the human immune system. One of the ways that neutrophils rid the body of harmful pathogens is by forming NETs, a meshwork of DNA and toxic enzymes that trap and kill these invaders. Over the last decade, the role of immune system cells in cancer as both promoters of and impediments to tumor development, progression, and spread have become of keen interest, explained Rosandra Kaplan, M.D., of NCI s Center for Cancer Research, whose research focuses on the tumor microenvironment and its specific components, including immune cells, that promote metastasis. But neutrophils have not received the same amount of attention as other immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages, she continued.  T cells have really had the center stage. They re the best at killing tumor cells, so they ve received a lot of the focus,  Dr. Kaplan said. Neutrophils, on the other hand, don t hang around very long in the body once they are produced and they aren t as lethal as other immune cells, she continued, so their culpability in promoting cancer or prowess as an anti-tumor weapon has been less studied. Dr. Egeblad and her team, following up on the earlier studies linking neutrophils to metastasis, focused initially on breast cancer metastasis to better understand how and where neutrophils might support this process. For example, in mouse models of a highly metastatic breast cancer, they showed that neutrophils and signaling molecules that recruit them could be found in abundance in primary and metastatic tumors. It wasn t until they turned to an advanced imaging technology known as confocal intravital lung imaging (CILI), however, that the potential role of NETs became clear. Using CILI, the researchers scanned the lungs of mice that had been injected with breast cancer cells that preferentially spread to the lungs and saw structures jutting out from some cells. Additional experiments revealed that the structures were NETs. And despite no evidence of infection in the lungs, the number of NETs in the mice remained  elevated for days  after the breast cancer cells were injected, they reported. To see if NETs are present in human breast cancers, the researchers analyzed samples of primary and metastatic tumors from breast cancer patients. Although they found NETs in both types of tumor samples, the traps were found in the greatest abundance and most consistently in the tumor samples from women with the highly metastatic form of breast cancer known as triple negative. Additional experiments in the lab showed that when neutrophils were grown in the presence of highly aggressive breast cancer cells, it led to robust NET formation and made the cancer cells behave far more aggressively. Neither of these outcomes occurred when they cultured neutrophils with breast cancer cells that don t rapidly grow and spread. Other experiments suggested that cancer cells might induce neutrophils to form and release NETs by turning on key signaling pathways in the immune cells. Digesting NETs The DNA-based structure of NETs, the researchers suspected, might present a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited something that s already done for people with cystic fibrosis (CF). A hallmark of CF is a buildup in the lungs of a thick mucus caused in part by the accumulation of NETs triggered by persistent infections. So patients with CF are often treated with an inhaled drug that uses a DNA-digesting enzyme, called DNase I, to dissolve the traps and thin the mucus. The enzyme showed strong hints of efficacy in cell lines of metastatic breast cancer. But when they tested DNase I in mouse breast cancer models, the enzyme s effect on metastasis  was not very robust,  Dr. Egeblad said. Based on data from older studies of DNase I, the research team speculated that the DNase I enzyme was rapidly degraded in the body and that this was the rate-limiting factor in the mice injected with metastatic breast cancer cells. So they turned to Michael Goldberg, Ph.D., of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, whose lab had developed nanoparticles to which enzymes can be bound, allowing them to remain stable and active for longer periods. The approach worked. In the first three mice treated with a nanoparticle to which the research team had bound DNase I,  we saw very striking effects,  Dr. Egeblad said. Overall, 3 of the 9 mice treated with the nanoparticle-bound DNase I had no detectable metastases, and all of the mice treated with the drug had fewer metastases and markedly smaller metastases than mice treated with control nanoparticles lacking DNase I. Understanding the Balance There are still many unanswered questions about the roles of neutrophils, other immune cells, and other actors in the tumor microenvironment in both promoting and suppressing the growth or spread of tumors, Dr. Kaplan cautioned. For example, although the finding that NETs might promote metastasis is  quite novel,  she continued, it s consistent with findings from other studies that have implicated other compounds excreted by cells in the metastatic process, including long non-coding RNAs and small sacs called exosomes. To complicate things further, Dr. Egeblad stressed, the available research strongly suggests that neutrophils or macrophages or other factors could aid tumor development in some situations and hinder it in others.  It s very likely that there is a fine balance  between when an immune cell fuels cancer development or inhibits it, she continued a balance that is influenced by many different factors that researchers are just beginning to understand. Her team is working to build on their findings, including conducting experiments that might help them better understand exactly how NETs facilitate the formation of metastatic tumors by cancer cells that have spread to a distant site. Even then, Dr. Egeblad cautioned, what they discover may have limitations.  We know that tumors hijack different processes to promote metastasis,  she said.  We need to look at other cancer types and be open to the idea that they may not all be using the same process.  Source: Story from the National Cancer Institute.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/plant-analysis-identifying-metabolites-205466,Plant Analysis   Identifying Metabolites New plant analysis method shows biologically active plant substances are far more common than previously thought  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Here s a reason not to peel tomatoes: A new method of plant analysis, developed at the Weizmann Institute of Science, has identified healthful antioxidants in tomato skins. In fact, as reported recently in Nature Communications, the new method reveals that biologically active plant substances typically associated with particular plant species   including those providing health benefits   are much more prevalent across the plant kingdom than was previously thought. Plants produce, in total, an estimated million-plus organic chemicals, and each plant is believed to contain as many as 15,000, on average. To address the challenge of identifying the majority of such  specialized metabolites  in any given plant, Dr. Nir Shahaf and other members of a team headed by Prof. Asaph Aharoni of Weizmann s Plant and Environmental Sciences Department created a database of plant metabolites, called WeizMass. Shahaf then developed a computer tool, MatchWeiz, which makes it possible to identify the metabolites by checking experimental results from the metabolic analysis of a particular plant against the database. Using these new tools, the scientists identified more than twenty metabolites that had never before been reported in tomatoes, including certain antioxidants in the skin. When the researchers then compared the analysis of tomatoes with that of duckweed and the research model Arabidopsis thaliana, they discovered an overlap in specialized metabolite content among these strikingly different species. These and other results suggest that plant species are not as specialized in their metabolism as has been commonly assumed. In other words, valuable substances produced by exotic plants may potentially be derived from more common species.

The research, outlined in a paper published online today in the journal Nature Microbiology, could have broad implications on the immunological understanding of human diseases caused by RNA viruses including influenza, Ebola, West Nile, and Zika viruses.  This opens up a new way to understand how humans respond to viral infections and develop new methods to control viral infections,  said Shou-Wei Ding, a professor of plant pathology and microbiology at UC Riverside, who is the co-corresponding author of the paper. The findings build on more than 20 years of research by Ding on antiviral RNA interference (RNAi), which involves an organism producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to clear a virus. His initial research showed that RNAi is a common antiviral defense in plants, insects and nematodes and that viral infections in these organisms require active suppression of RNAi by specific viral proteins. That work led him to study RNAi as an antiviral defense in mammals. In a 2013 paper in the journal Science he outlined findings that show mice use RNAi to destroy viruses. But, it remained an open debate as to whether the same was true in humans. That open debate led Ding back to a key 2004 paper in which he described a new activity of a protein (non-structural protein 1, or NS1) in the influenza virus that can block the antiviral function of RNAi in fruit flies, a common model system used by scientists. In the current Nature Microbiology paper, the researchers demonstrated that human cells produce abundant siRNAs to target the influenza A virus when the viral NS1 is not active. They showed that the creation of viral siRNAs in infected human cells is mediated by an enzyme known as Dicer and is potently suppressed by both the NS1 protein of influenza A virus and a protein (virion protein 35, or VP35) found in Ebola and Marburg viruses. The researchers in the lab of the co-corresponding author, Kate L. Jeffrey, an investigator in the Massachusetts General Hospital gastrointestinal unit and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, further demonstrated that the infections of mature mammal cells by influenza A virus and other RNA viruses are inhibited naturally by RNAi, using mice cells specifically defective in RNAi.  Our studies show that the antiviral function of RNAi is conserved in mammals against distinct RNA viruses, suggesting an immediate need to assess the role of antiviral RNAi in human infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses, including Ebola, West Nile, and Zika viruses,  Jeffrey said.

Many of the most effective antibiotics act by inhibiting various steps in protein synthesis on bacterial ribosomes,  as LMU biochemist Daniel Wilson points out. The search is now on for agents that interfere with aspects of the process that have so far been overlooked in this context. One of these processes is the recycling of stalled ribosomes. Wilson and his research group have just completed a comprehensive structural study of ribosome recycling. The results of the study, which appears in the leading journal Nature, may identify promising points of attack for future antibiotics. Ribosomes are the organelles that translate the nucleotide sequences encoded in messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs) into the amino-acid sequences of the corresponding proteins. The ribosome  reads  the nucleotide sequence in a fixed direction and is released from the mRNA only when it reaches a defined termination signal. Errors in synthesis or processing may, however, lead to the production of mRNAs that lack termination signals, causing the ribosome to stall while still attached to the mRNA and the growing protein. Cells have evolved several ways of detaching stalled ribosomes from the truncated mRNAs and recycling them for re-use. Wilson s team has now employed cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the bacterial recycling factor ArfA. Their analysis reveals how ArfA recognizes the stalled ribosome on a defective mRNA and recruits a so-called release factor, which detaches the incomplete protein. This then enables the stalled ribosome to be released from the mRNA in the normal manner by dissociation into its two component subunits. The subunits are then free to interact with another mRNA, thus allowing protein synthesis to proceed.  Our results could facilitate the development of new antibiotics that act by inhibiting ArfA-mediated ribosome recycling,  says Wilson. Since recycling of human ribosomes is dependent on factors that are unrelated to ArfA, such inhibitors should act specifically on the bacterial ribosome, and kill the bacterial cell by gradually cutting off the supply of free ribosomes.

They are produced by molecular machines, called ribosomes. A human ribosome contains some eighty ribosomal proteins. Prof. Mihaela Zavolan s research group at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel has now discovered that about a quarter of the ribosomal proteins have tissue-specific expression and that different cancer types have their own individual expression pattern of ribosomal proteins. In the future, these patterns may serve as a prognostic marker for cancer and may point towards new therapeutic opportunities. Cellular machines for protein synthesis Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis and are thus essential for the cell. Therefore, it has long been assumed that the expression of the individual components of the ribosomes is strictly controlled and invariant. A few studies, however, have already suggested that the expression of individual ribosomal proteins is altered in cancers as well as in diseases of the hematopoietic system such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Cancer signature  revealed by systematic data analysis Mihaela Zavolan and her co-worker Joao Guimaraes have systematically analyzed ribosomal protein expression in thirty tissue types, three hundred different cell types and sixteen different types of tumors, such as lung and breast cancer. In contrast to previous assumptions, they found a wide variability in ribosomal protein gene expression. In particular, hematopoietic and tumor cells display the most complex expression pattern.  For us, it was really impressive to see that consistent signatures emerged for the different cancer types after the analysis of distinct data sets including patient samples,  explains first author Guimaraes.  The pattern of the dysregulated proteins is very striking, whereby the expression of some ribosomal proteins is systematically reduced, and of others increased in cancer cells. This suggests that individual ribosomal proteins can either suppress or promote tumorigenesis.  Expression pattern as a prognostic marker Furthermore, the scientists discovered a strong relationship between the  signature  in breast cancer and the relapse-free survival.  We were quite surprised to find that the expression level of just three ribosomal proteins allows a fairly accurate prognosis of disease progression, comparable to the best predictive markers that are currently known , Zavolan points out.  Our study demonstrates the potential of such expression signatures for the prognosis and perhaps a diagnosis of cancer. We are especially interested to study the functions of individual ribosomal proteins and hopefully open the door for new therapeutic options,  explains the scientist.

Costs can be astronomical where these medications are needed most, and when doctors are able to acquire those medications they face another challenge   time. Drugs are perishable and some require refrigeration, which can be difficult to provide in the world s poorest regions. Now, a new study appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals a new way to improve the stability of common protein drugs and extend shelf life. Complex structures and poor chemical stability of biopharmaceuticals such as proteins, peptides and antibodies used to treat various illnesses and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and lymphoma can, over time, render drugs ineffective   the medicine simply becomes inactive. The study, led by Matthew Webber, assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in the College of Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, tested a novel route for non-covalent protein modification of insulin and glucagon, both used in treating diabetes, as well as an antibody drug used in treating leukemia, lymphoma and autoimmune disease. The results demonstrated significant stability for this new additive.  Our molecules interact with protein drugs reversibly, but when they are bound, they provide a protective shell,  said Webber.  This keeps the proteins from aggregating. This shell also protects the proteins from sticking to the wall of their storage vial, a major reason protein drugs become denatured and inactive.  Stability of insulin when formulated with the new additive increased from approximately 14 hours to over 100 days while maintaining complete activity even under stressed conditions.  We are simulating stressed environmental conditions for storage,  Webber said.  So by keeping these drugs at elevated temperatures with agitation, we provide maximal stress to the formulation to understand the stabilizing effects of our additive on protein drugs.  The glucagon samples, which typically lose stability in solution in under an hour, remained soluble for at least 24 hours. The therapeutic antibody also maintained its activity when stressed.  We have reason to believe this additive would be effective in many biopharmaceuticals beyond those evaluated in our research,  Webber said. However, Webber notes that  regulatory approval and financial support would be needed to for mass distribution and use   a process that could take several years or more.

The accurate diagnosis of epilepsy seizures remains a challenge to physicians and patients. Current diagnostic tools can be cumbersome, expensive and may have sub-optimal accuracy. The considerable time and cost of current diagnostic methods could pose a burden to patients and healthcare systems, and may also result in treatment delays for some epilepsy patients and inappropriate treatment for others.  The EvoScore START test is a new approach to the diagnosis of epileptic seizures. It analyzes the ratio and concentration of key protein biomarkers in a simple blood test format to determine whether an event was actually a seizure, with sensitivity and specificity of 90% or more. It is estimated that only about 15% of suspected seizure-like events are actual epileptic seizures, yet there are no easily available tools that can definitively distinguish a seizure from another event.   Evogen aims to be the leader in neurology proteomic and genomic testing, and we believe that EvoScore START has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of epilepsy,  said Todd Wallach, president and chief executive officer of Evogen.  We are accordingly thrilled to work with epilepsy leader UCB to conduct further development of this innovative biomarker-based blood test. We have always admired UCB s long-standing commitment to the epilepsy field and look forward to UCB s expert help in further refining this important new diagnostic tool for epilepsy patients and their healthcare providers.   UCB is excited about the potential of better diagnostic tests to improve individual experiences for people with epilepsy,  explained Jeff Wren, Head of UCB s Neurology Patient Value Unit.  We believe the availability of more accurate and accessible diagnostics, like EvoScore START, may improve time to care for epilepsy patients and could deliver additional value across the broader healthcare system.

The new type of drug treatment, which they tested in asthmatic lab mice and in tissue from cadaveric human lungs, appears to have an add-in effect to drug mainstays, like albuterol, and might potentially save lives, according to authors of the study, published online on Dec. 5, 2016, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. One in 12 adults has asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2009, asthma was found to be responsible for close to 500,000 hospitalizations, 1.9 million emergency department visits and 3,388 deaths.  Our hope is that this will be a new, effective drug treatment strategy for dampening exaggerated airway responsiveness in asthma, even under circumstances in which existing interventions are ineffective,  said Aparna Sundaram, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at UCSF and the lead author of the study. The drug used in the experiments on mice had previously been tested in phase II clinical trials as a way to block blood-vessel growth within tumors. The UCSF researchers have begun working with pharmaceutical scientists on campus to develop more potent drugs. Sundaram probed the intricacies of a biological mechanism that generates tension during  bronchospasm,  the prolonged contraction of the smooth muscle that surrounds lung airways that occurs during an asthma attack, which results in narrowing of the air passages and oxygen deprivation. Sundaram identified proteins that cause airway muscle cells to stick to the underlying cellular scaffolding and transmit the force generated by muscle contraction, and she found that she could disrupt these attachments and thereby decrease muscle contraction and relieve constriction of the airways.  Little progress  for therapies that target muscle The underlying cause of hyper-responsiveness of airway smooth muscle in asthma is an abnormal immune response. Steroid drugs have long been used to quiet the immune system in asthmatics. Newer drugs more specifically target immune responses that underlie the development of asthma. But these drugs act slowly and they do not work for all patients. Faster-acting rescue medicines, such as albuterol, a bronchodilator developed a half-century ago, target the contracting muscle that is the immediate cause of bronchospasm in asthma, allowing constricted airways to expand again. These remain standard treatment for asthma attacks.  There has been very little progress in terms of therapies that target muscle,  Sundaram said. In part, this is because the biological mechanism targeted by standard therapies plays a crucial role in cellular processes throughout the body, and efforts to improve old drug standbys have resulted in experimental drugs that often fail due to intolerable side effects, she said. These standard therapies affect the movement of muscle filaments that occurs during muscle contraction as a result of the interaction of the proteins actin and myosin, through well-understood mechanisms that have been described in myriad textbooks for generations.  What is most exciting about this new work is that we showed we can modulate tension transmission in a way that does not depend on modulating actin and myosin,  Sundaram said. Sundaram designed the experiments and wrote the newly published study with senior author Dean Sheppard, MD, professor of medicine and Chief of the Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Division at UCSF. Drug found to enhance airway-relaxing effect of standard treatment Sundaram homed in on a specific member of a family of molecules known as integrins, a type of cell protein that spans the cell s outer membrane and plays a role in tethering cells to the underlying matrix of scaffolding proteins, but which also engages in bi-directional signaling to reshape this extracellular matrix in response to changing conditions. Just as there are many integrins, there also are a variety of distinct structural proteins that are incorporated within the extracellular matrix. Through a series of experiments, Sundaram eventually determined that muscle tension in airway smooth muscle was largely determined by the attachment of a specific cellular integrin, called  5 1, to a specific scaffolding protein, called fibronectin. In experiments on airway tissue from cadaveric human lungs, the UCSF researchers found that disrupting the matrix surrounding cells impaired contraction in response to administration of a type of asthma-inducing  cytokine  molecule that is secreted by immune cells. In addition, when the researchers administered the cancer drug to inhibit  5 1 directly into the airways of mice, it also dampened the airway hyper-responsiveness caused by allergen challenge. Furthermore, using the drug to block  5 1 in mouse trachea also enhanced the airway-relaxing effect of the standard bronchodilator isoproterenol.  Prevention of asthma through new biologic strategies that target the immune system is important, but regardless of an asthmatic patient s immune system characteristics, the treatment of bronchospasm in asthma will always be required,  Sundaram said.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces-197265,How the Brain Recognizes Faces Machine learning system spontaneously reproduces aspects of human neurology  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. MIT researchers and their colleagues have developed a new computational model of the human brain s face-recognition mechanism that seems to capture aspects of human neurology that previous models have missed. The researchers designed a machine-learning system that implemented their model, and they trained it to recognize particular faces by feeding it a battery of sample images. They found that the trained system included an intermediate processing step that represented a face s degree of rotation   say, 45 degrees from center   but not the direction   left or right. This property wasn t built into the system; it emerged spontaneously from the training process. But it duplicates an experimentally observed feature of the primate face-processing mechanism. The researchers consider this an indication that their system and the brain are doing something similar.  This is not a proof that we understand what s going on,  says Tomaso Poggio, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT and director of the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), a multi-institution research consortium funded by the National Science Foundation and headquartered at MIT.  Models are kind of cartoons of reality, especially in biology. So I would be surprised if things turn out to be this simple. But I think it s strong evidence that we are on the right track.  Indeed, the researchers  new paper includes a mathematical proof that the particular type of machine-learning system they use, which was intended to offer what Poggio calls a  biologically plausible  model of the nervous system, will inevitably yield intermediary representations that are indifferent to angle of rotation. Poggio, who is also a primary investigator at MIT s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, is the senior author on a paper describing the new work, which appeared today in the journal Computational Biology. He s joined on the paper by several other members of both the CBMM and the McGovern Institute: first author Joel Leibo, a researcher at Google DeepMind, who earned his PhD in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT with Poggio as his advisor; Qianli Liao, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science; Fabio Anselmi, a postdoc in the IIT@MIT Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning, a joint venture of MIT and the Italian Institute of Technology; and Winrich Freiwald, an associate professor at the Rockefeller University. Emergent properties The new paper is  a nice illustration of what we want to do in [CBMM], which is this integration of machine learning and computer science on one hand, neurophysiology on the other, and aspects of human behavior,  Poggio says.  That means not only what algorithms does the brain use, but what are the circuits in the brain that implement these algorithms.  Poggio has long believed that the brain must produce  invariant  representations of faces and other objects, meaning representations that are indifferent to objects  orientation in space, their distance from the viewer, or their location in the visual field. Magnetic resonance scans of human and monkey brains suggested as much, but in 2010, Freiwald published a study describing the neuroanatomy of macaque monkeys  face-recognition mechanism in much greater detail. Freiwald showed that information from the monkey s optic nerves passes through a series of brain locations, each of which is less sensitive to face orientation than the last. Neurons in the first region fire only in response to particular face orientations; neurons in the final region fire regardless of the face s orientation   an invariant representation. But neurons in an intermediate region appear to be  mirror symmetric : That is, they re sensitive to the angle of face rotation without respect to direction. In the first region, one cluster of neurons will fire if a face is rotated 45 degrees to the left, and a different cluster will fire if it s rotated 45 degrees to the right. In the final region, the same cluster of neurons will fire whether the face is rotated 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, or anywhere in-between. But in the intermediate region, a particular cluster of neurons will fire if the face is rotated by 45 degrees in either direction, another if it s rotated 30 degrees, and so on. This is the behavior that the researchers  machine-learning system reproduced.  It was not a model that was trying to explain mirror symmetry,  Poggio says.  This model was trying to explain invariance, and in the process, there is this other property that pops out.  Neural training The researchers  machine-learning system is a neural network, so called because it roughly approximates the architecture of the human brain. A neural network consists of very simple processing units, arranged into layers, that are densely connected to the processing units   or nodes   in the layers above and below. Data are fed into the bottom layer of the network, which processes them in some way and feeds them to the next layer, and so on. During training, the output of the top layer is correlated with some classification criterion   say, correctly determining whether a given image depicts a particular person. In earlier work, Poggio s group had trained neural networks to produce invariant representations by, essentially, memorizing a representative set of orientations for just a handful of faces, which Poggio calls  templates.  When the network was presented with a new face, it would measure its difference from these templates. That difference would be smallest for the templates whose orientations were the same as that of the new face, and the output of their associated nodes would end up dominating the information signal by the time it reached the top layer. The measured difference between the new face and the stored faces gives the new face a kind of identifying signature. In experiments, this approach produced invariant representations: A face s signature turned out to be roughly the same no matter its orientation. But the mechanism   memorizing templates   was not, Poggio says, biologically plausible. So instead, the new network uses a variation on Hebb s rule, which is often described in the neurological literature as  neurons that fire together wire together.  That means that during training, as the weights of the connections between nodes are being adjusted to produce more accurate outputs, nodes that react in concert to particular stimuli end up contributing more to the final output than nodes that react independently (or not at all). This approach, too, ended up yielding invariant representations. But the middle layers of the network also duplicated the mirror-symmetric responses of the intermediate visual-processing regions of the primate brain.  I think it s a significant step forward,  says Christof Koch, president and chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.  In this day and age, when everything is dominated by either big data or huge computer simulations, this shows you how a principled understanding of learning can explain some puzzling findings.   They re very careful,  Koch adds.  They re only looking at the feed-forward pathway   in other words, the first 80, 100 milliseconds. The monkey opens its eyes, and within 80 to 100 milliseconds, it can recognize a face and push a button signaling that. The question is what goes on in those 80 to 100 milliseconds, and the model that they have seems to explain that quite well.  Source: Story from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Mazmanian, Ph.D., the company s scientific founder, have discovered a novel biological link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson s disease (PD). In a validated PD mouse model, gut bacteria were shown to promote hallmark disease processes including inflammation of the nervous system and motor dysfunction. The findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiome may provide a new approach for diagnosing and treating Parkinson s disease. The paper titled,  Gut Microbiota Regulate Motor Deficits and Neuroinflammation in a Model of Parkinson s Disease,  can be accessed in the current online edition of Cell. Over the past few years, evidence has accumulated pointing to a critical role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease. In addition, bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain has been implicated in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The research published in Cell is the first to find that alterations to bacteria in the gut may represent a risk factor for the onset and severity of Parkinson s disease. This finding opens the door for the potential identification of specific gut microbes that may impact PD. In the future, these microbes might be used as a biomarker for disease states, a method to identify patients who might be at-risk for PD and as novel therapeutic targets or microbial-based treatments.  Our findings provide a completely new paradigm for how environmental factors may contribute to Parkinson s disease and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders. The notion that these diseases may be impacted by pathology in the gut and not only in the brain is a radical departure from conventional research in neuroscience,  said Dr. Sarkis Mazmanian, the Louis & Nelly Soux Professor of Microbiology in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at the California Institute of Technology and Scientific Founder of Axial Biotherapeutics.  Parkinson s disease is complex and there are several genetic predispositions and environmental risks that play a role, but we believe our findings shed light on a previously unrecognized and potentially important part of this puzzle.  Dr. Mazmanian continued,  Gut bacteria in patients with Parkinson s disease are different from those microbes found in healthy individuals. When we transplanted the microbiome from Parkinson s patients into mice, we found that symptoms like motor deficits and neuroinflammation were more severe compared to mice harboring gut bacteria from healthy controls. This suggests that there is a fundamental relationship between bacteria in the gut and the disease processes involved in Parkinson s disease.  To conduct their experiments, the researchers utilized a mouse model of Parkinson s disease that overexpresses the human protein, alpha-synuclein. This protein is thought to be central to the disease process of PD. The mice were bred in a germ-free setting, devoid of all microbes. Using the germ-free animals as a platform, the researchers could then investigate how gut bacteria altered disease outcomes in mice. When human gut microbiota from PD patients were introduced into the model system (by fecal microbiota transplants), they were shown to enhance the typical hallmarks of the disease such as motor deficits, inflammation and alpha-synuclein aggregation, compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. The researchers also identified specific microbial metabolites that induce PD-related symptoms in mice. These findings suggest that gut microbes may contribute to, or even cause, PD symptoms in genetically predisposed individuals. The studies were carried out by a multidisciplinary team from Caltech; University of California San Diego; Arizona State University; Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg; University of California, Los Angeles; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Gut bacteria provide immense physiological benefit, and we do not yet have the data to know which particular species are problematic or beneficial in Parkinson s disease,  continued Dr. Mazmanian.  It is important to note that there are currently no antibiotic or microbial treatments available for human use that can replicate the effect we observed in mice. However, our next step will be to define the specific gut microbes that may contribute to the development of Parkinson s disease, as this could translate into novel biomarkers to identify at-risk patients. Additionally, these findings could lead to novel therapeutic approaches that avoid the complications of delivering drugs to the brain and may be safer and more effective.   Axial Biotherapeutics will build on these groundbreaking findings and the larger body of work that our scientific founder, Dr. Sarkis Mazmanian, has established in this area. Our goal as a company will be to focus on translating these discoveries into a unique class of microbial-targeted therapeutics that could become breakthrough therapies for a variety of underserved neurological diseases and disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson s and Alzheimer s disease,  said David Donabedian, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Axial Biotherapeutics.

The findings, published in Cell on December, could have a clinical role in improving efficiency of immunotherapy drugs.  Before our study, no one knew that the Hippo pathway was regulating immunogenicity,  said first author Toshiro Moroishi, MD, PhD, postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.  LATS1/2 deletion in cancer cells improves tumor immunogenicity, leading to the destruction of cancerous cells by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.  Hippo pathway signaling regulates organ size by moderating cell growth, apoptosis and stem cell renewal, but dysregulation contributes to cancer development. In vitro studies of Hippo pathway kinases LATS1/2 showed that the loss of these enzymes promoted cell proliferation and tumor survival. In vivo research using immune-compromised mouse models also supports a tumor suppressor function of the Hippo pathway. However, when Moroishi and team deleted LATS1/2 from mouse cancer cells and examined tumor growth in models with healthy immune systems researchers found that immunogenicity   the ability to stimulate an immune response   improved, destroying cancer cells. Researchers caution that immune systems of mouse models are different from the human immune system so the response might be different and further studies are needed. If the outcome proves to be the same, using a LATS1/2 inhibitor alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor may stimulate the immune system of patients that previously did not respond to immunotherapy treatments. Currently, most immunotherapy research focuses on targeting the immune system, but the new findings reveal that tumor cells may also be vulnerable to inhibitors.  Inhibiting LATS1/2 could be an attractive approach to treat cancer,  said Kun-Liang Guan, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology at Moores Cancer Center and senior author of the study.  LATS is an ideal target because there are many kinase inhibitors that have been successfully developed as cancer drugs.  This study focused on breast cancer, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma but the same could be applied to other cancers, said Moroishi. Study co-authors include: Tomoko Hayashi, Yu Fujita, Dennis A. Carson, UC San Diego; Wei-Wei Pan, UC San Diego and Jiaxing University; Matthew V. Holt, and Jun Qin, Baylor College of Medicine.

""Our findings show there is no measurable variation in how individuals with autism respond to repeated visual and tactile stimuli,"" said John Foxe, PhD, the chair of the University of Rochester Medical Center Department of Neuroscience and senior author of the study. ""Consequently, the concept that the symptoms of autism may arise from unreliable brain activity in response to the senses is in all likelihood a scientific cul-de-sac."" See Also: Researchers offer new theory: Autism has roots in early-life injury to the cerebellum The neuronal unreliability theory, which has gained traction in recent years in the wake of a study published in 2012, is based on the assumption that the brain's response to repetitive stimuli visual, audio, or touch should be steady and consistent. According to this theory, the brain's response is not constant in individuals with autism and, consequently, alters their perception of the physical environment and impairs cognitive and social development. The theory did not ring true with Foxe and his colleagues, based on their decades of studying the brain activity of children with ASDs. Furthermore, the original studies that formed the basis for this hypothesis involved functional MRI experiments which measure changes in the blood oxygen levels in the brain. While fluctuations in blood flow are important indicators of brain activity, these measures do not precisely correlate to the more rapid electrical activity that occurs in the brain when nerve cells are stimulated. Related: Autistic and non-autistic brain differences isolated for first time The new study involved 20 individuals diagnosed with autism and 20 individuals who served as healthy controls. The participants were fitted with a dense array of electrodes on the surface of their scalp to record brain electrical activity and were then exposed to repeated visual stimuli. No matter how the researchers measured the variability of the responses, brain responses in autism were as stable as those of the controls. To make sure that this wasn't just the case in the visual system, the team also evaluated tactile inputs repeated touches to the wrists of participants and, once again, measures of brainwave responses provided no evidence whatsoever of increased response variability in the individuals with autism. ""The point of this study is not to make the case that there aren't any differences in the way that people with an ASDs process touch, sight or sound; research shows clear differences in some cases,"" said Sophie Molholm, PhD, an associate professor of Pediatrics and Neuroscience at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and co-author of the study. ""Rather, it is to say that whatever those differences may be, they likely don't simply arise because the brain responses in autism are more variable."" The authors contend that, while the study essentially demonstrates negative findings, it represents an important contribution in the field of autism where much of our understanding of the disease is to the frustration of patients, families, research, and caregivers alike long on theory and conjecture but short on solid scientific fact.

A new paper published in the journal eLife finds that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss leads to increased consumption of unhealthy foods, specifically sucrose and fat. See Also: Exercise can increase levels of hunger-promoting endocannabinoids even if you are sleep-deprived The researchers at the University of Tsukuba's International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine used a new method to produce REM sleep loss in mice along with a chemical-genetic technique to block prefrontal cortex neurons and the behaviors they mediate. As a result, the researchers discovered that inhibiting these neurons reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption while having no effect on fat consumption. REM sleep is a unique phase of sleep in mammals that is closely associated with dreaming and characterized by random eye movement and almost complete paralysis of the body. The prefrontal cortex plays a role in judging the palatability of foods through taste, smell and texture.

Some of these experiences trigger the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain, and begin the process of forming memories. See Also: No dream: Electric brain stimulation during sleep can boost memoryHowever, these initial memory traces are fragile and only a small number will become long-term memories with the potential to last a lifetime. For this transition to occur, the brain must stabilize the memory traces through a process called consolidation. During consolidation, the brain produces new proteins that strengthen the fragile memory traces. However, if a new experience occurs while an existing memory trace is being consolidated, the new stimuli could disrupt or even hijack the consolidation process. The brain partially solves this problem by postponing some of the memory consolidation to a period in which new experiences are minimalized, that is, while we are asleep. But what happens if we wake up while consolidation is taking place? How does the brain prevent events that occur just after awakening from interrupting the consolidation process? A new study by Prof. Abraham Susswein of the Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences and The Leslie and Susan Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar-Ilan University, has now answered this question. Related: How sleep deprivation harms memoryPublished in eLife, the article's first author is Roi Levy, whose doctoral research conducted in Prof. Susswein's lab is described in the present study, which also includes part of the doctoral research of David Levitan. Susswein and his colleagues have used a seemingly unlikely subject for their study, namely the sea hare Aplysia. These marine slugs are convenient for neuroscientific investigation because of their simple nervous systems and large neurons, and because they have been shown to be capable of basic forms of learning. Just after training during waking hours, proteins are synthesized to initiate the consolidation of new memory. Consolidation proteins are produced again in greater quantities during sleep for subsequent processes on the memory trace. The researchers found that blocking the production of consolidation proteins in sleeping sea slugs prevents these creatures from forming long-term memories, confirming that, like us, they do consolidate memories during sleep. Susswein, Levy and Levitan now show that exposing sea slugs to new stimuli immediately after they wake up does not trigger the formation of new memories. In a learning paradigm affecting sea slugs' feeding activity, the animals were trained after being awakened from sleep. Learn More: How the brain consolidates memory during deep sleep On awakening, interactions between new experiences and consolidation are prevented because the brain blocks long-term memory arising from the new stimuli. However, when the researchers treated the slugs just prior to the training with a drug that inhibits protein production, they found that the new stimuli could generate long-term memory. These findings show that proteins blocking the formation of new memories prevent an experience upon waking from being effective in producing memory. Removing this block (by inhibiting protein production) allows experiences just after waking to be encoded in memory. This even applies to experiences that are too brief to trigger memory formation in fully awake sea slugs. Susswein: ""The major insight from this research is that there is an active process in the brain which inhibits the ability to learn new things and protects the consolidation of memories."" The researchers also compared learning by fully awake sea slugs trained in isolation and those trained with companions. They discovered that training in social isolation appears to inhibit new learning, and identified similar molecular processes common to both training in isolation and to training on waking from sleep. ""Our next step following on from this work,"" says Susswein, ""is to identify these memory blocking proteins and to fathom how they prevent the formation of new memories."" He adds: ""We may also find that the blocking process accounts for why we cannot remember our dreams when we wake up.""

""Unfortunately, prolonged or pronounced stress and adversity, including poverty and trauma, can delay children's self-regulation development."" Murray said the good news is research shows that interventions can improve outcomes for children from backgrounds of risk and adversity. Her research team, which includes Duke Center for Child and Family Policy's Katie Rosanbalm and Christina Christopoulos, recommend embedding a focus on self-regulation in schools and other settings. ""For optimal self-regulation, a child or adolescent needs to have a full bucket of skills and supports on which to draw,"" Murray said. ""There are two crucial periods when children are developing their self-regulation skills the most in early childhood and early adolescence when teachers and parents can help them build the skills they need for the rest of their lives."" Murray said many self-regulation interventions are designed for use in schools. ""Schools are an ideal place for interventions because there is opportunity to build skills in a cohesive approach from preschool through secondary school and because of the potential power of shared learning with peers,"" she said. ""Interventions in schools can impact the culture and climate in a way that benefits all students."" Learn More: Early parental program improves long-term childhood outcomes According to the report, strengthening self-regulation can be thought of like teaching literacy. Similar to literacy, self-regulation develops with simpler skills first, which build upon one another.

They suggest providing universal interventions across childhood and into early adulthood, with a strong emphasis on teaching caregivers (including teachers and other school staff) how to support children. She said the keys to this support are warm and responsive relationships, paired with positive discipline and consistency. The report also recommends providing more intensive intervention to children who are experiencing self-regulation difficulties. In 12 elementary schools, Murray's team is currently delivering and studying a small-group pull-out program teaching socio-emotional skills from ""The Incredible Years.""

The organoids, clusters of thousands of human brain cells, cannot perform a brain's basic functions, much less generate thought. But they provide a far more authentic model the first of its kind for studying how brain tumours grow, and how they can be stopped. See Also: An accessible approach to making a mini-brain ""This puts the tumour within the context of a brain, instead of a flat plastic dish,"" said Christian Naus, a professor in the department of cellular and physiological sciences at the University of British Colummbia, Canada, who conceived the project with a Japanese company that specializes in bioprinting. He shared details about the technique at November's annual Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego. ""When cells grow in three dimensions instead of two, adhering only to each other and not to plastic, an entirely different set of genes are activated."" Naus studies glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive brain cancer that usually takes root deep inside the brain, and easily spreads. The standard care is surgery, followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy, but gliomas almost always return because a few malignant cells manage to leave the tumour and invade surrounding brain tissue. From the time of diagnosis, average survival is one year. The idea for creating a more authentic model of glioblastoma originated when Naus partnered with a Japanese biotechnology company, Cyfuse, that has developed a particular technique for printing human tissues based on the Japanese art of flower arranging known as ikebana. In ikebana, artists use a heavy plate with brass needles sticking up, upon which the stems of flowers are affixed. Cyfuse's bioprinting technique uses a much smaller plate covered with microneedles. Don't Miss: A patient s budding cortex in a dish?Working with Naus and research associate Wun Chey Sin, Kaori Harada of Cyfuse skewered small spheres of human neural stem cells on the microneedles. As the stem cells multiplied and differentiated into brain tissue, they merged and formed larger structures known as organoids, about two millimetres to three millimetres in diameter. Although the organoids lack blood vessels, they are small enough to allow oxygen and nutrients to permeate the tissue. ""The cells make their own environment,"" said Naus, Canada Research Chair in Gap Junctions and Neurological Disorders. ""We're not doing anything except printing them, and then they self-assemble."" The team then implanted cancerous glioma cells inside the organoids. Naus found that the gliomas spread into the surrounding normal cells. Having shown that the tumour invades the surrounding tissue, Naus envisions that such a technique can be used with a patient's own cells both their normal brain cells and their cancerous cells to grow a personalized organoid with a glioma at its core, and then test a variety of possible drugs or combinations of treatment to see if any of them stop the cancer from growing and invading.

See Also: Shedding new light on protein aggregates and the diseases they cause Genetic analyses in baker's yeast now reveal that these large-scale expansions are controlled by genes that have been implicated in a process for repairing DNA breaks, leading the researchers to surmise that the expansions occur while breaks are being healed. Baker's yeast, known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is frequently used in scientific research. The findings are published in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. ""We think these large-scale repeat expansions could occur in a single step,"" said Sergei Mirkin, PhD, White Family Chair in Biology at Tufts School of Arts and Sciences and corresponding author on the paper. ""The DNA replication machinery stalls within those repeats, which ultimately results in the formation of DNA breaks. To heal those breaks, cells seem to involve a special path of repair, called break-induced replication, which sacrifices the fidelity of DNA synthesis for the sake of a quick fix. As a result, large numbers of extra repeats can be added while the break is healed."" Previous studies have identified certain mutations in DNA replication machinery that account for small-scale repeat expansions in which only a few extra repeats are added, but the cause of rapid accumulation of hundreds of repeats has remained unclear until now. Learn More: Novel fly model of motor neuron degeneration provides new avenues for exploration in humans To detect and analyze large-scale expansions of CAG and CTG repeats, Mirkin and his colleagues developed an experimental system in yeast that observed simultaneous additions of more than 100 triplets, a first for such systems. This observation is similar to what happens in human disease. Jane Kim, PhD, who was a research assistant professor in Mirkin's lab when the research was conducted and who is the paper's first author, said the model suggests answers to two questions that have puzzled researchers. ""Not only does this model explain how additions of hundreds of repeats can occur in human diseases, but it can also account for a bias towards expansions observed in human pedigrees,"" said Kim, now an assistant professor at California State University San Marcos.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/rnai-activated-in-response-to-influenza-207904,RNAi Activated in Response to Influenza Discovery could lead to better ways of combating serious infections  including Ebola and Zika  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of California, Riverside, have shown for the first time that RNA interference (RNAi)   an antiviral mechanism known to be used by plants and lower organisms   is active in the response of human cells to some important viruses. In their report receiving advance online publication in Nature Microbiology, the investigators document both the production of RNAi molecules in human cells infected with the influenza A virus and the suppression of RNAi defense by a viral protein known to block the process in a common animal model.   Viruses are the most abundant infectious agents and are a constant threat to human health,  says Kate Jeffrey, PhD, of the Gastrointestinal Unit in the MGH Department of Medicine, co-corresponding author of the paper.  Vaccines are somewhat effective but can have limited use when viruses like influenza rapidly mutate from year to year. Identifying therapeutic targets within patients that could help them fight off an infection is a critical strategy for combating the spread of common, often-dangerous viruses.  First described in the 1990s   a discovery that led to the 2006 Nobel Prize   RNAi is a process by which organisms suppress the expression of target genes through the action of small RNA segments that bind to corresponding gene sequences. Not only is RNAi used to regulate gene expression within an organism, it also can combat viral infection by silencing the activity of viral genes required for the pathogen s replication.  Whether RNAi contributes to antiviral defense in mammals has been uncertain. The only previous demonstration   by researchers led by Shou-Wei Ding, PhD, a professor of Plant Pathology and Microbiology at UC Riverside and co-corresponding author of the current study   was done in embryonic stem cells and in newborn mice. Ding has been studying antiviral RNAi for more than two decades and was the first to describe the action of the influenza virus protein NS1 in blocking RNAi in fruit flies. His team collaborated with investigators from Jeffrey s laboratory to investigate if an RNAi response is induced in human and mouse cells infected with the influenza virus, one of many important viruses using RNA as its genetic material.  Their experiments verified that influenza-A-infected mature human cells do generate the small RNA segments used in RNAi but that virally-produced NS1 blocks the processing of those molecules into the complexes that bind to and silence their target genes. If cells were infected with an influenza A mutant lacking NS1, they proceeded to produce large number of the molecular complexes required for RNAi, which include a protein called Argonaute that slices through the target gene.  Experiments in cells with an inactivated form of Argonaute   which contributes only to the antiviral and not the gene regulation activity of RNAi   confirmed that they were observing an antiviral RNAi response. The observation that a viral protein called VP35, which is used by the Ebola and Marburg viruses to suppress RNAi, suggests that RNAi may also be active against those dangerous pathogens and other viruses that utilized RNA as their genetic code or in their replication cycle.   We now need to assess more directly the role of antiviral RNAi in human infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses   which include Ebola, West Nile and Zika along with influenza   and how harnessing or boosting the antiviral RNAi response could be used to reduce the severity of these infections,  says Jeffrey, who is an assistant professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Bringing the expertise of Dr. Ding s team, which specializes in the RNAi biology of lower organisms, together with my group that specializes in mammalian immunology was a perfect match.  The teams will continue to work together to investigate some of these questions.  Source: Story from Massachusetts General Hospital.

The ability to convert cells from one type to another holds great promise for engineering cells and tissues for therapeutic application, and the new Wisconsin study could help speed research and bring the technology to the clinic faster. The new approach, published Dec. 5 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), uses a library of artificial transcription factors to switch on genes that convert cells from one type to another. Natural transcription factors are cellular molecules that bind to DNA to turn genes on and off. They help determine cell fate, meaning that if a cell is destined to be a skin cell, a heart cell or an eye cell, different transcription factors switch on specific sets of genes that program the cell to attain one state or another. Using artificial transcription factors made in the lab, researchers are trying to find which ones best mimic these natural changes in cell fate.  Our interest in changing cell fate comes from understanding how cells selectively use the information in our genomes to make specific cell types and also from the many therapeutic benefits such knowledge can offer,  says Asuka Eguchi, the study s lead author and a member of Professor Aseem Ansari s lab in the UW Madison Department of Biochemistry.  For example, if a patient needs a certain cell type, the idea is we can reprogram their own cells to what they need, rather than relying on donor cells. This allows us to study patient-specific cells and potentially avoids issues with immune response where a patient s body could reject the cells.  Conventional methods for finding the correct factors to change cell fate require scientists to perform a trial-and-error approach. They need prior knowledge about which combination of the thousands of natural factors would possibly work within a tightly choreographed timeframe to program cell fate. It is a slow, laborious, failure-prone process, the researchers say. The new method utilizes  libraries  of millions of artificial transcription factors that were designed to bypass natural controls and switch on genes that might be activated in a given cell type. In addition, the factors contain an attachment that lets them bind and work in concert to affect genes, a step not traditionally taken. By exposing the library of factors to cells, they can see if cell fate changed in any of them. If so, they can revisit those cells to see which factors were responsible. For their experiments, the Wisconsin group started with mice fibroblasts, a cell in connective tissue, and looked for them to be reprogrammed into what are called induced pluripotent stem cells. Given proper cues, these types of stem cells can become any type of cell in an animal s body. The technique could also be applied to humans. By reprogramming, the researchers mean that the artificial factors would trigger all of the right genes to cause the cell to shift from one type to another.  Imagine you have millions of keys and only a unique key or combination of keys can turn a motor on,  says Ansari, who is also affiliated with UW Madison s Genome Center of Wisconsin.  We test all those keys in parallel and when we see the motor fire up, we go back to see exactly which key switched it on.  In the process of testing their tool, the researchers discovered three combinations of the artificial factors that reprogrammed a fibroblast into a stem cell. The factors played a role similar to that of a natural transcription factor important in a process, called Oct4.  In this unbiased approach, we can try to basically cast a wide net on the whole genome and let the cell tell us if there are important genes perturbed,  Ansari says.  It s a way to induce cell fate conversions without having to know what genes might be important because we are able to test so many by using an unbiased library of molecules that can search nearly every corner of the genome.  The reprogramming of fibroblasts into stem cells has been well studied. The researchers put their approach to the test in this context because it places a high bar and requires significant changes to the cell. With this proof of concept, the Wisconsin scientists hope other researchers use their method to discover new genes that can drive more difficult conversions of cell fate.  Generating these pluripotent stem cells also helps us avoid having to make embryonic stem cells, which can be controversial,  says Eguchi, who is a recent graduate of the UW Madison Cellular and Molecular Biology Training Program.  We can also start better investigating direct conversions, which are conversions from one cell type to another without the need to go to the pluripotent stage first because that can cause problems in some contexts. This tool opens up the doors to research these areas more effectively.  Source: Story from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Original piece written by Kaine Korzekwa.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/more-effective-strategy-for-producing-flu-vaccines-201411,More Effective Strategy for Producing Flu Vaccines  Researchers have developed a virus backbone  allowing producers to grow vaccine viruses in mammalian cells  rather than in eggs  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A team of researchers led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, professor of pathobiological sciences at the University of Wisconsin Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, has developed technology that could improve the production of vaccines that protect people from influenza B. That technology is an influenza B vaccine virus  backbone  that would allow producers to grow vaccine viruses at high yield in mammalian cell culture rather than in eggs. Using the backbone as a template to add vaccine-virus-specific components, it would offer protection against both lineages of influenza B that circulate in the human population.  We want to provide a system that produces influenza vaccines that are more efficacious,  says Kawaoka.  It is better to produce influenza viruses for vaccine production in cells instead of eggs, but the problem is that influenza virus does not grow well in cell culture compared with embryonated eggs.  The new technology may overcome that challenge. The team published its results Monday, Dec. 5, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Each year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, decides which strains of influenza virus to include in the seasonal flu vaccine. It typically includes two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains. Growing vaccine viruses in high-yield cell culture should improve the ability of seasonal vaccines to protect against influenza A and B because vaccine viruses grown in mammalian cell culture are less likely to mutate compared to those grown in eggs. Mutations can lead to vaccine viruses that no longer match the intended strains of influenza.  It may still not be perfect, but it will at least be substantially better than current vaccines,  says Kawaoka, who notes no one else has successfully tried to produce high-yield influenza B vaccine virus before now. Last year, his research team created a high-yield influenza A vaccine virus candidate for cell culture production. Per the CDC, growing vaccine viruses in high-yield cell culture may also enable faster and potentially greater production of vaccine. This could improve the ability of health officials to respond during an influenza pandemic. To develop the influenza B vaccine virus backbone, Kawaoka s team screened influenza B viruses for random genetic mutations that led to improved replication. Using these mutants as templates, the researchers attached the genes that code for the surface proteins that trigger the human immune response (and thus offer protection in vaccinated individuals)   HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase). They selected the combinations of backbone mutations that supported better growth in cell culture, identifying two candidate backbones that led to higher amounts of vaccine virus. The team identified the characteristics of each backbone that contributed to their improved yield and also found the backbones to be genetically stable. However, Kawaoka points out that more testing is required to discern whether they would increase vaccine virus yield under industrial conditions. Several companies and federal agencies have already contacted him about the influenza A and influenza B backbones, Kawaoka says, and he is hopeful the systems can be adopted by vaccine manufacturers and grown in cell culture facilities already available in the United States and Japan. Kawaoka s goal is to help develop more effective vaccines to protect people from influenza infection. According to the CDC, influenza sickens millions, hospitalizes hundreds of thousands, and kills tens of thousands of people each year in the U.S.  This is something we have to do,  Kawaoka says.

Distributed through the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, these powerful tools are a crucial first step toward visualizing the dynamic organization of cells to better understand what makes human cells healthy and what goes wrong in disease.  Each of our cells the fundamental units of life are like a city, with people and resources that move around and factories that generate those resources and carry out important functions,  says Rick Horwitz, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Allen Institute for Cell Science.  With these cell lines, we aim to give the cell science community a kind of live traffic map to see when and where the parts of the cell are with the clarity and consistency they need to make progress toward understanding human health and tackling disease. Scientists at the Allen Institute for Cell Science used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to insert fluorescent tags for major cellular structures into human induced pluripotent stem cells. Unlike typical methods which flood the cell with fluorescent protein, these highly precise tags show exactly when and where the structures are at various stages in the cell s lifecycle.  By lowering the barrier to entry for cell biologists wishing to work on iPS cells, the availability of these lines will usher in a new era in cell biology,  says Anthony Hyman, Ph.D., Director and Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics. This first collection of five cell lines targets a set of major cellular structures that help to orient the cell. These include the nucleus (tagged by the protein lamin B1), mitochondria (Tom20), microtubules (alpha-tubulin), cell-to-cell junctions (desmoplakin) and adhesion (paxillin). Subsequent collections will be released throughout 2017.  This kind of precise fluorescent tagging of structures in human stem cells is valuable for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that the pluripotent stem cells can be turned into a large number of cell types, like heart, brain or skin,  says Ruwanthi Gunawardane, Ph.D., Director of Stem Cells and Gene Editing at the Allen Institute for Cell Science.  Our cells are healthy and as close to normal human cells as we can study in the lab, making these cell lines a powerful platform to identify the functions of genes, screen drugs, determine differentiation state and much more.   With these tagged cell lines, we get to  spy  on the organization of healthy, normal human cells in a way that scientists never could before,  says Susanne Rafelski, Ph.D., Director of Assay Development at the Allen Institute for Cell Science.  The images and movies we can generate from these lines show the cell s major structures with astonishing clarity and empower a broad, multi-structure view of how cells change as they execute their various activities and turn into different kinds of cells.  The cell lines will be available for scientists around the world to use not just to understand the fundamentals of the cell, but also to investigate disease. Key mutations can be introduced to the cells in order to study how disease progresses in a dish, with broad potential impacts on the fields of biomedical science and personalized medicine.

After receiving a single dose of an experimental gene therapy in a clinical trial, patients with hemophilia produced near-normal levels of clotting factor IX, allowing them to stop clotting factor infusions and to pursue normal activities of daily life without disabling bleeding episodes. Lindsey A. George, MD, a hematologist at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is the lead investigator of the phase 1/2 clinical trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) today highlighted updated findings from that trial in a press conference during its annual meeting in San Diego. George will present those study results tomorrow at an ASH plenary scientific session.  Katherine High, MD, a senior author of the study and Spark Therapeutics s president and chief scientific officer, described the updated interim trial data at today s press conference. The clinical trial of nine adult hemophilia B patients, aged 18 to 52 years, used a single dose of a gene therapy product engineered to enter patients  liver cells and direct the production of the blood clotting factor that they lack.  George notes,  Our goal in this trial was to evaluate the safety of the gene therapy product and secondarily, to determine if we could achieve levels of factor IX that could decrease bleeding events in patients.  She added,  These patients have a severe or moderate level of hemophilia, with baseline clotting factor level less than or equal to 2 percent of levels in healthy people. In current treatment, patients with hemophilia give themselves intravenous doses of factor IX up to a couple times a week. While generally effective, factor levels fluctuate, and patients may suffer painful, disabling joint bleeds when their clotting factor levels drop. Such a regimen requires significant planning of daily activities.  In the current trial, said George, the patients maintained factor levels of approximately 30 percent, enough to lift them out of the severe category.  At these new levels, hemophilia patients do not typically need to self-treat with factor to avoid bleeding events,  she said, adding,  This represents a potential dramatic improvement in their quality of life and a shift in the way we think about treating hemophilia.  A factor level of 30 percent is near-normal, she added, and patients would be expected to experience bleeding only in the event of major trauma or surgery. One subject self-infused two days after receiving the gene therapy vector. Beyond this, no patients had any bleeding events or required factor for any reason. With significant reduction in bleeding events and factor use, six of the first seven patients reported increased physical activity and all reported improved quality of life. Two additional patients received the gene therapy product too recently to determine quality-of-life measures. Previous hemophilia gene therapy trials have been frustrated by an immune response to the gene therapy product that limited the success of the therapy. In the current trial, two patients experienced an immune response to the gene therapy that did not result in safety concerns, and were treated with steroids. The patients are still undergoing treatment but have maintained factor IX activity without bleeding.  George reported that she is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging that this trial is a small study, with a short follow-up period as yet. However, as the researchers continue to monitor patients in the current trial, next steps will be to discuss with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the outlines of a larger, phase 3 clinical trial. No gene therapies for any genetic diseases have yet been approved for clinical use in the U.S. Formerly a research leader at CHOP, High pursued groundbreaking preclinical investigations in hemophilia B gene therapy and provided scientific expertise to previous gene therapy trials in hemophilia and other genetic disorders at CHOP before moving to Spark Therapeutics, which was spun off from CHOP in 2013.

A study conducted by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center revealed pre-leukemic mutations, called clonal hematopoiesis, may predict whether patients develop t-MNs. Clonal hematopoiesis appears to function as a biomarker for patients who develop t-MNs, a leukemia recognized for its extremely poor prognosis. The study findings were published today in The Lancet Oncology and presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego.  Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms occur in about 5 percent of cancer patients who were treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy,  said Andy Futreal, Ph.D., chair ad interim of Genomic Medicine.  In most cases, it is fatal, and currently there is no way to predict who is at risk or prevent it.  Being able to detect t-MNs earlier is crucial given that the disease usually occurs three to eight years following chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.  T-MNs are a problem that needs urgent attention,  said Koichi Takahashi, M.D., assistant professor of Leukemia and Genomic Medicine and a co-author on the Lancet Oncology paper.  Since many cancer patients are now living longer, t-MNs are an increasing concern for many cancer survivors.  Futreal s team studied 14 patients with t-MNs and found traces of pre-leukemic mutations or clonal hematopoiesis in 10. To determine if pre-leukemic mutations could reliably predict whether the patients would develop leukemia, the researchers compared prevalence of pre-leukemic mutations in the 14 patients with 54 patients who did not develop t-MNs after therapy.  We found that prevalence of pre-leukemic mutations was significantly higher in patients who developed t-MNs (71 percent) versus those who did not (26 percent),  said Futreal.  We also validated these findings in a separate cohort of patients. Based on these findings, we believe pre-leukemic mutations may function as a new biomarker that would predict t-MNs development.  In the sample of 14 patients with t-MNs, the team looked at samples of bone marrow at the time of t-MNs development and blood samples obtained at the time of their primary cancer diagnosis.  We found genetic mutations that are present in t-MNs leukemia samples actually could be found in blood samples obtained at the time of their original cancer diagnosis,  said Takahashi.  Based on this finding, we believe the data suggest potential approaches of screening for clonal hematopoiesis in cancer patients that may identify patients at risk of developing t-MNs, although further studies are needed.

The organoids, clusters of thousands of human brain cells, cannot perform a brain s basic functions, much less generate thought. But they provide a far more authentic model   the first of its kind   for studying how brain tumours grow, and how they can be stopped.  This puts the tumour within the context of a brain, instead of a flat plastic dish,  said Christian Naus, a professor in the department of cellular and physiological sciences, who conceived the project with a Japanese company that specializes in bioprinting. He shared details about the technique at November s annual Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego.  When cells grow in three dimensions instead of two, adhering only to each other and not to plastic, an entirely different set of genes are activated.  Naus studies glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive brain cancer that usually takes root deep inside the brain, and easily spreads. The standard care is surgery, followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy, but gliomas almost always return because a few malignant cells manage to leave the tumour and invade surrounding brain tissue. From the time of diagnosis, average survival is one year. The idea for creating a more authentic model of glioblastoma originated when Naus partnered with a Japanese biotechnology company, Cyfuse, that has developed a particular technique for printing human tissues based on the Japanese art of flower arranging known as ikebana. In ikebana, artists use a heavy plate with brass needles sticking up, upon which the stems of flowers are affixed. Cyfuse s bioprinting technique uses a much smaller plate covered with microneedles. Working with Naus and research associate Wun Chey Sin, Kaori Harada of Cyfuse skewered small spheres of human neural stem cells on the microneedles. As the stem cells multiplied and differentiated into brain tissue, they merged and formed larger structures known as organoids, about two millimetres to three millimetres in diameter. Although the organoids lack blood vessels, they are small enough to allow oxygen and nutrients to permeate the tissue.  The cells make their own environment,  said Naus, Canada Research Chair in Gap Junctions and Neurological Disorders.  We re not doing anything except printing them, and then they self-assemble.  The team then implanted cancerous glioma cells inside the organoids. Naus found that the gliomas spread into the surrounding normal cells. Having shown that the tumour invades the surrounding tissue, Naus envisions that such a technique can be used with a patient s own cells   both their normal brain cells and their cancerous cells   to grow a personalized organoid with a glioma at its core, and then test a variety of possible drugs or combinations of treatment to see if any of them stop the cancer from growing and invading.  With this method, we can easily and authentically replicate a model of the patient s brain, or at least some of the conditions under which a tumour grows in that brain,  said Naus.  Then we could feasibly test hundreds of different chemical combinations on that patient s cells to identify a drug combination that shows the most promising result, offering a personalized therapy for brain cancer patients.

The initiative seeks to develop clinically relevant tests. Details of the project and initial characterization and preliminary analyses of newly diagnosed myeloma patient data were presented today by Brian Walker, Ph.D., of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at the 58th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in San Diego, Calif.  ""The Myeloma Genome Project is a really exciting initiative that may change the way we manage myeloma patients,"" said Gareth Morgan, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Myeloma Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.  Current technologies have discovered five major translocation groups within myeloma patients and these mutations have demonstrated varying effects on prognosis. The Myeloma Genome Project is also looking at minor translocation and mutational groups that are often poorly described due to small sample numbers in limited data sets. The group has established a set of 2,161 patients for which whole exome sequencing (WES; n=1,436), whole genome sequencing (WGS; n=708), targeted panel sequencing (n=993) and expression data from RNA-sequencing and gene expression arrays (n=1,497) were available. The data were collected from the Myeloma XI trial (UK), Intergroupe Francophone du Myeloma/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Myeloma Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.  ""Understanding the various subgroups within multiple myeloma that exhibit distinct pathogenesis and clinical behavior is critical when looking to advance new therapies, particularly when considering a targeted approach,"" said Rob Hershberg, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Celgene. ""We look forward to the insights that this collaboration will provide for research and for patients.""  ""The Myeloma Genome Project expects to lead the way towards developing personalized and targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes in myeloma,"" said Nikhil Munshi, M.D., Director of Basic and Correlative Science at the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.  The Myeloma Genome Project has begun to integrate these diverse, large genomic data sets and is identifying genetic information that may inform clinical targets for therapy. While analyses are not completed, the current efforts clearly demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and the project leaders plan to expand collaboration to include additional investigators and institutions and present updates at future medical and scientific meetings including publications in peer-reviewed journals.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-links-to-brain-cancer-cell-growth-195772,Genetic Links to Brain Cancer Cell Growth Researchers discover clues to tumour behaviour from genetic differences between brain cancer cells and normal tissue cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Two recently discovered genetic differences between brain cancer cells and normal tissue cells -- an altered gene and a snippet of noncoding genetic material -- could offer clues to tumor behavior and potential new targets for therapy, Johns Hopkins scientists report. In a report on one of the two findings, published online Sept. 20 in Acta Neuropathologica, the investigators identified alterations in a protein known as ATRX in human brain tumors that arise as part of a genetically inherited condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The disorder, marked initially by benign tumors on nerves, often leads to brain cancer, and although most NF1-related malignancies are nonaggressive, a fraction are ""high-grade"" and difficult to treat, experts say. Study leader Fausto J. Rodriguez, M.D., associate professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, says the new study sought to sort out what makes the more aggressive NF1-related tumors genetically different from low grade tumors and normal, healthy cells. Research from other scientists at Johns Hopkins, he says, had suggested that some tumors, particularly those that affect the nervous system, have mutations in the ATRX gene, which produces proteins that appear to maintain the length of telomeres, repetitive segments of DNA on the ends of chromosomes that typically shorten each time a cell divides. Telomere shortening limits the number of divisions that cells can undergo. By keeping telomeres long, ATRX mutations give cells the ability to endlessly divide, a hallmark of cancer. To see what role ATRX mutations might play in NF1-related brain cancers, Rodriguez and his colleagues examined samples of both high- and low-grade gliomas -- tumors that arise from parent cells of nerve-supporting cells called glia -- which were removed by surgery from 27 patients with NF1. They tested the samples for longer telomeres that weren't the product of a protein called telomerase, which helps maintain telomere length in healthy cells and more commonly in other cancers. This nontelomerase-associated telomere lengthening is known as alternative lengthening of telomeres or ALT. They also tested for loss of the protein product of ATRX caused by mutations in this gene. About a third of the 27 samples had ALT and loss of the ATRX protein. The presence of both factors occurred in seven of 12 patients with high-grade tumors but only two of 14 with low-grade cancers. If further studies confirm the role of the mutation, Rodriguez says, researchers might be able to develop anticancer agents to target cells with ATRX mutations or ALT to limit telomere length. In the meantime, he adds, gaining a better understanding of aggressive NF1-related tumors allows researchers to develop more realistic models of these cancers in the lab. In a second study, described online Oct. 14 in Modern Pathology, the Johns Hopkins investigators sought a genetic source that could accurately identify subsets of low-grade pediatric gliomas, the most frequent tumors of the central nervous system in children. Unlike many other types of cancerous tumors, low-grade pediatric gliomas appear to have few genetic mutations, leaving the biology of these cancers a mystery, says Rodriguez. In an effort to unravel that mystery, Rodriguez and his colleagues focused on the ways those cancer cells regulate the expression of genes or whether they make their constituent proteins. One way to control expression, he explains, is through microRNA, small pieces of noncoding genetic material that control whether a gene's protein is generated from the DNA blueprints inside cell nuclei. The researchers analyzed the amounts of 800 different microRNAs in nine different types of low-grade gliomas or related cancers. Of all of these, one in particular caught the researchers' eyes: a microRNA called miR-487b, which was consistently underexpressed in tumor tissue compared to healthy cells. To pin down the role of this microRNA, the researchers artificially increased its levels in lines of laboratory-grown human cancer cells that appeared to make too little of it, in turn bringing down the levels of the protein it affects. Unlike unaltered cancer cells, these new cells formed 30 percent fewer colonies and had decreased levels of other proteins, such as Nestin, by a third. Nestin is known to be important in both early development and in cancers. Eventually, Rodriguez says, physicians might be able to look at the levels of this and other microRNAs in blood or cerebrospinal fluid to test for the presence of cancer. Researchers might also be able to target microRNAs directly, altering their levels to make cancer cells less likely to form tumors. ""By gaining a better understanding of the fine genetic differences between cancers and healthy tissues, we can develop better therapeutic or prognostic strategies,"" he says.

Yet thousands of studies worldwide have produced mixed signals on whether this storage capacity will actually decrease   or even increase   as the planet warms. It turns out scientists might have been looking in the wrong places. A new Yale-led study in the journal Nature finds that warming will drive the loss of at least 55 trillion kilograms of carbon from the soil by mid-century, or about 17% more than the projected emissions due to human-related activities during that period. That would be roughly the equivalent of adding to the planet another industrialized country the size of the United States. Critically, the researchers found that carbon losses will be greatest in the world s colder places, at high latitudes, locations that had largely been missing from previous research. In those regions, massive stocks of carbon have built up over thousands of years and slow microbial activity has kept them relatively secure. Most of the previous research had been conducted in the world s temperate regions, where there were smaller carbon stocks. Studies that focused only on these regions would have missed the vast proportion of potential carbon losses, said lead author Thomas Crowther, who conducted his research while a postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology.  Carbon stores are greatest in places like the Arctic and the sub-Arctic, where the soil is cold and often frozen,  Crowther said.  In those conditions microbes are less active and so carbon has been allowed to build up over many centuries.  But as you start to warm, the activities of those microbes increase, and that s when the losses start to happen,  Crowther said.  The scary thing is, these cold regions are the places that are expected to warm the most under climate change.  The results are based on an analysis of raw data on stored soil carbon from dozens of studies conducted over the past 20 years in different regions of the world. The study predicts that for one degree of warming, about 30 petagrams of soil carbon will be released into the atmosphere, or about twice as much as is emitted annually due to human-related activities (A petagram is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 kilograms). This is particularly concerning, Crowther said, because previous climate studies predicted that the planet is likely to warm by 2 degrees Celsius by mid-century. Other scientists on the team include Mark Bradford, professor of terrestrial ecosystem ecology at Yale; Clara Rowe, who earned a Master of Environmental Management degree at Yale in 2015; and Yale doctoral candidate Noah Sokol, as well as collaborating researchers from more than 30 other institutions. For Bradford, the analysis provides important clarity on the question of why soil-warming studies appear to provide contradictory evidence, with some showing losses of soil carbon and some showing no change.  The effects are strongly dependent on where you look,  Bradford said.  Now that we know this, we can begin to develop more confidence in the idea that this biological feedback is real, and hence likely to accelerate human-induced climate change.  The study considered only soil carbon losses in response to warming. There are several other biological processes   such as accelerated plant growth as a result of carbon dioxide increases   that could dampen or enhance the effect of this soil carbon feedback. Understanding these interacting processes at a global scale is critical to understanding climate change, the researchers said.  Getting a handle on these kinds of feedbacks is essential if we re going to make meaningful projections about future climate conditions,  said Crowther, who is now completing a Marie Curie Fellowship at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology.  Only then can we generate realistic greenhouse gas emission targets that are effective at limiting climate change.  Source: Story from Yale University. Original piece written by Kevin Dennehy.

One of those microproteins, called NoBody, is a molecular workhorse involved in sweeping out unneeded genetic material inside cells. Its discovery may signal the existence of additional microproteins involved in a host of key biological mechanisms and diseases, the researchers said.  The broadest significance of this work is that even in a well-studied biological process, a microprotein has been right there under our noses, undetected, all this time,  said Sarah Slavoff, co-senior author of a study published Dec. 5 in the journal Nature Chemical Biology. Slavoff is an assistant professor of chemistry and of molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale. She is a member of the Chemical Biology Institute at Yale s West Campus. The study s first author is Nadia D Lima, a researcher in Slavoff s lab. Alan Saghatelian of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies is the study s other co-senior author.  Despite how much we know about the human genome, there are still blind spots in the genome discovery algorithms,  Saghatelian said.  You can sequence the whole human genome and never know a protein, like this one, was there because it s too short and falls below the usual length requirement for gene assignment algorithms.  In previous work, the researchers began their search for microproteins by examining myeloid leukemia cells and removing the larger proteins. They used an analytical chemistry technique, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy proteomics, to find the amino acid sequences of every remaining protein. Next, the researchers developed a computational method to build a database of all possible microproteins in the sample. From this database, Slavoff and her colleagues found more than 400 new microproteins. The study focused on a microprotein called NoBody, which stands for non-annotated P-body dissociating polypeptide. The researchers found that NoBody is a key ingredient in cells for recycling mRNA   genetic blueprints for producing proteins   after those proteins have been created. Slavoff said the finding hints that microproteins may play important roles in many biological processes, as well as disease. There are many neurological diseases, for example, that feature groupings of proteins. Source: Story from Yale University. Original piece written by Jim Shelton.

The findings also suggest new possibilities for the treatment of children with language deficits and autism. See Also: The brain watched during language learningDrawing on theories of statistical learning, IU researcher Linda Smith and colleagues found that the number of times an object enters an infant's field of vision ""tips the scales"" in favor of associating certain words with certain objects. The research appears in the journal of the Royal Society Philosophical Transactions B in a special issue on statistical learning. ""We think that children's first words are predictable based on their visual experience with objects and the prevalence of those objects in their visual world,"" said Smith, a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and senior author on the study. ""Visual memory may be the initial key to getting words stuck on objects familiar visual objects like table, shirt, bottle or spoon,"" she added. ""It's an aggregated experience; those very first words may be learned slowly and incrementally for a few visually pervasive objects. This may be how infants begin to break into language before their first birthday."" The study's results could also help inform interventions for children with delayed speech and other language disorders. Learn More: First language wires brain for later language-learning""Difficulty learning words could stem from visual processing problems,"" Smith added. ""Children who are late talkers have slow or age-delayed visual processing skills for objects, for example. Children with autism have object-processing problems as well."" Although many researchers have studied infants' first words to understand learning, Smith said none have approached the question from the visual side. ""While studying language acquisition from the 'word side' may benefit those studying later stages of language learning at the ages of 18 months to 3 years it cannot account for how children break into language,"" she said. Under the new theory, which Smith and colleagues call the Pervasiveness Hypothesis, a few highly prevalent objects stand out to infants among the ""clutter"" of other less frequent objects to become their first words. To conduct their study, IU researchers looked at videos that showed the visual field of eight children five girls and three boys between 8 and 10 months old, the period before children engage in verbal interactions with parents and caregivers. The videos came from head-mounted cameras worn by the children an average of 4.4 hours. Caregivers were told the cameras would observe children's daily activities, not words or objects specifically. Caregivers could choose when to activate the camera. Don't Miss: Brain s hippocampus helps fill in the blanks of language For the purpose of the study, researchers observed mealtime scenes, defined as any eating by anyone at any time or location -- in cars, at playtime or in a high chair, for example. The recordings yielded 917,207 mealtime frames, with one image sampled every five seconds. Five objects were recorded for each frame: a total of 745 objects. Using an accepted method to index child vocabulary, the researchers then divided the named objects into ""first nouns,"" which are acquired by half of all 16-month-olds; ""early nouns,"" which are known by half of all 30-month-olds; and ""late nouns,"" which are acquired at later stages of learning. First nouns include words such as table, shirt, chair, bowl, cup, bottle, food, spoon and plate. The study's results revealed a strong correlation between the most frequently appearing objects and ""first nouns,"" with the top 15 of these words appearing in the images collected by the study. ""The comparison of first and early nouns was particularly striking, since both sets of object names are acquired quite early in childhood and refer to objects common in households with infants,"" said Elizabeth Clerkin, a PhD student in the IU Bloomington Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and first author on the study. ""That infants' visual environment during mealtime consistently involves a very small number of objects and the names of these high-frequency objects are among those normally learned first by infants suggests visual experience is doing the heavy lifting in very early word learning,"" she added. Whether children who experience speech disorders are not picking up visual regularities in the environment or simply live in households with fewer regularities, Smith said it's vital to explore the role of both words and vision in language learning.

But a new study led by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scientists provides further evidence that the brains of people with the disorder tend to have the same ""signature"" of abnormalities at the molecular level. See Also: New insights into the male bias of autism The scientists analyzed 251 brain tissue samples from nearly 100 deceased people 48 who had autism and 49 who didn't. Most of the samples from people with autism showed a distinctive pattern of unusual gene activity. The findings, published in Nature, confirm and extend the results of earlier, smaller studies, and provide a clearer picture of what goes awry, at the molecular level, in the brains of people with autism. ""This pattern of unusual gene activity suggests some possible targets for future autism drugs,"" said Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the paper's senior author and UCLA's Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics. ""In principle, we can use the abnormal patterns we've found to screen for drugs that reverse them and thereby hopefully treat this disorder."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, US), about 1.5 percent of children in the US have autism; the disorder is characterized by impaired social interactions and other cognitive and behavioral problems. In rare cases, the disorder has been tied to specific DNA mutations, maternal infections during pregnancy or exposures to certain chemicals in the womb. But in most cases, the causes are unknown. Learn More: Largest-ever autism genome study finds most siblings have different autism-risk genes In a much-cited study in Nature in 2011, Geschwind and colleagues found that key regions of the brain in people with different kinds of autism had the same broad pattern of abnormal gene activity. More specifically, researchers noticed that the brains of people with autism didn't have the ""normal"" pattern for which genes are active or inactive that they found in the brains of people without the disorder. What's more, the genes in brains with autism weren't randomly active or inactive in these key regions, but rather had their own consistent patterns from one brain to the next even when the causes of the autism appear to be very different. The discovery suggested that different genetic and environmental triggers of autism disorders mostly lead to disease via the same biological pathways in brain cells. In the new study, Geschwind and his team analyzed a larger number of brain tissue samples and found the same broad pattern of abnormal gene activity in areas of the brain that are affected by autism. ""Traditionally, few genetic studies of psychiatric diseases have been replicated, so being able to confirm those initial findings in a new set of patients is very important,"" said Geschwind, who also is a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""It strongly suggests that the pattern we found applies to most people with autism disorders."" Related: Diverse autism mutations lead to different disease outcomes The team also looked at other aspects of cell biology, including brain cells' production of molecules called long non-coding RNAs, which can suppress or enhance the activity of many genes at once. Again, the researchers found a distinctive abnormal pattern in the autism disorder samples. Further studies may determine which abnormalities are drivers of autism, and which are merely the brain's responses to the disease process. But the findings offer some intriguing leads about how the brains of people with autism develop during the first 10 years of their lives. One is that, in people with the disorder, genes that control the formation of synapses the ports through which neurons send signals to each other are abnormally quiet in key regions of the brain. During the same time frame, genes that promote the activity of microglial cells, the brain's principal immune cells, are abnormally busy. This could mean that the first decade of life could be a critical time for interventions to prevent autism. Read Next: Genetic basis for distinct type of autism uncovered The study also confirmed a previous finding that in the brains of people with autism, the patterns of gene activity in the frontal and temporal lobes are almost the same. In people who don't have autism, the two regions develop distinctly different patterns during childhood. The new study suggests that SOX5, a gene with a known role in early brain development, contributes to the failure of the two regions to diverge in people with autism.

The hippocampus is affected by many neurological conditions and diseases and it also can be compromised during normal aging. Future thinking is a cognitive ability that is relevant to all humans. It is needed to plan for what lies ahead, whether to navigate daily life or to make decisions for major milestones further in the future. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), BUSM researchers performed brain scans on healthy adults while they were imagining events. They then compared brain activity in the hippocampus when participants answered questions pertaining to the present or the future. After that, they compared brain activity when participants answered questions about the future that did or did not require imagining a scene. ""We observed no differences in hippocampal activity when we compared present versus future imaging, but we did observe stronger activity in the hippocampus when participants imagined a scene compared to when they did not, suggesting a role for the hippocampus in scene construction but not mental time travel,"" explained corresponding author Daniela Palombo, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the memory Disorders Research Center at BUSM and at the VA Boston Healthcare System. Learn More: Working memory: Underlying processes are more complex than we thought According to the researchers the importance of studying how the hippocampus contributes to cognitive abilities is bolstered by the ubiquity of hippocampal involvement in many conditions. ""These findings help provide better understanding of the role of the hippocampus in future thinking in the normal brain, and may eventually help us better understand the nature of cognitive loss in individuals with compromised hippocampal function,"" she added. Palombo believes that once knowledge about which aspects of future imagining are and are not dependent on the hippocampus, targeted rehabilitation strategies can be designed that exploit those functions that survive hippocampal dysfunction and may provide alternate routes to engage in future thinking.

The research shows that learning to grasp an object with the backs of the hands made participants more sensitive to motion near their hands, while learning a to pick up an object with their fingertips enhanced participants' perception of spatial detail near their hands. See Also: Study helps fill in gaps in our visual perception ""These results support the idea that vision is, in a sense, tuned for action,"" says psychological scientist Laura Thomas of North Dakota State University, author of the study. ""This evidence suggests that people experience flexible visual biases when viewing information within reach that may aid the actions they are prepared to take."" Previous studies have indicated that our visual biases the visual information we're attuned to at a given time may adapt to the immediate context. When participants in one study adopted a power-grasp posture, they showed greater sensitivity to motion-related information that would allow them to make a quick and forceful grab. When the participants adopted a precision-grasp posture, they were more sensitive to detailed spatial information that would help them manipulate something small. These findings suggest that the visual system prioritizes processing information that is relevant to the actions we are likely to take, allowing us to be more effective power or precision graspers, depending on the situation. Thomas wondered whether a short-term training experience might be sufficient to induce these action-oriented visual biases. To find out, she conducted two experiments in which participants learned to use their hands in new ways to pick up objects. Learn More: Study details brain pathways linking visual function, running In the first experiment, 60 student participants completed two visual perception tasks, as their hands either rested on the display or in their laps. In one task, they saw a group of moving dots some of which moved in the same direction and had to indicate the direction in which the dots appeared to be moving. In the other task, they saw another group of stationary dots some of which were arranged in a particular spatial pattern and had to say whether the dots appeared in a radial or concentric spatial pattern. The participants then practiced a new type of power grasp, using the backs of their hands to pick up and move a plunger. After this training, the participants completed the two visual perception tasks again. Don't Miss: Declining intelligence in old age linked to visual processing In the second experiment, another group of 60 student participants followed the same procedure this time, they learned a new type of precision grasp, using the tips of their little fingers to pick up and move one bean. The results of the two experiments showed that potential action seemed to drive the way the participants processed visual information, but only when that information was near their hands. Participants were better at identifying the direction in which the dots were shifting after learning the back-of-the-hands power grasp, but only when their hands were near the display. And they were more accurate in identifying the spatial pattern of dots after learning the finger-tips precision grasp again, only when their hands were near the display. Together, these findings suggest that our visual system flexibly adapts to recent experiences, allowing us to take action in effective and appropriate ways. Thomas is planning further research to examine this phenomenon, investigating whether the kinds of visual biases she has observed in lab-based tasks also emerge when people look at and interact with everyday objects.

The announcement, made at the Oxford Nanopore Community Meeting in New York City, marks a major breakthrough in sequencing technology in opening up the potential of wide-scale whole-genome sequencing in humans using nanopore approaches. The announcement raises the possibility of a major change to both the economics and the science of DNA sequencing.  Researchers at the WTCHG and Genomics plc used the MinION sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The portable MinION is a hand-held device about the size of a Mars bar, and is powered by a laptop computer to which it connects via a USB port.  It is available for $1,000 plus the cost of consumables.  While nanopore sequencing has been available for two years, it has previously only been practicable to apply it to relatively small genomes or regions of DNA, such as the much smaller genomes of viruses and bacteria.  Recent upgrades to the technology have now made it possible for researchers to conduct larger-scale studies such as sequencing complete human genomes by using multiple MinIONs.  A key strength of nanopore sequencing is that reads can be much longer than is possible with other scalable sequencing technologies.  Longer reads offer significant advantages in human genome sequencing, enabling researchers to obtain good sequence data from certain biologically important regions of the genome which are difficult to study using existing sequencing technologies.  The long reads also appear to make it easier to detect large structural changes in individual genomes. The WTCHG and Genomics team sequenced a standard human reference sample, NA12878. In addition, in collaboration with the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, they sequenced the DNA from a clinical patient.   Dr Rory Bowden, Deputy Head of High-Throughput Genomics at the WTCHG, and one of the leaders of the project, said:  It is a significant breakthrough to sequence multiple human genomes with nanopore technology.  Moving forward, the idea that there will be alternative technologies with new properties in this space will be very appealing to researchers and to clinical geneticists.  Professor Michael Simpson, Co-Head of Science at Genomics plc, another project leader, said:  It is particularly encouraging to show that nanopore sequencing works for routine clinical samples, where the amount and quality of DNA available for sequencing may be constrained.  Further, in the clinical sample, the long reads provided by nanopore technology were critical in confirming the genetic changes responsible for the patient s condition.  Professor Peter Donnelly, Director of the WTCHG and a Founder and Director of Genomics plc, said:  The WTCHG were one of the pioneers of whole-genome sequencing in clinical medicine.  We are delighted to be able to work with nanopore technology to sequence and analyse a reference and a clinical human genome, and to explore the potential for large-scale human sequencing using nanopore approaches.

In the pages of the journal Science, a team from the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) has shown that tissue damage is a relevant factor for cells to go back to an embryonic state.  Cell reprogramming earned its discoverer, Shinya Yamanaka, the Nobel Prize and opened the door to regenerative medicine. This technique, based on introducing a combination of four genes known as OSKM (for the initials of the genes, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC), reverts adult cells to an embryonic-like state, and transforms them into pluripotent cells. However, there are several limitations to this process, such as a very low efficiency and the emergence of a particular type of tumour (known as teratoma), which make cell reprogramming incompatible with its potential clinical use. Manuel Serrano and the Tumour Suppression Group at the CNIO have been working in this field for years. Their innovative approach led them to achieve cell reprogramming within a living organism (in this case, a mouse) in 2013, whereas, until then, reprogramming had been only reported using explanted cells out of the organism.  Understanding reprogramming to improve regeneration The work now published in Science by Serrano and his team analyses what happens in living tissues when reprogramming is induced using OSKM. What they have seen changes the idea that we had to date about this technique. ""The Yamanaka genes are inefficient inducing reprogramming or pluripotency in the highly specialised cells that constitute adult tissues,  explains Lluc Mosteiro, who has carried out most of the experimental work. Her observations indicate that tissue damage plays a critical role by complementing the activity of the OSKM genes. This relationship between damage and reprogramming is mediated by a proinflammatory molecule, interleukin-6 (IL6). Without its presence, the OSKM genes are far less efficient inducing the reprogramming process. These findings suggest the following sequence of events: the expression of the OSKM genes results in damage to the cells; accordingly, they secrete IL6; the presence of this molecule induces the reprogramming of some neighbouring cells. Having identified the essential role of IL6, Serrano, Mosteiro and the rest of the team are now working on various pharmacological approaches to enhance the reprogramming efficiency, which could help to improve the regeneration of damaged tissue even in the absence of the Yamanaka genes. Improving the repairing capacity of tissues could have obvious implications for regenerative medicine, including the treatment of multiple pathologies and degenerative processes associated with ageing.

In experiments, the strengthening effects of this bacterium on the intestinal barrier remained even after pasteurisation. This is the conclusion drawn by researchers of the Louvain Drug Research Institute of the University of Leuven in collaboration with researchers of the Wageningen University & Research and the University of Helsinki in Nature Medicine on 28 November. Their results help to pave the way for treatments against diabetes and obesity, but also against cardiovascular diseases and gastroenteritis.  In experiments with obese mice, the Leuven research groups led by Patrice Cani and the Wageningen and Helsinki groups led by Willem M. De Vos were able to stop the progression of obesity and diabetes type 2 in mice. To this end, the mice were given a special treatment with the intestinal bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila discovered in Wageningen.  The Leuven group established that the living form of Akkermansia reduces the effects of obesity and diabetes. Jointly the teams were able to establish that even after pasteurisation   heating above 70 degrees Celsius   Akkermansia still stopped the diseases  progress in mice. Pasteurisation was performed in an attempt to make the bacterium inactive, but without destroying it or its characteristics. However, in its inactive state the bacterium continued to effectively combat the diseases.  This came as a complete surprise,  says Willem de Vos.  Even more surprising was the fact that the bacterium was partially more active after pasteurisation: not only reducing obesity and diabetes, but preventing these diseases from developing in the first place.  Obesity and diabetes Akkermansia s effectiveness derives primarily from its inhibiting effect on intestinal inflammation, such as colitis or chronic irritable bowel syndrome. The intestinal bacterium is currently being tested in Brussels on its applicability for patients suffering from obesity and diabetes. The results are still expected, but the first clinical trial on the safety of administering the intestinal bacterium in inactivated form is positive.  The team discovered that the unexpected effect of the pasteurised Akkermansia bacterium is due to a protein in the external membrane of the bacterium, which was investigated in the Wageningen team by Dr Noora Ottman and Dr Clara Belzer. This protein   Amuc_1100*   remained functional after heating. Pasteurisation did inactivate the bacterium as a whole, but not the functional membrane protein that turns out to be responsible for the beneficial effect in mice. Isolating this protein makes it possible to develop a drug in concentrated form that could also be used in therapies against intestinal inflammation as a result of stress, alcoholism, liver disease and cancer.

The birds on this farm, at three other locations belonging to the same concern in Hierden and one location in Ermelo, were humanely destroyed as a preventive measure. Some 180,000 ducks were culled.  In addition, birds at another farm with 10,000 ducks were destroyed because they were within a one-kilometre radius of the affected farm in Biddinghuizen. A follow-up examination on Saturday showed that the virus is the highly contagious and pathogenic H5N8 virus. Three other farms are located within a three-kilometre radius of the affected farm in Biddinghuizen. Samples have been taken for examination.  Commercial poultry farms throughout Europe are currently being hit by bird flu. Unfortunately, a ban on keeping poultry outdoors combined with tighter biosecurity measures have not been enough to prevent the virus from spreading to poultry farms in the Netherlands.  Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR, previously known as Central Veterinary Institute, CVI) in Lelystad is the designated institute for diagnosing Avian Influenza or classic bird flu. The institute carries out laboratory tests to check for the virus and conducts diagnostic tests on poultry samples from farms where bird flu is suspected and on dead wild waterfowl. The aim is to identify the disease as soon as possible before carrying out extra controls on poultry in the immediate vicinity. Source: Story from Wageningen University.

Rice bioscientist Daniel Carson and alumna Micaela Morgado researched thiazolidinediones, small molecules used to fight diabetes, that can halt the expression of glycoproteins that make up the protective mucus that lines cells and organs in the body. These mucus cells are manipulated by tumors to keep them safe from chemotherapy and the immune system. But there are problems to be solved before the drug can be used to fight cancer, Carson said, including the fact that small doses appropriate for diabetes treatment actually increase cancer risk for patients with diabetes. The drug they studied, rosiglitazone, shows promise only if it can be delivered in large-enough doses and directly to tumors, he said. The work will appear in the January issue of the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry.  My lab is interested in the class of very high-molecular-weight glycoproteins that absorb water and cover and protect the surfaces of your cells,  Carson said.  These mucins perform a very important protective function, lining your mouth, your glandular structures and your gastrointestinal tract, essentially acting like Teflon for those surfaces.  But tumors have learned a trick,  he said.  Instead of keeping mucins on one end of a cell, where they would normally protect it from the external environment, they start putting mucins all over their surfaces. Cells of the immune system that kill tumors have to make contact with the cancer cell s surface, but when they have these big barrier molecules on the surface, they re protected.  If we can intervene in patients and reduce mucin levels, maybe the host immune system can do its job and kill the tumors,  Carson said. The lab studied the effects of one thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone, on a glycoprotein known as MUC16 that protects breast and ovarian cancer cells. Another, pioglitazone, was the focus of a recent Rice breast cancer study, and Carson s lab previously studied the effects of rosiglitazone on another glycoprotein, MUC1.  MUC16 wound up being particularly interesting because it s also known as CA125, which is the gold standard marker for ovarian cancer,  he said.  Women are routinely monitored for CA125 levels that normally are found at very low levels in serum. If you have certain tumors, these cancer cells begin to release fragments of CA125.  Carson said doses of rosiglitazone fed to cancer cell lines in the lab shut down the production of glycoproteins by interfering with the actions of cytokines that trigger the cells  protective response and elevate MUC16 production.  It turns out the tumor microenvironment is rich in these cytokines,  he said.  You would think these pro-inflammatory mediators would be a good thing because they enhance the immune response to the tumor. But, in fact, they also enhance the tumor s protective response.  He said stopping production of MUC16 for even a couple of days might be enough to breach the protective shield and allow immune cells to begin the destruction of a tumor.  If you could shut down synthesis by 90 percent or more, which is achievable with these drugs, within two days you have enough reduction to remove the tumor s protective coating.  There s nothing here we can take to a clinic yet,  Carson said.  We learned about ways to intervene and reduce the expression, but we either need better drugs that can do it at much lower, pharmacologically achievable levels, or we need to have a way to target drugs so we can get tumor-specific, superphysiological concentrations that would achieve the goal.  The upside is that these drugs are already FDA approved,  he said.  If we can repurpose them, we don t have to go through the same duration of regulatory process required to use them for cancer therapy.  Source: Story from Rice University.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/parkinsons-disease-linked-to-microbiome-204792,Parkinson s Disease Linked to Microbiome Scientists have discovered a link between intestinal bacteria and Parkinson sdisease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Caltech scientists have discovered for the first time a functional link between bacteria in the intestines and Parkinson's disease (PD). The researchers show that changes in the composition of gut bacterial populations or possibly gut bacteria themselves are actively contributing to and may even cause the deterioration of motor skills that is the hallmark of this disease. The work which has profound implications for the treatment of PD was performed in the laboratory of Sarkis Mazmanian, the Luis B. and Nelly Soux Professor of Microbiology and Heritage Medical Research Institute Investigator, and appears in the December 1 issue of Cell. PD affects 1 million people in the US and up to 10 million worldwide, making it the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Characteristic features of PD include symptoms such as tremors and difficulty walking, aggregation of a protein called alpha-synuclein ( Syn) within cells in the brain and gut, and the presence of inflammatory molecules called cytokines within the brain. In addition, 75 percent of people with PD have gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities, primarily constipation. ""The gut is a permanent home to a diverse community of beneficial and sometimes harmful bacteria, known as the microbiome, that is important for the development and function of the immune and nervous systems,"" Mazmanian says. ""Remarkably, 70 percent of all neurons in the peripheral nervous system that is, not the brain or spinal cord are in the intestines, and the gut's nervous system is directly connected to the central nervous system through the vagus nerve. Because GI problems often precede the motor symptoms by many years, and because most PD cases are caused by environmental factors, we hypothesized that bacteria in the gut may contribute to PD."" To test this, the researchers utilized mice that overproduce  Syn and display symptoms of Parkinson's. One group of mice had a complex consortium of gut bacteria; the others, called germ-free mice, were bred in a completely sterile environment at Caltech and thus lacked gut bacteria. The researchers had both groups of mice perform several tasks to measure their motor skills, such as running on treadmills, crossing a beam, and descending from a pole. The germ-free mice performed significantly better than the mice with a complete microbiome. ""This was the 'eureka' moment,"" says Timothy Sampson, a postdoctoral scholar in biology and biological engineering and first author on the paper. ""The mice were genetically identical; both groups were making too much  Syn. The only difference was the presence or absence of gut microbiota. Once you remove the microbiome, the mice have normal motor skills even with the overproduction of  Syn."" ""All three of the hallmark traits of Parkinson's were gone in the germ-free models,"" Sampson says. ""Now we were quite confident that gut bacteria regulate, and are even required for, the symptoms of PD. So, we wanted to know how this happens."" When gut bacteria break down dietary fiber, they produce molecules called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate and butyrate. Previous research has shown that these molecules also can activate immune responses in the brain. Thus, Mazmanian's group hypothesized that an imbalance in the levels of SCFAs regulates brain inflammation and other symptoms of PD. Indeed, when germ-free mice were fed SCFAs, cells called microglia which are immune cells residing in the brain became activated. Such inflammatory processes can cause neurons to malfunction or even die. In fact, germ-free mice fed SCFAs now showed motor disabilities and  Syn aggregation in regions of the brain linked to PD. In a final set of experiments, Mazmanian and his group collaborated with Ali Keshavarzian, a gastroenterologist at Rush University in Chicago, to obtain fecal samples from patients with PD and from healthy controls. The human microbiome samples were transplanted into germ-free mice, which then remarkably began to exhibit symptoms of PD. These mice also showed higher levels of SCFAs in their feces. Transplanted fecal samples from healthy individuals, in contrast, did not trigger PD symptoms, unlike mice harboring gut bacteria from PD patients. ""This really closed the loop for us,"" Mazmanian says. ""The data suggest that changes to the gut microbiome are likely more than just a consequence of PD. It's a provocative finding that needs to be further studied, but the fact that you can transplant the microbiome from humans to mice and transfer symptoms suggests that bacteria are a major contributor to disease."" The findings have important implications for the treatment of Parkinson's, the researchers say. ""For many neurological conditions, the conventional treatment approach is to get a drug into the brain. However, if PD is indeed not solely caused by changes in the brain but instead by changes in the microbiome, then you may just have to get drugs into the gut to help patients, which is much easier to do,"" Mazmanian says. Such drugs could be designed to modulate SCFA levels, deliver beneficial probiotics, or remove harmful organisms. ""This new concept may lead to safer therapies with fewer side effects compared to current treatments."" Source: Story from California Institute of Technology. Original piece written by Lori Dajose.

The switch, they say, is composed of regulatory proteins that control an immune signaling pathway in cells.  Asthma patients are constantly firing through this pathway because those proteins are stuck in the  on  position, without proper control by other proteins that shut down this reaction,  says Nicola Heller, Ph.D., assistant professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Asthma has been correlated with an overabundance of one type of immune cell called M2 macrophages in the lungs. In a nonasthmatic person, the M2 macrophages activate to clean up inhaled allergens and foreign particles, and then deactivate when the irritant is broken down. However, in people with asthma, the M2 cells and the chemical signals they emit linger and call in other cells that cause inflammation that can trigger an asthma attack with the classic symptoms of difficulty breathing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Over time, the lung is changed by secretions from the M2 cells, which cause the lung tissue to remodel itself, contributing to irreversible obstruction and poor lung function.  If you prevent these cells from becoming the M2 type, you can potentially stop the continued inflammation and long-term structural changes,  says Heller.  The new research, reported Nov. 25 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, investigated the role of two proteins, GRB10 and p70S6K, in the control of the signaling pathway that activates M2 cells. In their previous work, also published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry Sept. 23, Heller s group found that the inflammatory pathway involving the two proteins begins with interleukin 4 (IL-4), an immune system chemical that passes through a protein named IRS-2 before activating the M2 cells. They found that other proteins that stop the action of IRS-2 were not present in human M2 cells from people with allergies compared to healthy people. This made IRS-2 more active and increased the formation of M2 cells in people with allergies. In the new study, Heller s lab delved deeper into the IRS-2 pathway. By analyzing chemical changes of the IRS-2 protein in immortalized cultures of human white blood cells, it determined that IRS-2 appeared in two different forms    on,  which allows the signal to pass through, and  off,  which stops the signal from activating the cells into M2 macrophages. They began by observing which proteins became active in the presence of IL-4 in human white blood cells and add  stop  signals to IRS-2. The activity of two regulatory proteins, GRB10 and p70S6K, increased after IL-4 exposure compared to the same cells that were not exposed to IL-4. In further test tube experiments, the researchers treated the immortalized white blood cells with both chemical and genetic blockers, called small interfering RNA (siRNA), designed to render either p70S6K or GRB10 nonfunctional. The researchers saw that decreased GRB10 and p70S6K activity resulted in more of the  on  form of IRS-2, meaning these proteins are responsible for turning off IRS-2 and thereby downstream M2 production.  This confirmed for us that without properly functioning GRB10 and p70S6K, the cells could not turn off IRS-2 signaling and M2 production,  says Heller. The research team, Heller says, has already begun experiments to further explore the implications of these results, which include looking at differences in this pathway between cells taken from allergic and healthy individuals, and testing the efficacy of an inhalable drug that mimics the function of GRB1 and p70S6K to shut off the development of M2 macrophages in the lungs of mice.  One of the advantages of working with lung macrophages is that they are one of the first cells that see anything that gets put in an inhaler,  says Heller.  So we hope to modulate their activity in this way.  Source: Story from Johns Hopkins Medicine.

A challenge to the food-service industry is that these positions have high turnover, relatively low wages and servers are focused primarily on providing patrons with a positive experience. And new research shows that this poses a problem. A recent study finds restaurants don t do an effective job of communicating with customers when it comes to addressing risks associated with eating undercooked meat   specifically hamburgers. Inaccurate information provided by servers often contradicts science-based information customers need to make informed food safety decisions. All 50 states in the U.S. have adopted some version of the Food & Drug Administration s Model Food Code, which requires restaurants to tell customers about risks associated with undercooked meat and poultry products.  We wanted to know how well restaurant servers and menus communicated with customers about these risks, specifically in the context of beef hamburgers,  says Ben Chapman, co-author of a study on the work and an associate professor at North Carolina State University whose research program is aimed at improving food safety. The researchers focused on beef hamburgers because consuming undercooked ground beef has been linked to a lot of foodborne illness outbreaks, including outbreaks related primarily to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. For this study, the researchers sent trained  secret shoppers  into 265 full-service, sit-down restaurants in seven different regions around the U.S. At each restaurant, the patrons ordered one well-done hamburger and one medium-rare hamburger to go. The shoppers then recorded how, if at all, the restaurant communicated about risk. This study is the latest in a long line of real-world research that Chapman and his collaborators have conducted.  We try to actually match what people do versus what they say they do because people will say anything on a survey,  Chapman says.  We ve looked at cooking shows; observed handwashing and cross-contamination in commercial kitchens; examined hand hygiene during a norovirus outbreaks and others. What people actually do is the difference between an enjoyable meal and a foodborne illness.  For example,  Chapman says,  did the server mention risks associated with undercooked meat when the shopper ordered? If not, the shopper would ask about the risk of getting sick, and then record whether the wait staff responded with clear, accurate information.  The shoppers also looked to see whether restaurants included clear, accurate risk information on their menus. The study found that 25 percent of restaurants wouldn t even sell an undercooked hamburger to secret shoppers. However, at restaurants that would sell a medium-rare hamburger, the majority of servers   77 percent   gave customers unreliable information about food safety.  Servers said that meat was safe because it was cooked until  until the juices ran clear    which is totally unreliable,  says Ellen Thomas, a food safety scientist at RTI International and lead author of the study who worked on the project while a Ph.D. student at NC State.  Those 77 percent didn t mention things like cooking meat to the appropriate temperature   either 155 F for 15 seconds, or 160 F for instant kill.  The indicator of safety most widely reported by servers was the color of the burger, and that s also not a reliable indicator at all,  Thomas says  Time and temperature are all that matter. An undercooked, unsafe burger can be brown in the middle, and a safely cooked burger can still be red or pink in the center.  Meanwhile, almost all of the menus complied with FDA guidance. But what servers told customers often contradicted the information on the menu.  If a menu says something is risky but a server says that it isn t, that can downplay the risks for consumers and impact a customer s decisions,  Chapman says.  It s confusing, leaving the patron to choose which message to believe  The researchers also found that chain restaurants fared much better than independent restaurants at having servers offer reliable risk information.  That s not surprising,  Chapman says.  Large chains implement standardized training across all outlets for servers in order to protect their brand and reduce the likelihood of being implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak. That s bad for business.  This study tells us that servers aren t good risk communicators,  Chapman says.  We encourage consumers to ask food-safety questions, but they should probably ask a manager.  It also tells us that we need to work on addressing the widespread   and wrong   belief that color is a reliable indicator of food safety in meat,  Chapman adds.  Restaurants are in a position to help us share this information with consumers, but many servers are currently sharing incorrect information.  Source: Story from North Carolina State University.

This model can be used to improve and accelerate the production of biotherapeutics, cancer drugs, and vaccines. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) produce more than half of the top selling therapeutic proteins on the market today. These include cancer drugs, blood proteins, enzymes for metabolic disorders, vaccines, and various human hormones. Worldwide sales of biotherapeutic proteins exceed 140 Billion US Dollars per year. Despite the large market, it has been challenging to produce the drugs. Even the best produced drugs can only be produced at 5-10 g/L in CHO cells. The low yield and high demand makes bio-pharmaceuticals quite expensive.  Now, a new study reveals the biosynthetic pathways influencing protein production within the CHO cells. This tool allows scientists to make comprehensive simulations without doing tedious experiments in the laboratory. Hence, if a scientist wants to produce a specific human antibody in a CHO cell, the model will tell him or her which metabolic pathways are involved, and which growth conditions will presumably give the optimized production potential.  This model finally directly connects therapeutic protein production to the nutrients consumed by the CHO cells. This will allow researchers to design better CHO cells optimized for production of therapeutic proteins, which could result in lower prices and greater availability of many drugs,  says corresponding author and Assistant Professor Nathan Lewis from The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability at University of California, San Diego. The model accurately predicts cell physiology The research involves partners from USA, Denmark, Singapore, Austria, Australia, Chile, Iceland, and Saudi Arabia. The new model is called iCHO1766 and includes 6643 metabolic reactions and 2341 unique metabolites, i.e. products or intermediate molecules. To test whether the model s predictions reflected reality, the scientists performed a number of test runs and compared them to real data from several different laboratories. On average, the predictions only deviated 25% from the actual result. This is as good, if not better than similar analyses conducted in any other comparable model of mammalian or human metabolism.    This shows that the model is fairly robust, but still has room for improvement,  says co-first author and PhD student Hooman Hefzi from The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability at University of California, San Diego.  The model is primarily based on CHO data, but also on human and mouse cell lines, when there was no CHO data available. But the model is dynamic and will get updated as new data or areas for improvement are found,  he says. Combining three partial adequate models In order to construct this consensus model, the researchers combined three existing models for CHO metabolism. It turned out that each of the models covered different aspects of metabolism, and therefore only had 22 % of the final reactions in common. Hence, the consensus model gave a much more comprehensive overview of CHO metabolism and the combined effort of dozens of researchers allowed the team to carefully curate each pathway, according to Nathan Lewis:  Now researchers can work much more strategically in their CHO cell design. So instead of screening and testing billions of cells to find the one that by coincidence produces high concentrations of the desired bio-pharmaceutical, you can conduct simulations in the computer before going to the lab to design strategies to engineer the cells. This is a very important tool for CHO bioengineers, I would say.  Source: Story from the Technical University of Denmark.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/metabolite-promotes-cancer-cell-transformation-200741,Metabolite Promotes Cancer Cell Transformation  Researchers have identified a metabolite that promotes cancer cell transformation and colorectal cancer spread  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Osaka University researchers revealed that the metabolite D-2-hydroxyglurate (D-2HG) promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition of colorectal cancer cells, leading them to develop features of lower adherence to neighboring cells, increased invasiveness, and greater likelihood of metastatic spread. The finding highlights the value of targeting D-2HG to establish new therapeutic approaches against colorectal cancer. A metabolite is found to make the colorectal cancer cells more invasive and increase likelihood of more tumors spreading to distant organs; this makes the metabolite a promising target for future cancer therapies. Osaka, Japan   Cancer cells exhibit a range of properties that diverge from those of their normal healthy counterparts, including levels of various metabolites. However, it has been difficult to determine whether such altered levels is a cause or a consequence of the cancerous growth. In a breakthrough that offers hope for improved treatment of colorectal cancer, Osaka University researchers have identified a metabolite that causes cancer cells to develop more dangerous properties and increases the likelihood that cancer will spread in colorectal cancer patients. The team examined different varieties of cancer cells and cells from normal tissues and revealed high levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) in colorectal cancer cells. They then administered either D-2HG into cancer cells and found it induced the cells to undergo transformation. This transformation involved the cells adhering less strongly to each other and migrating more easily. These properties in the body are associated with cancer progression and spread.  When we grew the cells with D-2HG on plates and measured their movement, they migrated further than untreated cells  lead author Hugh Colvin says.  Using a Matrigel assay that models the ability of cancer cells to enter local tissue, the D-2HG treated cells were also more invasive.  The researchers showed that D-2HG acts by increasing the expression of a gene called ZEB1, which promotes this cell transformation. They also obtained specimens from 28 human colorectal cancer patients and divided them into two groups with low or high levels of D-2HG. The patients  records showed that the high group had more often suffered cancer spread to distant organs, which suggested the importance of D-2HG in patient prognosis.  When cancer cells initially emerge, it can be difficult for them to survive and multiply because of the local conditions,  coauthor Hideshi Ishii says.  D-2HG makes cancer cell survival more likely by causing them to transform from epithelial to mesenchymal cells, meaning that they can invade local tissue, enter the blood, and be transported elsewhere to establish a new tumor.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/zikas-entry-points-214442,Zika s Entry Points Discovery shows Zika infection of neural progenitor cells occurs regardless of AXL production  which was thought to be the main vector for the virus  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Around the world, hundreds of women infected with the Zika virus have given birth to children suffering from microcephaly or other brain defects, as the virus attacks key cells responsible for generating neurons and building the brain as the embryo develops. Studies have suggested that Zika enters these cells, called neural progenitor cells or NPCs, by grabbing onto a specific protein called AXL on the cell surface. Now scientists at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) and Novartis have shown that this is not the only route of infection for NPCs. The scientists demonstrated that the Zika virus infected NPCs even when the cells did not produce the AXL surface receptor protein that is widely thought to be the main vehicle of entry for the virus.  Our finding really recalibrates this field of research, because it tells us we still have to go and find out how Zika is getting into these cells,  said Kevin Eggan, principal faculty member at HSCI, professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School, and co-corresponding author on a paper reporting the research in Cell Stem Cell.  It s very important for the research community to learn that targeting the AXL protein alone will not defend against Zika,  agreed Ajamete Kaykas, co-corresponding author and a senior investigator in neuroscience at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR). Previous studies have shown that blocking expression of the AXL receptor protein does defend against the virus in a number of human cell types. Given that the protein is highly expressed on the surface of NPCs, many labs have been working on the hypothesis that AXL is the entry point for Zika in the developing brain.  We were thinking that the knocked-out NPCs devoid of AXL wouldn t get infected,  said Max Salick, a NIBR postdoctoral researcher and co-first author on the paper.  But we saw these cells getting infected just as much as normal cells.  Working in a facility dedicated to infectious disease research, the scientists exposed two-dimensional cell cultures of AXL-knockout human NPCs to the Zika virus. They followed up by exposing three-dimensional mini-brain  organoids  containing such NPCs to the virus. In both cases, cells clearly displayed Zika infection. This finding was supported by an earlier study that knocked out AXL in the brains of mice.  We knew that organoids are great models for microcephaly and other conditions that show up very early in development and have a very pronounced effect,  said Kaykas.  For the first few months, the organoids do a really good job in recapitulating normal brain development.  Historically, human NPCs have been difficult to study in the lab because it would be impossible to obtain samples without damaging brain tissue. With the advancements in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell) technology, a cell reprogramming process that allows researchers to coax any cell in the body back into a stem cell-like state, researchers can now generate these previously inaccessible human tissues in a petri dish. The team was able to produce human iPS cells and then, using gene-editing technology, modify the cells to knock out AXL expression, said Michael Wells, a Harvard postdoctoral researcher in the Eggan Lab and co-first author. The scientists pushed the iPS cells to become NPCs, building the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models that were infected with Zika. The Harvard and NIBR collaborators started working with the virus in mid-April 2016, only six months before they published their findings. This unusual speed of research reflects the urgency of Zika s global challenge, as the virus has spread to more than 70 countries and territories.  At the genesis of the project, my wife was pregnant,  Eggan remarked.  One can t read the newspapers without being concerned.  The collaboration grew out of interactions at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT s Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, where Eggan directs the stem cell program. His lab already had developed cell culture systems for studying NPCs in motor neuron and psychiatric diseases. The team at Novartis had created brain organoids for research on tuberous sclerosis complex and other genetic neural disorders.  Zika seemed to be a big issue where we could have an impact, and we all shared that interest,  Eggan said.  It s been great to have this public/private collaboration.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/radiationfree-imaging-in-the-brain-206780,Radiation Free Imaging in the Brain Scientists create sensors that use proteins to detect particular targets through induced blood flow changes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists hoping to get a glimpse of molecules that control brain activity have devised a new probe that allows them to image these molecules without using any chemical or radioactive labels. Currently the gold standard approach to imaging molecules in the brain is to tag them with radioactive probes. However, these probes offer low resolution and they can t easily be used to watch dynamic events, says Alan Jasanoff, an MIT professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences. Jasanoff and his colleagues have developed new sensors consisting of proteins designed to detect a particular target, which causes them to dilate blood vessels in the immediate area. This produces a change in blood flow that can be imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging techniques.  This is an idea that enables us to detect molecules that are in the brain at biologically low levels, and to do that with these imaging agents or contrast agents that can ultimately be used in humans,  Jasanoff says.  We can also turn them on and off, and that s really key to trying to detect dynamic processes in the brain.  In a paper appearing in the Dec. 2 issue of Nature Communications, Jasanoff and his colleagues used these probes to detect enzymes called proteases, but their goal is to use them to monitor the activity of neurotransmitters, which act as chemical messengers between brain cells. The paper s lead authors are postdoc Mitul Desai and former MIT graduate student Adrian Slusarczyk. Recent MIT graduate Ashley Chapin and postdoc Mariya Barch are also authors of the paper. Indirect imaging To make their probes, the researchers modified a naturally occurring peptide called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is active primarily during migraines or inflammation. The researchers engineered the peptides so that they are trapped within a protein cage that keeps them from interacting with blood vessels. When the peptides encounter proteases in the brain, the proteases cut the cages open and the CGRP causes nearby blood vessels to dilate. Imaging this dilation with MRI allows the researchers to determine where the proteases were detected.  These are molecules that aren t visualized directly, but instead produce changes in the body that can then be visualized very effectively by imaging,  Jasanoff says. Proteases are sometimes used as biomarkers to diagnose diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer s disease. However, Jasanoff s lab used them in this study mainly to demonstrate the validity their approach. Now, they are working on adapting these imaging agents to monitor neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, that are critical to cognition and processing emotions. To do that, the researchers plan to modify the cages surrounding the CGRP so that they can be removed by interaction with a particular neurotransmitter.  What we want to be able to do is detect levels of neurotransmitter that are 100-fold lower than what we ve seen so far. We also want to be able to use far less of these molecular imaging agents in organisms. That s one of the key hurdles to trying to bring this approach into people,  Jasanoff says. Jeff Bulte, a professor of radiology and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, described the technique as  original and innovative,  while adding that its safety and long-term physiological effects will require more study.  It s interesting that they have designed a reporter without using any kind of metal probe or contrast agent,  says Bulte, who was not involved in the research.  An MRI reporter that works really well is the holy grail in the field of molecular and cellular imaging.  Tracking genes Another possible application for this type of imaging is to engineer cells so that the gene for CGRP is turned on at the same time that a gene of interest is turned on. That way, scientists could use the CGRP-induced changes in blood flow to track which cells are expressing the target gene, which could help them determine the roles of those cells and genes in different behaviours. Jasanoff s team demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by showing that implanted cells expressing CGRP could be recognized by imaging.  Many behaviours involve turning on genes, and you could use this kind of approach to measure where and when the genes are turned on in different parts of the brain,  Jasanoff says.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-form-of-autism-found-202574,New Form of Autism Found An international team of researchers have identified a new form of syndromic autism  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Autism spectrum disorders affect around one percent of the world s population and are characterized by a range of difficulties in social interaction and communication. In a new study published in Cell, a team of researchers led by Gaia Novarino, Professor at IST Austria, has identified a new genetic cause of ASD. Gaia Novarino explains why this finding is significant:  There are many different genetic mutations causing autism, and they are all very rare. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to develop effective treatments. Our analysis not only revealed a new autism-linked gene, but also identified the mechanism by which its mutation causes autism. Excitingly, mutations in other genes share the same autism-causing mechanism, indicating that we may have underscored a subgroup of ASDs.   The identification of novel genes, especially in heterogeneous diseases such as autism, is difficult. However, as result of a collaborative effort, we were able to identify mutations in a gene called SLC7A5 in several patients born to consanguineous marriages and diagnosed with syndromic autism , points out Dr. Caglayan, Chairman of the Department of Medical Genetics in the School of Medicine at  stanbul Bilim University in Turkey and co-author of the study.  SLC7A5 transports a certain type of amino acids, the so-called branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), into the brain. To understand how mutations of SLC7A5 lead to autism, the researchers studied mice in which SLC7A5 is removed at the barrier between the blood and the brain. This reduces the levels of BCAAs in their brain, and interferes with protein synthesis in neurons. Consequently, the mice show reduced social interaction and other changes in their behavior, which are also observed in other autism mouse models. In a previous study, Gaia Novarino and colleagues identified a mutation in a gene that is involved in the breakdown of these same amino acids in several patients with ASD, intellectual disability and epilepsy.  Of course, not all genes causing autism affect amino acid levels, and these forms of autism are unarguably very rare, but it is possible that even more autism-causing genes fall in this group.  explains Gaia Novarino.  Notably, the researchers were able to treat some of the neurological abnormalities in the adult mice missing SLC7A5 at the blood-brain barrier. After delivering BCAAs straight into the mice s brains for three weeks, the authors observed an improvement in behavioral symptoms. Dora Tarlungeanu, PhD student in Gaia Novarino s group and first author of the study, is excited about the outlook this result gives:  Our research found a potential treatment for certain symptoms presented in this form of ASD in mice but translation into a treatment for ASD patients will require many years of additional research.  The researchers  results contrast with the idea that ASDs are always irreversible conditions. The way they treated symptoms in the mice can, of course, not directly be used in humans. But they show that some of the neurological complications presented by mice missing Slc7a5 can be rescued, and so it is possible that   eventually   patients may be treated as well.

As reported online in Nature on Nov. 30, the research is a step toward a nature-inspired means for delivering therapeutics directly to specific cell types within the body.  We re shifting our perception from viruses as pathogens, to viruses as inspiration for new tools,  says Wesley Sundquist, Ph.D., co-chair of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He is also co-senior author on the study with Neil King, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. The carefully designed instructions set forth a series of self-propelled events that mimic how some viruses transfer their infectious contents from one cell to the next. From the blueprints tumbled out self-assembling, soccer ball-shaped  nanocages , the structure of which was reported previously. Adding on specific pieces of genetic code from viruses caused the nanocages to be packaged within cell membranes, and then exported from cells. Like a shuttle leaving Earth to bring goods to a space station, the tiny capsules undocked from one cell, traveled to another and docked there, emptying its contents upon arrival. In this case, the protective nanocages carried cargo that the scientists used like homing beacons to track the vessels  journeys. Next steps are to design nanocages that hold drugs or other small molecules.  We are now able to accurately and consistently design new proteins with tailor-made structures,  says King.  Given the remarkably sophisticated and varied functions that natural proteins perform, it's exciting to consider the possibilities that are open to us.  The researchers  decision to model the microscopic shipping system after viruses was no accident. Viruses have honed their skills to effectively spread their infectious wares to large numbers of cells. Decades of research, including in-depth investigations of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by Sundquist s team, have led to an understanding of how the pathogens accomplish this goal with such efficiency. A test of whether you truly understand something is to build it yourself. And that s what Sundquist and King s teams have done here.  The success of our system is the first formal proof that this is how virus budding works,  remarks Sundquist. Viruses taught them that such a delivery system must include three essential properties: an ability to grasp membranes, self-assemble, and to be released from cells. Introducing coding errors into any one of those steps brought shipments to a halt.  I was sure that this would need fine-tuning but it was clean from the very beginning,  says lead author J rg Votteler, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in biochemistry at the University of Utah. When electron microscopist David Belnap, Ph.D. saw that images of the cages aligned closely with computer models, he knew they had made what they set out to design.  When it s right, you know it,  he says. The system could be modified as long as the three basic tenets were left intact. For example, the scientists could swap in differently shaped cages, or cause another type of membranes to surround them. Modularity means the vessels can be customized for various applications. This study is proof of principle that the systems works, but more needs to be done before it can be applied therapeutically. Researchers will need to determine whether the capsules can navigate long journeys within living animals, for instance, and whether they can deliver medicines in sufficient quantities.  As long as we keep pushing knowledge forward we can guarantee there will be good outcomes, though we can t guarantee what or when,  says Sundquist. Source: Story from the University of Utah.

The test is authorized to detect Zika virus RNA in blood plasma and serum as well as urine samples (when collected alongside a patient-matched serum or plasma sample), and can provide results within five to seven hours. According to the CDC, more than 4,000 people who live in the U.S. have been infected with Zika (primarily from travel outside the U.S.), and nearly 33,000 people are infected and reside in U.S. territories, mainly in Puerto Rico.1 Zika virus is primarily spread to people through bites from infected mosquitoes but can also be passed from pregnant women to their fetuses or through sexual transmission.2 It is important to quickly and accurately determine whether someone has a Zika infection to track and potentially help prevent the spread of the virus. However, diagnosing and testing for Zika virus infection can be difficult. People who are infected with the Zika virus might not have any symptoms or only have mild symptoms that last a few days to a week.2 Molecular testing is recommended with urine in parallel with plasma or serum up to two weeks after a possible Zika infection.3 ""Diagnosing a Zika infection can be challenging,"" said John Hackett, Ph.D., divisional vice president, applied research and technology, Diagnostics Products, Abbott. ""Abbott's molecular test uses the CDC's recommended sample types and can distinguish Zika from other viruses such as dengue or chikungunya, which helps doctors make informed diagnoses to help people get treated and get back to better health."" The Abbott RealTime ZIKA test is designed for use on the m2000 RealTime System   the company's molecular diagnostics instrument used in hospital and reference labs in the U.S. and around the world. The test is highly sensitive, meaning that it can detect if people have an active Zika infection. It is also automated, allowing people who work in the lab to be more efficient and spend less time preparing and handling samples, reducing the chances of contamination and increasing speed to diagnosis.

In soil collected from city parks, the team dug up genetic evidence of bacteria capable of producing a wide range of compounds whose potent effects might be harnessed as medicines. Their work was described November in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  By sequencing and analyzing genes within soil samples, we found the genetic instructions for making a wide range of natural products that have the potential to become treatments for various conditions, from cancer to bacterial or fungal infections, or that are already being used as drugs,  says senior author Sean F. Brady, the Evnin Associate Professor and head of Rockefeller s Laboratory of Genetically Encoded Small Molecules.  The sheer diversity we saw suggests there are many more potentially valuable compounds out there awaiting discovery even in a place as mundane as urban soil,  he adds. In their invisible battles against one another and against other organisms, microbes have developed a wealth of chemical weapons that have been turned into medicines capable of myriad feats, from fighting off viruses to killing tumor cells. Because soil is crammed with competing microbes, it is a rich source of such microbe-derived medicines. However, only a fraction of soil bacteria can be grown in the lab, severely limiting scientists  ability to exploit them. Brady s lab avoids this problem by looking directly at the bacterial DNA in soil. Within these sequences, the researchers can identify the instructions for making molecules that interest them. The research on New York City soil was a collaboration with the nonprofit Natural Areas Conservancy, whose scientists made sure the 275 samples came from a variety of ecosystems within New York City s park system. With assistance from the conservancy, five high school students participating in Rockefeller s Science Outreach Program collected small amounts of topsoil. These went to Barnard College where the DNA was isolated, then on to Rockefeller where scientists decoded the precise genetic sequences it contained. The researchers then compared their samples to those from known nonribosomal peptides and polyketides, two families of compounds to which many therapeutic molecules previously isolated from bacteria belong. As it turns out, the city s diversity extends down into its soil. For instance, a single sample from Prospect Park in Brooklyn harbored genes that likely encode 25 molecules that have been studied for potential use as antibiotics and other types of medicines. Meanwhile, a set of 11 representative compounds discovered elsewhere around the world such as the antibiotic erythromycin from the Philippines and the antifungal agent natamycin from South Africa are encoded by genes that were observed within the city parks  soil. The most important finding, say the scientists, is the abundance of unfamiliar genes.  Less than one percent of molecule-encoding sequences matched up to the known genes to which we compared them,  says first author Zachary Charlop-Powers, a postdoc in Brady s lab.  Similar efforts in soil collected elsewhere have also shown that novel molecule-encoding sequences vastly outnumber those we recognize. This suggests there are many as yet-unidentified genes out there, and among these, some are likely to have potentially useful biological activity.  For Brady, the genetic riches of city soil suggest it s time to shift the strategy for identifying new compounds.  Throughout the history of the field, there has been this idea that one travels to remote parts of the world to collect strange bacteria. But those environments are fragile and disappearing,  says Brady, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Early Career Scientist.  Meanwhile, we re finding that by using modern sequencing approaches, it s possible to turn up all of the same potentially useful molecules in our own backyards.  Brady s lab continues to examine soil samples from around the United States for genes encoding potentially useful compounds. Source: Story from Rockefeller University.

The gingko tree has changed little in the past 270 million years   and is the sole living representative of one lineage of gymnosperms. Researchers led by BGI s Wenbin Chen, Song Ge from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Chengxin Fu from Zhejiang University, reported in GigaScience that they ve sequenced the more than 10-gigabase ginkgo genome to find a high number of repetitive sequences as well as a number of gene clusters that appear to be involved in defense mechanisms.  Ginkgo represents one of the five living groups of seed plants, and has no living relatives,  Zhejiang University s Yunpeng Zhao, a study co-author, said in a statement.  Such a genome fills a major phylogenetic gap of land plants, and provides key genetic resources to address evolutionary questions like [the] phylogenetic relationships of gymnosperm lineages.  For their study, the researchers extracted genomic DNA from the endosperm tissue of a ginkgo seed for sequencing. They generated paired-end and mate-pair libraries, all using DNA from the same seed. After sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 4000 platforms, the researchers generated 189.84X coverage with raw sequencing reads. Using some of the mate-pair library reads as scaffolding, they assembled a draft ginkgo genome of some 10.6 gigabases in length. This, the researchers noted, is 80 times larger than the Arabidopsis thaliana genome as well as larger than the maize, orchid, and sorghum genomes.  The large genome of ginkgo may have resulted from whole genome duplication and insertion of a remarkably high proportion of repetitive sequences,  BGI s Chen said. More than three quarters of the G. biloba genome consists of repeats. This is a higher portion than what is found in other plant genomes, including the Norway spruce, orchid, and sorghum genomes. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons were also particularly common amongst the repeat sequences of ginkgo. By analyzing the reverse transcriptase genes tacked on to those long terminal repeats and comparing them to those in other land plants, the researchers found evidence that some of these repeats were conserved. Though the repeats largely accumulated slowly in the ginkgo genome, there was a period of repeat expansion that the researchers traced to between 16 million and 24 million years ago. At the same time, the team reported that two whole-genome duplication events took place in ginkgo: one was an ancient duplication 515 million years to 735 million years ago that is common to seed plants, while the other was a more recent duplication specific to ginkgo. Using protein sequence, transcriptome, and expressed sequence tag data from five other land plants   Selaginella moellendorffii, Picea abies, Pinus taeda, A. thaliana, and Oryza sativa   the researchers predicted gene models for ginkgo. Through this, they identified 41,840 ginkgo genes, of which 30,209 genes were assigned high confidence. Some 2,100 gene families were unique to ginkgo, and many of those that harbored expansions were enriched for stimuli response functions, including defense. The researchers noted that ginkgo s defense mechanisms have been of interest to scientists as it employs multiple mechanisms to fend off insects and pathogens. In particular, they uncovered a high level of gene duplications within the ginkgolide/bilobalide biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, both of which produce defense metabolites   terpenic trilactones like ginkgolides and bilobalides, along with flavonoids, fend off herbivore attacks, they noted. These duplications, the researchers said, could have a dose effect that enhances resistance and adaptability. Source: Story from BGI.

See Also: Atomic force microscopy for imaging nanoscale dynamics of neurons Currently the gold standard approach to imaging molecules in the brain is to tag them with radioactive probes. However, these probes offer low resolution and they can't easily be used to watch dynamic events, says Alan Jasanoff, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor of biological engineering. Jasanoff and his colleagues have developed new sensors consisting of proteins designed to detect a particular target, which causes them to dilate blood vessels in the immediate area. This produces a change in blood flow that can be imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging techniques. ""This is an idea that enables us to detect molecules that are in the brain at biologically low levels, and to do that with these imaging agents or contrast agents that can ultimately be used in humans,"" Jasanoff says. ""We can also turn them on and off, and that's really key to trying to detect dynamic processes in the brain."" In a paper appearing in Nature Communications, Jasanoff and his colleagues used these probes to detect protease enzymes, but their ultimate goal is to use them to monitor the activity of neurotransmitters. Learn More: PET imaging for tau visualization in the brain The paper's lead authors are postdoc Mitul Desai and former MIT graduate student Adrian Slusarczyk. Recent MIT graduate Ashley Chapin and postdoc Mariya Barch are also authors of the paper. To make their probes, the researchers modified a naturally occurring peptide called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is active primarily during migraines or inflammation. The researchers engineered the peptides so that they are trapped within a protein cage that keeps them from interacting with blood vessels. When the peptides encounter proteases in the brain, the proteases cut the cages open and the CGRP causes nearby blood vessels to dilate. Imaging this dilation with MRI allows the researchers to determine where the proteases were detected. ""These are molecules that aren't visualized directly, but instead produce changes in the body that can then be visualized very effectively by imaging,"" Jasanoff says. Related: Noninvasive imaging method looks deeper inside the body to study living brain Proteases are sometimes used as biomarkers to diagnose diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, Jasanoff's lab used them in this study mainly to demonstrate the validity their approach. Now, they are working on adapting these imaging agents to monitor neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, that are critical to cognition and processing emotions. To do that, the researchers plan to modify the cages surrounding the CGRP so that they can be removed by interaction with a particular neurotransmitter. ""What we want to be able to do is detect levels of neurotransmitter that are 100-fold lower than what we've seen so far. We also want to be able to use far less of these molecular imaging agents in organisms. That's one of the key hurdles to trying to bring this approach into people,"" Jasanoff says. Another possible application for this type of imaging is to engineer cells so that the gene for CGRP is turned on at the same time that a gene of interest is turned on. That way, scientists could use the CGRP-induced changes in blood flow to track which cells are expressing the target gene, which could help them determine the roles of those cells and genes in different behaviors. Jasanoff's team demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by showing that implanted cells expressing CGRP could be recognized by imaging. Read Next: Brain imaging may help predict future behavior""Many behaviors involve turning on genes, and you could use this kind of approach to measure where and when the genes are turned on in different parts of the brain,"" Jasanoff says. His lab is also working on ways to deliver the peptides without injecting them, which would require finding a way to get them to pass through the blood-brain barrier.

Describing how it works, however how the brain determines what to keep in mind, and what to set aside but keep handy for quick access is a work in progress. Work that may sharpen our theory of the mind and even help people suffering from schizophrenia or depression. See Also: Electric current to brain boosts memory ""A lot of mental illness is associated with the inability to choose what to think about,"" says Brad Postle, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin- (UW-) Madison. ""What we're taking are first steps toward looking at the mechanisms that give us control over what we think about."" Postle's lab is challenging the idea that working memory remembers things through sustained brain activity. They caught brains tucking less-important information away somewhere beyond the reach of the tools that typically monitor brain activity and then they snapped that information back into active attention with magnets. Their latest study is published in the journal Science. According to Postle, it's important to note that most people feel they are able to concentrate on a lot more than their working memory can actually hold. It's a bit like vision, in which it feels like we're seeing everything in our field of view, but details slip away unless you re-focus on them regularly. Learn More: Too much activity in certain areas of the brain is bad for memory and attention""The notion that you're aware of everything all the time is a sort of illusion your consciousness creates,"" says Postle. ""That is true for thinking, too. You have the impression that you're thinking of a lot of things at once, holding them all in your mind. But lots of research shows us you're probably only actually attending to are conscious of in any given moment just a very small number of things."" Postle's group conducted a series of experiments in which people were asked to remember two items representing different types of information (they used words, faces and directions of motion) because they'd be tested on their memories. When the researchers gave their subjects a cue as to the type of question coming a face, for example, instead of a word the electrical activity and blood flow in the brain associated with the word memory disappeared. But if a second cue came letting the subject know they would now be asked about that word, the brain activity would jump back up to a level indicating it was the focus of attention. ""People have always thought neurons would have to keep firing to hold something in memory. Most models of the brain assume that,"" says Postle. ""But we're watching people remember things almost perfectly without showing any of the activity that would come with a neuron firing. The fact that you're able to bring it back at all in this example proves it's not gone. It's just that we can't see evidence for its active retention in the brain."" Don't Miss: Differences in brain structure and memory suggest adolescents may not  grow out of  ADHD The researchers were also able to bring the seemingly abandoned items back to mind without cueing their subjects. Using a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to apply a focused electromagnetic field to a precise part of the brain involved in storing the word, they could trigger the sort of brain activity representative of focused attention. Furthermore, if they cued their research subjects to focus on a face (causing brain activity associated with the word to drop off), a well-timed pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation would snap the stowed memory back into attention, and prompt the subjects to incorrectly think that they had been cued to focus on the word. ""We think that memory is there, but not active,"" says Postle, whose work is supported by the National Institute of Mental Health. ""More than just showing us it's there, the TMS can actually make that memory temporarily active again."" The study conducted by Postle with Nathan Rose, a former UW-Madison postdoctoral researcher who is now a professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, and UW-Madison graduate students in psychology and neuroscience suggests a state of memory apart from the spotlight attention of active working memory and the deep storage of more significant things in long-term memory. ""What's still unknown here is how the brain determines what falls away, and what enables you to retrieve things in the short-term if you need them,"" Postle says. Studying how the brain apportions attention could eventually influence the way we understand and treat mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, in which patients focus on hallucinations instead of reality, and depression, which seems strongly related to spending an unhealthy amount of time dwelling on negative things.

See Also: 'Smart fat cells' cross blood-brain barrier to catch early brain tumors In a report on one of the two findings, published in Acta Neuropathologica, the investigators identified alterations in a protein known as ATRX in human brain tumors that arise as part of a genetically inherited condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The disorder, marked initially by benign tumors on nerves, often leads to brain cancer, and although most NF1-related malignancies are nonaggressive, a fraction are ""high-grade"" and difficult to treat, experts say. Study leader Fausto J. Rodriguez, MD, associate professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, says the new study sought to sort out what makes the more aggressive NF1-related tumors genetically different from low grade tumors and normal, healthy cells. Research from other scientists at Johns Hopkins, he says, had suggested that some tumors, particularly those that affect the nervous system, have mutations in the ATRX gene, which produces proteins that appear to maintain the length of telomeres, repetitive segments of DNA on the ends of chromosomes that typically shorten each time a cell divides. Telomere shortening limits the number of divisions that cells c an undergo. By keeping telomeres long, ATRX mutations give cells the ability to endlessly divide, a hallmark of cancer. Don't Miss: Nanocarriers may carry new hope for brain cancer therapy To see what role ATRX mutations might play in NF1-related brain cancers, Rodriguez and his colleagues examined samples of both high- and low-grade gliomas tumors that arise from parent cells of nerve-supporting cells called glia which were removed by surgery from 27 patients with NF1. They tested the samples for longer telomeres that weren't the product of a protein called telomerase, which helps maintain telomere length in healthy cells and more commonly in other cancers. This nontelomerase-associated telomere lengthening is known as alternative lengthening of telomeres or ALT. They also tested for loss of the protein product of ATRX caused by mutations in this gene. About a third of the 27 samples had ALT and loss of the ATRX protein. The presence of both factors occurred in seven of 12 patients with high-grade tumors but only two of 14 with low-grade cancers. If further studies confirm the role of the mutation, Rodriguez says, researchers might be able to develop anticancer agents to target cells with ATRX mutations or ALT to limit telomere length. In the meantime, he adds, gaining a better understanding of aggressive NF1-related tumors allows researchers to develop more realistic models of these cancers in the lab. In a second study, described in Modern Pathology, the Johns Hopkins investigators sought a genetic source that could accurately identify subsets of low-grade pediatric gliomas, the most frequent tumors of the central nervous system in children. Unlike many other types of cancerous tumors, low-grade pediatric gliomas appear to have few genetic mutations, leaving the biology of these cancers a mystery, says Rodriguez. Learn More: Shining light on brain tumorsIn an effort to unravel that mystery, Rodriguez and his colleagues focused on the ways those cancer cells regulate the expression of genes or whether they make their constituent proteins. One way to control expression, he explains, is through microRNA, small pieces of noncoding genetic material that control whether a gene's protein is generated from the DNA blueprints inside cell nuclei. The researchers analyzed the amounts of 800 different microRNAs in nine different types of low-grade gliomas or related cancers. Of all of these, one in particular caught the researchers' eyes: a microRNA called miR-487b, which was consistently underexpressed in tumor tissue compared to healthy cells. To pin down the role of this microRNA, the researchers artificially increased its levels in lines of laboratory-grown human cancer cells that appeared to make too little of it, in turn bringing down the levels of the protein it affects. Unlike unaltered cancer cells, these new cells formed 30 percent fewer colonies and had decreased levels of other proteins, such as Nestin, by a third. Nestin is known to be important in both early development and in cancers. Read Next: Scientists find way to disrupt brain tumor stem cells Eventually, Rodriguez says, physicians might be able to look at the levels of this and other microRNAs in blood or cerebrospinal fluid to test for the presence of cancer. Researchers might also be able to target microRNAs directly, altering their levels to make cancer cells less likely to form tumors. ""By gaining a better understanding of the fine genetic differences between cancers and healthy tissues, we can develop better therapeutic or prognostic strategies,"" he says.

The research is published in the journal Science Signaling. KORs help regulate the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Drugs that target KORs have shown promise as therapeutic candidates because of their efficacy for treating chronic itch and relieving pain.

In the new study, the researchers used rodent models to compare this kind of ""biased"" KOR agonist, called triazole 1.1, and a conventional KOR agonist. They found that triazole 1.1 could indeed circumvent the two side effects of previously developed KOR compounds without decreasing dopamine levels, a property associated with dysphoria and sedation. ""This adds to the mounting evidence that shows analgesic effects can be separated from the sedative and dysphoric effects by altering how the agonist engages the receptor,"" said TSRI Research Associate Tarsis Brust, first author of the study.

The cycles shift toward  awake  when that part of the brain pays attention to a task.When we are in a deep slumber our brain's activity ebbs and flows in big, obvious waves, like watching a tide of human bodies rise up and sit down around a sports stadium. It's hard to miss. See Also: Sleep in a dish: Researchers isolate smallest unit of sleep to date Now, Stanford University researchers have found, those same cycles exist in wake as in sleep, but with only small sections sitting and standing in unison rather than the entire stadium. It's as if tiny portions of the brain are independently falling asleep and waking back up all the time. What's more, it appears that when the neurons have cycled into the more active, or ""on,"" state they are better at responding to the world. The neurons also spend more time in the on state when paying attention to a task. This finding suggests processes that regulate brain activity in sleep might also play a role in attention. ""Selective attention is similar to making small parts of your brain a little bit more awake,"" said Tatiana Engel, a postdoctoral fellow and co-lead author on the research, which is published in Science. Former graduate student Nicholas Steinmetz was the other co-lead author, who carried out the neurophysiology experiments in the lab of Tirin Moore, a professor of neurobiology and one of the senior authors. Understanding these newly discovered cycles requires knowing a bit about how the brain is organized. If you were to poke a pin directly into the brain, all the brain cells you'd hit would respond to the same types of things. In one column they might all be responding to objects in a particular part of the visual field - the upper right, for example. Learn More: Insight into the seat of human consciousness The team used what amounts to sets of very sensitive pins that can record activity from a column of neurons in the brain. In the past, people had known that individual neurons go through phases of being more or less active, but with this probe they saw for the first time that all the neurons in a given column cycled together between firing very rapidly then firing at a much slower rate, similar to coordinated cycles in sleep. ""During an on state the neurons all start firing rapidly,"" said Kwabena Boahen, a professor of bioengineering and electrical engineering at Stanford and a senior author on the paper. ""Then all of a sudden they just switch to a low firing rate. This on and off switching is happening all the time, as if the neurons are flipping a coin to decide if they are going to be on or off."" Those cycles, which occur on the order of seconds or fractions of seconds, weren't as visible when awake because the wave doesn't propagate much beyond that column, unlike in sleep when the wave spreads across almost the entire brain and is easy to detect. The team found that the higher and lower activity states relate to the ability to respond to the world. The group had their probe in a region of the brain in monkeys that specifically detects one part of the visual world. The monkeys had been trained to pay attention to a cue indicating that something in a particular part of the visual field the upper right, say, or the lower left was about to change slightly. The monkeys then got a treat if they correctly identified that they'd seen that change. Related: Does your mind jump around, stay on task or get stuck?When the team gave a cue to where a change might occur, the neurons within the column that senses that part of the world all began spending more time in the active state. In essence, they all continued flipping between states in unison, but they spent more time in the active state if they were paying attention. If the stimulus change came when the cells were in a more active state, the monkey was also more likely to correctly identify the change. ""The monkey is very good at detecting stimulus changes when neurons in that column are in the on state but not in the off state,"" Engel said. Even when the monkey knew to pay attention to a particular area, if the neurons cycled to a lower activity state the monkey frequently missed stimulus change. Engel said this finding is something that might be familiar to many people. Sometimes you think you are paying attention, she pointed out, but you will still miss things. The scientists said the findings also relate to previous work, which found that more alert animals and humans tend to have pupils that are more dilated. In the current work, when the brain cells were spending more time in an active state the monkey's pupils were also more dilated. The findings demonstrate an interaction between synchronous oscillations in the brain, attention to a task and external signs of alertness. ""It seems that the mechanisms underlying attention and arousal are quite interdependent,"" Moore said. A question that comes out of this work is why the neurons cycle into a lower activity state when we're awake. Why not just stay in the more active state all the time in case that's when the saber tooth tiger attacks? One answer could relate to energy. ""There is a metabolic cost associated with neurons firing all the time,"" Boahen said. The brain uses a lot of energy and maybe giving the cells a chance to do the energetic equivalent of sitting down allows the brain to save energy. Read Next: Human brain clocks exposed: Effects of circadian clocks and sleep loss vary across brain regions, study finds Also, when neurons are very active they generate cellular byproducts that can damage the cells. Engel pointed out that the low-activity states could allow time to clear out this neuronal waste. ""This paper suggests places to look for these answers,"" Engel said.

No more trial and error with multiple drugs. No more experimenting with drug dosages. It sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, but a groundbreaking process developed by Maikel Rheinstadter, biophysicist and associate professor in McMaster s Department of Physics and Astronomy, is bringing researchers one step closer to making this kind of personalized medicine a reality. The process uses synthetic human-like tissue created in a petri dish to help identify how and why drugs work differently in different people, an innovation that could help improve existing drugs, accelerate drug innovation, and pave the way for significant advances in personalized medicine.  If you go to your favourite clothes store to buy a t-shirt, you have 16 different sizes to choose from, but if you get a prescription for a drug from your doctor, there are no variations,  says Rheinstadter.  For adults, everyone takes the same drug, but we all have slightly different body compositions. Even drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen work differently depending on your body composition. It s a question of finding the right drug composition that works with your body.  Rheinstadter says his goal is to understand how drugs, and the active ingredients that could potentially be used to create drugs, such as hormones, enzymes, vitamins  even sugar or caffeine  interact with different body compositions at the molecular level. Researchers in the Rheinstadter Lab begin by creating synthetic, human-like tissues that can simulate a variety of body compositions. It s a technique that was developed by Rheinstadter along with PhD student Rick Alsop.  We create these tissues from the bottom up,  says Rheinstadter.  We can mimic a person who is healthy, someone with high cholesterol, someone with arthritis, someone who is older. We can even make things like synthetic Alzheimer s tissue. The key is creating these tissues.  Drug molecules are then added to the tissue, which is placed on a silicone chip and left to grow in a petri dish. Once created, the tissue is put in an x-ray diffractometer, a molecular microscope with a specialized chamber designed to simulate the inside of the human body. While in the chamber, the microscope uses x-rays to generate images of how the drug molecules are interacting with the tissue. Rheinstadter then uses a cutting-edge computational microscope* to analyze the image and calculate the motion of the molecules to see how the tissue is responding to the drugs.  This process allows us to get very detailed information about how drugs work in various types of tissue and get the results very quickly,  he says, adding that his lab is one of the few labs in the world capable of this kind of analysis.  Five years ago it would have taken months on a super-computer to study a drug but with this process, we can now study a drug overnight.  Rheinstadter says this technique has wide-ranging applications. For example, it could accelerate the pace of drug discovery and reduce the need for drug testing in humans and animals. It could become an important step in the clinical trial process  quickly identifying drugs that have the potential to be effective, or weeding out drugs that could be harmful to certain groups of people. It could also help improve existing drugs.  Take antimicrobial resistance for example,  he says.  We can make tissues that mimic the ones in which the antibiotics are working and tissues where the antibiotics aren t working to understand how the interaction is different. Once we understand the mechanism and why it does or doesn t work, we might be able to tweak existing antibiotics to make them effective again.  Researchers in the Rheinstadter Lab are currently testing a number of drug and molecular interactions in the petri dish and, through this technique, have recently succeeded in providing evidence that curkumen  the active ingredient in turmeric  is an effective molecule in combatting the formation of Alzheimer s senile plaques. Rheinstadter says he is pursing potential partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry, and has also begun working with other research groups on campus.  We have so many research collaborations here  that s what McMaster is good at,  he says. Rheinstadter purchased the computational microscope using funds he was awarded after he was named a University Scholar last spring. Source: Story from McMaster University.

The methodology could also identify co-infections with secondary microbes, determine the specific variant of the pathogen, and help alert health officials to the presence of new or unusual pathogens. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently compared the new methodology against traditional culture-based methods with samples from two severe outbreaks of Salmonella, a common foodborne pathogen. The metagenomics approach   which relies on DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of the resulting sequencing data -- not only correctly identified the bacterial culprit, but also found a possible coinfection with a second important pathogen, Staphylococcus. Widespread use of the new shotgun metagenomics methodology could improve real-time disease surveillance, provide a better quantitative picture of pathogen abundance and help scientists and doctors understand the response of the body s natural microbiome. Supported by the CDC and the National Science Foundation, the research was reported November 23 in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.  When we receive the samples, we can move directly to characterizing them by sequencing the genomes of the microbes that are in the sample without waiting for conventional culturing techniques,  explained Kostas Konstantinidis, the Carlton Wilder Associate Professor in the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  Using computational analysis, we can then say what the pathogen is and identify the variant, its virulence factors, even what antibiotic might be effective against it. That can usually be done in a single day.  Conventional techniques used for identifying foodborne bacteria involve culturing the microbes to increase the numbers necessary for detection. This takes time, as long as two or three days, and some bacteria don t grow on traditional culture media and could be missed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can also be used to identify pathogenic bacteria, but it also relies on isolating the unknown microbes from a culture. Metagenomics technology has already been used to analyze the microbial content of everything from lake ecosystems to drinking water in pipes. The evaluation of samples from separate bacterial outbreaks in Alabama and Colorado is one of the very first applications of the methodology for diagnosing foodborne bacteria.  Stool samples are very complex and contain lots of different DNA from humans, healthy bacteria, and the food you ate,  explained Andrew Huang, Ph.D., a microbiologist/ bioinformatician in CDC s Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch.  The process of generating the DNA fingerprint of the bacteria directly from a sick patient s stool is like finding a needle in a haystack of all kinds of DNA. Because of this, the use of metagenomics for disease detection is in the early stages of research and development. However, this study shows the potential to use stools from healthy and sick people directly to determine who is involved in an outbreak, which will revolutionize the way we detect and monitor for foodborne disease in the future.  Metagenomics identifies the microbes present by sequencing all of the DNA present in a sample and comparing the genomic data to a database of known microbes. In addition to identifying the bacteria present in the samples, the methodology can also measure the relative abundance of each microbial species and their virulence potential, among other things.  Currently, the most advanced DNA fingerprinting method, whole genome sequencing, requires first pulling out, or isolating in a pure culture, the bacteria that made a person sick to generate a fingerprint,  said Huang, who co-leads a group working on culture independent and metagenomics subtyping.  Metagenomics differs from whole genome sequencing because it could allow us to sequence all the DNA in a patient s sample. It could allow us to skip the isolation steps and go directly from a stool sample to a highly detailed DNA fingerprint of the bacteria that made you sick. This method saves time and provides more detail that could be helpful for diagnosing a patient and identifying an outbreak.  In the two 2013 outbreaks investigated, the traditional diagnostic technique and the metagenomics methodology arrived at the same answers, but the metagenomics data provided specific information about the bacterial phenotype involved and identified a secondary Staphylococcus aureus pathogen present in two of the samples tested. Knowing the specific phenotype can help in pinpointing the origins of an outbreak, while information about the secondary infection may help explain related factors such as the severity of the infection. Scientists were also able to rule out one species   Escherichia coli (or E. coli)   because the variant present was not of a virulent type. Variants of this bacteria are present naturally in the gut microbiome (called ""commensal E. coli"") while other variants are notorious enteric pathogens. Metagenomics showed the abundant E. coli population in the outbreak samples was probably commensal, and its growth may have been accelerated when conditions became more favorable during the Salmonella infection. In the two cases evaluated, scientists were able to determine that although the symptoms were similar, the outbreaks were caused by different variants of Salmonella and therefore were probably not connected. As many as half of foodborne disease outbreaks are never attributed to a source. Those outbreaks may be caused by new infectious agents, or by microbes not commonly seen in food. The metagenomic methodology could help identify unknown microbes, potentially providing advance warning of new outbreaks.  Without going through culture methods, we are able to see all of the microbes that are in the sample,  Konstantinidis said.  We can get this information in a day or so, which is quite important in selecting the right antibiotic to combat the infection, controlling the outbreak and working with food producers to recall items that caused the outbreak. The sooner we have the answer, the better.  Though the study confirmed the benefits expected, two challenges must be addressed before the new approach can go into widespread use, Konstantinidis said. The first is the cost, which can be significantly higher than traditional approaches, suggesting the metagenomics test might be used first in complicated cases. The second challenge is in removing human DNA from the samples. All DNA must be sequenced, but the human DNA can account for as much as 99 percent of the genomic data, so removing it from consideration could accelerate the analysis.

This represents a major step by Takeda toward meeting important unmet needs in dengue prevention. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dengue is the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease. Forty percent of the world s population lives under the threat of the dengue virus, which causes an estimated 390 million infections and more than 20,000 deaths each year around the world in people of all ages.  This manufacturing plant investment reinforces Takeda s strong support for our global vaccine strategy in general, and dengue in particular. The new plant will provide millions of people with access to a medicine that addresses a huge unmet medical need. It underlines our commitment to improve the lives of people worldwide,  says Dr. Thomas Wozniewski, Global Manufacturing & Supply Officer at Takeda.  Our colleagues in Singen have vast experience in lyophilisation technology, which is key for the manufacturing process of Takeda s dengue vaccine finished product,  notes Thomas Wozniewski. Initial construction activities will start immediately, and the facility should be ready for production in 2019. On September 7, 2016 Takeda vaccinated the first subject in the Tetravalent Immunization against Dengue Efficacy Study (TIDES). TIDES is now enrolling approximately 20,000 healthy children between the ages of four and 16 years living in dengue-endemic countries in Latin America and Asia. The study is a Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Takeda s live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate. The study is evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine candidate to protect subjects against symptomatic dengue fever caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes, regardless of age and whether the individual has previously been exposed to the virus. The study is also evaluating vaccine safety and immunogenicity, with two doses of the vaccine candidate or placebo administered 90 days apart. Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, President of Takeda Vaccines, adds  This dengue vaccine production facility is another strong indication of Takeda s long-term commitment to vaccines. The progress of the dengue TIDES clinical trial, our partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to eradicate polio, the recent initiation of the world s first field efficacy trial for a norovirus vaccine, and our work with the U.S. Government to develop a Zika vaccine, together demonstrate how Takeda is dedicated to developing and providing vaccines to protect people in need wherever they are.

The collaboration involves working to better understand the mechanisms driving disease processes, including inflammation, as well as defining the characteristics of patient populations that might benefit from new therapies. In 2010, UCSF became the first university to enter into a collaboration with CTI, a research group with the goal of speeding the discovery and development of innovative antibody drugs, and, in 2013, it was the first institution to enter into a collaboration with CTI specifically to identify potential new small molecules against novel disease targets. The CTI collaboration comprises several ongoing research projects. One focuses on developing a treatment for malignant brain tumors in young children due to a genetic mutation with a novel small molecule kinase inhibitor. The team at UCSF consists of Nalin Gupta MD, PhD, Daniel A. Lim, MD, PhD, and Michael D. Prados, MD, from the Department of Neurological Surgery. Another, in which CTI has partnered with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and is working with UCSF scientist Jeffrey Bluestone, PhD, focuses on developing a novel immune-modulatory agent to treat type 1 diabetes with an accelerated path into human clinical trials.  Projects are identified periodically through a process that includes an announcement of requests for proposals, proposal submissions, and reviews by a steering committee comprised of leading Pfizer and UCSF scientists.  This type of public-private collaboration holds great promise for identifying new drug development strategies and for moving the best ideas more quickly into clinical trials,  said Daniel Lowenstein, MD, executive vice chancellor and provost at UCSF.  It s an essential path to follow if we are going to help people suffering from debilitating and life-threatening chronic conditions. We are seeing promising molecules begin to emerge from these collaborative projects, and we look forward to more in the years to come.  According to Pfizer CTI s Chief Scientific Officer Anthony Coyle, PhD,  CTI s collaboration with UCSF has set a course for exciting drug discovery projects. As a scientist, I see novel research being done under CTI s collaboration with UCSF; involving Pfizer s powerful drug development resources has the potential to be a game-changer for patients.  The collaborations between UCSF and Pfizer CTI are managed by the UCSF Innovation, Technology and Alliances office, which is responsible for coordinating the University s efforts in building collaborations that focus on translating cutting-edge science on campus into therapies and products that directly benefit patients worldwide.

""Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that represents a major and growing global public health problem, for which very few approved treatment options are available, and the societal cost is measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, so the need for improved treatment choices is paramount,"" said David Nicholson, Chief Research & Development Officer, Allergan. ""This acquisition adds a new Phase 3 ready program for Alzheimer's disease to our CNS portfolio and builds on our commitment to develop innovative approaches to improve the lives of millions of patients suffering from this devastating illness."" Chase's lead compound, CPC- 201, is a patent-protected combination of the most commonly prescribed acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), donepezil, and the peripherally acting cholinergic blocker, solifenacin. AChEIs have been shown to improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease patients. Currently approved AChEIs are only modestly effective due to dose-limiting side effects, including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. In Phase 2 clinical trials, 29 out of 33 patients (88%) reached 40 mg/day of donepezil (maximum dose allowed), without experiencing dose-limiting adverse events. This median donepezil dose did not change significantly during three months of maintenance treatment. Chase's next-generation formulations offer the possibility of greater and more tolerable dosing, and may provide the potential for significantly improved cognition and function in Alzheimer's disease patients. Chase Pharmaceuticals recently completed an End of Phase 2 meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on feedback from the FDA, Allergan intends to advance CPC-201 into a single Phase 3 registration study in 2017.

The search for these unique cancer markers has become a robust area of research as scientists believe they may hold the key to developing a new generation of personalized, targeted cancer immunotherapies. This new collaboration, the Tumor neoantigEn SeLection Alliance (TESLA), includes 30 of the world s leading cancer neoantigen research groups from both academia and industry. Because these tumor markers are both specific to each individual and unlikely to be present on normal healthy cells, neoantigens represent an optimal target for the immune system and make possible a new class of highly personalized vaccines with the potential for significant efficacy with reduced side effects.  Bringing together the world s best neoantigen research organizations to accelerate the discovery of personalized cancer immunotherapies is exactly the type of bold research collaboration that I envisioned when launching the Parker Institute,  said Sean Parker, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and founder of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.  This alliance will not only leverage the immense talents of each of the researchers but will also harness the power of bioinformatics, which I believe will be critical to driving breakthroughs.  The goal of the initiative is to help participating groups test and continually improve the mathematical algorithms they use to analyze tumor DNA and RNA sequences in order to predict the neoantigens that are likely to be present on each patient s cancer and most visible to the immune system. In support of this, Parker Institute and CRI have partnered with renowned open science nonprofit, Sage Bionetworks, to manage the bioinformatics and data analysis. Initially, the project is expected to focus on cancers such as advanced melanoma, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer that tend to have larger numbers of mutations and thus more neoantigens. Over time, the initiative will seek to broaden the relevance of neoantigen vaccines to a wide range of cancers. Participants come from universities, biotech, the pharmaceutical industry and scientific nonprofits. The researchers represent a wide swath of scientific fields, including immunology, data science, genomics, molecular biology, and physics and engineering.  This project embodies the spirit of collaboration and partnership between academia, industry and nonprofits that the Parker Institute strives to foster,  said Jeffrey Bluestone, Ph.D., president and CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.  It is a great example of how we are breaking down traditional barriers to conduct groundbreaking, multidisciplinary science to get cancer treatments to patients faster.   The Cancer Research Institute and the Parker Institute share a belief that the immune system is a platform technology that can be harnessed to turn all cancers into a curable disease,  said Adam Kolom, Parker Institute vice president of business development and strategic partnerships and CRI s Clinical Accelerator program director.  We believe that by bringing together the top laboratories in the world that are developing neoantigen prediction software, we will be able to unlock the promise of this next generation of personalized cancer immunotherapies sooner. This marks the first major collaboration between the San Francisco-based Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, launched in April 2016, and the Cancer Research Institute, founded in 1953 in New York City.  We re proud to join the Parker Institute in this collaboration, which demonstrates the vital role that nonprofits can play in bringing together stakeholders from across sectors to work alongside one another to advance the field of cancer immunotherapy,  said Jill O Donnell-Tormey, Ph.D., Cancer Research Institute CEO and director of scientific affairs. Participating researchers said they looked forward to working collaboratively through the alliance to solve one of immunotherapy s most complex problems.  This experiment is truly remarkable because of its potential to help us more precisely identify abnormal proteins in an individual s tumor that can be used as targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy,  said professor Robert D. Schreiber, Ph.D., director of the Andrew M. and Jane M. Bursky Center for Human Immunology & Immunotherapy Programs at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.  We believe that this type of precision medicine, used alone or with other forms of immunotherapy, will significantly improve our capacity to treat cancer patients more effectively and with fewer side effects than current treatments.

See Also: Psilocybin inhibits the processing of negative emotions in the brain Published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, the study showed that one-time treatment with the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin whose use required federal waivers because it is a banned substance quickly brought relief from distress that then lasted for more than six months in 80 percent of the 29 study subjects monitored, based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression. The NYU Langone-led study was published side by side with a similar study from Johns Hopkins. Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care. (See more on the Johns Hopkins research as presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, Dec. 2015) ""Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,"" says study lead investigator Stephen Ross, MD, director of substance abuse services in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone. ""If larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication dispensed under strict control to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients,"" says Ross, also an associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine. Learn More: New study discovers biological basis for magic mushroom 'mind expansion' Study co-investigator Jeffrey Guss, MD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile. Study participants, he says, experienced no serious negative effects, such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions. Although the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood, it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin, which is known to control mood and anxiety. Serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression. For the study, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 0.3 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo (250 milligrams of niacin) known to produce a ""rush"" that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience. Don't Miss: Psychedelic therapy re-emerging for anxiety, PTSD and addiction Approximately half way through the study's monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo, and those who first took niacin, then received psilocybin. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. Guss says, ""The randomization, placebo control, and double-blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results."" One of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study's extended monitoring period specifically, eight months for those who took psilocybin first. All patients in the study mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU Langone had either advanced breast, gastrointestinal, or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state. Co-investigator Anthony Bossis, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, says patients also reported post-psilocybin improvements in their quality of life: going out more, greater energy, getting along better with family members, and doing well at work. Several also reported variations of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased feelings of altruism. ""Our study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress,"" says Bossis.

In this case, modified T cells destroy the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells. Myelin protects the neural pathways and is thus essential to the ability of nerve cells to transmit information. See Also: Researcher finds link between gut bacteria and multiple sclerosis Which areas in the body are targeted by T cells and the impact they will have depends on various factors. In a previous study, Thomas Korn, Professor for Experimental Neuroimmunology at Technical University of Munich (TUM), demonstrated that a substance known as interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays an important role in instructing T cells to cause damage to myelin sheaths in the central nervous system. The T cells are turned pathogenic in the lymph nodes, where they encounter a certain type of dendritic cells. Signals from the dendritic cells prime them to trigger immune reactions in other parts of the body. In the case of foreign antigens, for example components of viruses or bacteria, this is useful, as they can then be eliminated from the tissue. However, when pathogenic T cells recognize autoantigens, i.e. elements of the body's own substances such as the myelin sheath, these T cells trigger an autoimmune disease. When dendritic cells not only signal myelin as a ""target substance"", but also secrete the messenger substance IL-6, a sort of molecular switch is flipped in the T cells. This causes them to become pathogenic, and thus to have particularly harmful effects on tissues. Learn More: Slowed processing speed linked with executive deficits in multiple sclerosis ""However, there was a major problem with this seemingly clear link,"" says Korn. ""The T cells do not always become pathogenic when IL-6 is secreted."" Together with a research group led by Dr. Ari Waisman, the head of the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University Medical Center in Mainz, Germany, Korn and his team have found an explanation for this phenomenon. ""The decisive factor is not only whether the dendritic cells provide an IL-6 signal to T cells,"" says Waisman. ""It's also how they do it."" Previously, dendritic cells were known to communicate IL-6 to T cells in two ways. First, they can secrete the messenger substance into their surroundings. The molecules are soluble and form a cloud in close proximity to the dendritic cell. Don't Miss: Predicting who will develop multiple sclerosis Second, in a process known as trans-signaling, soluble IL-6 and the soluble IL-6 receptor can form a complex that can trigger a signal in certain responder cells. Korn and Waisman have discovered that IL-6 does not trigger the decisive change in the T cells in either of those cases. Instead they identified a third way: IL-6 can also be displayed on the cell surface of dendritic cells and thus be directly presented to T cells. Korn and Waisman refer to this transmission mode as cluster signaling, as it involves the formation of clusters of dendritic cells and T cells. What sets this ""third"" IL-6 signaling mode apart is that the T cell receives the IL-6 signals from the dendritic cell almost simultaneously with other signals. This temporal proximity probably causes the T cell to become highly aggressive and efficient in attacking its target antigen. Teams conducting research into treatment methods for various chronically inflammatory autoimmune diseases are already using the link between IL-6 and pathogenic T cells today. The basic idea is that blocking IL-6 signaling will also prevent the formation of pathological cells. This applies not only to multiple sclerosis, but also to rheumatoid arthritis, another condition caused by errors in the immune system. Don't Miss: Pathological progression of multiple sclerosis documented for the first time ""The results of our research can clarify why some therapies are successful and why others are not,"" says Korn. ""The various drugs often block only one signaling method. If transmission through dissolved IL-6 is prevented, cluster signaling may still be possible,"" adds Waisman.

A study published in the journal JAMA Neurology examined aquaporin-4, a type of membrane protein in the brain. Using brains donated for scientific research, researchers at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) discovered a correlation between the prevalence of aquaporin-4 among older people who did not suffer from Alzheimer's as compared to those who had the disease. See Also: Why do people with Alzheimer's stop recognizing their loved ones? ""It suggests that aquaporin-4 might be a useful target in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease,"" said senior author Jeffrey Iliff, PhD, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine in the OHSU School of Medicine. ""However, we aren't under any illusion that if we could just fix this one thing, then we'd be able to cure Alzheimer's Disease."" Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, most often associated with aging, causing problems with memory, thinking and behavior. It is the leading cause of dementia worldwide and is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The disease has no known cure but there are treatments available for some of its symptoms. Learn More: Alzheimer s disease: Plaques impair memory formation during sleep Aquaporin-4 is a key part of a brain-wide network of channels, collectively known as the glymphatic system, that permits cerebral-spinal fluid from outside the brain to wash away proteins such as amyloid and tau that build up within the brain. These proteins tend to accumulate in the brains of some people suffering from Alzheimer's, which may play a role in destroying nerve cells in the brain over time. ""This system, and the failure of the system, may be one of many things that goes wrong in people with Alzheimer's disease,"" Iliff said. The study closely examined 79 brains donated through the Oregon Brain Bank, a part of the OHSU Layton Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Center. They were separated into three groups: People younger than 60 without a history of neurological disease; people older than 60 with a history of Alzheimer's; and people older than 60 without Alzheimer's. Researchers found that in the brains of younger people and older people without Alzheimer's, the aquaporin-4 protein was well organized, lining the blood vessels of the brain. However within the brains of people with Alzheimer's, the aquaporin-4 protein appeared disorganized, which may reflect an inability of these brains to efficiently clear away wastes like amyloid beta.

A genetic diagnosis for more than 95 per cent of patients is achievable with a new cystic fibrosis (CFTR) gene analysis kit developed by Elucigene Diagnostics, a leading developer and distributor of prenatal and human genetics diagnostics, in partnership with Congenica, a leader in genomic analysis and interpretation. The  all-in-one  kit allows sample processing, analysis with next generation sequencing (NGS) and variant interpretation streamlining the diagnostic process.  Dr Mark Street-Docherty, Commercial Manager for Elucigene Diagnostics, says:  Congenica has produced a bespoke analysis and reporting pipeline to support customers using our new targeted NGS kit for CFTR gene analysis.  The Congenica and Elucigene partnership will provide support to CFTR diagnostics, reporting only clinically relevant information, and therefore simplifying analysis associated with competitor whole genome approaches.  Congenica s Sapientia  platform will form part of our offering to the customer, enabling seamless sample processing and analysis.  Craig Taylor, Head of Business Development for Congenica, says:  We re very excited about partnering with Elucigene and introducing Sapientia to clinical labs around the world, enabling them to benefit from the same interpretation and analysis platform employed by leading NHS Hospitals in the UK. This partnership illustrates the flexibility of Sapientia, which can be customized according to partner needs."" Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder affecting approximately one in every 2,500 live births in Caucasians. It is due to mutations in a single gene (CFTR) that controls the movement of water and chloride ions across the cell membrane.  People affected by the disease experience a build-up of thickened mucus in their lungs and other organs, leading to challenging life-limiting symptoms.  Additionally, some male carriers of the condition experience reduced fertility (azoospermia) due to the congenital bilateral absences of the vas deferens (CBAVD). The CFTR gene analysis test meets the needs for fertility testing.  Over 2,000 DNA sequence variants have been identified within the CFTR gene, of which approximately 250 are classified as disease causing. Knowing the exact variant is vital, as the patient s symptoms and response to drug treatment can vary widely depending on which mutation affects the CFTR gene. As such, this test will enable the development of personalised disease management for patients. The new product is the first in Elucigene s range to embrace next generation sequencing. Elucigene has developed probes specifically designed to deeply sequence, with higher confidence, the areas of the CFTR gene where the targeted variants occur. This has increased the detection rate from between 85 to 95 per cent to over 99 per cent for some populations. The test uses a bespoke version of Sapientia including a bioinformatics pipeline that filters out non-pathogenic mutations and returns the pathogenic variant. Once the variant is identified, scientific literature regarding the consequences of that exact mutation on the patient s phenotype and condition is made readily accessible through the platform for clinicians to consult.   Bringing this new kit to Elucigene s international customer base will provide a better picture of the distribution of the variants within different populations, allowing the development of personalised medicine.

The findings may shed light on factors in other cancers that influence their sensitivity to chemotherapy, according to a report in Nature. Cancers of the testes are known as germ cell tumors (germ cells produce sperm and eggs). In 2016, about 8,720 new cases are expected in the U.S., with about 380 deaths. Although they are rare, primary testicular germ cell tumors are the most common solid cancers in young men. Most of the tumors are highly sensitive to chemotherapy, and more than 80 percent of patients with germ cell tumors are cured, even when the cancer has metastasized. However, a significant number become chemotherapy-resistant, and about 10 percent of patients with metastatic germ cell tumors die as a result. Previous studies of the genomes of testicular tumors revealed mutations and chromosome damage, but haven t pinpointed specific alterations or events linked to chemosensitivity or resistance. The new research was carried out by scientists led by Eliezer Van Allen, MD, of Dana-Farber and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Christopher Sweeney, MBBS, of Dana-Farber. In a comprehensive search for the critical genomic and molecular features of these cancers, the scientists analyzed samples of 59 tumors from 49 patients treated between 1997 and 2014 at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) over a period. The samples were studied with whole-exome DNA sequencing and RNA transcriptome analysis, and the findings were correlated with clinical outcomes data. Although mutated genes are the main drivers of many cancers,  we didn t find any one gene that really explains  the formation of testicular cancers, said Sweeney. One feature of the tumors that had been previously reported was a gain of extra DNA copies on one arm of chromosome 12, in a segment labeled 12p. Chromosomes carry two versions, or alleles, of DNA, one from each parent. In the new study, however, the scientists found there were many chromosome changes with multiple parts of the genome having gain of one parental allele while simultaneously losing a copy of the other parental allele   a type of chromosomal damage called reciprocal loss of heterozygosity (RLOH). The gain and loss of DNA copies shows that the tumors  chromosomes  are profoundly deranged,  said Van Allen, and represents  a hallmark feature we hadn t noticed before.  This abnormality maybe linked to the development of germ cell tumors and cause them to be sensitive to chemotherapy, Van Allen said, but exactly how it does so remains to be discovered. The analysis revealed another feature of the chemosensitive germ cell tumors   they possessed intact copies of the p53 gene. This gene directs cells to make a tumor-suppressor protein that clamps down on renegade cells so they can t form tumors. Many cancers contain mutated or lost p53 genes, indicating they have lost this protective factor. Moreover, the researchers discovered that in contrast to most types of cancer, testicular tumor cells are already poised on the brink of self-destruction by apoptosis. Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is the body s quality control process that gets rid of unneeded and dangerously abnormal cells. Many cancers have evolved strategies for blocking the cell s orders to self-destruct. The study results suggest that most testicular tumors may be highly susceptible to chemotherapy because their cells are already highly  primed  for apoptotic death, although why this is so hasn t been determined. In another part of the study, the scientists studied 13 germ cell tumor samples taken from five patients over time, spanning from before they underwent treatment to after the tumors became drug-resistant. As the cancers progressed, they showed increases in chromosomal abnormalities seen in all the tumors. The cells of the germ cell tumors also became more  differentiated    a trait that s usually associated with less-aggressive cancers; this observation remains a puzzle, the authors said, but may explain the resistance of these tumors to chemotherapy. Because of their rarity, germ cell tumors haven t been as intensively studied as other forms of cancer, and research funding is more scarce, Sweeney said. The new study, he said,  gives us insights into germ cell tumor biology that haven t been found to this degree and provide a strong base to explore these very interesting findings further.

Current testing for genetic disorders on the NHS is done through the Combined Test, which is significantly less accurate than NIPT. This results in many women who are incorrectly assessed as being  at risk  for fetal anomalies choosing to undergo an invasive diagnostic procedure, such as amniocentesis, which carries a risk of miscarriage. However, the availability of a safer and highly accurate non-invasive blood test on the NHS, such as Premaitha s IONA  test, is likely to result in a dramatic reduction in the number of women subjected to such invasive procedures. Premaitha expects NIPT to be rolled out across the NHS to high risk women over the next three years. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha, commented:  I am delighted that the UK Government is committed to making the process of screening for fetal anomalies a safer one. Through more accurate screening with non-invasive prenatal tests, such as the IONA  test, we will significantly reduce the number of women being referred for follow-up invasive diagnostic procedures. As the developer of the UK s leading non-invasive prenatal test, Premaitha looks forward to continuing its work with the NHS to make the IONA  test   which is already offered in over 50 NHS institutions -  more widely available. We hope that the NHS will seek to adopt only NIPT solutions of the highest certificated quality and that, in time, NIPT will be available to all women on the NHS and not just those perceived to be at the highest risk.  *High-risk refers to pregnant women with a 1:150 chance of having a pregnancy affected by Down s syndrome.","Published: December 1, 2016"

Learn More: Delivery strategies of chemotherapy to the central nervous systemThe only method that has been capable of overcoming all these conditions is based on the use of ultrasound (sound whose frequency is higher than the range of human hearing) after drugs are administered with an independent intravenous injection of lipid-coated gas microbubbles (which are completely innocuous). Like a laser, the ultrasound is focused on a specific region of the brain, where the microbubbles begin to oscillate and increase in size due to their interaction with the acoustic waves. When these tiny bubbles reach the critical size of 8 microns, the blood-brain barrier near to them opens, allowing the medicine circulating in the blood to pass through. This technique has been used successfully for over ten years, but it does have a disadvantage: the drugs move through the entire circulatory system and reach organs where they are not needed, causing adverse effects. However, it appears that scientists at the Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging Laboratory (UEIL) at New York's Columbia University have found the solution. Don't Miss: A new approach to visualize drug delivery to the central nervous system""We've made a step forward by incorporating the substance we're interested in into the lipid coating of the microbubbles. This makes the substance stay adhered to the microbubbles and prevents it circulating freely through the body,"" SINC was told by the physicist Carlos Sierra, a UEIL researcher who receives a grant from A Coru a's Berri  Foundation and the lead author of the paper on this new advance, published in the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism. With this technique, the microbubbles flow through the entire body with the potential drug adhered to them, but only release it in the area of the brain where it is required, where the effect of the ultrasound causes them to rupture and open the blood-brain barrier. ""It does all this, while being non-invasive, reversible and completely safe,"" Sierra stresses. So far, the researchers have proven the efficacy of their technique on mice. They chose a fluorescent molecule called 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein and confirmed that it was reaching the brain without affecting other parts of the animal. At the same time, they identified the acoustic pressure thresholds from which the substance is guaranteed to reach its target in vivo. ""Defining these parameters means we can think about how to transfer the technique to human patients, although it has to be tested on monkeys first,"" the researcher explains, adding that ""it could be applied to diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's diseases, brain tumours, strokes, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where we expect to see a very significant rise in the efficacy of treatment and a considerable reduction in side-effects.""

Researchers at Stockholm University and Brooklyn College have combined knowledge from the fields of artificial intelligence, ethology and the psychology of learning to solve several problems concerning the behavior and intelligence of animals. See Also: Brain size matters when it comes to animal self-control Animals are often very effective; an oystercatcher opens mussels quickly, a baboon takes every opportunity to steal food from tourists or a rat navigates with ease between the bins in a park. Previously these behaviors have been considered to be inherited instincts, even though it is well known that animals have great learning abilities. Researchers from Stockholm University and Brooklyn College have now created an associative learning model that explains how effective behaviors can arise. This means that an animal does not only learn that the last step of a behavior chain, the one that is rewarding, is valuable. An animal can learn that all steps towards the reward are valuable. ""Our learning model may also explain how advanced behaviors are created at an individual level. Behaviors like self-control, chimpanzee tool use as well as other phenomena like animals having certain expectations of life"", says Magnus Enquist, professor of ethology at Stockholm University. ""Similar models are used in the field of artificial intelligence, but they have been ignored in animal studies."" Learn More: Crows are smarter than you think Since the 1970s it has been known that animals weigh the cost of a certain behavior against the profit and that they, to a high degree, make optimal decisions, which is assumed to be genetically determined. The research group's new model deals not only with learning, it also takes into account the idea that what animals are able to learn can be genetically regulated. ""Young animals are often a bit clumsy, while adult animals are extremely skilled. A small cub does not even consider a vole as food, while an adult fox is an expert vole catcher"", says Johan Lind associate professor of ethology at Stockholm University. ""Our model shows how genetic regulation of learning can influence the development of species-specific behavior and intelligence since evolution can affect curiosity and the speed of learning among other things.""

New approved pharmacological interventions are mainly absent, despite intensive research on the subject. See Also: Depression's physical source discovered; potential for new treatmentsResearchers at Karolinska Institutet have characterized the role of the enzyme CYP2C19 in depression and functional and morphological changes in the brain. The enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of many neuroactive compounds, including antidepressants, and is located in the fetal brain and adult liver. ""We previously found that the CYP2C19 gene is expressed not only in the liver, but also in fetal brain. We described that transgenic mice that overexpress the human CYP2C19 in fetal life, in adult life have smaller hippocampus as well as an altered composition of nerve cells in the hippocampus and suffer from a higher level of anxiety- and depression-like behavior as compared to the wild type mice"", says Magnus Ingelman-Sundberg, who has been leader of the study together with Marin Jukic. The hippocampus is a central part of the brain for control of emotions and stress, and the finding of altered structure and function of the hippocampus following overexpression of CYP2C19 was in the starting point for the new study. The researchers now have examined to what extent these findings in mice can be extrapolated to humans. Related: Patients with recurrent depression have smaller hippocampi Such analysis was facilitated by the fact that four percent of the population lacks the CYP2C19 enzyme, while thirty percent have increased expression of the same enzyme. By analysis of MRI-based measurements of the hippocampal volume and by analyzing epidemiological statistics for suicide as well as by evaluating tests of depressive mood from thousands of people, researchers found that the absence of the enzyme was associated with a larger volume of the hippocampus. ""These persons showed a lesser degree of depressed mode. Conversely, we found that increased activity of CYP2C19 was associated with higher suicidal incidences in depressed patients"", Marin Jukic says. The results, presented in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, show that the propensity for depression and hippocampal function in part is programmed in fetal life. Fetuses lacking CYP2C19 enzyme have a lower risk of depression and have larger hippocampi in adulthood.

Related: CTE is confirmed as a unique disease that can be definitively diagnosed In a report on the study that used positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI, published in JAMA Neurology, the researchers highlighted the value of PET imaging to monitor a marker of injury and repair in the brains of NFL players and athletes in other contact sports. The new research builds on a rising tide of anecdotal evidence and a few scientific studies suggesting that people with repeated concussive head injuries incurred while playing football, hockey or boxing are at higher-than-normal risk of developing the neurodegenerative disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is associated with memory deficits, confusion, poor decision-making and later onset of dementia. However, because CTE is often only diagnosed at autopsy, and because similar symptoms may occur in people without repeated head injuries, researchers, including those at Johns Hopkins Medicine, have been developing methods to better visualize tissue damage in the living brain to demonstrate better cause and effect. Learn More: Experimental imaging agent reveals concussion-linked brain disease in living brain ""The exciting part of our new findings is that we now believe we have a useful tool to monitor the brains of NFL players and athletes in other contact sports,"" says Jennifer Coughlin, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins. ""We can measure TSPO, a PET biomarker of brain injury, in these younger players, and we can now begin to follow it over time to see if the brain is repairing itself or not."" In early 2015, the Johns Hopkins research team published PET imaging results showing higher levels of this same biomarker in the brains of nine elderly former NFL players compared to control participants. However, since they initially studied elderly players who were many years from play, the researchers were unable to tell if the findings were also linked to aging and vascular disease, independent of past NFL play. For the new study, the researchers collected PET imaging data from 11 men without a history of concussion and compared the scans to those of 12 young NFL players, all of whom were still active or had retired within the past 12 years. All players had a self-reported history of at least one concussion. These players were an average age of 31 years old. About 80 percent were Caucasian and 20 percent were African-American. The control participants were matched to the players by body mass index, age and education level. See Also: Neuroimaging technique identifies concussion-related brain disease in living brain The PET imaging was acquired using a radioactive chemical that binds to translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which is normally found at low levels in healthy brain tissue. Since TSPO is increased during cellular response to brain injury, high levels of the TSPO signal on each PET scan can indicate where injury and reparative processes occur. The researchers found higher radiotracer binding to TSPO in players compared to control participants in eight of the 12 brain regions studied. These regions included the hippocampus, a region functionally involved in memory. Separately, the researchers examined data from MRI scans to look for structural changes in the brains of the study participants. They found no evidence of brain tissue loss in players compared to control participants in any of the brain regions examined, yet they did find some evidence of white matter changes in the players' brains. ""We suspect that when the brain moves during a hard hit, it causes a shearing injury of the white matter fibers that travel across the brain,"" says Coughlin. Coughlin cautioned that there are some limitations to the imaging technique. For example, the radiotracer used in the PET scans doesn't work well in people with a specific variation in the gene that codes for TSPO protein, which occurs in about one in 10 people of European descent. Also, the researchers observed that use of creatine supplements taken by athletes to improve performance may interfere with the imaging results, necessitating further study of this effect before including participants taking creatine.

The findings provide insight into the role of the brain's internal time keeping system in the development of mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which have been associated with disturbed daily (circadian) rhythms. See Also: New findings link abnormalities in circadian rhythms to neurochemical changes in specific neurotransmitters ""Our data show that perturbing circadian rhythms in otherwise totally undisturbed animals is enough to cause behaviors similar to human depression,"" commented first author Dr. Dominic Landgraf of the University of California, San Diego. Inherent circadian clocks help us function throughout the day, by telling us when to sleep, wake and eat, as well as by synchronizing our bodily processes. ""It is perhaps not surprising that disruptions of our natural synchronization can have heavy impacts on our physical and mental health,"" Dr. Landgraf added. However, until now researchers did not know if disturbed circadian rhythms were a cause or consequence of mood disorders. In the new study, a team led by David K. Welsh has shown for the first time a causal relationship between functioning circadian clocks and mood regulation. The researchers developed a new genetic mouse model by suppressing Bmal1, one of the master genes that drives circadian rhythms, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which serves as the brain's central clock regulator. Diminished Bmal1 expression reduced the strength of the clock signals produced by the SCN by about 80%. Targeting this particular brain region allowed the researchers to focus on the specific effects of the SCN circadian rhythms, and to avoid alterations in other brain regions that have confounded previous studies. Learn More: Deconstructing mental illness through ultradian rhythms In behavioral tests, mice with reduced circadian rhythms, relative to control mice, were less motivated to escape an uncomfortable situation, which is commonly interpreted as despair or hopelessness in the animal. The mice also showed increased aversion to brightly lit areas, considered to be an indicator of anxiety-like behavior. In addition to the altered behavior, mice with reduced circadian rhythms gained more weight than normal mice, even though they consumed the same amount of food. This finding suggests that disrupted SCN circadian rhythms could lead to metabolic abnormalities observed in many depressed patients. Importantly, the findings show that even though the SCN does not directly regulate mood, alterations to circadian rhythms in the SCN are sufficient to cause depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice.

In an animal model, the patch was shown to be more effective at preventing thrombosis than traditional methods of drug delivery. The work was done by researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Thrombosis occurs when blood clots disrupt the normal flow of blood in the body, which can cause severe health problems such as pulmonary embolism, heart attack or stroke. Current treatments often rely on the use of blood thinners, such as Heparin, which require patients to test their blood on a regular basis in order to ensure proper dosages. Too large a dose can cause problems such as spontaneous hemorrhaging, while doses that are too small may not be able to prevent a relapse of thrombosis.  Our goal was to generate a patch that can monitor a patient s blood and release additional drugs when necessary; effectively, a self-regulating system,  says Zhen Gu, co-corresponding author on a paper describing the work. Gu is an associate professor in the joint biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC.  Two years ago, I spoke with Zhen Gu about the significant clinical need for precise delivery of blood thinners,  says Caterina Gallippi, a co-corresponding author and associate professor in the joint biomedical engineering program.  We, together with Professor Yong Zhu in the mechanical engineering department at NC State, assembled a research team and invented this patch.  The patch incorporates microneedles made of a polymer that consists of hyaluronic acid (HA) and the drug Heparin. The polymer has been modified to be responsive to thrombin, an enzyme that initiates clotting in the blood. When elevated levels of thrombin enzymes in the bloodstream come into contact with the microneedle, the enzymes break the specific amino acid chains that bind the Heparin to the HA, releasing the Heparin into the blood stream.  The more thrombin there is in the bloodstream, the more Heparin is needed to reduce clotting,  says Yuqi Zhang, a Ph.D. student in Gu s lab and co-lead author of the paper.  So we created a disposable patch in which the more thrombin there is in the blood stream, the more Heparin is released.   We will further enhance the loading amount of drug in the patch. The amount of Heparin in a patch can be tailored to a patient s specific needs and replaced daily, or less often, as needed,  says Jicheng Yu, a Ph.D. student in Gu s lab and the other co-lead author of the paper.  But the amount of Heparin being released into the patient at any given moment will be determined by the thrombin levels in the patient s blood.  The research team tested the HA-Heparin smart patch in a mouse model. In the experiments, subjects were injected with large doses of thrombin, which would result in fatal blood clotting of the lungs if left untreated. In the first experiment, mice were either left untreated, given a shot of Heparin, or given the HA-Heparin smart patch. The mice were injected with thrombin 10 minutes later. Fifteen minutes after the thrombin injection, only the mice who received no treatment died. In the second experiment, the thrombin was injected six hours after treatment. Fifteen minutes after the thrombin injection, all of the mice with the HA-Heparin smart patch were fine, but around 80 percent of the mice that received the Heparin shot had died.  We re excited about the possibility of using a closed-loop, self-regulating smart patch to help treat a condition that affects thousands of people every year, while hopefully also driving down treatment costs,  Gu says.  This paper represents a good first step, and we re now looking for funding to perform additional preclinical testing.  Source: Story from North Carolina State University.

The researchers designed the oral delivery system, which contains micro- and nanoparticles, to carry a protein therapy that treats hemophilia B. There are approximately 400,000 people worldwide living with either hemophilia A or hemophilia B, both caused by a missing protein in their blood. Hemophilia B is caused by a missing or defective factor IX, a clotting protein. The researchers describe their system in the Nov. 30 issue of the International Journal of Pharmaceutics. The bleeding disorder affects people throughout the world, but global accessibility to therapy is limited by cost, the need for trained medical personnel and possible complications associated with needle-based drug administration. Thousands of people endure multiple injections weekly to keep symptoms, such as excessive bleeding and pain in the joints, at bay and prevent future joint disease.   While an oral delivery platform will be beneficial to all hemophilia B patients, patients in developing countries will benefit the most,  said Sarena Horava, the study s lead author who is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Cockrell School s McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering and a National Science Foundation graduate research fellow.  In many developing countries, the median life expectancy for hemophilia patients is 11 years due to the lack of access to treatment, but our new oral delivery of factor IX can now overcome these issues and improve the worldwide use of this therapy.  Horava, who now works at Triton Systems, collaborated with co-author and co-inventor Nicholas A. Peppas, the director of UT Austin s Institute for Biomaterials, Drug Delivery and Regenerative Medicine and a Cockrell School professor who also holds appointments in the Dell Medical School and School of Pharmacy. Katie J. Moy, an undergraduate student in the Cockrell School s Department of Biomedical Engineering, is also a co-author on the study. Peppas said that alleviating the burden of injections for children was the impetus for the research project, which started about nine years ago.    My most pressing concern was the treatment of younger patients who suffer from hemophilia and who have to apply injections every two days,  Peppas said.  The original idea of the project was conceived when Dr. Lisa Brannon-Peppas, who at the time was a biomedical engineering faculty member, discussed with me the side effects of the disease and the psychological impact it has on mothers.  Peppas and Horava s work has been patented and builds upon their published and patented system for the oral delivery of human factor IX (hFIX), a prophylactic treatment for hemophilia B patients. That system was successful in transporting hFIX, and it was able to deliver adequate levels of the drug to the target site in the body. The biggest challenge in delivering hFIX is that it is extremely delicate and unstable in the body s various pH environments. The researchers  new and improved system is designed to capitalize on the body s pH and changes in enzymes inside the gastrointestinal tract for a smooth delivery. As it moves through the body, the particle-containing capsule resists the major gastric enzyme to remain intact while in the stomach, providing protection for the encapsulated drug. In the small intestine, the capsule begins to swell with the increase in pH and is then degraded by the major intestinal enzyme, slowly releasing the drug over time.  Based on the current capabilities of this system, approximately two capsules would be equivalent to one injection,  Horava said.  However, we anticipate that we will make further improvements to the delivery capacity of the oral delivery system and therefore decrease the capsule amount.

The International Phenome Centre Network (IPCN) will greatly increase global research capabilities in the field of phenomics. Through comprehensive analysis of biological fluids or tissue samples, phenomics examines how our lifestyles and the environment we are exposed to interact with our genes. It can help explain why some people develop disease when others don t. It is widely recognised that people s genes are not enough to explain how disease develops, and that disease prevention, detection and treatment can be improved by understanding the dynamic interactions between our genes, environments, microbiomes, diets and lifestyles, and their expression in diverse individuals and populations. The mission of the IPCN is to better understand how variation in gene-environment interactions affects disease across the lifespan for different populations. Using robust and harmonized data sets representing the world s diverse populations, this research will inform global public health policies and the development of new therapies.  The world is facing an unprecedented confluence of environmental and lifestyle factors that are dramatically increasing the risks of chronic disease, and posing the greatest public health challenges seen in modern times. The International Phenome Centre Network is creating internationally harmonised centres of analytical science focused on understanding gene-environment interactions that underpin disease risk, the comparative biology of major diseases, and addressing unmet healthcare and medical needs,  said Professor Jeremy Nicholson, Director of the MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre (NPC) and Head of Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London. Initiated by the NPC at Imperial College London, the IPCN includes more than a dozen international partners with regional and multi-institutional hubs. Since 2012, the NPC has established best-practice laboratory and research methodologies in phenomics, and the new IPCN will share this knowledge around the globe. If research is conducted in the same, harmonized fashion it makes it easier to combine data sets and compare results. This means that larger, more complex studies can be undertaken than would be otherwise possible, and less complex studies completed much faster than an individual centre could do in isolation.   Phenomic research really is one of the next medical frontiers which can advance our understanding of a whole raft of diseases and conditions,  said Professor Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom.  The way we treat autism, cancers, mental health, stroke, obesity, metabolic diseases and type 2 diabetes could all be revolutionised by research in this area. It is also really good for work to cross international boundaries to find ways of tackling the biggest global public health challenges facing us today faster.   In Singapore, we welcome the launch of the International Phenome Centre Network,  said Professor James Best, Dean, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.  Through this partnership, the Singapore Phenome Centre at Nanyang Technological University will have enhanced opportunity to collaborate internationally. By pooling data obtained with harmonised methodology and by sharing ideas, we will better understand the biochemical abnormalities underlying metabolic disorders such as diabetes.   The WISH program is dedicated to understanding and mapping changes in global health needs and emergent medical and healthcare problems,  said Professor the Lord Ara Darzi of Denham, Director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.  The IPCN is set to take on many of these healthcare challenges, such as obesity, diabetes, cancers and autism, and to create a technological framework for studying the comparative biology of disease at the global scale.

Announcement of the partnership was made during Launch Pad: Pathways to Cancer InnoVAtion, a joint VA/PCF summit held today that brings together world-class oncology experts, corporate and non-profit partners to discuss research, big data, technology and clinical solutions to advance screening, diagnostics and care coordination for cancer and to promote the implementation of best practices across the VA healthcare system.  As part of the summit, PCF announced a $50-million precision oncology initiative to expand prostate cancer clinical research among Veterans to speed the development of new treatment options and cures for prostate cancer patients. The agreement signed today is the first partnership between PCF and VA, and it comes at a time when an estimated 12,000 Veterans each year are diagnosed with prostate cancer, making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer among Veterans. In particular, African-Americans are 64 percent more likely to develop prostate cancer compared to any other race or ethnicity and 2.4 times more likely to die from the disease.  Fighting and treating cancer among our Veterans is a team effort, which is why this Launch Pad event and this partnership are so important,  said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. To effectively serve our Veterans and to keep VA on the cutting edge of medical research, we need government, corporate, and non-profit organizations working together. We are truly grateful to the Prostate Cancer Foundation for this important show of support. Our work together will save Veterans  lives.  The goals of the PCF partnership are to increase the number of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) investigators applying to PCF for funding; increase the number of VHA facilities involved in precision medicine/prostate cancer clinical trials; increase the number of Veterans enrolled in studies, providing veteran specimens or data used in studies as well as increase the number of minorities enrolled in PCF studies; and increase the number of early career scientists working on prostate cancer research.  Our goal is to increase our scientific understanding of prostate cancer among Veterans and to kick-start the development of precision medicine treatments for them, as well as the general population,  said Jonathan W. Simons, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, PCF.  This agreement will open new doors for the research community to work with Veterans facing a life-threatening disease and ultimately reduce the disease burden on America s Veterans.

It s a method they plan to use in new research to help uncover when antioxidant levels rise and fall during the manufacturing process, from raw cocoa beans to chocolate bars.  Our method predicts the antioxidant levels in chocolate in under a minute, compared to the industry standard that can take several hours or even days,  said Xiaonan Lu, an assistant professor in food, nutrition and health in the faculty of land and food systems, who developed the method alongside PhD student Yaxi Hu.  It s not a substitute for the traditional method used at the moment, but it does show a strong correlation for being just as reliable.  The UBC method uses infrared spectroscopy, a technology that can be used to illuminate infrared light onto chocolate samples. The infrared spectra record the chemical composition of each sample, including the amount of polyphenols, micronutrients with high antioxidant properties. The traditional method relies on biochemical tests to read absorbance values and can be quite time consuming and expensive.  Testing for antioxidant levels can give chocolatiers guidance on which cocoa beans to select, or how to improve their processing parameters,  said Hu. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans and is manufactured through several processing stages, including drying, roasting and fermentation of the beans. The UBC food scientists have started to use their method to measure cocoa bean samples from around the world in each stage to determine when antioxidant levels are at their highest and lowest.  If we identify drying as the step that significantly lowers the bean s antioxidant properties, for example, we will want to develop a strategy to reduce the drying time, or drying temperature,  Lu said.

It s truly interesting. Yet, more important findings, medically relevant ones, may be hiding in traits invisible to the eye, even with the best microscope. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are exposing these secrets -- micron-sized bumps and grooves -- and the intricate web of gene mutations possibly behind them in high detail. Their computational genetics work using digital optics could prove useful to understanding debilitating disorders.  When these faint mutations come together, it gives you a ginormous boost in disease risk,  said Hang Lu, a professor who applies engineering and data science to the study of neurology. Neurological disorder: Brain often looks normal  If you look at psychiatric diseases, anything that is relevant to humans, what you see is not that dramatic,  Lu said.  Brains of people who had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or autism don t look physically very different from healthy brains. It s not like they re missing a chunk.  Researchers led by Lu at Georgia Tech s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering have developed algorithms and special microscope slide to expose previously unseen neurological nuances and intricate mutations that may be behind them. But their findings could apply as well to computational genetics research pursuing other diseases such as autoimmune disorders. Lu and former Georgia Tech researcher Adrianna San-Miguel published their latest results on Wednesday, November 23, 2016, in the journal Nature Communications. Their research was funded by the National Institute of General Medicine, and the National Institute on Aging, both agencies of the National Institutes of Health. Seeing dots: Computers spot subtleties  Lu has replaced the fallible human eye with a proficient computer to pin down faintest phenotypes, the geneticist s term for physical traits based on genes. In the latest experiment, nerve proteins were marked to appear as dots on roundworms' undersides for the computer to scan. When mutations occur, the dots can change ever so slightly.  To the naked eye, they re just dots on a dark background,  Lu said. But the computer sees in them phenotypical shifts. Roundworm Caenorbabditis elegans, used in the experiment, helps scientists understand what may be going on in humans, because its nerves share strong similarities with ours. Ultimately, Lu wants the insights gained in studying them to lead to localizing genetic biomarkers for diseases in humans. Synaptic puncta: Glowing green tags The Georgia Tech scientists narrowed their focus to synapses on a single neuron where it connects to muscles. These  synaptic puncta  were tagged with a glowing green protein to form the dots. Some mutations did cause big shifts in dot position and size that the naked eye could actually pick up. And traditionally, forward geneticists -- geneticists who follow changes in phenotypes to see if they can find genes that cause them -- have used their eyes and microscopes to pick out such really obvious changes. But natural limitations on human perception have introduced a bias, Lu said. Her research aims to reduce it to boost the amount of data scientists can gather. Mutant bias: It looks funny Here s how the bias roughly works. Sorting mutants from non-mutants in the lab is usually tedious with the tiny worms, and that has consequences for science.  The normal way of doing it would be to take a little platinum wire and literally go under the microscope, pick up a worm, drug it, mount it on a slide, and then you have to recover it alive, if you think it's interesting,  Lu said. The tedium plus the limited abilities of the human eye lead researchers looking for mutations to single out worms that are markedly odd. Eye-popping phenotypes are namely likely to be caused by genotypic changes, i.e. mutations, so finding a clear phenotype is likely to lead to a successful research outcome. Stochasticity: Not a mutant  As a result, researchers might overlook subtle samples. In addition, amassing enough of them to determine important nuances may prove too difficult to do, and quirks can get in the way, too. For example, a single weird-looking worm might not be a mutant at all.  You can always find a  wildtype  (basically normal worm) that looks nothing at all like a wildtype,  Lu said.  It s just a crazy wildtype. Genotypically, it looks like everybody else, but phenotypically it s so different."" Why? Because nature can be stochastic   sort of random -- and mess up an individual worm, even when there s no mutated gene. Phenospace: A world revealed Looks can deceive the eye, but they re less likely to fool a high-resolution camera connected to a computer and an algorithm that statistically examines faint variations in order to sort mutants from non-mutants. Lu s technique works via a transparent slide with tiny tubes that suck in one worm at a time under the computer's microscope.  Then we freeze the worm for a moment, so we can take its picture,  Lu said.  Then it unfreezes, and it s totally okay.  There s a fork in the tube holding the worm. If the algorithm detects a mutant based on its synaptic puncta pattern in the image   even if this is not visible to the eye   the worm gets sucked down the first path for further study. If it isn t a mutant, it gets sucked down the second path. In the latest experiment, the algorithm analyzed phenotypic variations in the synaptic puncta of large worm populations. Parallel to that, the worms' genomes were analyzed to determine which phenotypical differences may be connected to mutated genes. Then the researchers mapped out genotypes in relation to the differences in phenotypes they underpinned. What was so nuanced before that it was virtually invisible, turned out to be a large, filigree web. Silent affliction: Poor little worm Then there was a particularly lucky find that made for a good metaphor for the study and its potential to advance research. The scientists stumbled upon a very subtle allele   a variation of a gene caused by mutation. The worms that had the allele were real mutants, but no one would have guessed it, because to the eye, they were completely neat and normal. They even behaved normally at first glance, and the researchers thought the computer may have sorted them out as mutants by mistake -- until a hitch turned up.  After they swam for about 40 minutes, they got really, really weak and couldn t swim well anymore,  Lu said. The allele seemed to be associated with some kind of neurological disorder.  Seen as a metaphor, this is an example of how you might identify something that is relevant to a disease but incredibly subtle,  she said,  and you would never have found it using eyes and a microscope.

The core technology behind this CRC risk assessment test was developed by Professor Mark Jenkins and his research team at the University s Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Results from preliminary modelling studies were first published online in Future Oncology on 1 February 2016, in a paper entitled  Quantifying the utility of single nucleotide polymorphisms to guide colorectal cancer screening,  2016 Feb: 12(4), 503-13. This simulated case-control study of 1 million patients indicated that a panel of 45 known susceptibility SNPs can stratify the population into clinically useful CRC risk categories. In practice, the technology could be used to identify people at high risk for CRC who should be subjected to intensive screening which can ultimately reduce the risk of occurrence and death from the disease. Those identified as low risk of CRC can be spared expensive and invasive screening, thereby preventing adverse events and saving money, as it is not justified. A scientific validation study supporting this work is nearing completion and is expected to be published within the next six (6) months. The fundamental technology is similar to the BREVAGenplus test and will fit synergistically into the Company s existing infrastructure and processes. The CRC test represents a significant milestone for the Company as it seeks to diversify its product pipeline and become a key player in the SNP-based cancer risk assessment landscape. The commercial development strategy for the CRC test will benefit from the BREVAGenplus experience in the marketplace. The terms and conditions of the Agreement are confidential, however, Genetic Technologies will be responsible for the commercial development of the test. In addition, as part of the Agreement, The University of Melbourne and Genetic Technologies will embark on a robust, ongoing research collaboration enabling the Company to leverage the University s renowned world-class expertise in SNPbased risk assessment and risk model development.  This is an exciting time for the Company as we commence this strategic alliance with The University of Melbourne. The relationship with the University is comprehensive and highlights our overall corporate mission to become a leader in the genomics focused oncology diagnostics  industry while enhancing our pipeline of risk assessment products,  commented Eutillio Buccilli, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Genetic Technologies Limited. Excluding skin cancers, CRC is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. Overall, the lifetime risk for developing CRC is about 1 in 20, (5%). CRC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both are combined. As with breast cancer, early diagnosis is key. When diagnosed at an early stage (before the disease has spread outside the colon), the relative 5- year survival rate for CRC is 92% and 87% for rectal cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, while the respective survival rate for late stage (metastatic) disease is much lower, at 11% and 12%, respectively. In fact, the majority of CRC cases are preventable by early detection and removal of precancerous polyps. Regular CRC screening is therefore, one of the most powerful weapons for preventing CRC. The main challenge with current CRC screening methodologies is compliance (the patient actually doing and completing the test), with the NCI stating that compliance in one of the large RCTs was ~47%, theoretically halving the impact of screening on CRC mortality. The most common CRC screening tool is a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) or visual inspection of the bowel by endoscopy (Colonoscopy or Sigmoidoscopy). FOBT-based-screening has been shown to reduce CRC mortality by three very large randomised controlled trials, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). FOBT screening has a fairly high sensitivity but low positive predictive value meaning a patient who returns a positive FOBT, then goes on to receive a diagnostic colonoscopy. Colonoscopy may be used as a primary screening tool in certain patients, but the cost and the infrastructure required to use it as a primary tool are considered too prohibitive. As with breast cancer, the more the physician can tailor a patient s screening program to their level of risk of developing CRC, the greater impact screening will have on the disease. The development of a much improved CRC risk assessment tool has the potential to provide a significant health benefit by better targeting the existing screening modalities and improving compliance among those patients most at risk of developing CRC. Risk stratification would also likely influence the age a patient will start screening and the frequency.  The licensing Agreement with Genetic Technologies provides us with a wonderful opportunity to work with an organisation that is a leader in the field of genomics for precision public health. Furthermore, Genetic Technologies provides the University with an established platform that will facilitate the transition of our scientific work into the clinical arena,  commented Mark Jenkins, Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at The University of Melbourne.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cracking-the-code-of-a-deadly-virus-191457,Cracking the Code of a Deadly Virus Researchers have exploited weaknesses in VEEV s genetic code  creating a far less deadly variant   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an unforgiving killer of horses, donkeys and zebras, resulting in mortality as high as 80 percent of infected animals. It causes rapid, catastrophic swelling of the brain and spinal cord, leading to severe neurological symptoms and in many cases sudden death. The virus can also infect humans, with similar results. The U.S. and Soviet Union both weaponized VEEV during the Cold War, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to classify VEEV as a category B pathogen. A research team led by the University of Maryland has exploited a weakness in VEEV s genetic code, resulting in a far less deadly mutant version of the virus when tested in laboratory mice. The new discovery could enable the development of a vaccine and other drugs to combat VEEV. The findings were published online November 16, 2016 in the Journal of Virology. Like many other dangerous viruses, VEEV has RNA as its genetic material instead of DNA. Because a similar weakness exists in RNA viruses that pose serious health risks to humans such as HIV, Zika, chikungunya and others the discovery could advance the development of treatments for these viruses as well.  RNA viruses tend to cause acute infections,  said Jonathan Dinman, professor and chair of the UMD Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, who is the senior author on the research paper.  You either fight them off quickly, like the common cold, or they overwhelm you, like Ebola.  Dinman and his colleagues exploited a mechanism known as programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which allows RNA viruses to pack a larger amount of genetic information into a relatively short sequence of RNA. By prompting an infected cell to read the same sequence of RNA in two different phases, PRF allows a virus to create two different proteins instead of one. The researchers created a mutant version of VEEV with a disrupted PRF mechanism, which impaired the virus  ability to create a second protein from a specific section of RNA. Tests in cultured cells did not reveal a large difference in the rate of virus production. But when the researchers tested the mutant virus in laboratory mice, they saw a dramatic increase in the rate at which infected mice survived the disease.  With some simple mutations, we compromised VEEV s ability to be a virulent virus,  said Joe Kendra, a biological sciences graduate student at UMD and the lead author of the study.  This result shows that PRF might be a therapeutic target for other viruses. If we can confirm that the mutant virus confers immunity, opening the door to a vaccine, that will be very exciting.  In addition to a higher survival rate of mice infected with mutant VEEV, the researchers also noted a lower incidence of the virus accumulating in brain tissues. Dinman, Kendra and their co-authors suspect that the missing protein in the mutant virus plays a role in the virus  ability to cross the blood-brain barrier an essential step to cause brain swelling.  It s interesting that the virus uses PRF to survive, but we can also manipulate that mechanism to work against it,  said study co-author Yousuf Khan, an undergraduate biological sciences major and Goldwater Scholar at UMD.  This is a new way to target viruses and make vaccines. It opens up a lot of new research questions.  According to Dinman, the finding is particularly encouraging in light of the challenge posed by climate change, as viral diseases begin to extend their range north beyond the tropics.  So many of these diseases are borne by mosquitoes. Chikungunya is now established in the Caribbean, and Zika has been found in two counties in Florida,  Dinman said.  These viruses are on our doorstep. But these results give us hope. Developing a vaccine takes a long time, but with a concerted effort across government and academic labs, we have a good chance.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/biologists-discover-origin-of-stomata-188481,Biologists Discover Origin of Stomata Researchers discover genetic mechanism similar in flowering plants and mosses is a result of evolutionary conservation  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An international team has discovered a genetic mechanism that is responsible for the development of stomata - microscopic valves on the surface of plants that facilitate the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor. The researchers discovered this mechanism, which was previously known in flowering plants like Arabidopsis thaliana, in the moss Physcomitrella patens and found similarities between the two, implying that it already existed in the last common ancestor of mosses and flowering plants. The team was led by the biologists Professor Ralf Reski from the University of Freiburg/Germany and Professor David J. Beerling from the University of Sheffield/UK. The results were published in the journal Nature Plants. Stomata came into being more than 400 million years ago, when the first plants colonized the hitherto hostile land masses. Because stomata facilitate an efficient gas exchange with the atmosphere, they enabled the spread of plants and the subsequent evolution of our complex ecosystems. In contrast to more developed vascular plants with roots, stems, leaves, and vasculature, which are necessary for the transport of water and nutrients, it remained unclear in the case of mosses, which have no vasculature, which genes are responsible for the development of stomata. The research team found that an interaction between the two proteins PpSMF1 and PpSCRM1 in Physcomitrella is the trigger responsible for the development of stomata in moss. When they deleted one of these genes, moss developed without stomata. The researchers found that this mechanism is similar to the interaction of the two proteins MUTE and FAMA, which triggers the development of stomata in Arabidopsis. The genes which encode these proteins therefore originate from the last common ancestor of mosses and flowering plants - the prehistoric plants which left the fresh water to dwell on rocks and thus laid the foundation for the development of all current ecosystems on the mainland. ""Our results show that the development of stomata originated over 400 million years ago and predated the development of roots, stems, and leaves,"" explains Reski. ""This evolutionary innovation fundamentally changed the global cycles of carbon, water, and energy and thus was a prerequisite for all life forms on the mainland, including us humans.""

Pluripotent stem cells, on the contrary, do not age and have increased mechanism to maintain the integrity of their proteins. Researchers from CECAD, the Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research based at the University of Cologne, defined the mechanisms underlying increased protein quality control of pluripotent stem cells. Then, the researchers mimicked these mechanisms in somatic tissues of model organisms to extend lifespan and delay age-related diseases. Their research was published in Nature Communications on November 28. The survival of an organism is linked to its ability to maintain the quality of the cellular proteins. A group of proteins called chaperones facilitate the folding of proteins and are essential to regulating the quality of the cellular protein content. This ability declines during the aging process, inducing the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins that can lead to cell death or malfunction. Several neurodegenerative age-related disorders such as Alzheimer s, Parkinson s or Huntington s disease are linked to a decline in protein quality control.  Human pluripotent stem cells can replicate indefinitely while maintaining their undifferentiated state and, therefore, are immortal in culture. This capacity necessarily demands avoidance of any imbalance in the integrity of their protein content.  There is one chaperone system, the TRiC/CCT-complex that is responsible for folding about 10% of all the cellular proteins. By studying how pluripotent stem cells maintain the quality of their proteome, we found that this complex is regulated by the subunit CCT8,  says David Vilchez, senior author of the study.  Then, we discovered a way to increase the assembly and activity of the TRiC/CCT complex in somatic tissues by modulating this single subunit, CCT8. The increase resulted in prolonged lifespan and delay of age-related diseases of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans,  he adds.   For this study, we combined the results from human pluripotent stem cells and C. elegans, to have both in vitro and in vivo models, providing a more convincing approach. Our results show that expressing CCT8 as the key subunit of the complex is sufficient to boost the assembly of the whole system,  says Alireza Noormohammadi, one of the first authors of the paper.  It is very interesting that expressing this single subunit is enough to enhance protein quality and extend longevity, even in older animals,  adds Amirabbas Khodakarami, the other main author.  One of our next steps will be to test our findings in mice,  outlines David Vilchez.  We hope to make further progress in understanding aging diseases and to get closer to finding therapies against diseases like Huntington s or Alzheimer s. CCT8 could be a candidate to correct deficiencies in age-related diseases associated with protein dysfuntions.  Source: Story from University of Cologne.

For example, if we are exposed to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses that carry foreign molecules on their surface, the body reacts with an immune response. In contrast, cells are ""tolerant"" of the body's own molecules. This state of unresponsiveness, or anergy, is regulated by a cellular signal, a calcium-controlled switch that was known to control also many brain functions. Neuroscientists from Heidelberg University and immunologists of Heidelberg University Hospital identified this signal. The research results were published in the  Journal of Cell Biology . The research work was led by Prof. Dr Hilmar Bading from the Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences working together with the research group of Prof. Dr Yvonne Samstag, Director of the Molecular Immunology Section. The Heidelberg research team identified a calcium signal in the cell nucleus of human T lymphocytes as a decision-maker in the immune system. They showed that a nuclear calcium signal is required for the immune reaction that T-cells trigger after contact with molecules foreign to the body. This study was inspired by previous work of Prof. Bading on the function of calcium in the cell nucleus. The neuroscientist demonstrated that the messenger calcium, after invading the cell nucleus, acts as a master switch in the nervous system. The nuclear calcium signal triggers genetic programmes that control virtually all of the brain's adaptive capabilities, including memory, chronic pain and neuroprotection   a process that prevents damaged nerve cells from dying. ""When we started our study, we thought that nuclear calcium may play a similar role in the immune system as in the brain by activating a specific immune reaction gene programme,"" says Prof. Bading. ""But we were surprised to see that human T lymphocytes became tolerant, i.e. shifted towards an anergic state, as soon as we switched off the nuclear calcium signal."" According to Hilmar Bading, this discovery has important implications for the development of novel types of immunosuppressive therapies. After organ transplants, for example, it is common to use drugs that completely block the immune reaction. Based on this new research, it may be possible to redirect the immune reaction towards tolerance   described by the Heidelberg research team as ""pro-tolerance immunosuppression"". Prof. Bading indicates this may be possible to achieve by blocking nuclear calcium in activated immune cells. Source: Story from Universit t Heidelberg.

The research study will enroll thousands of appropriately consented pediatric patients and their families, and has the goal of investigating potential links between an individual s disease and his or her genetic profile. The RGC will conduct whole exome sequencing, which looks at all the protein-coding DNA in a genome, for patients in the study. ""Many rare and undiagnosed diseases have genetic causes and whole exome testing may increase the chances of finding hereditary disease,"" said Marshall Summar, MD, Chief of Genetics and Metabolism at Children's National Health System. ""Through this collaboration, we hope to contribute to major advances in the diagnosis and management of rare disease, as well as the development of new therapies. We believe advances in genomic medicine will enable discoveries that provide answers to more families."" This program will be directed by Carlos Ferreira, MD, a Children's National geneticist, and coordinated by Lindsay Kehoe, a genetic counselor at the hospital. Children's National hopes to include up to 3,000 patients in the study's first year and greater numbers in the following two years. In the study, the RGC will conduct whole exome sequencing, and RGC scientists and Children's National geneticists will analyze the results. Children's National scientists and providers will screen for certain findings that are known to be potentially causative or diagnostic of disease and will confirm those preliminary research findings in a lab facility that is certified for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), the federal standards for clinical testing. Qualified members of the Children's National genetics team will review the results of any confirmatory CLIA-certified testing with patient families, and may refer patients to appropriate clinicians at Children s National for care. This information may provide some families with medical answers and lead to patients receiving treatment that is appropriate for their genetic condition. According to Dr. Summar, pediatric diseases that elude diagnosis can have many detrimental effects for patients and families such as treatment delays, multiple tests that are time- and cost-intensive, and stress from ongoing uncertainty about the illness. Regeneron will utilize the genomic data in its efforts to improve drug development. Since opening in 2014, the RGC has established collaborations with leading academic, government and integrated medical systems in order to pursue research that validates associations between genes and human disease and identifies potential new drug targets.  The Regeneron Genetics Center is utilizing human genetics data to speed the discovery and development of new and improved medicines for patients in need,  said Aris Baras, MD, Vice President and Co-Head of the Regeneron Genetics Center.  Partnering with dedicated organizations like Children s National and Dr. Summar s world-renowned team helps us achieve this long term mission and at the same time enables our partners to enhance patient care through the implementation of genomic medicine.  ""Regeneron's capabilities in ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing and genomics research and our team's diagnostic and therapeutic expertise is a strong combination,"" said Dr. Summar. ""This collaboration provides multiple benefits, and we at Children s National have an opportunity to help patients by utilizing testing and expertise that is not otherwise readily available."" With the nation's largest Pediatric Genetics and Metabolism program, the multi-disciplinary team at Children's National is widely recognized for its expertise in rare and undiagnosed diseases, seeing more than 8,000 patients annually from all over the world.

In most cases, the condition   hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, or HHT   is due to mutations in two genes that regulate proteins in the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. Treatment options are limited. To better understand the disease mechanism, professor of cardiology Anne Eichmann and her co-authors studied the condition in mouse models. They found that deleting the genes in the animals led to vascular malformations similar to those seen in HHT patients. Next, by using a drug to inhibit a protein involved in cell growth (P13 kinase), the researchers reversed the condition in mice. If the finding is confirmed in human patients, it could lead to improved treatment for the disease, say the researchers. Source: Story from Yale Unviersity.

The study, called HVTN 702, involves a new version of the only HIV vaccine candidate ever shown to provide some protection against the virus. HVTN 702 aims to enroll 5,400 men and women, making it the largest and most advanced HIV vaccine clinical trial to take place in South Africa, where more than 1,000 people become infected with HIV every day.  If deployed alongside our current armory of proven HIV prevention tools, a safe and effective vaccine could be the final nail in the coffin for HIV,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health and a co-funder of the trial.  Even a moderately effective vaccine would significantly decrease the burden of HIV disease over time in countries and populations with high rates of HIV infection, such as South Africa.  The experimental vaccine regimen being tested in HVTN 702 is based on the one investigated in the RV144 clinical trial in Thailand led by the U.S. Military HIV Research Program and the Thai Ministry of Health. The Thai trial delivered landmark results in 2009 when it found for the first time that a vaccine could prevent HIV infection, albeit modestly. The new regimen aims to provide greater and more sustained protection than the RV144 regimen and has been adapted to the HIV subtype that predominates in southern Africa, a region that includes the country of South Africa.  The people of South Africa are making history by conducting and participating in the first HIV vaccine efficacy study to build on the results of the Thai trial,  said HVTN 702 Protocol Chair Glenda Gray, M.B.B.C.H., F.C.Paed. (SA).  HIV has taken a devastating toll in South Africa, but now we begin a scientific exploration that could hold great promise for our country. If an HIV vaccine were found to work in South Africa, it could dramatically alter the course of the pandemic.  Dr. Gray is president and chief executive officer of the South African Medical Research Council; research professor of pediatrics at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg; and a founding director of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. The experimental vaccine regimen tested in the Thai trial was found to be 31.2 percent effective at preventing HIV infection over the 3.5-year follow-up after vaccination. In the HVTN 702 study, the design, schedule and components of the RV144 vaccine regimen have been modified to increase the magnitude and duration of vaccine-elicited protective immune responses. As the regulatory sponsor of HVTN 702, NIAID is responsible for all operational aspects of this pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial, which is enrolling HIV-uninfected, sexually active men and women aged 18 to 35 years. The NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is conducting the trial at 15 sites across South Africa. Results are expected in late 2020. HVTN 702 begins just months after interim results were reported for HVTN 100, its predecessor clinical trial, which found that the new vaccine regimen was safe for the 252 study participants and induced comparable immune responses to those reported in RV144. HVTN 100 and HVTN 702 are part of a larger HIV vaccine research endeavor led by the Pox-Protein Public-Private Partnership, or P5   a diverse group of public and private organizations committed to building on the success of the RV144 trial. The P5 aims to produce an HIV vaccine that could have a significant public health benefit in southern Africa and to advance scientists  understanding of the immune responses associated with preventing HIV infection. The study volunteers are being randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine regimen or a placebo. All study participants will receive a total of five injections over one year.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring the clinical trial, which will use an innovative evaluation method developed by a group of scientists who specialize in antibiotic resistance research. CAP is a potentially serious lung infection in young children that often leads to hospitalization. Viruses and bacteria (specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae) are the most common causes of CAP in pre-school-aged children, whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae and fungal infections occur more frequently in older children. The current standard of first-line treatment for young children diagnosed with CAP is a 10-day course of the antibiotic amoxicillin.  Finding new strategies for treating bacterial infections and making better use of existing antibiotic medications are major areas of focus for researchers,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  This study aims to determine whether we can effectively treat young children for community-acquired pneumonia with a shorter course of antibiotic therapy than is currently the standard. Using only the amount of medication that is needed   and no more   not only is good for patients but could also help conserve the long-term effectiveness of available drugs.  The clinical study, called SCOUT-CAP (Short Course vs. Standard Course Outpatient Therapy of CAP in Children), will enroll children ages 6 months to roughly 6 years (71 months) diagnosed with CAP who were initially treated in outpatient clinics, urgent care facilities and emergency departments and have clinically improved prior to enrollment. The trial is being conducted through the NIAID-funded Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU) program in collaboration with the NIAID-funded Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG), which prioritizes, designs and executes clinical research to reduce the threat of antibiotic resistance. Three VTEU sites are involved   Duke University, Vanderbilt University and Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center   along with the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh-University of Pittsburgh. The trial will use an evaluation method specifically designed to assess the best treatment strategies with a goal of reducing children s exposure to antibiotics and ultimately reducing the potential for developing resistance to antibiotics. The ARLG developed the trial method and the study concept. The SCOUT-CAP trial, estimated to end in March 2019, will evaluate short courses of the oral antibiotics amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, and cefdinir. As planned, 200 children enrolled in the study will receive the standard 10-day course of antibiotics, and 200 children will receive the short course.

Led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the team s report on its development of the network called InWeb_InBioMap (InWeb_IM) is receiving advance online publication in Nature Methods.   Modern genetic technologies allow us to routinely sequence the genomes of people with, for example, cancer or psychiatric diseases, but understanding the cellular systems that are affected by disease-causing genetic variations remains a major challenge,  says Kasper Lage, PhD, of the MGH Department of Surgery and the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, project leader and co-corresponding author of the Nature Methods report.  Having more complete maps of the physical interactions of human proteins will enable us to start exploring cellular processes affected in disease at a higher resolution than is currently possible.  While the importance of mapping large-scale protein-protein interaction networks is widely recognized, the most recent experimental efforts have identified fewer than 30,000 direct interactions, representing well under a quarter of the most conservative estimates of the total number of interactions. Lage s team, in collaboration with researchers in Denmark and the U.K., developed a computational framework to integrate data from more than 43,000 published articles, including data from eight established protein-protein interaction databases. They applied stringent quality control in creating InWeb_IM, which consisted of almost 586,000 interactions when the paper was submitted in February 2015 and now includes more than 625,500 interactions.  Co-lead author Taibo Li from Lage s team explains,  Just like people, proteins like to work in groups to carry out their functions, and they do this by physically interacting in protein networks. If you compare protein-protein interaction networks to human social networks, just as platforms like Facebook can infer people who may know each other or share interests based on patterns of interaction with others in the network, constructing networks of protein interactions can infer gene groups and molecular pathways that can improve our understanding of processes that occur in human cells.  Lage adds,  The rapidly declining cost of genome sequencing has far outpaced our ability to interpret the gene variants we identify in patients with undiagnosed diseases. By exploring interaction networks at the level of proteins and of the genes that may be causing a disease, clinicians may begin to see patterns of genetic data that would otherwise be difficult to discern, which we illustrate in the article for cancers and autism. For example, around 30 genes appear to be involved in cardiomyopathies, but many individuals with the condition do not have mutations in any of those genes. By looking at interaction partners at the protein level of the 30 cardiomyopathy genes, we can start to identify new candidate genes based on the  cardiomyopathy network,  potentially leading to new molecular insights into the disease. It is our hope that InWeb_IM can be a resource that contributes to interpreting clinical exome sequencing data and play a part in enabling clinical action in patients with an unknown cause of disease.

Announcement of the partnership was made during Launch Pad: Pathways to Cancer InnoVAtion, a joint VA/PCF summit held that brings together world-class oncology experts, corporate and nonprofit partners to discuss research, big data, technology and clinical solutions to advance screening, diagnostics and care coordination for cancer and to promote the implementation of best practices across the VA healthcare system. As part of the summit, PCF announced a $50-million precision oncology initiative to expand prostate cancer clinical research among Veterans to speed the development of new treatment options and cures for prostate cancer patients. The agreement signed is the first partnership between PCF and VA, and it comes at a time when an estimated 12,000 Veterans each year are diagnosed with prostate cancer, making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer among Veterans. In particular, African-Americans are 64 percent more likely to develop prostate cancer compared to any other race or ethnicity and 2.4 times more likely to die from the disease.  Fighting and treating cancer among our Veterans is a team effort, which is why this Launch Pad event and this partnership are so important,  said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. To effectively serve our Veterans and to keep VA on the cutting edge of medical research, we need government, corporate, and non-profit organizations working together. We are truly grateful to the Prostate Cancer Foundation for this important show of support. Our work together will save Veterans  lives.  The goals of the PCF partnership are to increase the number of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) investigators applying to PCF for funding; increase the number of VHA facilities involved in precision medicine/prostate cancer clinical trials; increase the number of Veterans enrolled in studies, providing veteran specimens or data used in studies as well as increase the number of minorities enrolled in PCF studies; and increase the number of early career scientists working on prostate cancer research.  Our goal is to increase our scientific understanding of prostate cancer among Veterans and to kick-start the development of precision medicine treatments for them, as well as the general population,  said Jonathan W. Simons, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, PCF.  This agreement will open new doors for the research community to work with Veterans facing a life threatening disease and ultimately reduce the disease burden on America s Veterans.  VA has a long history in cancer prevention and research. VA s cancer research portfolio supported 262 active projects with $53.5 million in fiscal year 2016, toward understanding and preventing cancers prevalent in the Veteran population. In addition, VA research also has ongoing collaborations and data-sharing with other public agencies, and profit and non-profit corporations to enhance cancer research, including studies that support the national Precision Medicine Initiative.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are almost 800,000 new cases of herpes in the United States each year, and about 1 in 6 Americans aged 14 to 49 have a genital HSV-2 infection.1 An estimated 87.4% of 14-49 year olds infected with HSV-2 have never received a clinical diagnosis. According to the CDC, transmission of HSV-2 most commonly occurs from an infected partner who does not have visible sores and who may not know that he or she is infected. Herpetic lesions can be a result of the primary infection by the virus or from a reactivation of the latent virus, causing recurrent episodes of the disease. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are genetically and antigenically distinct forms of HSV. HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital infections, due to venereal transmission; HSV-1 is commonly associated with other disease locations although both serotypes have been shown to cause disease in all locations of the body. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a DNA virus of the family Herpesviridae. Primary VZV infection results in chickenpox (varicella), which rarely results in complications including encephalitis or pneumonia. Even when clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person (virus latency). In approximately 10 to 20% of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, producing shingles. Quidel's Solana HSV-1+2/VZV Assay detects and differentiates herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, and varicella-zoster virus from cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion samples obtained from symptomatic patients. Specimens submitted in a broad range of transport media can be tested with the assay. The Solana HSV-1+2/VZV Assay is an easy-to-use, accurate, molecular diagnostic test that is compatible with many commonly used transport media, requires no upfront extraction of DNA and generates three accurate results in less than an hour. The Solana molecular platform leverages the Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) technology that is resident in Quidel's AmpliVue  molecular product line to generate a fast and accurate test result. Solana can process up to 12 patient samples in each run, and provides time-saving workflow advantages to healthcare professionals in moderately complex settings. ""Quidel has long been a leader in developing innovative Respiratory and Women's Health assays. Our latest product introduction, the Solana  HSV-1+2/VZV assay, broadens our molecular diagnostic offerings for Women's Health assays in the moderately complex setting,"" said Douglas Bryant, president and chief executive officer of Quidel Corporation. ""We believe that the Solana platform will provide the laboratorian with a fast and accurate method to diagnose many Women's Health conditions, including shingles, herpes, and trichomonas infections."" Solana  HSV-1+2/VZV is Quidel's fifth molecular diagnostic test to receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA in the scalable and versatile Solana format. Solana  Strep Complete received 510(k) clearance in October, Solana  Influenza A+B received 510(k) clearance in September, Solana  Trichomonas assay received 510(k) clearance in August, and the Solana  Group A Strep assay was cleared in June 2015. With the Solana franchise, Quidel has broadened its molecular strategy to include instrumented systems, and grown the number of its molecular platforms that are both FDA cleared and available commercially. Quidel's other FDA-cleared molecular solutions include the AmpliVue  non-instrumented system for lower-volume moderately complex labs and Lyra  reagents for higher throughput, highly complex laboratories that are compatible with existing PCR infrastructure. Solana  HSV-1+2/VZV Assay is not intended for use with cerebrospinal fluid or to aid in the diagnosis of HSV or VZV infections of the central nervous system (CNS).

For most women who have epilepsy, continuing their medication during pregnancy is important for their health. Over the last 25 years, research has shown that children exposed to these medications in the womb can be at a higher risk of having a malformation or birth defect. See Also: Granger causality test can make epilepsy surgery more effective The study, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, aimed to understand whether pregnant women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy were at higher risk of having a child with a malformation. The majority of women with epilepsy will be required to continue antiepileptic drug treatment during a pregnancy. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant increase in risk of having a child with a significant birth defect in the mother was taking certain antiepileptic drugs and therefore treatment decisions should be made carefully and collaboratively and aim to find a balance between maximizing maternal health while minimizing fetal risk. Learn More: Researchers use network science to help pinpoint source of seizuresAs part of this systematic review 50 published studies were analyzed and it was found that exposure in the womb to the AED sodium valproate was associated with a 10 percent chance of the child having a significant birth defect and that this rose as the dose of the drug increased. The types of birth defect that were increased were skeletal and limb defects, cardiac defects, craniofacial defects and neural tube defects. Children exposed to carbamazepine, topiramate or phenytoin were at an increased risk of having a significant birth defect but the exact types of defects were not clear and children exposed to phenobarbital were found to be at an increased risk of cardiac defects.

""We saw changes in these young players' brains on both structural and functional imaging after a single season of football,"" Dr. Davenport said. In the study, each player underwent pre- and post-season imaging: a specialized MRI scan, from which diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) data were extracted to measure the brain's white matter integrity, and a magnetoencephalography (MEG) scan, which records and analyzes the magnetic fields produced by brain waves.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gene-limits-desire-to-drink-alcohol-195498,Gene Limits Desire To Drink Alcohol Research teams have identified a gene variant that suppresses the desire to drink alcohol  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In the largest study of its kind, UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers and colleagues in Europe identified a gene variant that suppresses the desire to drink alcohol.  The findings are based on the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis and replication study to date mapping and comparing the genetics   the DNA   of more than 105,000 light and heavy social drinkers,  said Dr. David Mangelsdorf, Chair of Pharmacology at UT Southwestern and a corresponding author of the study.  The study identified a variation in the  -Klotho gene linked to the regulation of social alcohol consumption. The less frequent variant   seen in approximately 40 percent of the people in this study   is associated with a decreased desire to drink alcohol,  he said. Dr. Mangelsdorf runs a laboratory with Dr. Steven Kliewer, another corresponding author of the study published online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).  Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health problem worldwide, causing more than 3 million deaths per year,  said Dr. Kliewer, a Professor of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology who holds the Nancy B. and Jake L. Hamon Distinguished Chair in Basic Cancer Research.  Much of the research on alcohol consumption has focused on addiction. However, the overall burden of alcohol-associated disease reflects the total amount of alcohol consumed, not just addiction.  The European research group knew that the UT Southwestern team had worked on  -Klotho and the liver hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) that binds to the  -Klotho-FGF21 receptor complex.  They asked us to conduct experiments in mice to better understand the role of  -Klotho in alcohol drinking behavior,  Dr. Mangelsdorf said.  The  -Klotho gene directs the production of the  -Klotho protein that forms part of a receptor complex in the brain.  The PNAS study could lead to development of drugs to regulate alcohol consumption   possibly even in those with drinking problems. Alcoholics were not part of the current study, however. A shift from heavy to moderate social drinking could have major public health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Increased alcohol consumption is linked to two heart disease risk factors in particular: high blood pressure and obesity, according to the American Heart Association. This study of genetic influences on brain function affecting drinking behavior indicates the promise of pharmacogenetics, a field of precision medicine that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) describes as the study of how genes affect responses to drugs. Like many complex traits, the genetic influences on brain functions affecting drinking behavior were thought to be so small that it would be necessary to study large numbers of people in order to detect those genetic variations, said Dr. Mangelsdorf, also Professor of Biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Dr. Mangelsdorf holds the Alfred G. Gilman Distinguished Chair in Pharmacology, and the Raymond and Ellen Willie Distinguished Chair in Molecular Neuropharmacology in Honor of Harold B. Crasilneck, Ph.D. The study compared the genetics of light and heavy social drinkers of European ancestry participating in nearly four dozen other large population studies worldwide. In addition to providing samples for genetic analysis, the participants answered questionnaires on their weekly drinking habits. Heavy drinking was defined as more than 21 drinks per week for men and more than 14 drinks per week for women. Light drinking was considered to be 14 drinks or less per week for men and seven drinks or less per week for women. A  drink  was the equivalent of a small glass or wine, or a half pint of beer. The  -Klotho gene codes for the protein  -Klotho, which forms a receptor complex in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) with classic receptors for FGF21, a hormone produced in the liver.  The gene in the current study seems to work via a feedback circuit that goes from the liver, which processes alcohol, to the brain, where  -Klotho and classic FGF21 receptors form a cellular machine, or receptor complex, which binds to the liver hormone FGF21 to signal the response to alcohol,  Dr. Mangelsdorf said. The less common gene variant identified in this study is related to a decreased desire for alcohol. So, people who have this variant tend to drink less than those without it, he said. In this study, the frequency of the alcohol-decreasing variant among participants was 42 percent. To better understand how the gene works, the Kliewer-Mangelsdorf lab offered mice genetically unable to produce  -Klotho a choice between water and alcohol. The genetically altered mice preferred alcohol even when they were given the hormone FGF21, indicating that FGF21 s ability to suppress the preference for alcohol depends on the presence of  -Klotho, he said. This marks the fifth study in which Drs. Mangelsdorf and Kliewer report that the hormone FGF21 directly affects the central nervous system in mice. A study published in December 2015 found that FGF21 works via the brain s reward pathway to reduce cravings for sugar and that FGF21 needed  -Klotho to function in that signaling pathway. The current study indicates that FGF21 requires  -Klotho in the signaling pathway that suppresses alcohol consumption, he said. In 2014, they reported that FGF21 acts on the brain to cause weight loss. They also published two studies in 2013 reporting on FGF21 s ability to regulate metabolism, circadian (body clock) behavior, and female reproduction.  This is a hormone with some remarkable pharmacologic effects,  Dr. Mangelsdorf said.  The current study suggests that the FGF21- -Klotho pathway regulates alcohol consumption in humans and seems to point to a mechanism that we might be able to influence in order to reduce alcohol intake.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/enhancing-crispr-to-explore-further-193458,Enhancing CRISPR to Explore Further Researchers have developed sOPTiKO  a more efficient and controllable CRISPR genome editing platform  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and University of Cambridge researchers have created sOPTiKO, a more efficient and controllable CRISPR genome editing platform. Today (29 November), in the journal Development, they describe how the freely available single-step system works in every cell in the body and at every stage of development. This new approach will aid researchers in developmental biology, tissue regeneration and cancer. Two complementary methods were developed. sOPiTKO is a knock-out system that turns off genes by disrupting the DNA. sOPTiKD is a knock-down system that silences the action of genes by disrupting the RNA. Using these two methods, scientists can inducibly turn off or silence genes, in any cell type, at any stage of a cell s development from stem cell to fully differentiated adult cell. These systems will allow researchers world-wide to rapidly and accurately explore the changing role of genes as the cells develop into tissues such as liver, skin or heart, and discover how this contributes to health and disease. The body contains approximately 37 trillion cells, yet the human genome only contains roughly 20,000 genes. So, to produce every tissue and cell type in the body, different combinations of genes must operate at different moments in the development of an organ or tissue. Being able to turn off genes at specific moments in a cell s development allows their changing roles to be investigated.  As a cell develops from being stem cell to being a fully differentiated adult cell the genes within it take on different roles. Before, if we knocked out a gene, we could only see what effect this had at the very first step. By allowing the gene to operate during the cell s development and then knocking it out with sOPTiKO at a later developmental step, we can investigate exactly what it is doing at that stage.  said Professor Ludovic Vallier, one of the senior authors of the study from the Wellcome Trust Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute at the University of Cambridge and the Sanger Institute. The sOPTiKO and sOPTIKD methods allow scientists to silence the activity of more than one gene at a time, so researchers have the possibility to now investigate the role of whole families of related genes by knocking down the activity of all of them at once. In addition, the freely available system allows experiments to be carried out far more rapidly and cheaply. sOPTiKO is highly flexible so that it can be used in every tissue in the body without needing to create a new system each time. sOPiTKD allows vast improvements in efficiency: it can be used to knock down more than one gene at a time. Before, to silence the activity of three genes, researchers had to knock down one gene, grow the cell line, and repeat for the next gene, and again for the next. Now it can do it all in one step, cutting a nine-month process down to just one to two months. Dr Alessandro Bertero, one of the first authors of the study, added,  Two key advantages of using sOPTiKO/sOPTIKD over other CRISPR editing systems are that it is truly inducible and can work in almost any cell type. In the past we have been hampered by the fact we could study a gene s function only in a specific tissue. Now you can knock out the same gene in parallel in a diversity of cell type with different functions.  Source: Story from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

But for those that have figured out how to scavenge iron from their hosts, it s a fine place to grow and reproduce. Now, in an ironic twist, scientists have turned that iron-scavenging power against the most common UTI-causing bacteria. For the first time, they ve prevented UTIs in mice by vaccinating them with the same molecules that the bacteria usually use to grab iron and fuel their growth. The results are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a team from the University of Michigan Medical School. They caution that a human UTI vaccine based on the approach is still years away. But the success of vaccination with the small iron-grabbing molecules, called siderophores, paves the way for further research.  The same team previously reported success in preventing UTIs using a vaccine made of proteins from the bacteria, called uropathogenic Escherichia coli or UPEC. Neither the protein approach nor the siderophore approach provided complete protection, but the two approaches together might. UPEC causes more than three-quarters of UTIs in otherwise healthy women, and the bacteria produce  stealth  siderophores that evade the host immune system and are unique to them. That makes these molecules good candidates for a vaccine without unintended consequences. In fact, in the same issue of PNAS, a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of California, Irvine report success in preventing gut infections by vaccinating mice against Salmonella using siderophores made by those bacteria. A pressing problem With E. coli gaining resistance to the antibiotics that many women take to treat UTIs, or prevent recurring ones, the search for a vaccine takes on new urgency, says Harry Mobley, Ph.D., senior author of the new paper and chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at U-M. Recent findings that cranberry juice does not prevent UTIs adds to that urgency. UTI care in the United States costs more than $3.5 billion a year, and affect half of all women sometime in their lives. Half of those who get one will get another in the next year, and about 4 million women suffer continuous UTIs. Women suffering recurrent UTIs are the most likely candidates for a vaccine, says first author and research fellow Laura Mike, Ph.D. Mike, Mobley and their colleagues assessed the effect of siderophore vaccination in several ways. They started by applying two different UPEC stealth siderophores inside the noses of mice, several times over the course of two weeks. A week later, they applied UPEC bacteria directly into the mouse bladders, waited two days, and then looked at their urine, bladder and kidneys, which get involved when a UTI rages out of control. When each of the two siderophores was administered individually, modest protection against UTI resulted. But treating the mice with both siderophores and the carrier protein at the same time produced a much greater effect.  We saw efficacy more in the kidney than in the bladder, suggesting that this approach may be most useful in preventing advanced UTIs,  says Mike.  Our next challenge is creating a combination vaccine that also employs proteins that UPEC bacteria use to bind their iron-laden siderophores, and test other adjuvants to increase the response.  The team is planning to expand their study to see if they can protect against the bloodstream infection, or bacteremia, that can cause some UTI sufferers to develop sepsis and die. Mobley notes that the researchers did not find direct evidence of antibodies made by the mice responding to the siderophore vaccine. But the findings, including detailed examination of the bladder and kidney tissue, are consistent with an adaptive immune response stemming from the vaccination, he says. Other teams have tried to use siderophores against UTIs, but did not go as far as the U-M team. Using a small molecule such as a siderophore against bacterial infections is itself a novel approach, Mobley notes.  And, says Mike, since other dangerous bacteria make their own unique siderophores, the approach could be attempted beyond UPEC and Salmonella. Recently, U-M researchers showed the role of siderophores in the ability of a  superbug  bacteria called Klebsiella pneumonia to cause pneumonia and much worse.  Using proteins that are found on the surface of bacterial cells as the basis for vaccination may lack efficacy because of the variability of the exact protein structure,  says Mobley.  But siderophores are the same across most gram negative enteric bacteria that cause some of the worst infections. This is a step along the journey, but it s an encouraging one.

Steele, the University of Wisconsin Madison Winder-Bascom professor of food science, specializes in food, beverage and biofuel fermentation. Understanding how bacteria and yeast convert biomass into products has been his stock-in-trade for more than 30 years. The fermentation of beer and wine can be plagued by contamination with lactic acid bacteria, which make lactic acid rather than alcohol. The same problem affects the ethanol industry. Steele s new company, Lactic Solutions, is advancing a judo-like remedy: using genetic engineering to transform enemy into friend. Instead of killing lactic acid bacteria with antibiotics, he s spliced in genes for ethanol production so these organisms produce ethanol, not lactic acid.  We are taking the problem and trying to turn it into a solution,  Steele says. The company will sell bags of bacteria to the ethanol industry to be added to the fermenter alongside the yeast that presently makes ethanol. About 70 percent of ethanol plants fight lactic acid bacteria with antibiotics, including erythromycin, virginiamycin and penicillin. But these and other life-saving drugs are the subject of frantic concern as bacteria evolve resistance to one antibiotic after another. The ethanol industry s problem arises because one-third of the incoming corn goes out the door, after fermentation. This material, called  dried distillers grains with solubles,  is one of the largest sources of animal feed in the United States says Steele.  Distillers grains can carry antibiotics or bacteria that evolved in the fermentation facility to resist antibiotics.  The result could be dangerous drugs   or dangerous bugs   in the human food supply. According to Steele,  Tyson Foods, McDonald s, Panera, Perdue, etc. say they will, by the end of this year or next year, eliminate the use of meat from animals fed antibiotics, so the primary way to control lactic acid bacteria in the ethanol industry is going away.  Like the beer industry, some ethanol plants use hops to control lactic acid bacteria, but that s more expensive and less effective than antibiotics. As an ecologist of the microbial realm, Steele recognizes that the engineered bacteria must reproduce and survive rising levels of ethanol in the fermenter. To give them a competitive edge, a large number of engineered bacteria will be introduced as early as possible. The reformulated lactic acid bacteria have also received a gene that produces inhibitors of garden variety lactic acid bacteria, which uses  the same systems they have evolved to compete against each other over millions of years,  Steele says.  We want to give our organisms every advantage.  As a fringe benefit, the new bacteria consume types of sugar that are not available to the yeast.  At the end of the day, there is more ethanol produced from the same amount of corn,  Steele says,  but we would have never found this if we had not started trying to solve the antibiotics problem.  Steele s patent, assigned to the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, covers his concept for altering lactic acid bacteria to fight competing bacteria and to make ethanol, based on unused sugars. Lactic Solutions was incorporated in October.  We know where every potential customer is,  says Steele, the CEO.  There are about 200 ethanol plants in the United States. Indiana, Iowa and Illinois alone have 59 plants.  As a legacy of Wisconsin s leadership in the cheese industry, the state has two of the world s largest producers of lactic acid bacteria. Lactic Solutions will outsource manufacturing and distribution and focus on providing service to customers and developing new strains. Steele credits assistance from the Discovery to Product (D2P) program, cosponsored by WARF and UW Madison.  D2P has been a remarkable experience, in preparing us to talk to customers, helping us understand things from their point of view, developing our business plan, and preparing our  elevator speech.  We would not be here without D2P.  Other assistance has come from the Business and Entrepreneurship Clinic at the Wisconsin School of Business. Steele has recently begun the gBETA incubator program,  where we ll polish our story and learn to put together a team to run the company.  The ethanol industry, Steele says,  understands that antibiotics are a short-term solution, and we plan to provide them with a long-term solution that also increases conversion of sugars to ethanol. Hops are way more expensive and less effective than antibiotics. We think we can do much better for less.  Source: Story from the University of Wisconsin   Madison.

The MindMetre report, which reviewed the range of existing evidence and also canvassed views among a sample of 30 laboratory managers and principal biochemists in England and Wales, was conducted in response Lord Carter s latest report, Operational productivity and performance in English NHS acute hospitals: Unwarranted variations (February 2016) .   The Carter report notes that,  If benchmarks for pathology are unlikely to be achieved [by the deadline of April 2017], trusts should have agreed plans for consolidation and outsourcing to, other providers by January 2017.  The MindMetre review and research cautions against such a tight deadline being imposed, arguing that merger planning is not a substitute for within-laboratory efficiency and improvement drives. The MindMetre review suggests that a mandatory pathway is set for laboratory productivity improvement (particularly turnaround time reduction), recognising that all aspects of the NHS have to deliver efficiency savings in the current policy environment. However, the review also suggests that the high value offered by pathology services be re-appraised at the strategic level to determine their position in the NHS service funding priorities. Evidence covered in the review suggests that the immediate and knock-on effects of pathology service capacity and efficiency/productivity are more considerable than service funding would suggest, and could make an even more disproportionately positive contribution to patient outcomes, rapid diagnosis and the avoidance of unnecessary interventions and chronic condition development further down the line. Paul Lindsell, Mind Metre Managing Director, comments:  A knee-jerk push to consolidate pathology labs is not an easy universal panacea. There is evidently significant headroom for efficiency and productivity gains in pathology workflows and emerging technology. Our report recognises frustrations that greater productivity gains have not yet been achieved. However, we also suggest that the through-the-line benefits that pathology services offer mean it would be a mistake to potentially squeeze such resources in the NHS. In fact, there may be a rationale to put greater resources into pathology services, so long as they are strictly pegged to productivity improvements.  Source:  Story from Mind Metre.

The award includes funding that will enable Dr. Robinson to extend his research efforts to identify non-coding regions of the genome involved in gene regulation and disease. Of particular interest are those regions located far away from the genes they regulate or  enhancer  regions that typically escape exome sequencing analysis.  Dr. Robinson focuses on the identification of enhancer mutations involved in various human diseases and conditions. His research will increase our understanding of the disease relevance of regulatory regions in the genome, as well as demonstrate the utility of targeted sequence capture for such studies,"" said Herman Verrelst, Agilent vice president and general manager, Genomics and Clinical Applications Division, and the executive sponsor of this award. ""We are pleased to support Dr. Robinson s work in this important area,  added Verrelst.  I m very grateful for this award as it will allow us to examine the influence of DNA variation and dysregulation of gene regulation in immune cells, as well as cohorts of patients with diseases of the immune system, in order to address the hypothesis that alterations of enhancer-promoter looping interactions may underlie some forms of immunological disease,  said Dr. Robinson.  The work will involve genomics investigations in which relevant regulatory regions of the genome are enriched and subjected to next-generation sequencing. We will also develop bioinformatics pipelines and algorithms in order to process and analyse the resulting data, as well as software methods for biological and medical interpretation, with the goal of establishing robust methods for the use of this kind of genomics to investigate the disease relevance of non-coding regions of our genome,  he added.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/repurposing-genes-for-brain-development-207240,Repurposing Genes for Brain Development Mammalian bone gene may be repurposed to promote cognition in humans  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A gene that regulates bone growth and muscle metabolism in mammals may take on an additional role as a promoter of brain maturation, cognition and learning in human and nonhuman primates, according to a new study led by neurobiologists at Harvard Medical School.  Describing their findings in the Nov. 10 issue of Nature, researchers say their work provides a dramatic illustration of evolutionary economizing and creative gene retooling mechanisms that contribute to the vast variability across species that share nearly identical set of genes yet differ profoundly in their physiology. The research reveals that osteocrin   a gene found in the skeletal muscles of all mammals and well-known for its role in bone growth and muscle function   is completely turned off in rodent brains yet highly active in the brains of nonhuman primates and humans. Notably, osteocrin was found predominantly in cells of the neocortex   the most evolved part of the primate brain, which regulates sensory perception, spatial reasoning and higher-level thinking and language in humans.  The gene s marked presence in an area of the brain responsible for higher-level function and thought, the researchers said, suggests a possible role in the development of cognition, a cardinal feature that distinguishes the brains of human and nonhuman primates from those of other mammals.  Brain development in humans and other primates is profoundly affected by sensory experience and social interactions. Scientists have long sought to unravel genes in the brain that are turned on and off by experiences to fuel the rise of brain functions unique to such complex species. The HMS team s findings   part of an ongoing quest to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie human brain development, function and disease   reveal that osteocrin is precisely one such gene, activated by sensory stimulation. Furthermore, the team added, this is the first illustration of evolutionary gene repurposing in the brain.  We have uncovered what we believe is a critical clue into the evolution of the human brain, one that gives us a glimpse into the genetic mechanisms that may account for differences in cognition between mice and humans,  said senior investigator Michael Greenberg, the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and chair of the HMS Department of Neurobiology.  For their experiments, the team analyzed RNA levels   the molecular footprints of gene activity   in the brain cells of mice, rats and humans. Although many of the same genes were activated in both mouse and human brain cells, the scientists observed, a small subset of genes was activated solely in human brain cells. Much to the scientists  surprise, the bone gene osteocrin was most highly expressed in the human brain, yet completely shut off in the brain cells of mice.  Going a step further, the scientists placed brain cells from all three species in lab dishes and chemically re-created conditions that mimic sensory stimulation. Chemical stimulation activated osteocrin selectively in excitatory neurons, so called for their role in stimulating rather than dampening nerve signaling. But researchers noted something even more intriguing: The activity of the gene was most intense in neurons of the neocortex, the topmost layer of cells covering the brain and responsible for higher-level cognition, such as long-term memory, thought and language. At the same time, osteocrin was noticeably absent from other parts of the brain responsible for noncognitive functions such as spatial navigation, balance, breathing, heart rate and temperature control. When researchers compared osteocrin levels to levels of another brain protein, BDNF, well known for its role in neuronal growth and repair, they noticed another striking difference. While BDNF was present throughout the brain, osteocrin was restricted to the neocortex and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala, an area of the brain thought to play a role in memory formation, decision making and emotional responses. Osteocrin was also markedly expressed in cells of the temporal lobe, which houses functions such as learning, memory and audio-visual processing   and the occipital lobe, which houses the visual cortex, the area of the brain responsible for the processing of visual information. Further analysis revealed that in the primate brain, sensory stimulation appears to switch on osteocrin through a previously unknown DNA enhancer. Enhancers   snippets of DNA that act as the genome s regulators   are the  handles  that turn on some genes while shutting off others. In doing so, enhancers can profoundly alter genetic expression, fuelling dramatic differences between organisms with nearly identical DNA. The rodent versions of osteocrin lacked the stimulation-activated DNA enhancer, the analysis showed. In yet another critical observation, researchers found the osteocrin enhancer was, in turn, switched on by a protein called MEF2. Mutations in MEF2 are a well-established cause of intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders, so the link between the two begs further study, the researchers said, as it may portend a role for osteocrin in such developmental anomalies.  Humans share many genes with rodents and as much as 90 percent of their DNA in some parts of the genome,  says co-first author Gabriella Boulting, a neurobiologist at HMS.  In this case we see how turning up the expression of the same gene in a different location may precipitate dramatic differences in the function of brain cells.  Further analysis revealed that osteocrin s activation curbed the growth of neuronal dendrites   branchlike projections responsible for transmitting signals from one brain cell to the next.  Restricting dendritic growth is a precision-enhancing mechanism, essential to ensuring that neuronal wires don t get crossed and compromise signal transmission from one cell to the next,  says study first co-author Bulent Ataman, a neurobiologist at HMS. This observation, Ataman added, suggests that osteocrin s activity may help enhance nerve cell agility and proper signal transmission to ensure robust communication across neurons. To confirm that the activity-induced gene expression observed in nerve cells in the lab also occurred in the functioning, intact brain, researchers temporarily blocked vision in one eye of a macaque, a common technique to study activity-triggered brain plasticity and visually-induced gene activation in the visual cortex. This proof-of-concept experiment, they surmised, would reveal whether osteocrin is, indeed, awakened by visual stimulation and shut off by its absence. A day later, the researchers observed that osteocrin expression was markedly higher in cells from the visually intact parts of the macaque brain, compared with cells in vision-deprived areas. The findings illustrate a foundational principle in neurobiology abnormal visual experiences can interfere with the development and function of brain cells in the visual cortex, a phenomenon first described more than 50 years ago by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, two of the founding members of the Department of Neurobiology at HMS. The two shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on visual information processing in the brain.   Nature and nurture interact to wire up the brain, and abnormal vision can alter that wiring,  said Margaret Livingstone, the Takeda Professor of Neurobiology at HMS.  Our observations reveal the molecular basis for what Hubel and Wiesel observed more than half a century ago.  Source: Story from Harvard Medical School. Original piece written by Ekaterina Pesheva.

In recent years, the approach of harvesting and transplanting a patient s own stem cells to help heart repair has garnered much interest internationally. However, determining the best cell type to use remains a large challenge. To help overcome this challenge, Dr Katare and his team used cultured stem cells from 14 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery to compare the function of three types of adult stem cells. Two were from the patient s heart itself   the left ventricle and the right atrium   while the third was from the circulating blood of the same patient.  After simulating the conditions of low oxygen levels and lack of nutrients present in heart disease, he and his colleagues then studied the therapeutic effects each of the three stem cell types in repairing the damaged heart cells. They found that the right atrial stem cells had the greatest protective effect on heart muscle cells, while the ventricular stem cells were the most effective at promoting the formation of new blood vessels. The third cell type, endothelial progenitor cells, was also equally effective at promoting blood vessel growth, but these cells  potential to be cultivated outside of the body and to migrate to the site of injury in heart cells was found to be significantly lower. Dr Katare says that if the findings can be replicated in clinical trials, this would suggest a need for personalised stem cell therapy depending on the type of heart disease present in a patient.  Our findings also provide a possible explanation for several failed clinical trials in stem cells therapy,  he says. The study, which was supported by grants from the J&C Anderson Trust and the Heart Foundation of New Zealand, appears in the International Journal of Cardiology.

The meta-genomics research, a collaboration between the University of Sydney and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, was made possible by new technology that also provides a powerful new way to determine what pathogens cause human diseases. Professor Edward Holmes, from the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases & Biosecurity and the School of Life and Environmental Sciences, who led the Sydney component of the project said although the research revealed humans are surrounded by viruses in our daily lives, these did not transfer easily to humans.  This groundbreaking study re-writes the virology text book by showing that invertebrates carry an extraordinary number of viruses   far more than we ever thought,  Professor Holmes said.  We have discovered that most groups of viruses that infect vertebrates   including humans, such as those that cause well-known diseases like influenza   are in fact derived from those present in invertebrates,  said Professor Holmes, who is also based at the University s multidisciplinary Charles Perkins Centre. The study suggests these viruses have been associated with invertebrates for potentially billions of years, rather than millions of years as had been believed, and that invertebrates are the true hosts for many types of virus. The paper,  Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere,  is published in Nature.  Viruses are the most common source of DNA and RNA on earth,  Professor Holmes said. The findings suggest viruses from ribonucleic acid, known as RNA   whose principal role is generally to carry instructions from DNA   are likely to exist in every species of cellular life.  It s remarkable that invertebrates like insects carry so very many viruses   no one had thought to look before because most of them had not been associated with human-borne illnesses.  Although insects such mosquitoes are well-known for their potential to transmit viruses like zika and dengue, Professor Holmes stressed that insects should not generally be feared because most viruses were not transferable to humans and invertebrates played an important role in the ecosystem. Importantly, the same techniques used to discover these invertebrate viruses could also be used to determine the cause of novel human diseases, such as the controversial  Lyme-like disease  that is claimed to occur following tick bites.  Our study utilised new techniques in meta-genomics, which we are also using to provide insights into the causes of human-borne diseases,  said Professor Holmes, who is also a National Health and Medical Research Council Australia Fellow.  The new, expensive technologies available to researchers which have allowed us to do this landmark project, provide the ultimate diagnostic tool.  Source: Story from the University of Sydney.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-compound-to-reduce-tumor-growth-202450,New Compound to Reduce Tumor Growth Researchers at Stanford found that a new cell surface receptor they created is effective at inhibiting cancer growth in mice  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A baseball glove is typically made from leather. If a new design made gloves more attractive to baseballs   catching them at higher rates than the typical glove   would it be a game changer? Researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine created such a glove at a microscopic scale. They developed a receptor   with a half-circle shape like that of a baseball glove   that attracted a key cancer-causing molecule called Gas6 and took it out of play, slowing the progression of pancreatic and ovarian cancer in mice. The study was published online Nov. 28 in The Journal of Clinical Investigation. When used alone or in combination with chemotherapy in mice, their  decoy receptor  showed a higher ability to reduce or stop cancer growth than other treatments did. They also elucidated a previously unknown mechanism in the body. In mice, when the researchers inhibited Gas6 from binding to its native receptor, Axl, the cancer cells began to release DNA-damaging molecules, causing the cells to die. This suggests a potential method to improve current therapeutic approaches.  We were even able to get some animals cured, even those that started out with widespread and aggressive metastatic disease,  said Amato Giaccia, PhD, professor of radiation oncology and lead author of the study. The problem with current treatment The researchers wanted to test their molecule in animal models of ovarian and pancreatic cancer, which are hard to detect in early stages. Current treatment options for ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients are limited and usually require a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The therapies can have toxic side effects and rarely lead to a complete cure. So researchers have been increasingly turning to other medications, such as antibiotics or small compounds called tyrosine kinase inhibitors, to use with them. But those medications also have drawbacks: They re toxic, so they can t be delivered in large quantities, and they are unable to beat the strong attraction between Gas6 and Axl. Although they can sometimes stop tumor growth, they rarely result in complete eradication of cancer.   A lot of treatments out there are very toxic because they are not specifically targeting the cancer cells, and they have a huge burden on the liver and kidney,  said Rebecca Miao, PhD, a Stanford research associate who shares lead authorship of the study.  Our decoy receptor seems in mice to not only to be very efficacious but also safe.  Giaccia said,  We basically came up with a better glove, with a much stronger ability to catch the baseball   in this case, Gas6.    Activation of Axl: a key player in different forms of cancer Gas6 is a molecule that binds and activates Axl, the surface receptor that plays a key role in cell survival, growth and migration. In many forms of cancer, Axl is over-expressed and binds Gas6 very strongly, which makes it difficult for the development of therapeutics to target this complex. However, Giaccia and his team developed a decoy receptor that binds to Gas6 around 350 times better than Axl does. When given to mice, the decoy took out the Gas6 molecules from the system and blocked them from activating Axl, suppressing cell growth and migration and stopping cancer growth.  Our molecule has a higher affinity for Gas6, so it is more effective in taking it out,  said Giaccia. To create the decoy receptor, called MYD1-72, they used yeast as a vessel to express different mutations of the Axl protein. They then labeled Gas6 with a fluorescent molecule so that they could detect which mutated Axl protein it best bound with. Once they found the most effective mutation, they tested it against other promising therapies that target the Axl pathway and that are currently in clinical trials: BGB324 and foretinib. MYD1-72 and foretinib were both able to reduce tumor size and metastasis, but foretinib showed toxicity in the mice. BGB324 showed little in the way of harmful effects on the mice, but did not reduce tumor burden. The researchers further tested their new decoy receptor on pancreatic and ovarian cancer in mice. In ovarian cancer models, they tested the efficacy of MYD1-72 both alone and in conjunction with a DNA-damaging agent called doxorubicin that is commonly used for treatment. They found that alone, MYD1-72 reduced tumor burden by 95 percent. In combination with doxorubicin, most mice ended up with almost complete tumor reduction. In mice with more aggressive forms of ovarian cancer, MYD1-72 alone decreased tumor weight by 51 percent, whereas doxorubicin decreased tumor weight by 91 percent. When used together, the researchers measured a 99 percent reduction of tumor weight. In pancreatic cancer, they also found that MYD1-72 in combination with a DNA-damaging agent called gemcitabine showed greater tumor reduction. Alone, MYD1-72 did not make any impact on the mice s tumor burden. Mice treated with MYD1-72 and gemcitabine together had a three times higher survival rate than mice not on any treatment. These results suggested that a combination therapy of their decoy receptor and DNA-damaging agents could result in significantly lower levels of tumor burden. Hoping to bring therapy to clinic  We are actively working to push this into clinical trials,  said Miao.  But we are also interested in looking at how our molecule affects other types of cancers.  They hope to continue studies on how this decoy receptor could enhance treatments for other types of cancer, such as leukemia.  These pre-clinical models in mice are pretty robust as we ve shown in a number of different tumor settings and now in ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer,  said Giaccia.  But we need to ultimately test this in human cancers.  Source: Story from Stanford University School of Medicine. Original piece written by Yasemin Saplakoglu.

Artificially regulating this pathway might help keep muscles supple in muscular dystrophy or during normal aging, researchers hope. Treating mice with a compound that increases the expression of an inactive protein helped them heal from injury with less scarring, according to a study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The researchers are hopeful that their findings could one day be used to help keep muscles supple during normal aging and to treat people with diseases like muscular dystrophy.  Fibrosis occurs in many degenerative diseases and also in normal aging,  said Thomas Rando, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences.  It negatively impacts muscle regeneration by altering the stem cell niche and inhibiting the stem cell function. In addition, as more scarring occurs, muscles become stiff and can t contract and relax smoothly.  Rando, who is the director of Stanford s Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging, is the senior author of the study, published online Nov. 28 in Nature. Former graduate student Alisa Mueller, MD, PhD, is the lead author. Self-policing stem cells The researchers discovered that stem cells embedded in muscle fibers do some fancy gene-expression footwork in order to respond appropriately to injury, disease or aging. In particular, the cells toggle between producing a full-length, active version of a protein that responds to external signals to divide and a shorter, inactive version of the same protein that attenuates the growth signal and prevents an overly enthusiastic response that can lead to scarring or fibrosis. The researchers studied a protein called platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, or PDGFR alpha, that sits on the surface of muscle-embedded stem cells called fibro-adipogenic progenitors, or FAPs. These stem cells are responsible for generating the connective tissue scaffolding necessary to support muscle development and regeneration.  PDGFR alpha straddles the cell membrane. The portion outside the cell serves as a landing pad for external signals that encourage the FAPs to begin dividing, or proliferating. The interior portion of the protein passes the signal along to other proteins inside the cell to get the ball rolling. Although some proliferation is necessary to repair an injury, an overly enthusiastic response can lead to scarring and fibrosis that inhibits muscle function. So it s imperative the cells strike the right balance in their response. The researchers found that the cells have devised a novel, unexpected way to police themselves. The cells found a way to generate a shortened version of the protein that is missing the interior portion of its structure. This shortened version hangs out on the cells  membranes and sequesters the growth signals away from the active form of PDGFR. Without the interior part of the protein, the message to grow is stopped in its tracks.  We ve found that the cells actively regulate the production of the inhibitory form of the protein, which is very surprising,  said Rando.  If they make less, the degree of fibrosis increases; if they make more, it decreases.  The cells produce the shortened form of the protein by recognizing and using a specific series of nucleotides in the messenger RNA that encodes the instructions to make the PDGFR alpha protein. The nucleotide code tells the cell s messenger RNA-processing machinery to create a shorter-than-normal message. As a result, the protein that is made from that messenger RNA is also truncated. Artificially increasing, decreasing expression Mueller, Rando and their colleagues used a type of small molecule called a vivo-morpholino that can bind and block access to small sections of messenger RNA to artificially increase or decrease expression of the inhibitory version of the PDGFR alpha protein. They found that increasing the amounts of the inhibitory version allowed both young and old mice to heal from injury with less fibrosis and scarring. Conversely, decreasing the amount increased the severity of fibrosis.  We d like to test this approach in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy next,  said Rando.  Interestingly, the vivo-morpholino we used is similar to a small oligonucleotide therapy currently being tested in clinical trials to stimulate the production of proteins missing in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Perhaps we could also use this approach to reduce fibrosis in this disease.  Source: Story from Stanford University School of Medicine. Original piece written by Krista Conger.

It is caused by the worm Onchocerca volvulus, whose larvae migrate through the body, including into the eyes of infected people, making them blind. The parasite is a major socioeconomic issue in the villages and families it affects because sufferers are no longer able to work. In addition other family members, often children, have to give up their studies or work to care for them, further depriving the family of income or future development. Efforts to control Onchocerca rely almost exclusively on a single drug - ivermectin - which has become so important it's discoverers shared the Nobel prize for medicine last year. However, treatment has a potentially fatal side-effect. In many places people are infected with two species of worm at the same time: Onchocerca and its evolutionary near neighbour Loa Loa. Ivermectin not only kills Onchocerca, it also kills Loa   which is often fairly benign and does not affect people too seriously   but killing it can provoke a serious immune reaction (anaphylactic shock) which can kill the patient.  One problem with eradicating river blindness is that we need a way to kill the Onchocerca infection without killing coinfecting Loa Loa and provoking a fatal immune reaction. What we need is a magic bullet that will only target Onchocerca. Dr James Cotton, first author of the study, from the Sanger Institute. To help find the magic bullet, Sanger Institute researchers and colleagues at the New York Blood Center and the US National Institutes of Health have read the entire genome of Onchocerca to understand how it works and discover how it differs from its evolutionary neighbour.  We now have the full map of the river blindness worm from end to end. This is vital because it not only shows what is in the genome, but also what is missing in comparison with Loa Loa. These key differences show us how the biological pathways within the two species  differ, giving us important ways to target Onchocerca, and leave Loa Loa untouched.  Dr Matt Berriman, joint senior author of the study and member of Faculty at the Sanger Institute. One reason why the two species of worm differ is that Onchocerca carries a bacterial passenger in its cells   an endosymbiont. Loa Loa does not. As the bacteria and Onchocerca developed their symbiotic relationship, the worm evolved to rely on the bacteria to supply some of its needs, by losing the genes to make some molecules. Now, if the bacteria die, the worm dies too. These missing genes offer an exciting opportunity to target the worm. One key difference lies in the worm s ability to produce purines. The team worked with ChEMBL (a database of bioactive small drug-like molecules) to match these genetic changes to already existing drugs. They discovered a number of drugs that already have licenses for other uses that could be investigated and trialled. Another possible line of attack offered by the worm s genome lies in the unusually large number of genes for a particular step in synthesising collagen that Onchocerca has. The worm has a protective cuticle   a coat largely made from collagens   but this does not explain why it has so many genes. One theory is that it could be something to do with the parasite needing to change it coat as it grows and passes through people and the insect (a biting fly) that transmits it. The team hope that this mysterious reliance on having so many genes to make collagens will turn out to be a weakness that could also be targeted. Drugs targeting these kinds of gene are already in development for treating collagen-based conditions, and they may be useful in preventing river blindness too.

Now scientists have found that a protein believed to help anchor that city of receptors also helps ensure their formation and function and slow their degradation. See Also: High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency across the board in neuromuscular diseaseThe finding provides new insight into how diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, that disconnect brain and body occur, as it points to novel treatment targets, said neuroscientist Dr. Lin Mei. Mei is chairman of the Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Neuroscience and corresponding author of the study in the journal Neuron. The protein is rapsyn, and the receptors are for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that motor neurons release to activate our muscle cells. Rapsyn is made by our muscle cells and considered a sort of biological anchor that interacts with the acetylcholine receptors to ensure that they are optimally positioned for our muscles to receive orders from our brain. ""For precise, efficient synapse function, the receptors have to be extremely highly concentrated at exactly the right place,"" Mei said. The connection, or synapse, the cells form is called the neuromuscular juncture. During development, neurons in the spinal cord reach out to muscle cells to form this direct line of communication. To make that connection, neurons release the protein agrin, which reaches out to LRP4, a protein on the muscle cell surface. This activates MuSK, an enzyme that supports the clustering of receptors on the muscle cell surface that will enable communication. Learn More: Glutamate plays previously unknown role in neuromuscular development Now Mei and his collaborators have shown that rapsyn does not just help hold these receptors in place on the muscle cell, but also functions as an enzyme to help drive the formation of the neuromuscular juncture through a process called neddylation. In fact, agrin and MuSK also aid this neddylation. The newly discovered action occurs in one of three domains, or parts, of rapsyn called RING, whose specific function was previously unknown. Rapsyn's classic scaffolding function is in another portion; a third portion has a still unknown role. The RING finding is a bit of a surprise since in biology anchor proteins like rapsyn typically don't have this enzymatic activity. ""This anchor is active,"" Mei said. In fact, this is the synapse brain protein found that appears to have both these essential jobs with receptors. It was known that there's a lot of rapsyn near the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular juncture and there is fairly constant turnover of both. The new finding indicates that rapsyn helps ensure plenty of receptors are always present in this dynamic environ. Don't Miss: Understanding the fascinating interaction between bone and brain Rapsyn mutations that result in receptors not clustering or functioning properly likely contribute to a wide range of muscle weakness seen in muscular dystrophy, Mei said. This includes congenital myasthenic syndrome, which most often affects facial muscles and may first show up as drooping eyelids. Even before the function of the RING portion was known, others had found that defects or deletions specifically in this portion of rapsyn cause human fetuses to be stillborn, likely because of their inability to breathe, said Mei, a dramatic indicator of the domain's essential role in development of the nerve-muscle connection. Mice cannot survive without the enzymatic action of rapysn, the MCG scientists have shown. ""Fundamentally, it provides a novel mechanism for synapse formation,"" Mei said. ""Translationally, by identifying this novel enzymatic activity, presumably, you could develop a therapeutic way to make it more active."" They still have plenty of questions, like if rapsyn also changes the function of the receptors, as Mei suspects. They also want to see if mutations in these other parts of rapsyn impact the enzymatic role of the RING domain, since there is evidence that mutations in other portions also can lead to deadly breathing problems. The scientists also are pursuing the function of the third rapsyn portion. Read Next: Stimulating the brain makes exercising the legs feel easierAnd that's only the tip of the iceberg and a clue, Mei theorizes, to also take a look at anchor proteins throughout the body, including the brain itself. He is already looking at classic anchoring proteins, such as PSD-95, in the neuron-to-neuron connections, for any evidence of enzymatic activity and potential new therapeutic targets there.

But there is far less known about the details of how sleep deprivation affects children's brains and what this means for early brain development. See Also: Sleep deprivation leads to symptoms of schizophrenia ""The process of sleep may be involved in brain 'wiring' in childhood and thus affect brain maturation,"" explains Salome Kurth, first author of the study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, and a researcher at the University Hospital of Zurich. ""This research shows an increase in sleep need in posterior brain regions in children."" This contrasts with what researchers know about the effects of sleep deprivation in adults, where the effect is typically concentrated in the frontal regions of the brain. After staying up too late, both children and adults need a period of deep sleep to recover. This recovery phase is characterized by an increase in an electrical pattern called slow-wave activity, which can be measured with a non-invasive technique called an electroencephalogram. With a large number of electrode channels distributed across the scalp, this method also detects which brain regions show more slow-wave activity than others. Related: Developing brain regions in children hardest hit by sleep deprivationSupported by a large student team, Kurth and her colleagues, Monique LeBourgeois professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, and Sean Deoni , professor at Brown University, studied the effects of 50 percent sleep deprivation in a group of 13 children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. The team first measured the children's deep sleep patterns during a normal night's sleep. They then re-measured on another night after the researchers had kept the children up well past their bedtimes by reading and playing games with them. After only getting half of a night's worth of sleep, the children showed more slow-wave activity towards the back regions of the brain the parieto-occipital areas. This suggests that the brain circuitry in these regions may be particularly susceptible to a lack of sleep. The team also measured how this deep sleep activity correlated with the myelin content of the brain a cornerstone of brain development. Myelin is a fatty microstructure of the brain's white matter that allows electrical information between brain cells to travel faster. It can be measured with a specific magnetic resonance imaging technique. ""The results show that the sleep loss effect on the brain is specific to certain regions and that this correlates with the myelin content of the directly adjacent regions: the more myelin in a specific area, the more the effect appears similar to adults,"" says Kurth. ""It is possible that this effect is temporary and only occurs during a 'sensitive period' when the brain undergoes developmental changes."" Don't Miss: How sleep deprivation harms memoryFurther exploration is needed before drawing any conclusions about how insufficient sleep affects early brain developmental processes in the longer term. But for now, these results suggest that going to bed too late may have a different impact on kids' brains than on adults'. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

See Also: Key molecular process in brain is different in males and females The researchers used an eye tracking device on almost 500 participants at the Science Museum over a five-week period to monitor and judge how much eye contact they felt comfortable with while looking at a face on a computer screen. They found that women looked more at the left-hand side of faces and had a strong left eye bias, but that they also explored the face much more than men. The team observed that it was possible to tell the gender of the participant based on the scanning pattern of how they looked at the face with nearly 80 per cent accuracy. Given the very large sample size the researchers suggest this is not due to chance. Lead author Dr Antoine Coutrot from QMUL's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences said: ""This study is the first demonstration of a clear gender difference in how men and women look at faces. Don't Miss: Declining intelligence in old age linked to visual processing ""We are able to establish the gender of the participant based on how they scan the actors' face, and can eliminate that it isn't based on the culture of the participant as nearly 60 nationalities have been tested.

The participants were asked to judge how comfortable the amount of eye contact they made with the actor in a Skype-like scenario.

The scientists from the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital at McGill University, led by Peter McPherson, along with collaborators in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany, and at SickKids Hospital and the University of Toronto, have discovered that a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene DENND5A. Their findings are published in the American Journal of Human Genetics. See Also: Research breakthrough to treat female-specific epilepsy Epileptic encephalopathy is a rare but devastating sub-form of epilepsy that results in severe mental and physical disabilities in children from birth. It is often caused by improper development of the brain. Individuals with epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in DENND5A present with serious anomalies in brain structure along with calcifications in the brain and altered facial features. Researchers performed whole exome sequencing on three children with epileptic encephalopathy from two families, one from Saudi Arabia and another from Jordan. Both families were consanguineous, meaning the parents were related to each other. This greatly increases the chance that rare mutations that are recessive and that cause no harm to the parents are expressed in the children. The whole exome sequencing, along with extensive and complex genetic analysis, revealed that recessive mutations in DENND5A were responsible for the disease, with the Saudi family and the Jordanian family having different mutations but in the same DENND5A gene. They found that mutations in DENND5A lead to a lack of the DENND5A protein, resulting in underdevelopment of the central nervous system. The protein expressed from the DENND5A gene is present at highest levels in the nervous system especially while the brain is developing, corroborating the evidence that mutations in the gene cause epileptic encephalopathy. Related: Dragnet for epilepsy genes The researchers discovered that the DENND5A protein controls the movement of receptors for key developmental factors called neurotrophins. Disruption of DENND5A function leads to altered levels of these receptors, which could explain why loss of DENND5A leads to the severe neurological developmental defects in the patients. Epilepsy affects approximately three per cent of the world population, and epileptic encephalopathy is a rare sub-form of the disease. It is difficult to say how many children with epileptic encephalopathy have the DENND5A mutations, but now that the gene has been identified as a cause, researchers around the world can begin to test patients for mutations in this gene. This finding also improves our understanding of neuronal development. The observation that loss-of-function mutations in DENND5A causes epileptic encephalopathy suggests that DENND5A protein controls membrane trafficking pathways critical for  normal neuronal development and strengthens the argument that protein trafficking processes in cells are critical for normal neuronal development and function. Read Next: Scientists track down possible new treatment for epilepsy""Our study demonstrates the importance of membrane trafficking in neuronal development and it provides a new pathophysiological mechanism for this disease type. This will allow physicians around the world to test if mutations in DENND5A are causing the disease in their patients, and also to provide genetic counselling for affected families,"" says Dr. Chanshuai Han, the lead author on the study.

The research, from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Harvard Medical School, shows that the therapy activates the immune system s T cells, which then attack the abnormal skin cells. The study, which involved patients with actinic keratosis, a precursor to a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, is published Nov. 21 in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.  We looked at precancerous lesions on patients with sun-damaged skin,  said Washington University dermatologist and study co-author Lynn A. Cornelius, MD, director of the Division of Dermatology.  Most commonly found on the face, scalp and arms, these lesions appear abnormal by visual examination and under the microscope but are not full-blown skin cancers. But because these lesions have the potential to develop into a true skin cancer, they are commonly treated. Our study shows this combination therapy is more effective and better tolerated than current treatment practices.  On average, the investigational therapy reduced the number of precancerous skin lesions on the face by almost 88 percent compared with a 26 percent reduction using the standard chemotherapy. While some side effects such as skin scaling and itching were similar with both treatments, patients receiving the investigational therapy reported more redness and increased burning sensations, which are consistent with the immune response it triggers. Interestingly, although not specifically measured, patients who had been treated previously with conventional therapies reported decreased pain and discomfort with the combination treatment, according to Cornelius, who is also the Winfred A. and Emma R. Showman Professor of Dermatology. The investigational treatment combines a cream formulation of a chemotherapy drug called 5-fluorouracil with a synthetic form of vitamin D called calcipotriol. Topical 5-fluorouracil alone is prescribed to treat actinic keratosis. Calcipotriol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of psoriasis, an autoimmune disorder characterized by red, scaly patches of skin. Past studies of mice prone to allergic inflammation, especially eczema rash on the skin, have shown that they also are resistant to developing skin cancer. These observations suggested that overreactive immunity triggered by damaged skin may have a beneficial side effect   a hyper-vigilant immune system that also attacks any cancerous cells that may form. Earlier work at Washington University by senior author Shadmehr Demehri, MD, PhD, now at Harvard Medical School, showed that a protein called TSLP in the skin activates the immune system s T cells, which then attack tumor cells. Calcipotriol also was known to cause the skin to produce TSLP.  The idea behind this study was to induce a heightened immune response in the skin using calcipotriol combined with the 5-fluorouracil that works to destroy the precancerous cells,  Cornelius said.  In so doing, the destroyed precancerous cells release cell proteins, or antigens, and facilitate the heightened immune system to respond. We compared the two-drug formulation to 5-fluorouracil alone over a shorter application period   four days as opposed to two to four weeks that is typical for the standard treatment of 5-fluorouracil alone.  The current study involved 132 patients with actinic keratosis treated at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Sixty-five of these patients were randomly assigned to receive the investigational drug combination of 5-fluorouracil plus calcipotriol. The remaining 67 served as a control group and received the standard 5-fluorouracil plus Vaseline petroleum jelly. Patients applied the assigned cream twice daily for four days. Patients in the investigational and control groups began the trial with similar numbers of precancerous lesions on each part of the body examined. At each body site evaluated, there were on average about 15 lesions on the face, 22 lesions on the scalp, 14 lesions on the right arm and 12 on the left arm. Following treatment, facial lesions were reduced by 88 percent in the investigational group versus 26 percent in the control group. On the scalp, lesions were reduced by 76 percent in the investigational group compared with about 6 percent for the control group. On the right arm, the reduction was 69 percent for the investigational treatment versus about 10 percent for the control. On the left arm, the precancerous lesions were reduced by 79 percent for the investigational treatment compared with 16 percent for the control.  Because calcipotriol has been shown to induce an immune response, we are now interested in seeing if the anti-tumor immunity of the activated T cells can be recalled later to help prevent both precancerous and cancerous skin lesions,  Cornelius said.  We are now planning to re-contact our patients to determine whether there are differences in precancerous and skin cancer rates between the two treatment groups.

Previously unclear was how its protein abundance is regulated in the cells. Researchers at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and the Technical University of Munich, working in collaboration with colleagues from ETH Z rich, now report in  Cell Systems  that the more Nanog there is on hand, the less reproduction there is. Every stem cell researcher knows the protein Nanog because it ensures that these all-rounders continue to renew. A controversial debate revolved around how the quantity of Nanog protein in the cell is regulated. ""So far it was often assumed that Nanog activates itself in order to preserve the pluripotency in embryonic stem cells,"" explains Dr. Carsten Marr. He heads the Quantitative Single Cell Dynamics research group at the Institute of Computational Biology (ICB) of the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen. Together with colleagues from ETH Z rich, he and his team have developed an algorithm called STILT (Stochastic Inference on Lineage Trees) that now rebuts this assumption.  Using STILT, the scientists evaluated time-resolved protein expression data from individual cells in which Nanog could be detected through fusion with a fluorescence protein. ""We compared the Nanog dynamics that were measured in this way with three different models. One of the challenges here was the quantitative comparison of the models, and another was taking stem cell divisions into account in the algorithm,"" reports first author Dr. Justin Feigelman, who had moved from the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen to ETH Z rich as a postdoc. ""The results show that Nanog is regulated by a so-called negative feedback loop, which means that the more Nanog there is in the cells, the less reproduction there will be.""  Carried over from the computer to the petri dish  In order to check these results, the scientists calculated what would happen if there were an artificial increase in Nanog protein levels. ""We then actually succeeded in confirming the hypothesis put forward by STILT in an additional single-cell experiment with increased Nanog,"" explains study leader Marr.  Thanks to their research, the scientists promise a better understanding for stem cell renewal and hope that this knowledge might be useful for medical applications in the future. ""We will also be applying STILT to other time-resolved single cell data in the future, which will give us insight into the underlying molecular gene regulation mechanisms,"" Marr explains.

Through live cell imaging, they were able to identify a new triarylmethane compound that can rapidly inhibit cell division in plant cells. They also found that this new compound does not have an effect on the cell division of animal cells, and that cell division restarts in plant cells upon removal of the compound. Being able to control the cell division in plant cells may be effective in controlling plant growth. Thus, the selectivity and reversibility of this new triarylmethane compound on the cell division of plant cells makes it a good candidate for an agrochemical. Plant growth occurs by increasing the number of cells by cell division followed by enlargement of the cells. Thus, it has been considered that if there is a way to control cell division in plants, this will lead to the control of plant growth in a range of plant species. Although various compounds that can control cell division in plants have been explored in the past, they have mainly resulted in damage to the plant shape or irreversible inhibition of cell division despite removal of the compounds. ""As part of ITbM's interdisciplinary research initiative, we decided to search for new compounds that can inhibit the cell division in plants without causing damage to them,"" says Minako Ueda, a plant biologist and a leader of this study. ""Being in the Mix Lab (special labs that have researchers from different disciplines mixed together) at ITbM, I was able to talk to an organic chemist, Masakazu Nambo, who suggested the use of triarylmethane compounds for cell division inhibition in plant cells,"" she continues. ""We had reported a new catalytic reaction in December 2013, to rapidly synthesize triarylmethanes in 3 steps from readily available starting materials, using a palladium catalyst,"" says Masakazu Nambo, an organic chemist and another leader of this study. ""Triarylmethanes have not really been used before on plants, but we were able to visualize their effect on Tobacco plant cells using live cell imaging. We started this research about 3 years ago, but we were fortunate to be able to identify a triarylmethane compound that can rapidly inhibit cell division in plants,"" he continues. Triarylmethanes are a group of compounds that derive from methane (a molecule consisting of carbon with 4 hydrogen atoms attached to it) and consist of a carbon atom center with 3 aryl (aromatic ring) groups and a hydrogen atom. This structure can be found in organic materials, such as dyes and fluorescent probes, as well as in natural products. Some compounds containing the triarylmethane moiety are known to exhibit anticancer properties, and many new compounds have been synthesized to investigate their bioactivities. ""Our palladium-catalyzed sequential arylation reaction has been highly useful to rapidly synthesize a variety of triarylmethanes to be used for testing their effect on the cell division in plants,"" says Nambo. ""We used a Tobacco plant cell attached with a fluorescent probe to visualize the cell division process,"" says Ueda. ""We added the triarylmethane compounds to the cultivated cells and investigated whether cell division had occurred or not by realtime live cell imaging."" ""As a result of screening about 200 compounds, we found that (3-furyl)diphenylmethane (chem7), which is a triarylmethane that contains 2 phenyl groups and a furyl (a 5-membered aromatic ring containing 4 carbons and an oxygen atom in the ring) group, had strong inhibitory activity on plant cell division,"" says Ueda. When the furyl moiety was replaced with other aromatic groups, or when one of the benzene rings was removed, the cell division inhibitory activity was not observed, suggesting that a triarylmethane structure containing both the benzene and the furan rings are necessary for their bioactivity. ""Although I did not have any issues about working with compounds directly synthesized by chemists, I was initially surprised to receive compounds that were not necessarily soluble in the solvents that I was using in my biological experiments,"" says Ueda. ""It was exciting to test new compounds and I was astonished by the speed that the compounds were being synthesized. The speed of compounds being generated was faster than the speed that we could test them on the cells."" The group also tested whether chem7 could inhibit cell division in other plants, or in other developing tissues. By applying chem7 to the young seeds and roots of a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, the group found that rapid inhibition of cell division was observed in both tissues. ""We saw that chem7 had hardly any effect on the shapes of the cells and tissues, thus, suggesting that chem7 stops cell division in plant cells, but does not cause any severe damage to the shapes,"" describes Ueda. ""With the help of animal biologists, we found that chem7 had no effect on budding yeasts and human cells, which indicates that chem7 does not inhibit the cell division of animal cells."" Cell division consists of several phases, including the M phase where the cells actually divide (M = mitosis), the S phase where the DNA is copied and prepares for division (S = synthesis) and the G1/G2 phase in between (G = gap). These phases (cell cycle) are repeated leading to cell division. In order to figure out which phase that chem7 actually acts upon, Ueda and her team used two fluorescent proteins of different colors to visualize the process of the cell cycles in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana. (Green indicates the M phase and red indicates the S and G2 phases.) ""As the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana contain cells at various phases, it was possible to observe different phases, shown in green and red,"" explains Ueda. ""Upon addition of chem7 to the roots, we found that both colors existed but the area that contains fluoresced cells (tissues with high cell division activity) became smaller."" This indicates that chem7 does not target a specific plant cell phase, but exhibits cell inhibitory activity regardless of the phase. The group concluded that chem7 causes no severe damage to the shapes of cells and tissues by being able to rapidly stop the cell activity at any cell phase. In addition, when chem7 was washed away from the roots and cultivated cells treated with chem7, cell division was observed again, indicating that the effect of chem7 is not lethal. ""Through the collaboration with chemists and biologists, we were fortunate to discover a new compound that can selectively inhibit the cell division of plant cells regardless of the cell phase,"" says Ueda and Nambo. ""chem7 rapidly stops cell division and plant growth without causing drastic damage to the shapes or functions of the cells."" ""It was nice to be able to come together and discuss research with people from different research fields. We are currently carrying out further studies to generate new compounds that can rapidly and reversibly control plant growth without causing harm to humans and bacteria in the surrounding environment, which can potentially work as agrochemicals,"" they speak.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/first-steps-to-neutralising-zika-194678,First Steps to Neutralising Zika Researchers have discovered a highly potent antibody that neutralises Zika infection at a cellular level  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. As Zika spreads throughout the world, the call for rapid development of therapeutics to treat Zika rings loud and clear. Taking a step further in identifying a possible therapeutic candidate, a team of researchers at Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), in collaboration with scientists from the University of North Carolina, have discovered the mechanism by which C10, a human antibody previously identified to react with the Dengue virus, prevents Zika infection at a cellular level. Previously, C10 was identified as one of the most potent antibodies able to neutralise Zika infection. Now, Associate Prof Lok Shee-Mei and her team at the Emerging Infectious Disease Programme of Duke-NUS have taken it one step further by determining how C10 is able to prevent Zika infection. To infect a cell, virus particles usually undergo two main steps, docking and fusion, which are also common targets for disruption when developing viral therapeutics. During docking, the virus particle identifies specific sites on the cell and binds to them. With Zika infection, docking then initiates the cell to take the virus in via an endosome   a separate compartment within the cell body. Proteins within the virus coat undergo structural changes to fuse with the membrane of the endosome, thereby releasing the virus genome into the cell, and completing the fusion step of infection. Using a method called cryoelectron microscopy, which allows for the visualisation of extremely small particles and their interactions, the team visualised C10 interacting with the Zika virus under different pHs, so as to mimic the different environments both the antibody and virus will find themselves in throughout infection. They showed that C10 binds to the main protein that makes up the Zika virus coat, regardless of pH, and locks these proteins into place, preventing the structural changes required for the fusion step of infection. Without fusion of the virus to the endosome, viral DNA is prevented from entering the cell, and infection is thwarted.  Hopefully, these results will further accelerate the development of C10 as a Zika therapy to combat its effects of microcephaly and Guillain-Barr  syndrome. This should emphasise the need for further studies of the effect of C10 on Zika infection in animal models,  commented Dr Lok.  By defining the structural basis for neutralization, these studies provide further support for the idea that this antibody will protect against Zika infection, potentially leading to a new therapy to treat this dreaded disease,  says Ralph Baric, PhD, professor in the Department of Epidemiology at UNC s Gillings School of Global Public Health. These findings suggest that C10 may be developed as a therapy for Zika infection, and should be further explored. In addition, disrupting fusion with C10 may prove to be more effective in preventing Zika infection compared with therapies that attempt to disrupt docking. This is because the fusion step is critical for Zika infection, while the virus may develop other mechanisms to overcome disruptions to the docking step. With the call for rapid development of Zika therapies, C10 has emerged as a front runner to answer this call. Source: Story from Duke-NUS Medical School.

The genetic circuit produces the machinery necessary to produce a compound that inhibits a protein which has a significant and critical role in the growth and survival of cancer cells. This results in the cancer cells being unable to survive in the low oxygen, low nutrient tumour micro-environment. As tumours develop and grow, they rapidly outstrip the supply of oxygen delivered by existing blood vessels. This results in cancer cells needing to adapt to low oxygen environment. To enable them to survive, adapt and grow in the low-oxygen or  hypoxic  environments, tumours contain increased levels of a protein called Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 senses reduced oxygen levels and triggers many changes in cellular function, including a changed metabolism and sending signals for the formation of new blood vessels. It is thought that tumours primarily hijack the function of this protein (HIF-1) to survival and grow. Professor Ali Tavassoli, who led the study with colleague Dr. Ishna Mistry, explains:  In an effort to better understand the role of HIF-1 in cancer, and to demonstrate the potential for inhibiting this protein in cancer therapy, we engineered a human cell line with an additional genetic circuit that produces the HIF-1 inhibiting molecule when placed in a hypoxic environment.  We ve been able to show that the engineered cells produce the HIF-1 inhibitor, and this molecule goes on to inhibit HIF-1 function in cells, limiting the ability of these cells to survive and grow in a nutrient-limited environment as expected.  In a wider sense, we have given these engineered cells the ability to fight back   to stop a key protein from functioning in cancer cells. This opens up the possibility for the production and use of sentinel circuits, which produce other bioactive compounds in response to environmental or cellular changes, to target a range of diseases including cancer.  The genetic circuit is incorporated onto the chromosome of a human cell line, which encodes the protein machinery required for the production of their cyclic peptide HIF-1 inhibitor. The production of the HIF-1 inhibitor occurs in response to hypoxia in these cells. The research team demonstrated that even when produced directly in cells, this molecule still prevents the HIF-1 signalling and the associated adaptation to hypoxia in these cells. The next step for the researchers is to demonstrate the viability of this approach to the production and delivery of an anticancer molecule in a whole tumour model system. Professor Tavassoli adds:  The main application for this work is that it eliminates the need for the synthesis of our inhibitor, so that biologists conducting research into HIF function can easily access our molecule and hopefully discover more about the role of HIF-1 in cancer. This will also let us understand whether inhibiting HIF-1 function alone is enough to block cancer growth in relevant models. Another interesting aspect to the work is that it demonstrates the possibility of adding new machinery to human cells to enable them to make therapeutic agents in response to disease signals.

But new research indicates that such patients, paradoxically, may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug. Treatment with the less intensive drug, decitabine, is not a cure. But surprisingly, AML patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called TP53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine.  The study, by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published Nov. 24 in The New England Journal of Medicine. In AML, treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patient s leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission. If successful, a follow-up bone-marrow transplant can offer a possible cure, but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications, even death.  What s really unique here is that all the patients in the study with TP53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission,  said the study s senior author, Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Medicine, noting that in AML, TP53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis.  With standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies.  The findings need to be validated in a larger trial,  Ley added,  but they do suggest that TP53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine, potentially prolonging survival in this ultra high-risk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates.  Elihu Estey, MD, an AML expert at the University of Washington Medical Center, noted that AML is not one disease but many, each driven by different genetic mutations. The results of the current trial, he said, point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients, with treatments targeted to their specific mutations. The current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. The patients either had AML   a cancer of the bone marrow   or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a group of blood cancers that often progresses to AML. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease. Decitabine often is given to older patients with AML or MDS because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies. But fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission, so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients  cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment. To find out, they sequenced all the genes in patients  cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes. They also conducted standard tests to look for broken, missing or rearranged chromosomes. Then, the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine. Among the patients in the study, 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine. But, remarkably, all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried TP53 mutations went into remission. Patients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an  unfavorable risk  prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells; many of these patients also had TP53 mutations. Indeed, 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission, compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses.  The challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond,  said co-author Amanda Cashen, MD, an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with AML.  The value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit. This information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients, but also younger patients who carry TP53 mutations.  First author John Welch, MD, PhD, added:  It s important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis, which is encouraging. We don t yet understand why patients with TP53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine, and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon.  Responses to decitabine are usually short-lived, however, with remissions typically lasting for about a year. Decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry TP53 mutations, and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug, leading to relapse.  Remissions with decitabine typically don t last long, and no one was cured with this drug,  Ley explained.  But patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy, and that can mean something. Some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life, because the chemotherapy is not too toxic.  Roughly 10 percent of AML patients carry TP53 mutations in their leukemia cells. Among patients in the study with such mutations, median survival was 12.7 months   which is not significantly different from the 15.4 months  survival seen in patients without the mutations   and is longer than the typical four- to six-month survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies.  We re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,  Welch said.  It s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.

This is good news for researchers, including cancer and stem cell researchers, who use fluorescent proteins to track essential cellular processes. The researchers at the University of Amsterdam, the Institut de Biologie Structurale and the European Synchrotron in Grenoble describe their approach in the latest edition of the journal Nature Methods. Biologists often employ a trick to understand how a (human) cell divides, secretes a hormone or transmits a signal to another cell. They attach small coloured lights to their proteins of interest in order to trace their movements and interactions in living cells under the microscope. The more colours of lights they use, the more processes they can track simultaneously. Scientists used a fluorescent protein as a colour code in a cell for the first time in the 1990s. That protein was green and originated from a fluorescent jellyfish. By tinkering with that green protein, scientists were able to develop blue, turquoise and yellow variants in the years that followed. In the 2000s a red fluorescent protein was discovered in corals. However, nobody succeeded in developing a versatile and bright-red light in the cell   until now. Protein mScarlet Professor of Molecular Cytology Dorus Gadella and doctoral researchers Daphne Bindels and Lindsay Haarbosch have succeeded in creating a spectacularly bright-red fluorescent protein. They have dubbed the protein mScarlet and expect it to be used by research groups across the world, for example to gain a better understanding of how disruption of cellular processes causes uncontrolled cell division found in cancer cells. Gadella:  Just as other people study the stars and prepare future trips to Mars, we are exploring the universe of the proteins that regulate the cellular processes within our bodies.  The research group created mScarlet by comparing the genetic blueprints of a range of red fluorescent proteins from corals. They searched for sequences that consistently occurred in the various genetic codes since these apparently are indispensable. The group assembled these essential pieces of code and then had a company synthesise a complete DNA strand. They introduced that synthetic DNA into a bacterium, which converted it into a protein. They assessed the brightness of each protein produced in this way under a microscope and then tinkered some more with the DNA code, observing how modifications affected the brightness. The entire process was a kind of lab-based evolutionary experiment which resulted in Gadella and his colleagues creating mScarlet, the protein with the highest brightness.   That brightness will serve cellular microscopy well as it ensures the visibility of the proteins studied by scientists. Moreover, mScarlet is an ideal illuminating agent as it does not affect the functioning of the proteins to which it is tagged. Source: Story from the University of Amsterdam.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-method-for-analyzing-crystal-structure-202767,New Method for Analyzing Crystal Structure Exotic materials called photonic crystals reveal their internal characteristics with new method  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new technique developed by MIT researchers reveals the inner details of photonic crystals, synthetic materials whose exotic optical properties are the subject of widespread research. Photonic crystals are generally made by drilling millions of closely spaced, minuscule holes in a slab of transparent material, using variations of microchip-fabrication methods. Depending on the exact orientation, size, and spacing of these holes, these materials can exhibit a variety of peculiar optical properties, including  superlensing,  which allows for magnification that pushes beyond the normal theoretical limits, and  negative refraction,  in which light is bent in a direction opposite to its path through normal transparent materials. But to understand exactly how light of various colors and from various directions moves through photonic crystals requires extremely complex calculations. Researchers often use highly simplified approaches; for example they may only calculate the behavior of light along a single direction or for a single color. Instead, the new technique makes the full range of information directly visible. Researchers can use a straightforward laboratory setup to display the information   a pattern of so-called  iso-frequency contours    in a graphical form that can be simply photographed and examined, in many cases eliminating the need for calculations. The method is described this week in the journal Science Advances, in a paper by MIT postdoc Bo Zhen, recent Wellesley College graduate and MIT affiliate Emma Regan, MIT professors of physics Marin Solja i  and John Joannopoulos, and four others. The discovery of this new technique, Zhen explains, came about by looking closely at a phenomenon that the researchers had noticed and even made use of for years, but whose origins they hadn t previously understood. Patterns of scattered light seemed to fan out from samples of photonic materials when the samples were illuminated by laser light. The scattering was surprising, since the underlying crystalline structure was fabricated to be almost perfect in these materials.  When we would try to do a lasing measurement, we would always see this pattern,  Zhen says.  We saw this shape, but we didn t know what was happening.  But it did help them to get their experimental setup properly aligned, because the scattered light pattern would appear as soon as the laser beam was properly lined up with the crystal. Upon careful analysis, they realized the scattering patterns were generated by tiny defects in the crystal   holes that were not perfectly round in shape or that were slightly tapered from one end to the other.  There is fabrication disorder even in the best samples that can be made,  Regan says.  People think that the scattering would be very weak, because the sample is nearly perfect,  but it turns out that at certain angles and frequencies, the light scatters very strongly; as much as 50 percent of the incoming light can be scattered. By illuminating the sample in turn with a sequence of different colors, it is possible to build up a full display of the relative paths light beams take, all across the visible spectrum. The scattered light produces a direct view of the iso-frequency contours   a sort of topographic map of the way light beams of different colors bend as they pass through the photonic crystal.  This is a very beautiful, very direct way to observe the iso-frequency contours,  Solja i  says.  You just shine light at the sample, with the right direction and frequency,  and what comes out is a direct image of the needed information, he says. The finding could potentially be useful for a number of different applications, the team says. For example, it could lead to a way of making large, transparent display screens, where most light would pass straight through as if through a window, but light of specific frequencies would be scattered to produce a clear image on the screen. Or, the method could be used to make private displays that would only be visible to the person directly in front of the screen. Because it relies on imperfections in the fabrication of the crystal, this method could also be used as a quality-control measure for manufacturing of such materials; the images provide an indication of not only the total amount of imperfections, but also their specific nature   that is, whether the dominant disorder in the sample comes from noncircular holes or etches that aren t straight   so that the process can be tuned and improved.  Using a clever trick, the Solja i  group turned what is ordinarily a nuisance (i.e., unavoidable disorder in nanofabrication) to their advantage,  says Mikael Rechtsman, an assistant professor of physics at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved in this work.  The random scattering caused by the disorder allowed them to directly image the iso-frequency contours of the photonic crystal slab structure. Since any nanofabricated structure always has some degree of disorder, and since disorder is invariably difficult to model a priori in simulations, their method provides an extremely convenient characterization tool for photonic crystal resonant mode band structures.  Rechtsman adds,  This could become an essential tool in the hunt for high-power single-mode semiconductor lasers (in particular, photonic crystal surface emitting lasers), with wide-ranging applications including telecommunications and manufacturing.

Particularly common among Mediterranean populations, this genetic disease is characterized by inflammation, fever and severe pain. Because of its complex diagnosis, patients often remain untreated for many years, which can eventually lead to kidney failure. In collaboration with Ghent University Hospital and Antwerp University Hospital, VIB and Ghent University are now planning clinical trials  to further validate immunodiagnosis of FMF.  In the Mediterranean basin, including the Middle East and Caucasus, FMF has a prevalence between 1 and 2 per 1,000 inhabitants. FMF is usually diagnosed during childhood, after which a daily, lifelong treatment is necessary. However, accurate diagnosis is complicated by a number of factors: other autoinflammatory diseases show similar symptoms, the clinical picture is often incomplete in young children, atypical signs may occur, and a suggestive family history is sometimes lacking. Wrong or late diagnosis often even leads to unnecessary surgery and, ultimately, kidney failure. Worldwide interest The lab of professor Mohamed Lamkanfi (VIB-Ghent University) developed an alternative for today s inadequate diagnosis, efficiently segregating FMF patients from people suffering from other autoinflammatory diseases and healthy individuals. The tool detects changes in the body s immune reaction to pyrin, a protein that is usually mutated in FMF. Following successful tests on mice, the tool has been validated in 13 patients in collaboration with physicians from Belgium and Italy.  Prof. Mohamed Lamkanfi (VIB-Ghent University):  As next steps, we are setting up clinical trials in Belgium for which we are actively seeking volunteers   both FMF patients and people suffering from related inflammatory disorders. These trials are funded by, among other parties, the European Research Council and FWO (Research Foundation   Flanders). In addition, labs from the Netherlands and Italy have already expressed interest. We are also exploring possible collaborations with industrial partners in order to make our method available as a diagnostic kit.  Patent application The new tool could be good news for thousands of people with a Mediterranean background. However, in rare cases, FMF also affects other people. Prof. Lamkanfi and his team have expressed the ambition to start the clinical trials as soon as possible. Meanwhile, a patent application for the invention has been submitted. Source: Story from VIB.

Typically, research on brain activity relies on average brain measurements across entire groups of people. In a new study, Elizabeth Davison of Princeton University, New Jersey, and colleagues describe a novel method to characterize and compare the brain dynamics of individual people. See Also: Stress hormone elevation associated with working memory deficits in aging The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record healthy people's brain activity during memory tasks, attention tasks, and at rest. For each person, fMRI data was recast as a network composed of brain regions and the connections between them. The scientists then use this network to measure how closely different groups of connections changed together over time. They found that, regardless of whether a person is using memory, directing attention, or resting, the number of synchronous groups of connections within one brain is consistent for that person. However, between people, these numbers vary dramatically. Related: New clues about the aging brain's memory functionsDuring memory specifically, variations between people are closely linked to age. Younger participants have only a few large synchronous groups that link nearly the entire brain in coordinated activity, while older participants show progressively more and smaller groups of connections, indicating loss of cohesive brain activity even in the absence of memory impairment. ""This method elegantly captures important differences between individual brains, which are often complex and difficult to describe,"" Davison says.

In experiments involving 120 student participants, individuals who learned a series of words and images by retrieval practice showed no impairment in memory after experiencing acute stress. Participants who used study practice, the conventional method of re-reading material to memorize it, remembered fewer items overall, particularly after stress. See Also: Stress hormone elevation associated with working memory deficits in aging ""Typically, people under stress are less effective at retrieving information from memory. We now show for the first time that the right learning strategy, in this case retrieval practice or taking practice tests, results in such strong memory representations that even under high levels of stress, subjects are still able to access their memories,"" said senior study author Ayanna Thomas, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the graduate program in psychology at Tufts. ""Our results suggest that it is not necessarily a matter of how much or how long someone studies, but how they study,"" said Amy Smith, graduate student in psychology at Tufts and corresponding author on the study. The research team asked participants to learn a set of 30 words and 30 images. These were introduced through a computer program, which displayed one item at a time for a few seconds each. To simulate note taking, participants were given 10 seconds to type a sentence using the item immediately after seeing it. One group of participants then studied using retrieval practice, and took timed practice tests in which they freely recalled as many items as they could remember. The other group used study practice. For these participants, items were re-displayed on the computer screen, one at a time, for a few seconds each. Participants were given multiple timed periods to study. Learn More: Can a brain scan early in stress predict eventual memory loss?After a 24-hour break, half of each group was placed into a stress-inducing scenario. These participants were required to give an unexpected, impromptu speech and solve math problems in front of two judges, three peers and a video camera. Participants took two memory tests, in which they recalled the words or images they studied the previous day. These tests were taken during the stress scenario and twenty minutes after, to examine memory under immediate and delayed stress responses. The remaining study participants took their memory tests during and after a time-matched, non-stressful task. Stressed individuals who learned through retrieval practice remembered an average of around 11 items out of each set of 30 words and images, compared to 10 items for their non-stressed counterparts. Participants who learned through study practice remembered fewer words overall, with an average of 7 items for stressed individuals and an average of a little under 9 items for those who were not stressed. ""Even though previous research has shown that retrieval practice is one of the best learning strategies available, we were still surprised at how effective it was for individuals under stress. It was as if stress had no effect on their memory,"" Smith said. ""Learning by taking tests and being forced to retrieve information over and over has a strong effect on long-term memory retention, and appears to continue to have great benefits in high-stakes, stressful situations."" While a robust body of evidence has previously shown that stress impairs memory, few studies have examined whether this relationship can be affected by different learning strategies. The current results now suggest that learning information in an effective manner, such as through retrieval practice, can protect memory against the adverse effects of stress. Although the research team used an experimentally verified stress-inducing scenario (Trier Social Stress Test) and measured participant stress responses through heart-rate monitors and standardized self-reported questionnaires, they note that stress effects are variable between individuals and additional work is needed to expand on their results. The team is now engaged in studies to replicate and extend their findings, including whether retrieval practice can benefit complex situations such as learning a foreign language or stressful scenarios outside of a testing environment.

This is an important method for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) used to treat hematological malignancies such as leukemia. G-CSF is essential for treatment of hematological malignancies and other types of cancers, but the mechanism for its unfavorable side effects has not been elucidated until now. The findings from this research revealed not only the mechanism of the unfavorable effects of G-CSF, but also a new function of neutrophils, a type of blood cell which was previously recognized just as a consumer of invading substances. This research can lead to better understanding of the homeostasis of blood-forming (hematopoietic) cells as well as improving the methods of PBSCH. In recent years, there has been a growing need for HSCT to treat hematological malignancies. HSCT is done to rescue a normal generation of blood cells (hematopoiesis) after the treatment of malignancies. Hematopoietic stem cells are usually found in the bone marrow, but under certain conditions they are released into the peripheral blood (regular blood vessels) where they can be harvested in blood samples. G-CSF stimulates the bone marrow to mobilize stem cells into the peripheral blood. G-CSF has been widely used for PBSCH because it is a safe method. However, the mechanism for the mobilization of hematopoietic cells by G-CSF largely remained unclear, and there is no convincing reason to explain the existence of  poor mobilizers  (people who displayed poor mobilization of hematopoietic cells to peripheral blood by G-CSF which results in the insufficiency of hematopoietic cells for HSCT) and the mechanism of unfavorable effects such as fever and bone pain caused by G-CSF. Understanding of those mechanisms could largely contribute to the improvement of transplantation therapy. Professor Katayama s research group focused on the effectiveness of standard anti-inflammatory drugs in treating fever and bone pain caused by G-CSF. These anti-inflammatory drugs suppress the production of PGE2, which is involved in inflammation and pain, so the group expected that PGE2 might be the cause of unfavorable effects by G-CSF. Using mouse models to test this hypothesis, they discovered that PGE2 inhibited the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells to peripheral blood, and that blood cells produced PGE2 by the treatment of G-CSF. Furthermore, they revealed that, among blood cells, neutrophils produced PGE2 by G-CSF-induced stress stimulation (sympathetic nerve stimulation). The researchers investigated the fever response in denervated mice by neurotoxin and neutrophil-depleted mice by antibodies, and displayed that in these mice fever caused by G-CSF was diminished. PGE2 also affected osteoblastic cells in the bone marrow to increase osteopontin (OPN), a known inhibiting factor of stem cell mobilization to peripheral blood which resulted in decreases in the numbers of mobilized stem cells. These findings displayed that the production of PGE2 by neutrophils governed by the sympathetic nervous system is behind the unpleasant symptoms caused by G-CSF, and this is one of the causes of suppression of stem cell mobilization. Based on this discovery, researchers now have information to treat unfavorable effects of G-CSF as well as to predict the currently unpredictable poor mobilizers and treat them using OPN antibodies. Because sympathetic nerve stimulation occurs under stress conditions, the fact that sympathetic signals stimulate neutrophils to produce the inflammatory PGE2 means that highly-motile neutrophils may be involved in stress-related inflammation in the whole body. These facts indicate the possibility that neutrophils are also involved in carcinogenesis, the progression of cancer, autoimmune disorders and hardened arteries. Source: Story from Kobe University.

A little larger than a quarter and about the same thickness, the simple, low-cost device analyzes key biomarkers to help a person decide quickly if any adjustments, such as drinking more water or replenishing electrolytes, need to be made or if something is medically awry. The wearer can quickly see how his or her body is responding to exercise. Designed for one-time use of a few hours, the device, placed directly on the skin of the forearm or back, even detects the presence of a biomarker for cystic fibrosis. In the future, it may be more broadly used for disease diagnosis.  The intimate skin interface created by this wearable, skin-like microfluidic system enables new measurement capabilities not possible with the kinds of absorbent pads and sponges currently used in sweat collection,  said John A. Rogers, who led the multi-institution research team that created the  lab on the skin.   Sweat is a rich, chemical broth containing a number of important chemical compounds with physiological health information. By expanding our previously developed  epidermal  electronics platform to include a complex network of microfluidic channels and storage reservoirs, we now can perform biochemical analysis of this important biofluid,  he said.Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Neurological Surgery in the McCormick School of Engineering and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Rogers and his longtime collaborator Yonggang Huang are pioneers in developing skin-like stretchable electronics that move naturally with the skin, and this is their first device to monitor physiological health by analyzing biofluids.  We already know how to put electronics on the skin in a natural manner -- here our challenge was dealing with fluid flow and the collection, storage and analysis of sweat in a thin, soft and flexible device,  said Huang, who worked on the device s design and optimization.  The sweat analysis platform we developed will allow people to monitor their health on the spot without the need for a blood sampling and with integrated electronics that do not require a battery but still enable wireless connection to a smartphone,  he said. Huang is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at the McCormick School. In a study of accuracy and durability, the device was tested on two different groups of athletes: one cycling indoors in a fitness center under controlled conditions and the other participating in the El Tour de Tucson, a long-distance bicycle race in arid and complex conditions. The researchers placed the device on the arms and backs of the athletes to capture sweat. During moderate or vigorous exercise, sweat winds through the tiny microscopic channels of the device and into four different small, circular compartments. In the compartments, reactions with chemical reagents result in visible color changes in ways that quantitatively relate to pH and concentrations of glucose, chloride and lactate. When a smartphone is brought into proximity with the device, the wireless electronics trigger an app that captures a photo of the device and analyzes the image to yield data on the biomarker concentrations.  We chose these four biomarkers because they provide a characteristic profile that s relevant for health status determination,  said Rogers, director of Northwestern s Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics.  The device also can determine sweat rate and loss, and it can store samples for subsequent laboratory analysis, if necessary.  In the group that cycled indoors, the researchers compared the new device s biomarker readouts to conventional laboratory analysis of the same sweat and found the two sets of results agreed with each other. (Conventional methods include capturing sweat with absorbent patches taped to the skin and analyzing them off-site.) With the long-distance cyclists, the researchers tested the durability of the device in the complex and unpredictable conditions of the desert. They found the devices to be robust: They stayed adhered to the athletes  skin, did not leak and provided the kind of quality information the researchers sought. The sweat analysis device features a number of innovations: The device can capture, store and analyze sweat in situ in real time The device can quantitatively determine biomarker levels using colorimetric analysis A power source is not required to display the results; instead, a smartphone camera and app are used to read the biomarker change Source: Story from Northwestern University.

Now, researchers reporting in the journal Current Biology have evidence that dogs have that kind of ""episodic memory"" too. The study found that dogs can recall a person's complex actions even when they don't expect to have their memory tested. See Also: You can teach an old dog new tricks - but younger dogs learn faster ""The results of our study can be considered as a further step to break down artificially erected barriers between non-human animals and humans,"" says Claudia Fugazza of MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group in Budapest, Hungary. ""Dogs are among the few species that people consider 'clever,' and yet we are still surprised whenever a study reveals that dogs and their owners may share some mental abilities despite our distant evolutionary relationship."" Evidence that non-human animals use episodic-like memory has been hard to come by because you can't just ask a dog what it remembers. In the new study, the researchers took advantage of a trick called ""Do as I Do."" Dogs trained to ""Do as I Do"" can watch a person perform an action and then do the action themselves. For example, if their owner jumps in the air and then gives the ""Do it!"" command, the dog would jump in the air too. The fact that dogs can be trained in this way alone wasn't enough to prove episodic memory. That's because it needed to be shown that dogs remember what they just saw a person do even when they weren't expecting to be asked or rewarded. To get around this problem, the researchers first trained 17 dogs to imitate human actions with the ""Do as I Do"" training method. Next, they did another round of training in which dogs were trained to lie down after watching the human action, no matter what it was. Learn More: The power of expectation can restrain hyper-emotional memories in the brain After the dogs had learned to lie down reliably, the researchers surprised them by saying ""Do It"" and the dogs did. In other words, the dogs recalled what they'd seen the person do even though they had no particular reason to think they'd need to remember. They showed episodic-like memory. Dogs were tested in that way after one minute and after one hour. The results show they were able to recall the demonstrated actions after both short and long time intervals. However, their memory faded somewhat over time. The researchers say that the same approach can most likely be used and adapted in a wide range of animal species, to better understand how animals' minds process their own actions and that of others around them.

The enhancements provide an unprecedented view of how viruses infect cells. The new nanodiscs are more stable than previous versions and, for the first time, can be made in several precise sizes and shapes.  We finally have a defined environment where we can study how viruses or other proteins interact with membrane proteins and get details as never seen before,  said Gerhard Wagner, the Elkan Blout Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at HMS and senior author of the study. The design improvements mean scientists can now watch under a microscope as viruses in this case, polioviruses dock with the nanodiscs, open a pore and inject their genetic material.  One of the major goals in virology is to understand step by step how viruses enter cells and to make a  molecular movie,  said first author Mahmoud Nasr, a research fellow in the Wagner lab.  The hope is that these nanodiscs will help us gather more details about this process so we can design vaccines and small-molecule drugs to prohibit virus entry.  In addition, embedding different proteins in the nanodiscs and tumbling them around in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers provides sharper images of the proteins  structures and dynamics than were previously possible, helping researchers better understand the proteins  functions in the body. Buckling the belt Phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs are basically bundles of fat cinched around the waist by a pair of protein belts. The fats, or lipids, form a double layer like that of the natural cell membrane. Scientists can then embed membrane proteins in the bilayer. Nanodiscs emerged in the early 2000s as an alternative to other membrane surrogates that are oversized or unstable or that require detergents, which interfere with natural protein dynamics. But nanodiscs presented their own problems. For instance, researchers couldn t make them in consistent sizes, throwing off test results. Wagner s team recognized that the trouble probably lay in the fact that the protein belts surrounding the nanodiscs gaped open, so that discs ballooned with uneven amounts of lipid. Sure enough, when the scientists did some fancy chemistry to buckle the belts, the nanodiscs came out in a much narrower size range. The discs also held together better over time and at the high temperatures necessary for NMR experiments. The researchers found that they could shorten or lengthen the belts and still close them, allowing the nanodiscs to be custom-sized to fit specific membrane proteins. So far, they ve made discs with diameters of 9, 11, 15 and 50 nanometers. Being able to control the size of nanodiscs expands the tools  usefulness for a range of proteins and technologies. NMR requires small discs and proteins, for example, while electron microscopy often needs big ones.  You can t use small nanodiscs to study huge protein complexes or to look at viruses, which need a minimum surface area to form a pore,  said Nasr. Most of the nanodiscs are circular, although the scientists are also tinkering with an array of polygonal shapes, from triangles to hexagons.  We hope that by packing together more efficiently than circular nanodiscs, the polygonal nanodiscs, especially if we can make smaller ones, will help us grow good crystals, which provides another way for us to solve the structures of the membrane proteins we embed in them,  said Nasr. In Practice Wagner and Nasr teamed up with James Hogle, the Edward S. Harkness Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at HMS, and his postdoctoral fellow Mike Strauss, who were running into roadblocks trying to learn how simple viruses get into cells. First, Nasr built 50-nanometer discs that were big enough to hold all the puzzle pieces. Then the team embedded proteins in the nanodiscs that bind to polioviruses, added poliovirus particles to the mix, froze the samples and took snapshots through a cryo-electron microscope. The images showed some virus particles taking the bait attaching to the receptor proteins, opening what looked like pores through the lipid bilayer and releasing their RNA as though trying to infect a real cell. The researchers haven t yet confirmed that the objects they re seeing are truly pores, but, Hogle said,  We know they re there because the RNA is going across.  Nasr is now trying to make even better-tailored 30-nanometer discs to help Hogle s team determine the structure of the poliovirus/receptor protein complex and dig further into what s happening in the membrane.  The nanodiscs are an exciting technique,  said Hogle.  I can t imagine any other way of seeing what the pore looks like. Mahmoud was very clever to get these working and create a system that opens the door for a wide variety of studies.  The researchers hope their initial results encourage others to use the nanodiscs to scrutinize many virus/receptor interactions. Already flooded with requests for collaboration, Wagner s group has made a collection of protein belts available and is publishing a detailed protocol so other labs can build the nanodiscs on their own.

Epigenetics refers to the alterations that influence the expression of genes encoded within the DNA of living organisms, rather than changes to the DNA itself. For instance, fall colors change when shorter daylight hours influence the expression of the genes responsible for particular leaf pigments.  Epigenetics is one of the important players in the cross-talk between the environment and our bodies,  says Zhong, assistant professor of genetics and a faculty member at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. Her research focuses on how gene expression in growth and development is regulated by epigenetic modification and how that regulation can be influenced by environmental stimuli. Aging, or senescence, is an elaborate process vital to the life cycle of a plant. The efficiency of this process has critical implications for biological success: Premature aging could result in a reduction in yield, a grave concern for the production of offspring and cultivation of crops. Belated senescence, on the other hand, reduces a plant s efficiency by delaying reallocation of nutrients and may impact the viability of the next generation. By searching the genome of the common experimental plant model Arabidopsis thaliana (commonly known as thale cress) for locations where HDA9 binds, Zhong s group found evidence that it is a key player in the senescence process. It acts on previously identified genes that code for various components of aging.  We found that this protein binds to a lot of genes that have potential functions in the aging process. That provides some other information which led us to study the potential functions in [the process],  says Xiangsong Chen, a postdoctoral researcher working with Zhong and first author on the paper. The team says that the newly-profiled HDAC jumpstarts the process of aging, which is responsible for the many-colored leaves of the fall season. This process is also of key importance commercially, Zhong says, and the mechanistic insight into the initiation of aging is a significant step forward in epigenetics research.  We believe that this information will provide a foundation for developing a new strategy to manipulate the plant aging processes to improve crop productivity, which could prove very beneficial for agricultural improvement,  says Zhong.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/longlasting-pill-to-fight-malaria-199844,Long Lasting Pill to Fight Malaria An ultra long acting pill has been developed to offer a new hope in eliminating malaria  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Imagine swallowing a pill today that continues releasing the daily dose of a medicine you need for the next week, month or even longer. Investigators from Brigham and Women s Hospital and their collaborators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a long-acting drug delivery capsule that may help to do just that in the future. To test the capsule s real-world applications, the team used both mathematical modeling and animal models to investigate the effects of delivering a sustained therapeutic dose of a drug called ivermectin, which is used to treat parasitic infections such as river blindness. Ivermectin has an added bonus of helping keep malaria-carrying mosquito populations at bay. The team found that in large animal models, the capsule safely stayed in the stomach, slowly releasing the drug for up to 14 days, and potentially providing a new way to combat malaria and other infectious diseases. The results of this work are published Nov. 16 in Science Translational Medicine.  We want to make it as easy as possible for people to take their medications over a sustained period of time. When patients have to remember to take a drug everyday or multiple times a day, we start to see less and less adherence to the regimen. Being able to swallow a capsule once a week or once a month could change the way we think about delivering medications,  said co-corresponding author C. Giovanni Traverso, MB, BChir, PhD, a gastroenterologist and biomedical engineer in the Division of Gastroenterology at BWH and an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Medication non-adherence is a massive problem in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S. alone, non-adherence is estimated to lead to more than $100 billion in expenses annually. Medication non-adherence is also a persistent problem in low-resource settings, where there may not be reliable access to health care and the full course of a medication. To help develop a new solution, the multi-disciplinary research team included members with expertise in biomechanical engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, infectious disease modeling, polymer chemistry and health care innovation.  In addition to improving adherence, our ultra long-acting drug delivery system may reduce side effects and improve drug efficacy by smoothing out the high variability of serum concentration that often comes with taking a daily pill,  said co-first Andrew Bellinger, MD, PhD, a cardiologist at BWH and co-founder and chief scientific officer at Lyndra, the healthcare company that licensed the technology from MIT and BWH and is developing it for commercial use in the U.S. and worldwide. The company is focusing on drug delivery for neuropsychiatric disorders. (Other diseases that could benefit from ultra long-lasting drug delivery include tuberculosis, HIV, diabetes, and epilepsy.) The research team developed a capsule that is about the size of a fish oil capsule when swallowed. Once inside the stomach, the capsule unfolds into a star-shaped structure too large to pass through the pylorus and exit the stomach, but designed to allow food to continue passing through the digestive system. ""The gastrointestinal tract is a strong, durable passage way through the body. We designed the capsule to pause its transit in the stomach to allow for more controlled drug delivery and absorption, before passing through the GI tract without any harm,  said Traverso.  Some of the challenges we face in getting the capsule in place are the  ship in the bottle problem    in this case, the neck of the bottle is the esophagus   and preventing the capsule from passing through the rest of the tube. The pylorus is about 2 centimeters in diameter so we designed our system to be 4 centimeters when it opens.  The capsule contains polymers and other materials mixed with ivermectin to allow the drug to slowly diffuse out of the material over time. The team reports evidence of diffusion for up to two weeks, and is interested in continuing to develop the system so that it can provide the drug for one month or longer. Ivermectin is currently used to combat several kinds of parasites, including the parasitic worms that causes river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. (The researchers who discovered ivermectin were awarded the Nobel prize in 2015.) Ivermectin has also been shown to reduce malaria transmission as the drug is toxic to the mosquito species that spread malaria (Anopheles). The concentrations of ivermectin in the blood of humans taking the drug are high enough to kill mosquitoes that bite them. In collaboration with research teams at Imperial College London and the Institute of Disease Modeling in Seattle, the team applied mathematical modeling of malaria transmission and found that long-lasting ivermectin levels could amplify the efficacy towards malaria elimination of mass drug administration campaigns. In addition, they envision potential applications beyond infectious disease, including chronic diseases such as psychiatric disease, heart disease, renal disease and more. They plan to investigate the system s applications for these conditions as well. This work was funded, in part, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung Foundation and a National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada postdoctoral fellowship.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/toxoplasmas-balancing-act-explained-212233,Toxoplasma s Balancing Act Explained Parasite s method of rewiring our immune response leads to novel tool for drug tests  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a silent success. It infects up to 95% of people in many regions of the world, and most of them never know it, due to the parasite s artful manipulation of its host s immune response. Toxoplasma keeps the immune response low enough so that it can thrive, but high enough so that its human hosts generally live healthy lives and can incubate parasites. Scientists at EMBL* and the Institute for Advanced Biosciences (IAB, an INSERM - CNRS - Universit  Grenoble-Alpes research centre) have uncovered one of the ways it maintains this balance, in a paper published today in Structure.  The parasite rewires the host s inflammatory response,  says Matthew Bowler, who led the research at EMBL.  It completely subverts the chain reaction that would normally trigger our body s defenses.  When a cell in your body detects a parasite, it sets off a chain reaction. Inside that cell, a series of molecules activate each other until a protein called p38  is activated and moves into the cell s nucleus. There, it turns on the genes that trigger the inflammatory response. Among other things, the purpose of that response is to eliminate the pathogen. One would expect parasites like Toxoplasma to want to subdue that response, but Mohamed-Ali Hakimi and colleagues at IAB discovered a few years ago that Toxoplasma secretes a protein, GRA24, which does just the opposite: it activates and controls our inflammatory response. Bowler and Hakimi discovered that GRA24 bypasses the cell s chain reaction, activating p38  directly, and pulling it into the nucleus to turn on inflammatory response genes. Using a combination of techniques, they found that the Toxoplasma protein attaches itself much more strongly to p38  than the cell s own proteins do. So, by producing a protein that binds directly, and very tightly, to p38 , Toxoplasma controls the level of the inflammatory response and sustains it by making it inaccessible to the proteins that would usually turn it off. Therefore, Toxoplasma isn t considered a serious health threat except for pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. This research has generated a new way to assess the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, many of which are designed to block p38 . So far it has been difficult to assess how effective they are, because scientists haven t had a good way to produce an active form of p38  in the lab. In producing GRA24 bound to p38 , Bowler, Hakimi and colleagues   with the help of EMBL s Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility   created just that. The tight interaction with the parasite protein keeps p38  in its active state, so researchers can now subject it to the drugs they d like to test, and evaluate how well they block p38 s active site, which the Toxoplasma protein doesn t interfere with.

That describes how two research teams are approaching their fight, using accelerated computing, to battle the disease at the most basic levels of human biology. Each group will receive $200,000 from the NVIDIA Foundation to further research that could lead to new and more targeted treatments. The two grants are part of the NVIDIA Foundation s Compute the Cure effort, which supports projects that use parallel computing technology to yield breakthroughs in cancer treatment and diagnostics. A group of NVIDIA employees, with the support of researchers at the National Cancer Institute, chose the recipients from among nearly 20 proposals submitted from around the world. One team, led by Seungchan Kim at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), based in Phoenix, Ariz., aims to understand why some cancer cells respond to treatments and some don t. This could make it possible to treat different cells with different medications. The other team, led by Andr s Cisneros at the University of North Texas, is searching for mutations that cause changes in the proteins that repair damage to DNA. These mutations may indicate the presence of cancer. Fighting Cancer, Cell by Cell Research by Kim and his team at TGen could lead to precise cancer therapies that target specific cells within each patient s tumor. To do so, they created a GPU-accelerated statistical analysis tool that allows them to examine in precise detail how the cells  DNA controls protein production and how those proteins interact with each other and with other molecules. Using the tool, the researchers are able to identify differences among groups of cells in the same tumor. This could lead to personalized treatments for cancer patients that treat different parts of the tumor with different medicines.  There may be a subpopulation of cells that respond only to compound A and another subpopulation of cells that respond only to compound B,  Kim said. The tool, called EDDY-GPU (EDDY is short for  evaluation of differential dependency ) allows researchers to analyze the vast amount of data from thousands of tumor cells quickly enough to make a difference for patients, Kim said. In contrast, an earlier CPU-based version of EDDY worked on 4,754 samples for two months and never finished.  If you have a cancer patient with their life on the line, you don t want to wait for results,  Kim said. He plans to use the Compute the Cure funds to improve his algorithms so they work even faster. Kim and his team are also planning a trial with the University of California at San Francisco. Using tissue samples from two brain cancer patients, they ll perform detailed analysis of the patients  tumors, propose therapies and investigate these further using patient-derived models. DNA is frequently damaged by UV light, the carcinogens in cigarette smoke and many other substances. Fortunately, the body manufactures DNA repair proteins that normally take care of the problem. But sometimes the DNA repair proteins themselves break or mutate. Cisneros and his team at the University of North Texas are combing through vast datasets from the National Institutes of Health and others to find mutations on DNA repair proteins that are related to cancer. After identifying the mutations, the researchers use GPU-accelerated computer simulation to figure out how these change the DNA repair protein and its ability to do its job.  If we know there are mutations that affect these proteins and they re related to cancer, then researchers can use this info to try to fix the proteins or come up with drugs or other therapies to treat the disease,  Cisneros said. Cisneros  larger goal is to find more biomarkers that point to an elevated risk for particular types of cancer. Already the team has identified several mutations related to different types of cancer, including a biomarker related to prostate cancer in African Americans. Scientists currently use genetic data to determine risk for certain types of cancer and to determine treatment. For example, physicians can test for mutations linked to a high risk for breast cancer and testing for receptors for estrogen or progesterone helps doctors determine which treatments are likely to be most effective. By identifying more biomarkers, Cisneros could provide new diagnostic tools for more types of cancer. In addition, his detailed analyses of mutations on DNA repair proteins could help scientists develop personalized, genetic therapies to fight the disease. Source: Story from NVIDIA Foundation.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibiotics-discovered-while-sifting-through-human-microbiome-186644,Antibiotics Discovered While Sifting Through Human Microbiome Researchers identify genes in a microbe s genome that produce antibiotic compounds  then synthesize them without the need for bacterial culture  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Most antibiotics in use today are based on natural molecules produced by bacteria and given the rise of antibiotic resistance, there s an urgent need to find more of them. Yet coaxing bacteria to produce new antibiotics is a tricky proposition. Most bacteria won t grow in the lab. And even when they do, most of the genes that cause them to churn out molecules with antibiotic properties never get switched on. Researchers at The Rockefeller University have found a way around these problems, however. By using computational methods to identify which genes in a microbe s genome ought to produce antibiotic compounds and then synthesizing those compounds themselves, they were able to discover two promising new antibiotics without having to culture a single bacterium. The team, which was led by Sean Brady, head of the Laboratory of Genetically Encoded Small Molecules, began by trawling publicly available databases for the genomes of bacteria that reside in the human body. They then used specialized computer software to scan hundreds of those genomes for clusters of genes that were likely to produce molecules known as non-ribosomal peptides that form the basis of many antibiotics. They also used the software to predict the chemical structures of the molecules that the gene clusters ought to produce. Unearthing the humimycins  The software initially identified 57 potentially useful gene clusters, which the researchers winnowed down to 30. Brady and his colleagues then used a method called solid-phase peptide synthesis to manufacture 25 different chemical compounds. By testing those compounds against human pathogens, the researchers successfully identified two closely related antibiotics, which they dubbed humimycin A and humimycin B. Both are found in a family of bacteria called Rhodococcus microbes that had never yielded anything resembling the humimycins when cultured using traditional laboratory techniques. The humimycins proved especially effective against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria, which can cause dangerous infections in humans and tend to grow resistant to various antibiotics. Further experiments suggested that the humimycins work by inhibiting an enzyme that bacteria use to build their cell walls and once that cell-wall building pathway is interrupted, the bacteria die. A similar mode of action is employed by beta-lactams, a broad class of commonly prescribed antibiotics whose effect often wanes as bacteria develop ways to resist them. Yet the scientists found that one of the humimycins could be used to re-sensitize bacteria to beta-lactams that they had previously outsmarted. Synergistic effects In one experiment, they exposed beta-lactam resistant Staphylococcus microbes to humimycin A in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and the bugs once again succumbed. Remarkably, that held true even when humimycin A had little effect by itself a result that Brady attributes to the fact that both compounds work by interrupting different steps in the same biological pathway.  It s like taking a hose and pinching it in two spots,  he says. Even if neither kink halts the flow altogether on its own,  eventually, no more water comes through.  To further test that proposition, Brady and his colleagues infected mice with a beta-lactam resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus, a microbe that often causes antibiotic-resistant infections in hospital patients. Mice that were subsequently treated with a mixture containing both humimycin A and a beta-lactam antibiotic fared far better than those treated with only one drug or the other a finding that could point towards a new treatment regimen for humans infected with beta-lactam resistant S. aureus. Brady hopes that this discovery will inspire scientists to mine the genomes of bacteria for more molecules that could yield similarly useful results. And he looks forward to applying his methods to the many bacterial species that lie beyond the human microbiome, and that might harbor their own molecular treasures not to mention the even greater number of bacteria whose genomes have not yet been sequenced, but that undoubtedly will be over time.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/common-virus-helps-fight-liver-cancer-191087,Common Virus Helps Fight Liver Cancer Reovirus  a cause of childhood colds  stimulates the immune system to kill cancerous cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.A virus that causes childhood coughs and colds could help in the fight against primary liver cancer. Reovirus stimulates the body s own immune system to kill off the cancerous cells, researchers from the University of Leeds discovered. In addition, Reovirus is able to kill off the hepatitis C virus   a common cause of primary liver cancer   at the same time, the team found. These early-stage findings are important because primary liver cancer is the third highest cause of cancer deaths worldwide and, if surgery is not an option, the prognosis is poor.  Study co-leader Dr Stephen Griffin, Associate Professor of Viral Oncology in the Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology at the University of Leeds, said:  Ultimately we hope that by simultaneously treating the tumour, and the hepatitis virus that is driving the growth of the tumour, we may provide a more effective therapy and improve the outcomes for patients.   Current treatments for liver cancer that can t be removed by surgery are mainly palliative   with chemotherapy only tending to prolong life, rather than cure   and it can have significant side effects.  Reovirus can cause respiratory illnesses and stomach upsets in children but by adulthood most people have been exposed to it and so it does not cause illness.  The University of Leeds team, whose study is published today in the journal Gut, found that Reovirus was successful in treating both liver cancer cells grown in the laboratory and those taken directly from patients undergoing surgery.  When introduced into the body, Reovirus stimulates an immune system factor known as interferon, which in turn causes the activation of a specific white blood cell called a Natural Killer cell.  These Natural Killer cells then kill both the tumour, and cells infected with the hepatitis C virus.  Stimulating the immune system to kill cancer cells is known as immunotherapy. It differs from chemotherapy, in which the actual drugs kill the cancer cells.  The researchers are now hoping to start the first in-human clinical trials.  Study co-leader Professor Alan Melcher, now Professor of Translational Immunotherapy at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:   Our study establishes a completely new type of viral immunotherapy for the most common primary liver cancer type, hepatocellular carcinoma, which has a very poor prognosis in its advanced form.   Using a mixture of experiments in human cancer samples and mice, our research showed that the Reovirus therapy switches on the host immune system to attack cancer cells   as well as suppressing the replication of hepatitis C virus, which is linked to many hepatocellular cancers.   We also showed that Reovirus therapy could be used to treat a range of other cancer types associated with viral infection, including Epstein Barr Virus-associated lymphoma.  Primary liver cancer is cancer that starts in the liver and is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, where the cancer originally develops in another part of the body and then spreads to the liver.  Most cases of primary liver cancer are associated with damage and scarring of the liver, most commonly from having a hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection. Less commonly it is caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years.  At least 130 million people globally have chronic hepatitis C infection, according to the World Health Organisation, and a significant proportion of these will develop liver cancer.  Co-researcher Dr Adel Samson from the University of Leeds said:  It is becoming increasingly clear that one of the most powerful weapons available to treat cancer is our own immune system.   However, as cancers are formed from our own cells, the immune system frequently struggles to identify the subtle differences that differentiate cancerous cells from normal cells, without help.   Immunotherapy involves various strategies   such as a virus, as in our study - to kick-start our immune system to better identify and fight cancer.   These  oncolytic  viruses show great promise in clinical trials, and the first such virus has recently been licensed as a medicine for the treatment of skin cancer.  Dr Justine Alford, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK which funded the research, said:  This study in cells and mice suggests the possibility of using a harmless oncolytic virus as an immune-boosting one-two punch against liver cancer and the cancer-causing hepatitis C virus.   These early results also suggest this oncolytic virus could be used more widely in the treatment of virus-driven cancers.   In these cancers, the viruses can represent a major hurdle for treatment, so we urgently need new and effective ways to tackle the root of the problem.   The next step will be to see if this technique will work in patients.  Source: Story from the University of Leeds.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/molecular-signature-for-aggressive-brain-tumor-uncovered-201340,Molecular Signature for Aggressive Brain Tumor Uncovered Researchers have identified genetic mutations in a highly agressive brain cancer that distinguishes the agressive  from the benign forms of the cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, but the term encompasses over a dozen subtypes that range from benign to highly aggressive. Rhabdoid meningiomas are classified as highly aggressive due to their high rates of recurrence and mortality, but the experience and outcomes for patients with this rare form of brain tumor vary widely. Researchers from Brigham and Women s Hospital, in collaboration with colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, have identified genetic mutations in this form of brain cancer that can distinguish aggressive rhabdoid meningiomas from more benign forms using routine laboratory tests. The new findings could have immediate implications for clinical decision-making. The work is published Nov. 10 in the journal Neuro-Oncology.  Our work has practical implications for the care of patients with meningiomas,  said Sandro Santagata, MD, PhD, a pathologist in the Neuropathology Division at BWH.  We hope that this work will have an impact not only on clinical management, but also for the enrollment of patients in clinical trials. Novel treatments for meningiomas are urgently needed, and determining which patients have more aggressive forms of the disease based on the tumor s genetics could help us design better trials and more precise treatment approaches.  Ganesh Shankar, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, said,  Two meningiomas may appear similar under the microscope, but we know these two tumors may have very different clinical courses. The goal of this study was to identify an easy-to-measure feature that would help predict which tumors require closer surveillance and upfront therapies following surgical resection to delay progression. This is an effort that drew on the resources of multiple collaborating institutions working towards the same goal.  Usually, rhabdoid meningiomas are classified based on physical appearance and characteristics, but these enigmatic tumors can be difficult for pathologists to accurately classify. To find a molecular fingerprint that could help identify rhabdoid meningioma, Santagata and his colleagues sequenced 560 cancer-related genes from 14 meningiomas. In one sample, the team detected a mutation in the BAP1 gene along with telltale physical features (such as the shape of the tumor cells) of rhabdoid meningioma. Previous studies had found that people with inherited mutations in the BAP1 gene that cause a loss of BAP1 protein are prone to a tumor predisposition syndrome   a condition that puts them at a very high risk of developing several kinds of tumors including tumors in the eye, lung, kidney and elsewhere. But primary brain tumors had not been associated with the syndrome before. The team went on to analyze samples from 47 patients with rhabdoid meningiomas as well as 265 additional meningiomas of diverse subtypes and grades. None of the non-rhabdoid meningiomas had a loss of BAP1. However, five of the 47 patients with rhabdoid meningiomas did have mutations or deletions affecting BAP1. These patients had poor clinical outcomes: two died of the disease and two had multiple cases of recurrence; clinical follow-up information was not available for the fifth. For those patients with intact BAP1, average time of disease progression was 116 months; for the patients with BAP1 mutations, it was only 26 months.  The presence or absence of BAP1 can be monitored with a simple and inexpensive test known as immunohistochemistry   in which a tissue sample is collected and stained for a particular protein. This approach is currently in routine use for characterizing samples of an eye cancer known as uveal melanoma and a tumor that arises from the linings of the chest and abdomen known as mesothelioma   forms of cancer tied to the tumor predisposition syndrome. The number of cases of rhabdoid meningioma studied in this work was small; larger studies will be needed to determine the prevalence of BAP1 mutations in rhabdoid meningiomas and to assess the impact of their detection on clinical care. However, the new work strongly suggests that a careful assessment of family history is a critical for patients who develop rhabdoid meningiomas and that patients with BAP1 negative tumors may warrant more careful observation and focused care.  Testing for BAP1 in rhabdoid meningiomas could be performed routinely and at a low cost, with the potential to change the course of clinical care and avoid overtreatment or to identify those who may need more aggressive therapy,  said Santagata.  We hope that this new work will offer insights for clinicians and patients alike as they seek more information on these tumors.  Source: Story from Brigham and Women s Hospital.

The study, published Nov. 21 in the journal Nature Cell Biology, could establish new avenues of therapeutic treatments for many types of solid tumors. Growth signals typically come in the form of chemical agonists outside of cells that bind to protein receptors on cells. Activated receptors are responsible for transmitting the signal to the inside of the cell, ultimately generating a growth messenger called PIP3. Two years ago, research out of UW Madison Professor Richard Anderson s lab found that some of these agonist-stimulated receptors continue to transmit the signal even after they have been pulled into the cell, sequestered in vesicles called endosomes and presumably on their way to being degraded.  According to dogma in the literature, receptors shouldn t make PIP3 at these internal sites, but they were,  Anderson says.  We set out to ask,  Why is that?  In this new study, a postdoctoral fellow in Anderson s lab, Suyong Choi, showed that the proteins known to be in this signal transmission cascade were all present on endosomes inside the cell, supporting the idea that the key growth message was being signaled from these internal compartments. However, there was one fact which they could not biologically explain: In a typical signaling cascade, each step amplifies the signal, suggesting there should be more and more of the messenger molecules; but here, levels of PIP3 and other intermediary messengers were too low to be detected in endosomes.  A scaffold completely solves this issue, because it acts like an assembly line, bringing together all of the proteins and passing one messenger molecule to the next protein in the cascade until the last protein, PI3K, is activated and generates PIP3,  Anderson says.  Suyong Choi found that the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 brings all of these proteins together like a happy family on the endosome. It s an incredibly efficient mechanism.  Choi discovered that the IQGAP1 complex pulls together all of the signaling components in the PI3K pathway. Remarkably, this assembly happens in response to nearly all agonists that switch on growth and cell survival signals in cells. Once Choi had established how the proteins in the complex interacted, he was able to block scaffold formation in cells by adding a small, competing fragment of the IQGAP1 protein.  It worked beautifully to block assembly of IQGAP1 and PI3K complex,  Anderson says.  The really cool thing was, when we treated different cells with these inhibitory fragments, the disruption of IQGAP1 and PI3K complex formation had almost no effect on normal cells but it killed cancer cells very efficiently.  PI3K is an essential protein, and cells (and whole organisms) die if they do not have any functional PI3K because the protein is involved in multiple signaling pathways. However, it is specifically this pathway, mediated through IQGAP1, that is required for the growth and survival of cancer cells but not normal cells. In fact, mice lacking IQGAP1 develop normally but are resistant to developing solid tumors.  Pharmaceutical companies have developed PI3K inhibitors, but many of these have failed, likely because they re hitting all PI3Ks and the different pathways,  Anderson said.  If you can specifically disrupt this agonist-activated PI3K pathway, the one that has a specific role in cancer, then you can effectively treat cancers. We think that s what this study is showing.

Consisting of trillions of organisms   bacteria, fungi and viruses   the microbiome is essential for host health, providing important services ranging from nutrient processing to immune system development and maintenance. Now, in a study comparing mice raised in a  germ free  environment and mice raised under more typical lab conditions, scientists have identified yet another key role of the microbes that live within us: mediator of host gene expression through the epigenome, the chemical information that regulates which genes in cells are active. Writing online Nov. 23 in the journal Molecular Cell, a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin Madison describes new research helping tease out the mechanics of how the gut microbiome communicates with the cells of its host to switch genes on and off. The upshot of the study, another indictment of the so-called Western diet (high in saturated fats, sugar and red meat), reveals how the metabolites produced by the bacteria in the stomach chemically communicate with cells, including cells far beyond the colon, to dictate gene expression and health in its host.  The bugs are somehow driving gene expression in the host through alteration of the epigenome,  explains John Denu, a UW Madison professor of biomolecular chemistry and a senior researcher at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, and a co-author of the new study.  We re starting to understand the mechanism of how and why diet and the microbiome matter.  The study, which was led by Kimberly Krautkramer, an MD/Ph.D. student in the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, revealed key differences in gene regulation in conventionally raised mice and mice raised in a germ-free environment. The mice were provided with two distinct diets:  one rich in plant carbohydrates similar to fruits and vegetables humans consume; the other mimicking a Western diet, high in simple sugars and fat. A plant-based diet, according to Federico Rey, a UW Madison professor of bacteriology and also a co-corresponding author of the new report, yields a richer microbiome:  A good diet translates to a beautifully complex microbiome,  Rey says.  And we see that the gut microbiome affects the host epigenome in a diet-dependent manner. A plant-based diet seems to favor host-microbe communication.  The new Wisconsin study shows that a small set of short-chain fatty acids produced as the gut bacteria consume, metabolize and ferment nutrients from plants are important chemical messengers, communicating with the cells of the host through the epigenome.  One of the findings here is that microbial metabolism or fermentation of plant fiber results in the production of short-chain fatty acids. These molecules, and potentially many others, are partially responsible for the communication  with the epigenome, says Denu. In the study, the gut microbiota of the animals that were fed a diet rich in sugar and fat have a diminished capacity to communicate with host cells. According to the Wisconsin team, that may be a hint that the template for a healthy human microbiome was set in the distant past, when food from plants made up a larger portion of diet and sugar and fat were less available than in contemporary diets with more meat and processed foods.  As we move away from plant-based diets, we may be losing some of that communication between microbes and host,  notes Rey.  With a Western-type diet, it seems like the communication between microbes and host gets lost.  Foods rich in fat and sugar, especially processed foods, are more easily digested by the host, but are not necessarily a good source of food for the flora inhabiting the gut. The result is a less diverse microbiome and less communication to the host, according to the researchers. A surprising finding in the study is that the chemical communication between the microbiome and host cells is far reaching. In addition to talking to cells in the colon, the microbiome also seems to be communicating with cells in the liver and in fatty tissue far removed from the gut. That, says Denu, is more evidence of the importance of the microbiome to the well-being of its host. The kicker experiment in the study, says Denu, was providing mice raised in a germ-free environment with three different short-chain fatty acids that the study showed to be important messengers to the epigenome. The supplement was enough to promote the kind of healthy interplay between microbiota and host cells seen in mice given a diet high in plant fiber.  It helps show that the collection of three short-chain fatty acids produced in the plant-based diet are likely major communicators,  adds Denu.  We see that it is not just the microbe. It s microbial metabolism.  Source: Story from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Original piece written by Terry Devitt.

Such a device could potentially help clinicians determine personalized treatment regimens for individual patients, the study authors believe. Using cancer cells from patients and mice, the researchers showed that the device, which measures changes in the mass of single cells, correctly predicted whether the cells were sensitive or resistant to certain drugs. The research team, led by Scott Manalis, Ph.D., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and David Weinstock, M.D., and Keith Ligon, M.D., of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, also demonstrated that the device could be used to rapidly test the effects of several different drugs on cancer cells taken directly from a patient. Although the study demonstrates the capabilities of their device, a ""substantial amount of work"" is still needed to determine if it can potentially guide the selection of personalized cancer treatments in the clinic, the study authors wrote. The results of the study, which was funded in part by NCI's Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT) program, appeared in Nature Biotechnology on October 10. Measuring Single-Cell Mass Cancer treatment is shifting away from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach and toward a precision medicine approach, in which therapy is selected for each patient based, in part, on the genetic and molecular makeup of the patient's cancer. In some cases, the presence of specific genetic mutations in a tumor may help predict whether the patient is likely to respond to treatment with a particular therapy. Some researchers are trying to pinpoint these genetic mutations for diverse cancer types and to develop tests that can reliably identify them. ""But for more than 90% of patients, their cancer does not have a mutation that suggests [an effective] drug,"" said Dr. Manalis. An alternative approach to guiding personalized treatment, he explained, is to collect living cancer cells taken from patients and measure their biological responses to different possible therapies. Knowledge of how the patient's cancer cells respond to drug treatment in the laboratory, he continued, may better inform treatment selection. For over a decade, Dr. Manalis' team at MIT has been developing a device to help do just that. The device, called a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), contains a series of oscillating cantilevers with hollowed-out channels through which fluids and cells are flowed. The cantilever structure, which is akin to a diving board, is  used in all kinds of technologies and as a building component,  said Tony Dickherber, Ph.D., director of the IMAT program. Inside the SMR the mass of a cell traveling through a channel affects how fast the cantilever wobbles. From this speed, the mass of each individual cell can be calculated in femtograms a unit of mass one quadrillion times smaller than a gram (a paperclip has a mass of about 1 gram). As each cell passes repeatedly through the device, its change in mass over a period of several minutes (called mass accumulation rate, or MAR) is also calculated. ""Cells are constantly taking in and secreting a lot of different things,"" said Dr. Manalis. ""The difference between total uptake and total secretion is the mass accumulation rate, which can be indicative of cell growth.  Predicting Cancer Cell Responses First, the researchers engineered a mouse cell line to be sensitive or resistant to the targeted drug imatinib (Gleevec  ). Then they treated the cells with imatinib and measured the MARs. They found that the SMR correctly predicted the expected responses: Compared with untreated cells, the imatinib-sensitive cells had MARs near zero while the MARs of imatinib-resistant cells were unchanged. Likewise, they saw similar results in tests of the device using different glioblastoma cell lines known to be sensitive or resistant to an experimental targeted therapy. The results were also consistent with the results of a traditional cell death test that showed whether the cells were killed by the treatment. The device also correctly predicted responses using cells from mice engineered to have leukemia that is sensitive or resistant to imatinib, and even worked when they used only a few leukemia cells obtained from a single drop of blood. This is an important characteristic, the study authors wrote, because usually only a limited amount of cancer cells are available from patient biopsies. Finally, the researchers tested the device using clinical samples from human patients. They found that they could quickly measure MARs of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that were obtained directly from a patient and then treated with several drugs in the lab. They also used the SMR to detect changes in the MAR of leukemia cells before and after a patient received treatment. Advantages and Challenges Throughout their experiments, the researchers found that MARs of individual cells from the same tumor varied widely, which, they wrote, reflects tumor heterogeneity diversity in the molecular makeup and behavior of cancer cells in a tumor. Other tests of drug sensitivity commonly used in the lab measure the average growth or death rate of a group of cells, but that average may not represent the true behavior of the entire cell population, Dr. Manalis said. Tumor heterogeneity has been linked to drug resistance, so being able to measure that heterogeneity in lab tests could potentially produce more accurate predictions of tumor responses. The device may be able to overcome other shortcomings of existing drug sensitivity tests in that the SMR can quickly and accurately give readings using a small number of cells, said Dr. Dickherber. This short timeline is a major advantage, said Dr. Manalis, especially when testing cells that have been taken from a patient because ""the sooner you can measure them, the closer the cells are likely to be to their original state."" But there are limitations to the new device as well, Dr. Dickherber cautioned. For instance, the cell culture procedure required to treat patients' cells before they are analyzed by the SMR may introduce unnatural biological changes that can skew results. And the researchers don t yet know whether they will be able to use the device to test cells from patients with solid tumors because of potential damage to the cells while they are being prepared for the SMR. Dr. Manalis believes that another ""useful capability"" of their device is that cells tested with the SMR can still be used for additional analyses, including sequencing. For example, Dr. Manalis and his team are performing single-cell gene expression measurements after they acquire MAR measurements in order to better understand what makes some cells responsive and others resistant to the same drug treatment.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/colorcoded-stem-cells-191006,Color Coded Stem Cells Researchers develop colour coding tool for tracking live blood stem cells over time  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.A new color-coding tool is enabling scientists to better track live blood stem cells over time, a key part of understanding how blood disorders and such cancers as leukemia arise, report researchers at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital. In Nature Cell Biology on Nov. 21, they describe the use of their tool in zebrafish to track the blood stem cells the fish are born with, the clones these cells make of themselves and the types of specialized blood cells they give rise to (red cells, white cells and platelets). Leonard Zon, professor of stem cell and regenerative biology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University and a senior author on the paper, believes the tool has many implications for hematology and cancer medicine since zebrafish are surprisingly similar to humans genetically. People are born with a certain number of blood stem cells and rely on them for life. Various blood disorders and cancers are thought to arise when a mutant clone of an original blood stem cell starts to dominate. But what actually happens with blood stem cells over time has been hard to pin down.  There s significant interest in determining how a stem cell clone expands, what makes one clone dominant, and why that predisposes you to cancer and blood disorders,  said Zon, who is also director of the Stem Cell Research Program at Boston Children s. All the colors of the rainbow Zon, with David Traver of the University of California at San Diego, first author Jonathan Henninger of HMS and Boston Children s, and other colleagues, used a specially bred zebrafish called Zebrabow that has multiple copies of genes for red-blue-green fluorescent protein scattered through its genome. By activating certain enzymes, the team cut the red-blue-green assembly in different ways and in different amounts. This technique yields, in theory, about 80 different colors based on the cell s overall proportions of each fluorescent protein. Each color represents a different clone or variety of blood stem cell.  It s like an RGB television set, where red, blue and green give you the whole spectrum of colors,  explained Zon.  In our system, the enzyme cuts out different parts blue, for example, or green and blue so the stem cell will end up a different shade of color. In this way, we were able to mark each stem cell being born with a different color, and then follow the colors through development and see how many stem cells of each color were present in the adult fish.  Other scientists have developed tracking systems based on genetic barcodes. But these require dissecting the cells, so cannot analyze living, circulating cell populations.  Because our system is based on color, we don t have to destroy the cells to analyze their clonality,  said Henninger, an HMS research assistant graduate student in the Zon lab.  Rather, we can isolate the cells by color, with the help of computational tools, and then look at what genetic factors are involved in their expansion.  Tracking blood disease and cancer A normal blood system tends to have a diversity of clonal stem cell types; all cells are genetically identical but have different epigenetic changes that affect gene expression. Being able to track how different clonal populations develop has many implications for medicine. For example, leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders, in which certain kinds of blood cells aren t made or don t mature properly, are thought to arise from a clone of an original stem cell that ran amok and began replicating in great numbers. But until now, this has been hard to analyze, since no one knew how many blood stem cells we start out with. Based on the zebrafish data, Henninger and Zon estimate that blood stem cells make up about 20 percent of all blood cell progenitors at the time they are formed. That provides a starting point for exploring, for example, why and how a particular blood stem cell clone may begin to expand as people age, posing a risk for leukemia, or how cancer chemotherapy can sometimes transform tumor cells.  Within a tumor, you can get clones of cells that become resistant to chemotherapy, and that s what kills the person,  Zon explained.  The questions are,  What makes a clone take off and start to behave differently than the rest? How is clonal diversity regulated?  Maximizing marrow transplant Similarly, the knowledge could also improve bone marrow transplantation for a variety of childhood and adult disorders.  When you do a bone marrow transplant, only certain clones of stem cells take,  Zon said.  This is important because these clones are driving development of an entire blood system, based on a finite number of cells.  To test this out, the team irradiated the Zebrabow fish, damaging their blood cells, then watched, using their color-coding system, as the fish s blood systems recovered.  We saw that a smaller number of clones were dominant,  Zon said.  This suggests there are some  good  cells that help people regenerate a healthy blood system.

More than half the babies had microcephaly, brain calcifications and loss of brain tissue volume, along with other structural changes. ""The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas has coincided with increased reports of babies born with microcephaly,"" said study author Heron Werner Jr., M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Radiology at Cl nica de Diagn stico por Imagem. ""An early diagnosis may help in treating these babies after birth. Moreover, the knowledge of abnormalities present in the central nervous system may give hints about the pathophysiology of the disease."" Zika is mainly spread to humans via the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms may include fever, rash, joint or muscle pain, headache and bloodshot eyes. More serious conditions, such as Guillain-Barr  syndrome, have been associated with Zika infection in adults, but are uncommon. Many adults infected with Zika have no symptoms at all. Zika appears to be most dangerous when transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, increasing the likelihood of severe brain defects in the baby, including microcephaly. Zika has also been linked to eye defects, hearing impairment and stunted growth in babies. Don't Miss: Neurodevelopmental model of Zika may provide rapid answersPregnant women and women who are considering becoming pregnant should avoid visiting areas where infected mosquitos are known to be present. However, if women live in areas where the mosquitos are present, the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, US) is to wear clothes that protect from mosquito bites, use mosquito repellent and get appropriate testing, including routine prenatal care and an ultrasound at 18 to 20 weeks. Pregnant women who are worried that they may have contracted the virus should speak with their obstetrician to initiate testing. Although these reports focus on the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the infection has spread to countries and territories around the world, including the United States.

Consistent with past functional MRI studies, their findings demonstrate neuro-metabolite alterations across the brain - linking stuttering to changes in brain circuits that control speech production and circuits that support attention and emotion. The study in now published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). See Also: Brain develops abnormally over lifespan of people who stutterThe research was led by Bradley S. Peterson, MD, Director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at CHLA, and Professor and Director of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. Developmental stuttering is a neuropsychiatric condition; its origins in the brain are only partly known. In order to measure an index of neural density related to stuttering in circuits and brain regions suspected to be affected, the scientists performed proton shift imaging of the brain in 47 children and 47 adults. The study included subjects both with and without stuttering. Related: Researchers, clients turn to video to treat stuttering The research team found that affected brain regions included major nodes of the so-called Bohland speech-production network (associated with the regulation of motor activity); the default-mode network, (involved in the regulation of attention); and the emotional-memory network (responsible for regulating emotion). ""That stuttering is related to speech and language-based brain circuits seems clear,"" says Peterson. ""Attention-regulating portions of the brain are related to control circuits that are important in governing behavior. People with changes here are more likely to stutter and have more severe stuttering. And emotions like anxiety and stress also tend to make stuttering worse, likely because this network interacts with language and attention control circuits."" Learn More: Testing ecopipam's effectiveness in treating stuttering This initial, unique MRS study of stuttering confirmed that disturbances in neuronal or membrane metabolism contribute to the development of stuttering. Looking at a combination of children and adults in order to detect the effects of stuttering, independent of life-stage, revealed differences between children and adults within both the stuttering and control samples. This suggests different metabolic profiles in children versus adults who stutter. Few sex-specific effects of stuttering on brain metabolites were observed.

These 'neural progenitors' (stem cells that differentiate into different kinds of neurons) are produced during embryonic development. See Also: Stem cells in the brain: Limited self-renewal These findings show that the neural progenitors found in the meninges produce new neurons after birth, highlighting the importance of meningeal tissue as well as these cells' potential in the development of new therapies for brain damage or neurodegeneration. A paper highlighting the results is published in the journal Cell Stem Cell. Scientists' understanding of brain plasticity, or the ability of the brain to grow, develop, recover from injuries and adapt to changing conditions throughout our lives, has been greatly broadened in recent years. Before the discoveries of the last few decades, neurologists once thought that the brain became 'static' after childhood. This dogma has changed, with researchers finding more and more evidence that the brain is capable of healing and regenerating in adulthood, thanks to the presence of stem cells. However, neuronal stem cells were generally believed to only reside within the brain tissue, not in the membranes surrounding it. Believed in the past to serve a mainly protective function to dampen mechanical shocks, the meninges have been historically underappreciated by science as having neurological importance in its own right. The data gathered by the team challenges the current idea that neural precursors or stem cells that give rise to neurons can only be found inside actual brain tissue. Learn More: Scientists sniff out unexpected role for stem cells in the brain Prof. Peter Carmeliet notes: ""The neuronal stems cells that we discovered inside the meninges differentiate to full neurons, electrically-active and functionally integrated into the neuronal circuit. To show that the stem cells reside in the meninges, we used the extremely powerful single-cell RNA sequencing technique, a very novel top-notch technique, capable of identifying the [complex gene expression signature] nature of individual cells in a previously unsurpassed manner, a premi re at VIB."" When it comes to future leads for this discovery, the scientists also see possibilities for translation into clinical application, though future work is required. ""An intriguing question is whether these neuronal stem cells in the meninges could lead to better therapies for brain damage or neurodegeneration. However, answering this question would require a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of these stem cells,"" says Carmeliet. ""How are these meningeal stem cells activated to become different kinds of neurons? Can we therapeutically 'hijack' their regeneration potential to restore dying neurons in, for example, Alzheimer' Disease, Parkinson's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other neurodegenerative disorders? Also, can we isolate these neurogenic progenitors from the meninges at birth and use them for later transplantation? These findings open up very exciting research opportunities for the future."" Moving into unchartered territory is high risk, and can offer high gain, but securing funding for such type of research is challenging. However, Carmeliet's discoveries were made possible to a large extent by funding through ""Opening the Future: pioneering without boundaries"", a recently created Mecenas Funding Campaign for funding of high risk brain research but with potential for breakthrough discoveries, started up by the KU Leuven in 2013 and unique in Flanders.

Writing in the journal eLife, scientists from The Scripps Research Institute, US, have for the first time found a way to study 'food comas' in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and explained some of the causes behind this phenomenon. See Also: Taste sensors in fly legs control feeding They created a system that can measure both the sleep and feeding behaviors of individual fruit flies and discovered that, in much the same way as humans, the animals sleep for longer periods following larger meals. Further studies also revealed that certain types of food can promote post-meal sleep. ""In Drosophila, there is a well-documented interaction between sleep and metabolism, whereby flies suppress sleep or increase their activity when starved,"" says senior author William Ja, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of Metabolism and Aging at Scripps Florida. ""However, the acute effects of food consumption on sleep have not yet been tested, largely because there was no system available to do so."" To better understand this relationship, Ja and his team created the Activity Recording CAFE (ARC), the first system for flies that enables visual tracking of food consumption and animal motion. Recordings of fruit flies' behavior from this system reveal that, after eating a meal, the animals sleep more before returning to a normal state of wakefulness. The sleep period generally lasts around 20 to 40 minutes, with flies that eat larger portions generally sleeping more. To determine if individual nutrients could modulate post-meal sleep, the team gave the flies food consisting of protein, salt or sugar. They found that only protein and salt were effectors of post-meal sleep, suggesting that this form of sleep can indeed be regulated by specific food types. Learn More: Light causes drosophila to take longer midday nap ""We next sought to identify a neuronal mechanism by which feeding drives post-meal sleep,"" explains first author Keith Murphy. ""By using genetic tools to turn neurons on and off in the fly brain, we were surprised to find a number of circuits that play a role in controlling this behavior."" A previous study has shown that leucokinin (Lk) neurons are involved in meal-size regulation, indicating that this system acts rapidly during feeding to signal a behavioral shift. Building on this work, the authors of the current study demonstrate that the Lk system plays a role in post-meal sleep. ""A subset of leucokinin receptor (Lkr) neurons was necessary to initiate post-meal sleep in the presence of protein specifically,"" Murphy says. ""While we expected that flies defective in protein sensing would experience post-meal sleep in a similar way to those fed only sucrose, we found instead that they had a waking response. Our analysis suggests that ingested protein promotes both sleep and wakefulness, and that the wakefulness is counterbalanced by Lkr neuronal activity."" They also found that other brain circuits are sensitive to the fruit fly's internal clock, reducing post-meal sleepiness only around dusk. Taking these results together, the team concludes that post-meal sleepiness can be regulated in a number of different ways in flies and humans alike. Don't Miss: Dietary restriction gives fruit flies a rhythm for a long life ""The ARC provides a starting point for future studies aimed at uncovering the exact genes and circuits that enable meal size, protein and salt to drive sleep,"" Ja adds.

Failure to detect and/or repair of DNA genotoxic lesions, such as double-strand breaks, can lead to the appearance of mutations, genomic instability and, eventually, cancer.  In order to better understand the DNA-repair processes, Dr Modesti's team exploits and merges different techniques going from classical ensemble biochemical assays and cell biology to the use of  single-molecule  biophysical methods that allow visualization and monitoring of the dynamic behavior of repair proteins acting on DNA molecules. Given that tumor treatments by radiotherapy or chemotherapy rely on the induction of DNA double-strand breaks in cancer cells in order to kill them, targeting the factors involved in DNA repair is thus a sensible strategy to improve cancer therapy but still necessitates a deeper understanding at the fundamental level of the DNA repair mechanisms, which is the goal of the research group.  The group uses JPK's NanoTracker  2 optical tweezers system as a unique tool that enables the grabbing and manipulation of individual DNA molecules. This way, the researchers of the group are able to hold the DNA, like a wire between two handles, and study the action of different DNA-repair proteins. Optical tweezers are used to  feel  the mechanical action of the proteins on the DNA and are combined with fluorescence imaging in order to observe, in real time, the position of the (fluorescently labelled) proteins as they move along the DNA and interact between them and with the DNA substrate. The group has recently developed an assay where two DNA molecules are captured and used to test whether and how different DNA-repair complexes are able to bring and maintain together the two DNA molecules. This mimics the situation in which the DNA is broken in two pieces and the two pieces need to be held together and then reconnected, as illustrated in the schematics below.  Describing the system and its role in the group, research engineer, Davide Normanno, takes up the story.  We use the JPK NanoTracker  2 optical tweezers system in combination with a custom-built single-molecule epi-fluorescence microscope and a microfluidics system. This way we can catch and manipulate the DNA while precisely controlling the environmental conditions and observing the activity on the DNA of fluorescently labelled proteins. This enables us to perform, follow and study complex biochemical reactions in a highly controlled way. We especially like the software to control all the instrumentation, which is a crucial aspect to be actually able to perform such complicate experiments.  ""Also, we appreciate the timely and positive interaction with all JPK engineers, application specialists, and software developers for their help and support when we have some issue or questions. Their efforts in continuing to implement and add new custom functionalities in the software enables us to really have fun and, hopefully, be creative and innovative in the use of the NanoTracker  system. We also enjoy the versatility of the (new AOD-based) trap multiplexing, which gives us the possibility to have as many traps as we want, and more traps means more fun for us!

Ramesh Wigneshweraraj is a Professor of Microbiology leading a group that is working at the leading edge of understanding the behaviour of small proteins produced by viruses that infect bacteria (phages) at the single cell level to ultimately inspire and inform the development of truly novel drugs against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.  Networking in science is so often the provider for new discoveries and collaborations. A meeting at Cambridge proved the point here with Professor Wigneshweraraj (Ramesh) meeting Oxford physicist, Professor Achillefs Kapanidis of the Clarendon Laboratory. Discussing their research over a drink on a warm summer evening, Professor Kapanidis pulled out his laptop and showed results of an experiment very relevant to that being defined by his colleague, Ramesh. One thing led to another and an early demonstration for the Nanoimager, a high resolution single molecule imaging technique developed over a number of years by the Kapanidis group. When, in May 2016, newly-formed company Oxford Nanoimaging (ONI) launched the commercial version of the Nanoimager, Ramesh set out to get funding for the system. With support from the Wellcome Trust, one of ONI's first installations was made at Imperial College in September.  Since its arrival, the Nanoimager has been put through its paces by PhD student, Amy Switzer. Without a background in microscopy, Amy has been able to define what she needs from the instrument to satisfy her research needs. Now working alongside ONI's development team, she is evaluating new data processing software to enable her to produce data at the super-resolution levels. Having a multifunctional system is enabling her to use a variety of imaging methods to achieve live cell imaging at the single molecule level. Techniques at the single molecule level including immunofluorescence, tracking PALM and dSTORM, will now help Amy and Ramesh to work quickly on their goal   the rapid evaluation of how phage-derived small proteins inhibit bacteria and how bacterial enzymes behave in response to the diverse stresses they are subjected to. The Nanoimager, seen below, is a very small unit measuring just 21 cm x 21 cm. It requires no special environmental conditions like an isolation table as it has been designed to compensate for acoustic and vibrational issues. As Amy says,  I am very fortunate to be one of the first users of the Nanoimager. I can work directly with the inventors including Bo Jing from the Kapanidis team. I am able to request new iterations of software and these are delivered with enthusiasm by the ONI folks.  Timing is very important and here Ramesh takes up the story.  My meeting with Achillefs and the acquisition of the Nanoimager has come at the right time for my research needs. It enables me to understand the behaviour of individual proteins within single bacterial cells. Given the appropriate experimental protocols, I am able to easily detect specific proteins in mixed populations of bacteria. Looking ahead, I can envisage an application of the NanoImager in early diagnostics of bacterial infections, thus enabling rapid species identification and ensuring the correct medication is prescribed, and thereby improving patient welfare while reducing costs. We are really excited to work with ONI in the on-going development of diverse applications for the Nanoimager and, more importantly, to advance fundamental bacteriology in this new and exciting direction.

The Unit is a core facility with the responsibility of providing collaborative assistance to scientists from ARS, Northeast Area and Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) who have microscopy applications that require high resolution imaging. Dr Bauchan s team have produced images using electron microscopes of bacteria, fungi, mites, insects, nematodes and parasites along with plant and animal tissues both healthy and diseased. One of his major collaborations is with Dr Ron Ochoa, the world's expert on plant feeding mites.  Biological specimens require special treatment due to the high water content of the samples. Many of the specimens are in liquid cultures or are very soft-bodied and by using classical preparative techniques will either destroy the specimen or distort the specimen producing artefacts. A cryo-prep system is an ultra-fast method to ready the specimens for observation in a SEM especially a high resolution field emission SEM. Thus, specimens are frozen in time to allow for observation of feeding behaviour, mating behaviour, host/parasite interactions, etc. It preserves the natural orientation of ultrafine structures such as setae, antenna, legs, skin texture, sensory organs, waxy coatings and eggs.  Asked about his experience using a Quorum PP2000 Cryo-SEM preparation system on the Hitachi S-4700 field emission scanning electron microscope, Dr Bauchan said  The Quorum system is easy to use, the set-up for imaging is logical, durable, reliable, and maintains ultra-low temperatures for a long period of time. Holders containing pre-frozen samples are transferred into the cryo-prep chamber where they are etched to remove any surface contamination (condensed water vapour) by raising the temperature of the stage from -130  C  to -90  C for 10-15 minutes. Following etching, the temperature inside the chamber was lowered below -130  C, and the specimens were coated with a 10 nm layer of platinum using a magnetron sputter head equipped with a platinum target. The specimens were transferred to a pre-cooled (-130  C) cryo-stage in the SEM for observation.  The system has been used in multiple projects by the Unit, many of which have been published with the generation of stunning, colourful images. The use of low temperature SEM has been shown time and again to be the best method for the examination of microscopic biological specimens and their ultrastructure. The work in conjunction with Dr Ochoa has been particularly productive with five papers published this year to date. These have focused on the field of acarology, a branch of zoology dealing with the study of mites and ticks.  Source: Story from Quorum Technologies.

The new urine test, they say, is different because it analyzes not only multiple sources of human cellular DNA altered by precancerous changes, but also DNA from HPV that is sexually transmitted and causes virtually all cases of the disease. In a proof-of-concept study, described online in Cancer Prevention Research on November 8, the investigators say their genetic markers test showed a ""sensitivity"" or accuracy rate of 90.9 percent in identifying so-called CIN2 lesions -- cervical lesions with abnormal cells likely to not only develop into cancer, but also to develop into cancers likely to spread. Additionally, they demonstrated that the DNA for all three human genes and one viral gene could be successfully extracted from urine, and they could identify such lesions with 75 percent sensitivity. Two commercial tests based on markers of DNA chemical changes called methylation, released in Europe last summer, require Pap smears or swabs of cervical tissue, and show 64 percent sensitivity in identifying similar lesions, according to senior investigator Rafael Guerrero-Preston, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. ""If further studies confirm these findings, we see a significant use of urine screening as a way to quickly and inexpensively determine if a biopsy is warranted, or if physicians can use a 'watch and wait' approach before intervening,"" says Guerrero-Preston. Typically, he says, a woman who tests positive for HPV and has an abnormal Pap smear undergoes a biopsy to rule out cervical cancer using cells taken directly from cervical tissue. But previous studies suggest more than 50 percent of these biopsies are unnecessary and can result in pain, worry, infertility and higher health care costs. ""Our urine test would serve as a molecular triage,"" he says, ""at times supplementing Pap test information.

But like Olympic athletes who rely on special diets to perform, tumor cells  amped-up metabolism can also make them dependent on specific nutrients for survival. For years, scientists have been trying to identify and understand these cellular cravings in hopes of creating new cancer treatments that work by blocking off access to necessary nutrients and starving tumors to death. In a new study, Duke University scientists report that cells from a vicious and treatment-resistant form of breast cancer, called triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), die off rapidly when deprived of a key nutrient called cystine. By examining the cause of cell death, they found that this  cystine addiction  is triggered by a mechanism that many kinds of tumor cells use to break away and migrate to new locations in the body.  This process is well-known and shows up in metastatic cancer cells, and what we found is that it also makes the cells cystine-addicted,  said Jen-Tsan Ashley Chi, associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Duke University School of Medicine and senior author on the study.  This is great news, because these are the cells that we really want to get rid of.  The results indicate that blocking cystine uptake may be an effective way of treating not only triple negative breast cancer, but other aggressive cancers that use this pathway during metastasis. The study appeared online Nov. 21 in Oncogene. Patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, which constitute about 10 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases, have few treatment options outside of surgery and chemotherapy. That is because the most successful breast cancer therapies target two of three receptors commonly found in tumor cells -- estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or the Her2/neu receptor -- but triple negative breast cancer cells lack all three. Some studies have hinted that these cells cannot survive without cystine, a molecule built from two copies of the amino acid cysteine linked together. Earlier this year, Chi s group published a study showing that cells from an aggressive form of kidney cancer are addicted to cystine. To find out if this was also true for triple negative breast cancer, Xiaohu Tang, a previous postdoctoral fellow in Chi's lab, submitted both triple-negative and estrogen-positive breast cancer cells to a nutrient deprivation test: growing batches of each cell type in a series of different growth media, each missing just one out of 15 key amino acids. Most of the cells showed little reaction to these small changes in diet, Chi said. But there was one notable exception.  The triple negative breast cancer cells were very sensitive to cystine,  Chi said.  So if you removed cystine, they just rapidly died, while the other breast cancer cells didn t care.  They subjected the cells to a battery of genetic analyses to pinpoint the cause. They found that the cystine addiction is linked to a process called the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a bit of genetic programming that allows stationary epithelial cells, usually stuck in place by tough, zipper-like molecules, to transform themselves into roving mesenchymal cells. The triple negative breast cancer cells, along with several other types of cancer cells, tap into this process to break away from their neighbors and metastasize to spread throughout the body, Chi says. But it appears that this process also triggers a cellular signaling pathway that leads to rapid death as soon as cystine is not available.  We found that this transition between epithelial and mesenchymal basically opens up a signaling difference that makes the cells very vulnerable to cystine deprivation, leading to death,  Chi said.  It is almost like EMT is opens up a whole highway system (for cystine-mediated death), and therapeutically this could be very useful because there are actually compounds to block this.  Chi says the team is now in the process of testing out these cystine-blocking molecules on tumors and searching for biomarkers that will help identify when cancers are likely to respond positively to this treatment.    Tumor cells use this EMT programming to move faster, to move around the body,  Chi said.  We want to take advantage of this same pathway to cure you.  Source: Story from the Duke University.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) account for more than 70 percent of diagnostic testing for malaria in Africa. Most rapid test diagnostics rely on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), an antigen specific to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, one of every 15 children infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in the DRC is infected by a pfhrp2-deleted mutant, producing a false-negative result when an RDT is used, investigators from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found.  This is the first nationwide study to demonstrate the presence and estimate the prevalence of malaria caused by pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum in asymptomatic children,  said Jonathan Parr, MD, MPH, the study s lead author and a researcher in UNC s Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Ecology Lab.  Because most rapid diagnostic tests in the DRC are HRP2-based, they will fail to detect these parasites,  Parr said.  Their spread would represent a serious threat to malaria elimination efforts.  Samples were collected from children under the age of 5 during the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey in the DRC. The UNC team focused on 783 samples with opposing rapid test diagnostic test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. PCR testing showed positive results for malaria where rapid diagnostic testing did not.  We identified 149 P. falciparum isolates with a deletion of the pfhrp2 gene, representing a country-wide prevalence of 6.4 percent,  Parr said.  This proved that pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum is a common cause of rapid diagnostic test negative, but PCR positive malaria test results among asymptomatic children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Surveillance for these deletions is needed and alternatives to HRP2-specific rapid diagnostic tests may be necessary.  The WHO and UNC recently coordinated a meeting in Atlanta to address these parasites. The meeting brought together leading researchers, policy makers, commercial diagnostic developers, and representatives from diverse national malaria control programs to review what s known and to formulate a response. Alternate rapid diagnostic tests will be deployed in settings where they are found to be common, and further research into their clinical impact and distribution throughout Africa will be undertaken. The DRC project resulted from an National Institutes of Health-funded study of malaria transmission led by Steven Meshnick, MD, PhD, professor and associate chair of epidemiology at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. Meshnick emphasized the need for a measured response.  It is important to note that these mutated parasites have only been found in a small number of places in the world,  Meshnick said.  HRP2-based rapid tests continue to play a key role in malaria control and elimination efforts.  The team is actively investigating these parasites through applied genomics studies recently funded by the Thrasher Research Fund and the ASTMH/Burroughs Wellcome Fund and ongoing NIH-funded epidemiological studies in Kinshasa Province, DRC.

This research, which was reported this month in Cancer Research, shows that defective Kv1.3 channels, which regulate calcium ions (Ca2+) presence in T cells, and Ca2+ abnormalities in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes cells that attack and kill cancer cells may contribute to the inability of the immune system to fight off head and neck cancers.   By regulating their expression at the cellular level and using the body s own immune response to fight the tumor cells, patients with these cancers could have better, more effective outcomes.   ""Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth most common type of cancer, with a 5-year survival of 50 percent,  says Laura Conforti, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the UC College of Medicine, a researcher within the UC Cancer Institute and corresponding author on the study. ""The heterogeneity of these tumors, the complex anatomy of the head and neck region and the proximity of these tumors to several vital organs and structures present a challenge in conventional treatment options of these cancers.  ""Immunotherapies aimed to boost the immune system to fight cancer cells are showing promising results in this group of patients.  Conforti says that to survive and spread, tumors create a cozy microenvironment where they often go unrecognized by the immune system. ""The extent to which CD8+ cells, a type of T cell capable of killing cancer cells, infiltrate the head and neck tumor affects disease progression and responsiveness to therapy,  she says. ""Also, how well CD8+ lymphocytes function within the confines of the tumor microenvironment determines their ability to eradicate cancer cells, and in the case of head and neck solid tumors, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have multiple functional defects, decreasing their ability to work correctly.  ""The function of CD8+ lymphocytes depends on Ca2+, which is controlled by ion channels. In particular, Kv1.3 ion channels regulate Ca2+ influx into T cells. In this study, we assessed the role of Kv1.3 channel and Ca2+ fluxes on these lymphocytes  function in head and neck cancer,  she adds. Conforti says that her team, led by Ameet Chimote, PhD, research associate in the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, used tumor samples and blood from 14 patients with head and neck cancers to analyze how Kv1.3 effected the function of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes.  They found a 70 percent reduction in functional Kv1.3 channels in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as compared to the blood T cells, which was accompanied by a decrease in Ca2+ levels and reduced ability to attack and kill cancer cells.  ""Overall our data showed that suppression of Kv1.3 channels in these lymphocytes, the cells that fight off cancer, contribute to their decreased function, raising the possibility that this channel may be used as a potential marker of functionally competent T cells that have infiltrated the tumor mass,  Conforti says. ""These findings are particularly timely as a recently published study in Nature proposes these channels as potential new target for immunotherapy in cancer. The authors in this study reported that overexpressing these channels in an animal model with cancer lead to increased survival.  ""Further studies are needed on this T cell channel to find out more about its effects on head and neck cancer and ways we can target it to improve outcomes.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-explanation-for-cancers-male-bias-195763,Genetic Explanation for Cancer s Male Bias Researchers uncover the explaination as to why cancer is found more commonly in males than females  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a new study, a group of Boston scientists, including researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, offer a genetic explanation for the age-old conundrum of why cancer is more common in males than females. Females, it turns out, carry an extra copy of certain protective genes in their cells   an additional line of defense against the cells growing out of control   the investigators report in a paper published online today by Nature Genetics. Though not solely responsible for cancer s  bias  toward males, the duplicate copies likely account for some of the imbalance, including up to 80 percent of the excess male cases in some tumor types, report the study authors, based at Dana-Farber, the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and Massachusetts General Hospital.  Across virtually every type of cancer, occurrence rates are higher in males than in females. In some cases, the difference might be very small   just a few percent   but in certain cancers, incidence is two or three times higher in males,  said Andrew Lane, MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber, the co-senior author of the study with Gad Getz, PhD, of the Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital.  Data from the National Cancer Institute show that males carry about a 20 percent higher risk than females of developing cancer. That translates into 150,000 additional new cases of cancer in men every year.  Despite the size of the gap, the reasons for this divergence have been difficult to discern. The historic explanation   that men were more likely to smoke cigarettes and be exposed to hazardous chemicals in the work environment   has proven inadequate, because even as smoking rates have dropped and occupational patterns changed, men still outpace women in developing many cancers, including some associated with tobacco use such as kidney, renal, bladder, and oral cancers, Lane said. The disparity is present among boys and girls, as well as men and women. Previous research found that in one form of leukemia, the cancer cells often carried a mutation in a gene called KDM6A, located on the X chromosome   one of the sex chromosomes that determine whether an individual is male or female. (Females cells carry two X chromosomes; males carry an X chromosome and a shorter, smaller Y chromosome.) If KDM6A is a tumor-suppressor gene   responsible for preventing cell division from spinning out of control   the mutation could lead to cancer by crippling that restraint system. One might expect female cells to be just as vulnerable to the mutation. During embryo formation, one of the X chromosomes in female cells shuts down and remains off-line for life. A mutation in KDM6A on the active X chromosome, therefore, should lead to the same cell-division havoc as it does in males. Unexpectedly, KDM6A mutations were detected more often in male cancers. It turns out that some genes on the inactivated X chromosome in female cells  escape  that dormant state and function normally. One of those awakened genes happens to be a working copy of KDM6A. The  good  copy of the gene is sufficient to prevent the cell from turning cancerous. The new study explored whether this phenomenon   fully functional tumor-suppressor genes on an otherwise idle X chromosome   underlies the broader phenomenon of cancer s partiality toward male cells. The researchers dubbed such genes  EXITS,  for Escape from X-Inactivation Tumor Suppressors.  Under this theory, one of the reasons cancer is more common in males is that male cells would need a harmful mutation in only one copy of an EXITS gene to turn cancerous,  Lane said.  Female cells, by contrast, would need mutations in both copies.  To test this hypothesis, researchers at the Broad Institute scanned the genomes of more than 4,000 tumor samples, representing 21 different types of cancer, looking for various types of abnormalities, including mutations. They then examined whether any of the irregularities they found were more common in male cells or female cells. The results were striking. Of nearly 800 genes found solely on the X chromosome, six were more frequently mutated   and incapacitated   in males than females. Of more than 18,000 other genes, none showed a gender imbalance in mutation rates. Of the six genes more likely to be mutated in males, five were known to escape X chromosome inactivation, making them strong candidates to be EXITS genes.  The fact that the very genes which are more often mutated in males are found exclusively on the X chromosome   and that several of them are known to be tumor-suppressors and escape X-inactivation   is compelling evidence of our theory,  Lane remarked.  The protection afforded by the working copies of these genes in female cells may help explain the lower incidence of many cancers in women and girls.  One of the implications of the finding is that many cancers may arise through different molecular pathways in men and women. To circumvent the added genetic safeguards against cancer in female cells, tumors in women may employ alternate genetic circuits than in men. Source: Story from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-growth-of-point-of-care-diagnostics-211572,The Growth of Point of Care Diagnostics Point of Care Diagnostics are rapidly evolving to provide immediate care in bedside testing  but key challenges remain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. This article was prepared by Frost & Sullivan. Point of care testing (POCT) instruments are a combination of multi analytical, self-contained portable devices which are employed in direct usage for detection and diagnosis. The molecular testing involves the evaluation of molecule level estimation of DNA/RNA. The amalgamation of molecular level detection and point of care testing is currently the most effective, rapid, point of need in patient bedside care.  Point of Care aspects in modern diagnosis enable continuous monitoring of all relevant parameters in either a minimally invasive or noninvasive way, in an environment that is most convenient to patients.  At Frost & Sullivan, our findings reflect that the global molecular diagnostics market was valued at $6.4 billion in 2015. The US region dominates the market by accounting for the major portion of the global molecular diagnostics market, followed by Europe and the APAC regions. Similarly, the global POCT market accounts for 13 percent of the global IVD market in 2015.  The molecular diagnostics market is witnessing a shift in focus from the infectious disease segment to immediate care in bedside testing, which involves patient monitoring during drug intake and response. Despite advances in diagnosis routines, key challenges remain in POC molecular testing such as sample preparation and nucleic acid extraction that are necessary to obtain a molecular level sample for MDx. The ability to centralize multiple tests in a single diagnosis routine has firmly placed the European POCT market in the growth phase. This has also led to expansion of newer applications in defence forensics and in chronic settings such as oncology. From a M&A perspective, the centralized testing trend continues to be a driving factor, which contributes to the development of new technologies, new product offerings and an increase in market presence. POCT has opened doors to non-healthcare companies and OEMs in connected health that help interoperability and data management of POCT with other upstream and downstream systems. Market participants focusing on strengthening their presence in POCT should employ a diverse set of digital strategies and connectivity solutions rather than relying on comprehensive product portfolio-OEM integration with data connectivity providers. This is particularly crucial considering the lack of uniform reimbursement across the European Union, which is a deterrent for companies seeking to establish strong foothold across the region. Disparity in reimbursement among Western European countries leads to non-linear adoption across segments and non-uniform pricing models. In the European region, POCT devices are regulated under the 1998 European Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The latest amended directive was in 2011 (2011/100/EU). Recently, an international standard (ISO 22870:2006) giving specific requirements applicable to POCT was introduced, and this is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO 15189, which describes the general requirements for the competence and quality of medical laboratories. Patient self-testing in a home or community setting is not covered by these ISO standards. Emergence of iPOCT is the next evolution, which is Technology-based and Need-driven, meeting  the requirement of  real-time analysis, dynamic patient verification at the device level, integration into data management systems, automation of data analysis, report generation/distribution and IT solutions to facilitate communication by sending messages to certain units or users through the POCT device. As part of the clinical routine in diagnosis the need of the hour is to identify and develop a technology which is portable, affordable, hand-held, molecular level analytical system, with shorter turnaround time, that produces efficient results comparable to mutation detection, sequencing, and infectious agent identification, and improves patient care throughout.

For the first time, the researchers have been able to prove that it is possible to confidently detect levels of cocaine and their metabolites using a compact mass spectrometer. The test uses chromatography to separate cocaine from other compounds and can not only detect the presence of cocaine but also give quantitative data about the amount of cocaine a person has ingested. The test was found to offer a level of sensitivity below the cut-off level normally used for oral fluid drug testing, meaning that it can detect even low levels of cocaine in a person s urine or oral fluid. The technique potentially offers an effective solution for scenarios where a rapid test is required. This could include roadside testing by police of motorists, and also drug testing in the workplace and in prisons. While there are a number of portable tests for cocaine commercially available, these are mainly based on antibody reagents, which cannot offer quantitative data and   since the cocaine antibody can bind to something that is not cocaine   can give false positive results. The research paper s lead author, Mahado Ismail of the University of Surrey, explained,  Surface mass spectrometry is used in a wide range of disciplines to obtain chemical information from the surface of a sample. However, until now it has not been possible to translate this method to low cost, portable testing. ""This new method, which extracts analytes from a surface and separates them using chromatography, has been shown to provide a sensitive, accurate result.

This leads to root nodule formation where bacteria are accommodated to convert nitrogen from the air into ammonia that the plant can use for growth. This symbiotic nitrogen fixation allows legumes to thrive in habitats with limited nitrogen availability.  Researchers from Denmark and Germany have now found that an intact nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in Lotus japonicus is needed for the establishment of taxonomically diverse and distinctive bacterial communities. Integrating these highly specific binary interactions into an ecological community context is critical for understanding the evolution of symbiosis and efficient use of rhizobia inoculum in agricultural systems.  Legumes are known as pioneer plants colonising marginal soils, and as enhancers of the nutritional status in cultivated soils. This beneficial activity has been explained by their capacity to engage in symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The beneficial effect of this symbiosis is not limited to legume hosts, but extends to subsequent or concurrent plantings with non-legumes as exemplified by ancient agricultural practices with legume cropping sequences or intercropping systems. This symbiosis likely involves a beneficial activity of legumes on the nutritional status of the soil as well as the soil biome. However, the mechanisms underpinning these symbiotic interactions in a community context and their impact on the complex microbial assemblages associated with roots remain largely unknown.  Loss of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis impacts plant growth  The research team performed a bacterial community profiling analysis of Lotus japonicus wild-type plants, grown in natural soil, and symbiotic mutants impaired at different stages of the symbiotic process. They found that the loss of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis impacts plant growth, and dramatically alters Lotus-associated community structures, affecting at least 14 bacterial orders. This growth phenotype and the altered community structure were retained under nitrogen-supplemented conditions that blocked the formation of functional nodules in wild-type.  This finding extends the role of key symbiotic genes beyond perception and selection of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia for intracellular accommodation in nodules, and reveals a major role in the establishment of bacterial communities in the root and rhizosphere of L. japonicus.  Their study raises the possibility that the influence of legumes on soil performance in agricultural and ecological contexts is mediated by the enrichment of a symbiosis-linked bacterial community rather than dinitrogen-fixing rhizobia alone. In the longer term, these bacteria alone or with rhizobia could be used as inoculum for other plants to increase their growth with minimal nutrient consumption.  Source: Story from Aarhus University.

For most people, it's not a serious disease, but structural biologist Rebecca DuBois saw how devastating it can be when she worked at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. ""There were all these young cancer patients who were successfully fighting their cancer, but they were getting severe chronic astrovirus infections because the chemotherapy suppressed their immune systems, and there was no treatment for it,"" said DuBois, now an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz. By studying the astrovirus capsid, the protein shell of the viral particles, the DuBois lab is laying the foundation for new antiviral therapies and vaccines for human astroviruses. In a new study accepted for publication in the Journal of Virology, she used x-ray crystallography to show how a specific protein structure on the surface of the virus is blocked by a neutralizing antibody, thus preventing the virus from infecting human cells. ""We've identified a site of vulnerability on the surface of the virus that we can now target for development of a vaccine or antiviral therapy,"" DuBois said. ""These are the first results showing how a neutralizing antibody blocks this virus."" Antibody binding site The study shows how the antibody binds to a structure known as the astrovirus capsid spike domain, which projects from the surface of the virus. By binding to the spike domain, the antibody blocks the virus's ability to attach to and infect human cells. The new findings provide a roadmap for researchers to design a vaccine based on the spike domain that can induce neutralizing antibodies and prevent infection in children. The study also highlights the potential to develop therapeutic antibodies to treat severe astrovirus infections. ""Antibody therapeutics is a rapidly growing field. Many immunotherapies are being developed to target cancer cells, and we expect to see a growing number of antibody therapies for infectious diseases over the next ten years,"" DuBois said. Graduate student Walter Bogdanoff is first author of the paper. DuBois noted that the first three authors of the paper--Bogdanoff and undergraduates Jocelyn Campos and Edmundo Perez--have all been supported by the STEM Diversity Programs at UC Santa Cruz.

Called MEMOIR, or Memory by Engineered Mutagenesis with Optical In situ Readout, the technique can record the life history of animal cells their relationships with other cells, communication patterns, and the influential events that have shaped them. ""MEMOIR allows cells to record their histories in their genomes and allows us to read out that information using advanced microscopy methods,"" says Long Cai, assistant professor of chemistry at Caltech and a principal investigator of the new research. Colead authors of the paper are postdoctoral scholars Kirsten Frieda and Sahand Hormoz, and research scientist James Linton. ""Normally, we can only see the state of a cell at the moment we look at it,"" says co-principal investigator Michael Elowitz, professor of biology and bioengineering at Caltech and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. ""But what we really want to know is, what is the history of that cell? Who are its sisters and cousins? Who did it talk to and when?"" The new study serves as a proof of principle, demonstrating that MEMOIR can read the histories of cells from mice. Ultimately, the researchers say the method will aid in the understanding of tissue and animal development, as well as in studies of the abnormal development of diseased tissues like tumors. Reconstructing cellular family trees In the same way that biologists use DNA to trace the lineages of humans and other animal species, molecular biologists can use DNA to trace the lineages of cells. As animals develop, their cells divide and multiply, leading to new generations. Molecular biologists have been developing various methods to reconstruct the lineages of cellular families and answer questions about when and how they develop. Two new powerful tools have helped in this goal. In one, genome editing, a developing organism's genetic code can be changed at any designated target site with the help of a DNA-slicing system called CRISPR. Any change written in one cell's genome is passed on to subsequent generations. A change occurring earlier in an animal's development will appear in many of its cells, while more recent changes will appear in fewer cells. By analyzing the patterns of DNA edits, researchers can identify the cells' common ancestors and figure out how they are related; for example, they can determine which cells are sisters or cousins. Similar approaches are used in diverse areas of science including medieval history. ""Historians can identify the lineage and origins of medieval manuscripts because of errors propagated by medieval copyists in abbeys,"" says Cai. ""Thus, propagated errors are quite informative about the history of texts and, in our case, cells."" The other tool, called sequential single molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization seqFISH was developed by Cai to learn which genes are active in an individual cell. In a recent Neuron paper, Cai's team demonstrated how the technique could be used to determine the expression levels of more than 200 genes in a single cell. The method also lets researchers analyze the gene activity of a cell in its place of origin in the body. Previous techniques required the cells to be dissociated from their natural setting. In the new study, the scientists combined the two tools: the seqFISH method was used to track changes introduced into the genome via CRISPR editing. ""The key insight was to develop a special kind of genomic memory storage element, analogous to a computer bit, that could be flipped by CRISPR between two different states,"" says Elowitz. ""This can be distinguished just by looking at the cells with seqFISH and determining whether they share the same CRISPR edits."" Recording cellular ""talk"" This system can be used to learn about not only cell-lineage information but also about events that happened to the cells in the past when they received messages from one another or when they changed from one cell type into another. For example, as a tumor develops, some cells may receive different molecular signals than other cells, triggering distinct fates. One cell might become metastatic and migrate, while another cell remains stationary. The ability to track how signals in the past affected the fate of a cell in the present could provide a new view of tumor development across time and space. ""The technology promises us access to information within the cell that we have not been privy to before,"" says Linton. ""Potentially, MEMOIR can record the activity of multiple signaling pathways within single cells, providing information on how the pathways work together to influence a cell to make decisions, such as when a neural stem cell differentiates to become a neuron."" In the current study, the researchers traced the history of mouse embryonic stem cells over three generations. In the future, they hope to follow even more generations and ultimately learn the life stories of animal development, as told through their cellular memoirs. Source: Story from CalTech.

Side effects, including an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women, also severely curtail their use for cancer prevention. However, a new study by scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) offers a novel structure-based drug design strategy aimed at altering the basic landscape of this type of breast cancer treatment. The findings show that the current approach is not the only, or even the best way, to block the oestrogen receptor.  We have created a different approach that gives us a mechanism to produce new types of therapeutic molecules,  said TSRI Associate Professor Kendall Nettles.  There are a lot of ways to avoid resistance and other cancer risks, and this gives us a tool box full of alternative approaches that could limit or eliminate those effects.   With the standard method, no one understands the structural basis,  he continued.  With our approach we know exactly how we did it. If you can see the shape of the receptor protein and see how the drug works on it, that makes the development process that much faster.  The findings were published November 21, 2016, by the journal Nature Chemical Biology. Seeing Is Believing The current method of creating this class of drugs, which includes tamoxifen, involves attaching a bulky cluster of atoms with a chainlike structure (called, appropriately, a side chain) to molecules that disrupt the oestrogen receptor binding site. The team s new strategy taps a technique called X-ray crystallography to visualize the drug candidate as it binds to the receptor. This image is used to guide the production of oestrogen receptor degraders that also lack the side chain, helping to reduce the risk of resistance and the development of other cancers.  Our structure-trapping approach to X-ray crystallography provides a molecular snapshot of how subtle changes to a compound series generate a range of graded activity profiles,  said Research Associate Jerome C. Nwachukwu, who was co-first author with Research Associate Sathish Srinivasan.  This structurally distinct mechanism, acting indirectly rather than involvement of the typical side chain, provides a new way to design biologically distinct molecules for breast cancer prevention and treatment.  The new method also makes it possible to identify structural rules for how the molecules interact.  This is the first example of a structure-based design strategy targeting the oestrogen receptor where there is a clear correlation between the chemistry, crystal structure and activity, which is another big advance that will be of broad interest to the cancer community,  Srinivasan said.  We show that indirect antagonism can result in inhibition of proliferation in a predictive fashion.  Source: Story from The Scripps Research Institute.

But less understood is the mechanical force that governs those interactions. A multidisciplinary team of Cornell engineers and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania have devised a method for measuring the force a cell   in this case, a breast cancer cell   exerts on its fibrous surroundings. Understanding those forces has implications in many disciplines, including immunology and cancer biology, and could help scientists better design biomaterial scaffolds for tissue engineering. The group, led by Mingming Wu, associate professor in the Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering, developed 3-D traction-force microscopy to measure the displacement of fluorescent marker beads distributed in a collagen matrix. The beads are displaced by the pulling of migrating breast cancer cells embedded in the matrix. An important part of the puzzle was to calculate the force exerted by the cells using the displacement of the beads. That calculation was carried out by the team led by Vivek Shenoy, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Wu   who also was affiliated with the Cornell Center on the Microenvironment and Metastasis at Weill Cornell Medicine, which existed from 2009 through 2015   said the group s work centered on a basic question: How much force do cells exert on their extracellular matrix when they migrate?  The matrix is like a rope, and in order for the cell to move, they have to exert force on this rope,  she said.  The question arose from cancer metastasis, because if the cells don t move around, it s a benign tumor and generally not life-threatening.  It s when the cancerous cell migrates that serious problems can arise. That migration occurs through  cross-talk  between the cell and the matrix, the group found. As the cell pulls on the matrix, the fibrous matrix stiffens; in turn, the stiffening of the matrix causes the cell to pull harder, which stiffens the matrix even more. This increased stiffening also increases cell force transmission distance, which can potentially promote metastasis of cancer cells.  We ve shown that the cells are able to align the fibers in their vicinity by exerting force,  Hall said.  We ve also shown that when the matrix is more fibrous   less like a continuous material and more like a mesh of fibers   they re able to align the fibers through the production of force. And once the fiber is aligned and taut, it s easier for cells to pull on them and migrate.   I m a strong believer that every new science discovery goes hand-in-hand with new technology development,  she said.  And with every new tool, you discover something new.  This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute and the National Science Foundation, and made use of the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility, the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center Imaging Facility, the Cornell Center for Materials Research and the Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center.

The laboratory studies, conducted so far in mice and now published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, represent an important step forward in attempts to introduce a first line of defence against HIV at the site of infection. ""With sexual activity being one of the primary methods of HIV transmission, it's necessary to try to protect those parts of the body that are most likely to encounter the virus first,"" says senior author Dr Branka Grubor-Bauk, from the Discipline of Surgery at the University of Adelaide and Basil Hetzel Institute for Translational Health Research, Queen Elizabeth Hospital. ""A possible reason why previous HIV vaccine trials have not been successful is because of this lack of a frontline protection. ""In mice, we delivered a rhinovirus (or common cold virus) inside the nose, and this virus had been altered to include HIV proteins. At the same time, the mice also received an injection into the skin containing a DNA-based vaccine. This approach resulted in very specific responses in the immune system,"" Dr Grubor-Bauk says. ""Importantly, this vaccine approach encompasses two different arms of the immune system: white blood cells that attack the HIV virus, and specific antibodies that recognise and shut down HIV-positive cells."" The Head of the Virology Group conducting this research is Professor Eric Gowans, also from the University's Discipline of Surgery, based at the Basil Hetzel Institute. ""There's an element of HIV known as Tat that helps the virus to replicate quite rapidly. One of the beauties of our vaccine approach is that the antibodies inhibit the Tat effect, preventing HIV from replicating itself,"" Professor Gowans says. ""Overall, we found that infection was considerably reduced in the mice we studied. The findings of our work now support the need for further testing of this targeted approach to an HIV vaccine,"" he says. Source: Story from The University of Adelaide.

In a new study, researchers from the National Food Institute transferred bacterial communities from 32 children and adolescents   half of which were overweight and half within the normal weight range   into specially bred mice with no bacteria in their intestines. The researchers subsequently examined differences in weight gain and metabolism among the mice and compared these findings with the corresponding differences between the children, who had originally 'donated  the bacteria. Same diet, different weight gain  The study, in which we have used gut bacteria from children, confirms results from previous studies among adults, which have shown that mice colonized with gut bacteria from overweight people gain more weight than mice whose intestines are colonized by bacteria from people within the normal weight range   even though they eat the same diet,  Professor Tine Rask Licht from the National Food Institute explains. The new study is based on a larger number of humans than previous similar studies. As such it is possible to compare each mouse with their  bacteria donor  and to examine other differences between the donors which are potentially transferred to the mice. Additionally, the researchers have investigated how the spread of bacteria between individual mice affects their digestion/metabolism. The study design is different than previous studies within this field and as such the researchers are able to obtain new observations related to the effect of gut microbes on host metabolism. Bacterial composition affects metabolism The National Food Institute study has measured a larger amount of unspent energy in faeces from mice with the smallest weight gain.  The bacterial community in the intestine of mice with the smallest weight gain has been less capable of converting dietary fibre in the feed, which partly explains the difference in weight between the animals,  Tine Rask Licht says. The study also shows that the gut bacterial composition affects a number of other measurements, which have to do with the ability of the mice to convert carbohydrates and fats, and which affect the development of diseases such as type 2 diabetes (e.g. levels of insulin and tryglycerides). However, it cannot be concluded that bacterial communities from the overweight children affects the mice in a specific direction e.g. in relation to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, the study shows that the spread of bacteria from mouse to mouse, which occurs e.g. through the keeper s handling, is enough to affect the measurements   and this is a completely new observation.  When interpreting studies such as this one it is important to keep in mind that not all gut bacteria from humans are able to establish themselves in the mouse intestine.   The larger number of human  bacteria donors  in our study has given us a unique opportunity to follow which of the human-derived bacteria that generally colonize the mouse gut, and which don t. This provides important insights for future research,"" Tine Rask Licht explains. Source: Story from the Technical University of Denmark.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/proteinfolding-gene-helps-heal-wounds-206251,Protein Folding Gene Helps Heal Wounds Researchers identified a protein that dramatically accelerates wound healing in animal models  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Wound healing after an injury is a precise, highly controlled process. Complex mechanisms are rapidly summoned to trigger an inflammatory response, close the wound, and then restore the tissue. Humans have a limited ability to restore certain tissues compared to non-mammalian vertebrates, such as zebrafish.           Zebrafish can regenerate multiple body tissues, including fins. They can also fully recover hearing loss by replacing dead hair cells the tiny sensory cells in ears. This restorative ability helps makes zebrafish an ideal model to study tissue regeneration. In a study led by Dr. Shawn Burgess of NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), researchers screened for genes that are essential for hair cell regeneration in zebrafish. The results were published in npj Regenerative Medicine on October 27, 2016. The scientists identified the heat shock protein 60 gene, Hsp60, as an important player in tissue regeneration. They showed that genetically modified zebrafish lacking Hsp60 failed to regenerate hair cells or fins after an injury. The Hsp60 protein, also called Hspd1, is known for its ability to facilitate proper protein folding. Previous research had also shown that Hsp60 is necessary for an inflammatory response. The current study uncovers a new function of this protein as a mediator of wound healing. Experiments measuring immune responses suggested that Hsp60 attracts immune cells towards the site of injury and triggers signalling involved in wound closure. Injecting Hsp60 at an injury site in zebrafish accelerated tissue regeneration, the researchers showed. The scientists also investigated the tissue-regenerating effects of Hsp60 in diabetic mice. Diabetes is known to impair wound healing in both mice and humans   for instance, leading to foot ulcers that don t heal in people. The researchers topically applied a gel containing Hsp60 to the diabetic mice to treat a skin puncture wound. Upon Hsp60 application, the diabetic mice showed nearly complete wound healing within 21 days. In diabetic mice without the Hsp60 treatment, the wounds remained unhealed. These findings demonstrate the importance of HSP60 in triggering tissue regeneration. The researchers are now working to test other heat shock proteins to see if they are also involved in wound healing. Future studies will seek to determine whether the benefits seen in diabetic mice could be achieved on human wounds.  This study proposes an unusual role for a well-known gene,  Burgess says.  This gene is found in every organism from bacteria to man. We have shown that in vertebrates, it has a surprising role in immunity that is essential for wound healing.

This microbial community, collectively known as the gut microbiota, plays a role in illness and health. Changes in these microbes have been associated with several diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and irritable bowel syndrome. Dietary emulsifiers, which are chemically similar to detergents, are added to many processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life. Scientists at Georgia State University previously found that mice fed low levels of common dietary emulsifiers developed altered gut microbiota and a thinned mucus barrier protecting the lining of their intestines. The mice also developed low-grade intestinal inflammation and metabolic syndrome a group of conditions that increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Intestinal inflammation is a known risk factor for colorectal cancer. In their latest study, the scientists investigated whether dietary emulsifiers might affect the risk for colorectal cancer by altering the gut microbiota. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Results were published online on November 7, 2016, in Cancer Research. The team fed mice standard chow and either plain drinking water or water with 1% of the commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose or polysorbate-80. This dose was designed to model the diets of people who eat large amounts of processed foods. Mice fed either of the dietary emulsifiers for 9 weeks developed chronic, low-grade intestinal inflammation and impaired glucose metabolism. The researchers next tested a chemically induced model of colitis-associated cancer. When given a cancer agent, mice fed emulsifiers for 90 days had greater intestinal inflammation and tumor development than mice that didn t get the emulsifiers. The team found that mice fed the emulsifiers had less gut microbiota diversity and increased levels of inflammatory molecules. The intestinal epithelial cells of mice fed the emulsifiers also had higher levels of both cell death and proliferation. Increased cell turnover is known to play a role in tumor development. When the scientists fed emulsifiers to germ-free mice, which don t have gut microbiota, these effects didn t appear. This finding suggests that the effects of the emulsifiers were caused by altering the gut microbiota. When gut microbes from emulsifier-fed mice were transferred into germ-free mice that hadn t been fed emulsifiers, the germ-free mice developed some of the abnormalities. These results hint that changes in the gut microbiota caused by dietary emulsifiers may play a role in promoting tumor development.  The incidence of colorectal cancer has been markedly increasing since the mid-20th century,  first author Dr. Emilie Viennois notes.  A key feature of this disease is the presence of an altered intestinal microbiota that creates a favorable niche for tumorigenesis.  Whether dietary emulsifiers in the human diet have a similar effect will be a subject for future study. Source: Story from the National Institutes of Health. Original piece written by Carol Torgan.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibody-protects-mice-from-zika-infection-186670,Antibody Protects Mice from Zika Infection Researchers develop human derived antibody protected pregnant mice and their developing fetuses from Zika infection  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Zika virus spreads mostly through bites from infected mosquitoes, but can also be transmitted through sex. Most people infected with Zika don t become sick. For the 20% who do, the illness is generally mild, with symptoms like fever, rashes, joint pain, and pink eye. In some adults, though, Zika has been linked to serious neurological disease. In pregnant women, Zika infection can severely affect the fetus. Currently, no vaccines or medicines are available to prevent or treat Zika. Several NIH-funded studies have been dedicated to developing a vaccine against Zika virus, and investigative vaccines are now being studied in early-stage clinical trials. A team of researchers led by Dr. James Crowe of Vanderbilt University and Dr. Michael Diamond of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis took another approach. People who have recovered from Zika infection have anti-Zika antibodies in their blood. The scientists obtained blood samples from 8 such people. Their goal was to isolate antibodies that could neutralize Zika viruses. The study was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Results appeared online in Nature on November 7, 2016. The scientists studied antibody-producing B cells from the blood samples. They selected the B cells that produced antibodies that bound to the Zika virus envelope protein (ZIKV E). They then used these cells to generate hybridomas cells that multiply and continue to produce a specific antibody indefinitely. Among the 29 hybridomas generated, one called ZIKV-117 was particularly effective in neutralizing Zika virus strains of African, Asian, and American origins. The researchers discovered that the ZIKV-117 antibody acts by binding to ZIKV E at a unique region. The scientists examined whether ZIKV-117 antibodies could defeat Zika infections in mice. A single dose of ZIKV-117 antibodies, given 1 or 5 days after infection in male mice, offered protection and increased survival compared to the mice that received a control antibody. To assess whether ZIKV-117 could protect the developing fetus, the scientists gave ZIKV-117 to pregnant mice one day before infection. The treatment reduced levels of virus in both the placenta and the fetal brain. Treated mice had less damage to the placenta and larger fetuses.  This is proof of principle that Zika virus during pregnancy is treatable, and we already have a human antibody that treats it, at least in mice,  Diamond says.

Since then, dozens of technology firms, academic institutions, scientists and other have been developing new tools to give researchers unprecedented opportunities to explore how the brain processes, utilizes, stores and retrieves information. But without a coherent strategy to analyze, manage and understand the data generated by these new technologies, advancements in the field will be limited. See Also: Crowdsourcing contest using data from people, dogs advances epileptic seizure forecastingThis is precisely why Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) Computational Neuroscientist Kristofer Bouchard assembled an international team of interdisciplinary researchers including mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists and experimental and computational neuroscientists to develop a plan for managing, analyzing and sharing neuroscience data. Their recommendations were published in a recent issue of Neuron. ""The U.S. BRAIN Initiative is just one of many national and private neuroscience initiatives globally that are working toward accelerating our understanding of brains,"" says Bouchard. ""Many of these efforts have given a lot of attention to the technological challenges of measuring and manipulating neural activity, while significantly less attention has been paid to the computing challenges associated with the vast amounts of data that these technologies are generating."" To maximize the return on investments in global neuroscience initiatives, Bouchard and his colleagues argue that the international neuroscience community should have an integrated strategy for data management and analysis. This coordination would facilitate the reproducibility of workflows, which then allows researchers to build on each other's work. For a first step, the authors recommend that researchers from all facets of neuroscience agree on standard descriptions and file formats for products derived from data analysis and simulations. After that, the researchers should work with computer scientists to develop hardware and software ecosystems for archiving and sharing data. Learn More: A BRAIN Initiative first: new tool can switch behavior  on  and  off The authors suggest an ecosystem similar to the one used by the physics community to share data collected by experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this case, each research group has their own local repository of physiological or simulation data that they've collected or generated. But eventually, all of this information should also be included in ""meta-repositories"" that are accessible to the greater neuroscience community. Files in the ""meta-repositories"" should be in a common format, and the repositories would ideally be hosted by an open-science supercomputing facility like the Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), located at Berkeley Lab. Because novel technologies are producing unprecedented amounts of data, Bouchard and his colleagues also propose that neuroscientists collaborate with mathematicians to develop new approaches for data analysis and modify existing analysis tools to run on supercomputers. To maximize these collaborations, the analysis tools should be open-source and should integrate with brain-scale simulations, they emphasize. ""These are the early days for neuroscience and big data, but we can see the challenges coming. This is not the first research community to face big data challenges; climate and high energy physics have been there and overcome many of the same issues,"" says Prabhat, who leads NERSC's Data & Analytics Services Group. Berkeley Lab is well positioned to help neuroscientists address these challenges because of its long tradition of interdisciplinary science, Prabhat adds. DOE facilities like NERSC and the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) have worked closely with Lab computer scientists to help a range of science communities from astronomy to battery research collaborate and manage and archive their data.

The study bolsters the science behind the use of controlled yogic breathing to help battle depression. See Also: Benefits & risks of yoga for bipolar disorder In a randomized, controlled pilot study, led by Anup Sharma, MD, PhD, a Neuropsychiatry research fellow in the department of Psychiatry at Penn, researchers found significant improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety in medicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who participated in the breathing technique compared to medicated patients who did not partake. After two months, the yoga group cut its mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score by several points, while the control group showed no improvements. HDRS is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment that scores mood, interest in activities, energy, suicidal thoughts, and feelings of guilt, among other symptoms. More than half of the 41 million Americans who take antidepressants do not fully respond. Add-on therapies are often prescribed to enhance the effects of the drugs in these patients, but they typically offer limited additional benefits and come with side effects that can curb use, prolonging the depressive episode. What's more, patients who don't fully respond to antidepressants are especially at risk of relapse. ""With such a large portion of patients who do not fully respond to antidepressants, it's important we find new avenues that work best for each person to beat their depression,"" Sharma said. ""Here, we have a promising, lower-cost therapy that could potentially serve as an effective, non-drug approach for patients battling this disease."" Related: Researchers probing potential power of meditation as therapy The meditation technique, which is practiced in both a group setting and at home, includes a series of sequential, rhythm-specific breathing exercises that bring people into a deep, restful, and meditative state: slow and calm breaths alternated with fast and stimulating breaths. ""Sudarshan Kriya yoga gives people an active method to experience a deep meditative state that's easy to learn and incorporate in diverse settings,"" Sharma said. In past studies, the practice has demonstrated a positive response in patients with milder forms of depression, depression due to alcohol dependence, and in patients with MDD; however, there are no clinical studies investigating its use for depression in an outpatient setting. Past studies suggest that yoga and other controlled breathing techniques can potentially adjust the nervous system to reduce stress hormones. Overall, the authors also note, well-designed studies that evaluate the benefits of yoga to treat depression are lacking, despite increased interest in the ancient Indian practice. Millions of Americans participate in some form of yoga every year. In the study, researchers enrolled 25 patients suffering from MDD who were depressed, despite more than eight weeks of antidepressant medication treatment. The medicated patients were randomized to either the breathing intervention group or the ""waitlist"" control group for eight weeks. (The waitlist group was offered the yoga intervention after the study). During the first week, participants completed a six-session program, which featured Sudarshan Kriya yoga in addition to yoga postures, sitting meditation, and stress education. For weeks two through eight, participants attended weekly Sudarshan Kriya yoga follow-up sessions and completed a home practice version of the technique. Patients in the Sudarshan Kriya yoga group showed a significantly greater improvement in HDRS scores compared to patients in the waitlist group. With a mean baseline HDRS score of 22.0 (indicating severe depression at the beginning of the study), the group that completed the breathing technique for the full two months improved scores by 10.27 points on average, compared to the waitlist group, which showed no improvements. Patients in the yoga group also showed significant mean reductions in total scores of the self-reported Beck Depression (15.48 point improvement) and Beck Anxiety Inventories (5.19 point improvement), versus the waitlist control group.

This model, described in a paper published recently in the journal Development, may help scientists better understand how the Zika virus affects different cell types in the developing brain, which could hasten the creation of new treatments and diagnostics. See Also: Zika virus tested in brain precursor cells Spread mostly by the bite of an infected mosquito, the Zika virus can pass from a pregnant woman to her fetus. This can result in microcephaly, a birth defect in which the brain does not develop properly, resulting in a smaller than normal head. ""A lot of the discussion about Zika has focused on microcephaly, and while that is certainly important, we found that the virus causes additional devastating damages to the developing brain as well,"" said Jianfu ""Jeff"" Chen, an assistant professor of genetics in UGA's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. Most notably, Chen and his colleagues, including postdoctoral fellow Qiang Shao and graduate student Stephanie Herrlinger, found that Zika infection leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the brain and a leaky blood-brain barrier, which normally protects the brain from potentially harmful pathogens. Related: Mouse models of Zika in pregnancy show how fetuses become infected ""In addition to neural progenitor cell disruption, which is a classical cause of human microcephaly, we also observed massive death of neuronal cells in our mouse model,"" Chen said. ""This combined with the disruption of the vascular system and the blood-brain barrier results in microcephaly and extensive brain damage."" Therefore, he added, ""It's not just that the brain is smaller than normal; it is severely injured as a result of the infection, and we need to understand all these effects if we are going to develop successful therapies."" The researchers created their model by injecting Zika virus that was isolated in Mexico from an infected mosquito into the brain of mouse embryos. They were then able to observe the neurological effects after the mice were born. ""A lot of scientists are looking for postnatal mouse models to study the effects of Zika virus infection, but the virus often causes premature birth in mice,"" Chen said.

The findings describe an unprecedented approach to engineer and study tissues in the intestine   the body s largest immune organ, its food processor and main interface with the outside world. Study authors at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center say the paper puts medical science a step closer to using human pluripotent stem cells (which can become any cell type in the body) for regenerative medicine and growing patient-specific human intestine for transplant.  One day this technology will allow us to grow a section of healthy intestine for transplant into a patient, but the ability to use it now to test and ask countless new questions will help human health to the greatest extent,  said Michael Helmrath, MD, co-lead study investigator and surgical director of the Intestinal Rehabilitation Program at Cincinnati Children s. This ability starts with being able to model and study intestinal disorders in functioning, three-dimensional human organ tissue with genetically-specific patient cells. The technology will also allow researchers to test new therapeutics in functioning lab-engineered human intestine before clinical trials in patients.  ""Many oral medications give you diarrhea, cramps and impair intestinal motility. A fairly immediate goal for this technology that would help the largest number of people is as a first-pass screen for new drugs to look for off-target toxicities and prevent side effects in the intestine,  explained Jim Wells, PhD, co-lead investigator and director of the Pluripotent Stem Cell Facility at Cincinnati Children s.   As science continues to learn more about how important intestinal health is to overall health, Wells and Helmrath said using functioning lab-generated human intestine creates an array of new research opportunities. Some include the ability to conduct deeper studies into nutritional health, diabetes, severe intestinal diseases (like necrotizing enterorcolitis), and biochemical changes in the body from gastric by-pass weight-loss surgery. Nerves Nature s Way Researchers started out by subjecting human pluripotent stem cells to a biochemical bath that triggers their formation into human intestinal tissue in a petri dish. The process was essentially the same as that used by the Wells  lab in a landmark 2010 Nature study, which reported the first-ever generation of three-dimensional human intestinal organoids in a laboratory.  Intestinal tissues from the initial study lacked an enteric nervous system, which is critical to the movement of waste through the digestive tract and the absorption of nutrients. The gastrointestinal tract contains the second largest number of nerves in the human body, according to Wells. When these nerves fail to work properly it hinders the contraction of intestinal muscles. This contributes to abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and in severe cases creates functional blockages that require surgery.  To engineer a nervous system for the intestinal organoids already growing in one petri dish, researchers generated embryonic-stage nerve cells called neural crest cells in a separate dish. The neural crest cells were manipulated to form precursor cells for enteric nerves. The challenge at this stage was identifying how and when to incorporate the neural crest cells into the developing intestine.  We tried a few different approaches largely based on the hypothesis that, if you put the right cells together at the right time in the petri dish, they ll know what do to. It was a longshot, but it worked,  said Wells, who credits Cincinnati Children s developmental biologist Samantha Brugmann, PhD, (and a study co-author) with providing critical insights into embryonic nerve development. The appropriate mix caused enteric nerve precursor cells and intestines to grow together in a manner resembling developing fetal intestine. The result was the first evidence for generating complex and functional three-dimensional intestinal organoids in a petri dish, and fully derived from human pluripotent stem cells. In Vivo Testing A key test for the engineered intestines and nerves was transplanting them into a living organism - in this case laboratory mice with suppressed immune systems. This allowed researchers to see how well the tissues grow and function. Study data show the tissues work and are structured in a manner remarkably similar to natural human intestine. They grow robustly, process nutrients and demonstrate peristalsis   series of wave-like muscle contractions that in the body move food through the digestive tract. Researchers then used the technology to study the molecular progression of a rare form of Hirschsprung s disease - a condition in which the rectum and colon fail to develop a normal nervous system, causing waste to accumulate. A severe form of Hirschsprung s is caused by a mutation in the gene PHOX2B. Tests in a petri dish and mice demonstrated that mutating PHOX2B causes profound detrimental changes to innervated intestinal tissues. The current study blends basic research and clinical insight from the Developmental Biology and Endocrinology laboratory staff of Wells and General/Thoracic Surgery research team of Helmrath   who cares for children with a broad spectrum of digestive disorders. Co-first authors include Maxime Mahe, PhD, an instructor in the Helmrath lab, and Michael Workman, PhD, a former a member of the Wells lab.

To overcome this, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, an international team led by Jonathan Sebat, PhD, at University of California (UC) San Diego School of Medicine, analyzed the genomes of more than 41,000 people in the largest genome-wide study of its kind to date. Their study, published in Nature Genetics, reveals several regions of the genome where mutations increase schizophrenia risk between four- and 60-fold. See Also: Schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk deconstructedThese mutations, known as copy number variants, are deletions or duplications of the DNA sequence. A copy number variant may affect dozens of genes, or it can disrupt or duplicate a single gene. This type of variation can cause significant alterations to the genome and lead to psychiatric disorders, said Sebat, who is a professor and chief of the Beyster Center for Genomics of Neuropsychiatric Diseases at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Sebat and other researchers previously discovered that relatively large copy number variants occur more frequently in schizophrenia than in the general population. In this latest study, Sebat teamed up with more than 260 researchers from around the world, part of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, to analyze the genomes of 21,094 people with schizophrenia and 20,227 people without schizophrenia. They found eight locations in the genome with copy number variants associated with schizophrenia risk. Only a small fraction of cases (1.4 percent) carried these variants. The researchers also found that these copy number variants occurred more frequently in genes involved in the function of synapses, the connections between brain cells that transmit chemical messages. With its large sample size, this study had the power to find copy number variants with large effects that occur in more than 0.1 percent of schizophrenia cases. However, the researchers said they are still missing many variants. More analyses will be needed to detect risk variants with smaller effects, or ultra-rare variants.

In Huntington's disease (HD), the huntingtin gene is mutated, causing progressive neuronal death. This leads to defects in movement, behavior, and cognitive ability. Apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis are the three main types of cell death, but researchers have not yet been able to determine what type of cell death causes neurodegeneration in the brain of HD patients. See Also: Study identifies new biomarkers for Huntington's diseaseIn a new study, researchers examined the nature of cell death in HD using newly developed imaging techniques. The effects of mutant huntingtin in neuronal cells were visualized by live cell imaging. With this approach, the authors identified a novel type of cell death associated with mutant huntingtin, which they called ballooning cell death (BCD). These cells gradually expanded like a balloon, until they ruptured. To characterize the specific nature of BCD, the authors examined different cellular organelles by live cell imaging. ""The endoplasmic reticulum was the main origin of ballooning,"" study first author Ying Mao explains. ""Rupture of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol was followed by gradual cell body ballooning, nuclear shrinkage, and cell rupture."" The authors observed the same phenomena in vivo using two-photon endoplasmic reticulum imaging in a HD mouse model. Pharmacological inhibitors and genetic interventions showed that BCD was not like apoptosis or autophagy. ""We noticed multiple similarities between BCD and a unique form of necrosis called TRIAD, which is caused by inhibition of RNA polymerase II in neurons,"" corresponding author Hitoshi Okazawa explains. ""Based on our existing knowledge of how TRIAD is regulated, we were able to show that BCD is mediated by impaired TEAD/YAP transcription.""

""It's been known that musical instruction benefits children with these disorders,"" said Pilar Dies-Suarez, MD, chief radiologist at the Hospital Infantil de M xico Federico G mez in Mexico City, ""but this study has given us a better understanding of exactly how the brain changes and where these new fiber connections are occurring."" See Also: Listening to classical music modulates genes responsible for various brain functions The researchers studied 23 healthy children between the ages of five and six years old. All of the children were right handed and had no history of sensory, perception or neurological disorders. None of the children had been trained in any artistic discipline in the past. The study participants underwent pre- and post-musical-training evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain. DTI is an advanced MRI technique, which identifies microstructural changes in the brain's white matter. ""Experiencing music at an early age can contribute to better brain development, optimizing the creation and establishment of neural networks, and stimulating the existing brain tracts,"" Dr. Dies-Suarez said. Fibers belonging to the greater forceps pre-musical training are observed (A, B, C). Fibers belonging to the same patients after 9 months of musical training are observed below (a, b, c). Credit: Radiological Society of North America  The brain's white matter is composed of millions of nerve fibers called axons that act like communication cables connecting various regions of the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging produces a measurement, called fractional anisotropy (FA), of the movement of extracellular water molecules along axons. In healthy white matter, the direction of extracellular water molecules is fairly uniform and measures high in fractional anisotropy. When water movement is more random, FA values decrease, suggesting abnormalities. Learn More: Researchers look into the brains of music fansOver the course of life, the maturation of brain tracts and connections between motor, auditory and other areas allow the development of numerous cognitive abilities, including musical skills. Previous studies have linked autism spectrum and ADHD with decreases in volume, fiber connections and FA in the minor and lower forceps, tracts located in the frontal cortex of the brain. This suggests that low connectivity in the frontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in complex cognitive processes, is a biomarker of these disorders. After the children in the study completed nine months of musical instruction using Boomwhackers percussion tubes cut to the exact length to create pitches in a diatonic scale, DTI results showed an increase in FA and axon fiber length in different areas of the brain, most notably in the minor forceps. ""When a child receives musical instruction, their brains are asked to complete certain tasks,"" Dr. Dies-Suarez said. ""These tasks involve hearing, motor, cognition, emotion and social skills, which seem to activate these different brain areas. These results may have occurred because of the need to create more connections between the two hemispheres of the brain.""

In fact, most patients who succumb to cancer do not die because of the initial tumours that form, but rather because of the deadly secondary metastatic tumours that appear at distant sites.  Thus, understanding the biology and clinical relevance of these traveling cells is critical in our fight against cancer. Monitoring circulating tumour cells, however, is a tremendous challenge as they are outnumbered in blood by healthy cells at a level of over 1 billion-to-1.  Moreover, they can display varied and dynamic properties, and the collection of CTCs found in the bloodstream of a cancer patient may have differing metastatic potential.  Consequently, efforts to integrate the analysis of these cells into mainstream clinical medicine have been limited because it has been difficult to pinpoint what types of cells and what phenotypic properties should be targeted.  But the potential of CTCs to allow the collection of a non-invasive  liquid biopsy  to monitor cancer progression is a tantalizing possibility that has continued to attract significant attention to this problem. A breakthrough by Professor Shana Kelley s research group at the University of Toronto published in Nature Nanotechnology provides a new tool to characterize CTCs that may help cancer biologists and clinicians understand how to use these cells to provide better treatment.  Using magnetic nanoparticles, CTCs in blood samples were targeted based on proteins displayed on the cell surface, and separated based on the levels of the protein present.  Using a high resolution microfluidic device, cells are then separated into 100 different capture zones to generate a profile that provides phenotypic information related to metastatic potential.  Using this approach and monitoring cells generated in animal models of cancer and in samples collected from prostate cancer patients, the properties of CTCs were shown to evolve and become more aggressive as tumours became more advanced.  Through this approach, we aimed to provide a new way to profile CTCs beyond simply counting their numbers in clinical samples,  explained Dr. Mahla Poudineh, lead student author on the paper.  Instead, we wanted to provide phentotypic information that might allow these cells to be classified as benign or more dangerous, which would then inform treatment options.   We were very fortunate to collaborate with a number of oncologists at the Sunnybrook Research Centre and Princess Margaret Hospital as we developed this technology so that we could test our approach with real patient specimens and better understand how to adapt it for use in the clinic,  noted Dr. Kelley.

Using a new breakthrough technology, their study, published in Nature Medicine, identified a new potential target for the treatment of a class of pancreatic cancer, and unveiled a new treatment option that exploits genetic faults to destroy cancer cells. Associate Professor Stephane Angers and PhD student Zachary Steinhart from the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, along with Drs. Jason Moffat and Sachdev Sidhu from the Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, the Department of Molecular Genetics, and the Centre for the Commercialization of Antibodies and Biologics, made this discovery using the cutting-edge CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology. Using this revolutionary tool, the team of researchers probed the function of every single gene expressed by pancreatic cancer cells to determine that one of the receptors (Frizzled-5) is essential for the growth of mutant pancreatic cancer cells. Normally, the signalling pathways activated by Frizzled-5 tell cells when to divide, what types of cells to become, and when they should die. When mutated or deregulated, however, they can initiate tumour growth. Having identified the key role that the Frizzled-5 receptor plays in promoting pancreatic cancer growth, the team rapidly developed an antibody drug to inhibit the growth of these cells. The study showed that the antibody proved highly effective in killing the cancer cells in patient-derived samples and shrank tumours in mice without damaging the surrounding healthy cells. Leveraging the Donnelly Centre s state-of-the-art platform for custom antibody design, the team were able to create a targeted antibody in months   a fraction of the time it would normally take to develop a safe and effective treatment for a specific cancer. As part of this study, the team also explored the role of this receptor in colorectal cancer, a form of cancer that shares common features with pancreatic cancer. The results of this study indicate that Frizzled-5 may be a factor across multiple cancer types, broadening the potential use of anti-Frizzled-5 antibodies as a targeted cancer therapy.  Ultimately, this study revealed genetic vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer cells that could be exploited through the development of new targeted antibodies to inhibit tumour growth,  noted Dr. Angers of the Centre for Pharmaceutical Oncology.  By targeting the exact signalling circuit activated in these tumours, these rapidly developed antibodies have shown considerable promise as a cancer treatment. Moreover, the state-of-the-art antibody development platform developed at U of T is a transformational leap forward in our ability to rapidly create exciting new treatments to combat various cancers.

The hand-held breathalyzer device detects acetone, which has been linked to high blood glucose levels in the breath. The research is being presented at the 2016 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) Annual Meeting and Exposition, the world s largest pharmaceutical sciences meeting. Although testing technology has improved in recent decades, with the finger stick testing, as many as 67 percent of people with diabetes may not comply because it is invasive and somewhat painful. Yet, lack of blood-glucose monitoring can result in serious diabetes-related complications.  We believe this technology will be a great improvement in the lives of people with diabetes,  said Priefer.  It is the first non-invasive medical device for detecting and monitoring diabetes by connecting one s acetone levels with their blood glucose. We believe it is a necessary alternative to the finger-prick approach for people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  Priefer and his team tested the device they developed, that checks a patient s blood glucose levels, in a blind study of 50 people: 26 did not have diabetes, 16 had type 2 diabetes, and 8 people had type 1 diabetes. Using the device in conjunction with the sensor slides, when patients blow into the device, readings are immediately taken. The acetone level is instantly correlated to a blood glucose level, which allows patients to determine how much insulin they need to take when their glucose levels are high. Stage 1 clinical results found clear correlations between blood glucose levels and breath acetone. The only outlier found was in a small number of smokers, whom had higher levels of acetone in the breath due to the combustion of tobacco. Priefer s goal is to have a device by the end of 2017 that patients can bring home and track their blood glucose levels over time. He is also working to make the device even smaller.

Jennifer Risso-Ballester, Jos  Cuevas and Rafael Sanju n from the Evolution and Health Research Unit at the University of Valencia, Spain, used a recently developed, deep sequencing technique (Duplex sequencing) to accurately analyse the genome-wide rate of spontaneous mutation of human adenovirus C5 (HAdv5) under conditions of minimal selection.  Rates of spontaneous mutation determine the ability of viruses to evolve, infect new hosts, evade immunity and undergo drug resistance. Much lower than mutation rates of RNA viruses, previous estimates of DNA virus mutation rates have been measured only indirectly, and on very small portions of the genome.  The team sequenced >98% of the viral genome with >1000-fold coverage at extremely high accuracy; over 200 spontaneous mutations were identified at different positions in the genome. The team used human cervix tumour HeLa cells, with defective repair pathways, for HAdv5 growth; particular care was taken in method development to ensure any diversity present was due to spontaneous mutations and not experimental artefacts.  The adenovirus genome shows a relatively low mutation rate, consistent with high replication fidelity and the action of post-replicative repair. Previous research shows that genetic diversity across adenovirus genomes is not uniformly distributed; although the mutation rate did not vary strongly along the adenovirus genome, the team found several sources of mutation rate heterogeneity. First, two regions mapping to transcription units were significantly depleted for mutations. Second, several point insertions/deletions located within low-complexity sequence contexts appeared recurrently, suggesting mutational hotspots. Third, mutation probability increased at GpC dinucleotides.  The findings suggest that host factors may influence the distribution of spontaneous mutations in human adenoviruses and potentially other nuclear DNA viruses; and factors other than genome size may determine DNA virus mutation rates, such as whether the virus encodes its own polymerase or whether the viral genomic DNA is single-stranded or double-stranded. Future work should help clarify the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary processes underlying mutation rate variation across viruses. ","Published: November 22, 2016"

The test, called MicroScreen, detects the genes inside the antibiotic resistant bacteria and is a major breakthrough in the battle against drug resistant infection, now widely regarded as a ticking time-bomb. Chief Medical Office, Professor Dame Sally Davies has said: ""Antimicrobial resistance poses a catastrophic threat"" adding that ""antibiotic resistance represents a threat that may be ""as important as climate change for the world"". MicroScreen presents a cheap, quick and simple test which can be used on pre-operative patients in hospital to establish if they carry antiobitic restistant bacteria, including MRSA, to to avoid uneccesssary use of antiobiotics and ensure they receive appropriate treatment for their own recovery and the well-being of other patients. To date other tests available are complex, need to use expensive equipment and take around three days for the results to be made available. Bruce Savage, CEO of GFC Diagnostics says ""Our test takes about thirty minutes and does not need expensive equipment or highly trained staff. ""This test could be a major step forward to reduce the harm caused by drug resistant bacteria. Drug resistant infections are on the rise with up to 50,000 lives lost each year to antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe and the US alone. This rapid test will give a quick diagnosis and prevent the unnecessary use of broad spectrum antibiotics. It will reduce healthcare costs by helping to stop the spread of deadly infections throughout a hospital."" The technology can also be used to detect other bacteria including deadly strains of drug resistant tuberculosis and CPE (Carbapenem Aseproducing Enterobacteriaceae). Bruce Savage said: ""The grant will help our work to detect the so called  nightmare bug' CPE which is resistant to nearly all known antibiotics, is often fatal and spreading fast across the world. The Discovery Awards were announced at The Royal Society in London and mark the second anniversary of the Longitude Prize - a global challenge to tackle the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by reducing overuse of antibiotics. GFC Diagnostics will receive a grant to be used in developing ideas and overcoming the technical challenges of making a submission for the main Longitude Prize challenge which offers  10 million for the development of a novel, affordable and rapid point-of-care test that could be used anywhere in the world to determine when antibiotics should be used. According to the Longitude Prize's latest UK public survey1 around three-quarters (74%) of people believe a positive test for bacterial infection should be compulsory before being able to access antibiotics. Eight in ten (81%) agreed that having access to a cheap and simple home test for bacterial infections would affect their decision of whether to seek out antibiotics. Attention is turning increasingly to the role of diagnostic tests to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance, as seen with the recent announcement of the Boots-NHS partnership on pharmacy-based bacterial tests for sore throats2 Daniel Berman, Longitude Prize lead at Nesta, the innovation foundation, said ""We're delighted to announce today the recipients of Longitude Discovery Award funding, chosen from a field of over 70 teams of inventors. The groups receiving these grants are working across a range of technologies, from nanosensors to gene detectors to lasers, but they are all working towards one goal - the development a tool which will radically transform the way people access antibiotics and help to fight the growing threat of antibiotic resistance."" 1.

The finding may lead to the development of treatment based on the genetic profiles of arthritis patients, the researchers said. The study was published Nov. 21 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disease that affects an estimated 3 million people and is most prevalent in women. The disease, which destroys cartilage in joints, can lead to severe disability. In its most severe form, vascular inflammation and internal organ damage occur, leading to premature death. To understand the disease mechanism, Yale professor of medicine Dr. Richard Bucala and his team focused on the disease-causing variants of the gene, MIF, which his lab had found to be associated with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The research team conducted experiments with cells derived from the rheumatoid joint of patients who either had a disease-causing, high-expression variant of the MIF gene or a disease-protective, low-expression variant of the MIF gene. They found that high-expression MIF variants correlated with increased expression of the MIF receptor protein (CD44) and induced structural changes in the protein that occur in cancerous tissues. These cancerous properties in turn led to the destructive changes in the rheumatoid joint.  We showed that the presence of the high-expression risk variant led to more MIF production and to structural alterations in a cell surface protein that had long been associated with invasive cancers,  said Bucala.  The high-expression MIF risk gene helps explain the cancer-like properties of the rheumatoid joint.  This finding could lead to the application of MIF inhibitors, which the laboratory has developed for clinical testing in cancer and in autoimmunity, for severe rheumatoid arthritis in genetically susceptible patients. In the published study, the researchers used these drugs as well as new inhibitors to suppress the invasive effect of MIF on rheumatoid joint cells.  It s a precision-medicine approach to treating autoimmune disease,  Bucala noted.  Patients with a risk MIF genotype would be most effectively treated by such drugs.

The findings could offer doctors a new way to choose drugs for this type of breast cancer, known as triple-negative because it lacks the three most common breast cancer markers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2 protein. The biomarker, a protein called Mena, has previously been shown to help cancer cells spread through the body. The researchers also showed that combining paclitaxel with another drug that interferes with Mena s effects can kill the cells much more effectively than paclitaxel alone.  Drugs that target that pathway restore paclitaxel sensitivity to cells expressing Mena,  says Frank Gertler, an MIT professor of biology and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.  The study also suggests that during the course of treatment it might be worth monitoring the level of Mena. If the levels begin to increase, it might suggest that switching to another type of therapy could be useful.  Gertler is the senior author of the study, which appears in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. Madeleine Oudin, a Koch Institute postdoc, is the paper s lead author. How cells survive The Mena protein is known to interact with a cell s cytoskeleton in ways that help the cell to become mobile. Many cancer patients have an alternative form of the protein known as Mena invasive or MenaINV, which helps cancer cells to spread from their original location through a process known as metastasis. Gertler s research group has previously found that breast cancer patients who have high levels of the protein s invasive form tend to have more metastasis and lower survival rates. The researchers wondered if Mena might also play a role in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. Between 30 to 70 percent of triple-negative breast cancer patients respond well to chemotherapy, but the disease reappears within six to 10 months, on average.  We know we have good drugs that can kill a lot of cancers, but some people don t respond to them, and some people do respond but only for a short amount of time,  Oudin says. They tested several different chemotherapy drugs on triple-negative breast cancer cells with varying levels of Mena, and found that those cells with the highest Mena levels were resistant to paclitaxel. However, Mena levels did not affect sensitivity to two other commonly used chemotherapy drugs, doxorubicin and cisplatin. Paclitaxel, which is also used to treat ovarian cancer, works by interfering with microtubules   small tubular proteins that make up the cell s cytoskeleton and help with cell division. Microtubules can be either dynamic or stable, and the dynamic version is necessary for cell division. Paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubules, interfering with cell division and killing the cells. After giving paclitaxel to mice with metastatic triple-negative tumors, the researchers found that tumors with the highest levels of Mena showed the worst response: The drug did not slow growth of either the original tumors or metastases. This effect was the same whether the tumors expressed the invasive form of Mena or the original version. The researchers also showed that cancer cells with high Mena levels had more dynamic microtubules than cells with low Mena levels. This increase in dynamic microtubules makes it easier for the cells to divide and allows them to resist the effects of paclitaxel. Countering resistance Previous studies have shown that paclitaxel treatment also affects a cellular pathway known as ERK signaling, which is often overactive in cancer cells and drives cell proliferation. Paclitaxel treatment turns on this pathway, which helps cancer cells to survive the treatment, but if an inhibitor of ERK signaling is given at the same time, the treatment is more successful. In the Molecular Cancer Therapeutics study, the MIT team tried the paclitaxel-ERK pathway inhibitor combination in breast cancer cells with high levels of Mena and found that it killed cells much more effectively than paclitaxel alone. Clinical trials are already underway to test this combination of drugs in breast cancer.  Our work would suggest that for a certain subset of patients that have high levels of Mena, that could be an efficient combination to try,  Oudin says. The findings could also help doctors choose treatments for patients based on the levels of Mena in their tumors. To pursue that possibility, the researchers now hope to do studies with human tumor samples to see if they show the same relationship between Mena levels, paclitaxel sensitivity, and patient outcome. This work may be done in collaboration with MetaStat, a company that Gertler and others founded to develop diagnostic tests based on Mena and other biomarkers.  The hope is it may also provide more information on therapeutic choice and potentially spare some patients treatment with a chemotherapy that is likely to be less effective,  Gertler says.

Although this approach has delivered important advances, a team of scientists from Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center are studying cancer from a new angle. They have developed new technology that has allowed them to identify molecular intermediates that drive the genetic changes that transform normal cells into cancerous cells. Their results, which appear in Science Advances, offer the opportunity for developing new drugs to neutralize the intermediates before they lead to cancer.  In my lab we study how the genome   the genes in an organism   changes, in particular how the genome of normal cells changes to transform the cells into cancerous cells,  said senior author Dr. Susan Rosenberg, Ben F. Love Chair in Cancer Research and professor of molecular and human genetics, of molecular virology and microbiology and of biochemistry and molecular biology at Baylor. Mutations in the cell s DNA cause genetic changes that can steer a normal cell toward becoming cancerous and also cause resistance of cancers to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mutations result from many different sources, including imperfect DNA repair reactions and simple errors that occur when the cell is making copies of the DNA. When cells divide, and make copies of the instructions encoded in their DNA, the DNA unwinds and becomes vulnerable to damage that must be repaired. However, sometimes the process of repairing the DNA causes mutations and errors remain. When these errors accumulate over time, the cells may acquire characteristics of cancer.  The process of editing the DNA is carried out by specific enzymes   proteins that work on DNA to fix the mistakes,  said Rosenberg, who also is leader of the Cancer Evolvability Program at the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor.  This work is a biochemical reaction in which an enzyme interacts with DNA that needs repair and promotes chemical changes that end up producing DNA without mistakes. DNA repair processes usually take several steps to be completed. Between the original DNA and the final product there are molecular DNA reaction intermediates. The intermediate molecules are crucial to the reaction, but are hard to study because they are transient and elusive. They are present for a fraction of a second as the enzyme catalyses the changing of one molecule into another.  The intermediate molecules are the most important parts of biochemical reactions,  said Rosenberg.  They define what the reaction is and how it will proceed. But because they are transient and elusive, it s really difficult to study them, especially in living cells. We wanted to do that. We decided to invent synthetic proteins that would trap DNA reaction intermediates in living cells.  Other investigators also have attempted to trap intermediates, but they have only succeeded in a few biochemical reactions.  We want to use the synthetic proteins to study mechanisms that change DNA sequence,  said Rosenberg.  We do that now with genetics and genomics in my lab. But genomics, which allows us to compare the genes of normal cells with those of cancerous cells, is like reading the fossil record of these processes. We want to see how the real-time processes that change DNA happen, including all the intermediate steps, which our synthetic proteins will allow us to freeze in time and isolate.  Rosenberg and colleagues carried out this study in the laboratory bacterium E. coli, which they and others have shown to be a reliable model of the genetic changes that occur in animal cells. In their paper, they discovered a new role of an E. coli protein related to five human cancer proteins. They then analysed gene expression data from human cancers and were able to implicate two of the five E. coli-related human cancer proteins in potentially promoting cancer by a similar mechanism   one not previously implicated.  The most exciting part in this paper for me is that we can learn something new about the mechanisms of cancer from the E.coli model,  said co-first author Qian Mei, who is a research assistant in the Rosenberg lab and a graduate student in the Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology (SSPB) program at Rice University.  Even though bacteria and human cells are very different, many DNA repair proteins are highly conserved through evolution; this makes E. coli a good model to study how cells repair DNA or accumulate mutations.  Rosenberg and colleagues think that their approach offers significant advantages. For instance, with the synthetic proteins, they have been able to identify specific DNA-repair intermediate molecules, their numbers in cells, rates of formation and locations in the genome and the molecular reactions in which they participate.  It is most exciting that we are now able to trap, map and quantify transient DNA reaction intermediates in single living cells,  said co-first author Jun Xia, graduate student in the Rosenberg lab and in the Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences program at Baylor.  This new technology helps us reveal the origins of genome instability.   When you know these reactions and the role each intermediate plays in the mechanisms that change DNA, you can think about making drugs that will stop them,  said Rosenberg.  In the future we hope we will be able to design drugs that target specific types of cancers; drugs that block the cells  ability to evolve into cancer cells, instead of, or in addition to, traditional chemotherapies that kill or stop cancer cells from growing.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/molecular-imaging-hack-makes-cameras-faster-201304,Molecular Imaging Hack Makes Cameras  Faster  Rice scientists  enhancement adds time element to super resolution microscopy  allowing for faster image capture   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new Rice University technique grabs images of chemical processes that happen faster than most laboratory cameras are able to capture them. The technique, super temporal resolution microscopy (STReM), allows researchers to view and gather useful information about fluorescing molecules at a frame rate 20 times faster than typical lab cameras normally allow. The work by Rice chemist Christy Landes and her team, along with Rice electrical engineer Kevin Kelly, appears in the American Chemical Society s Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. The Rice researchers start with a Nobel-winning microscopy technique that views objects like molecules at  super resolution    that is, things below the diffraction limit that are smaller than most microscopes are able to see.  Super-resolution microscopy lets us image things smaller than about half of visible light s wavelength   around 250 nanometers,  Landes said. But she noted a barrier:  You couldn t take pictures of anything faster than your frame rate,  she said. The Rice lab s new enhancement, which uses a rotating phase mask to encode fast dynamics in each camera frame, will help researchers understand processes that occur at interfaces like adsorption and desorption of proteins or molecules  trajectories as they move along two-dimensional surfaces. Typical charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras max out at frame rates of 10 to 100 milliseconds, Landes said. While other techniques like electron microscopy can see materials at the subnanoscale, super-resolution microscopy has a distinct advantage for fragile samples like biomolecules: It doesn t destroy them in the process. The technique manipulates the phase of light to give the image at the detector a more complicated shape. This process had previously been used by other researchers to encode where the object is in three-dimensional space within an otherwise two-dimensional image. The Rice lab s contribution was to note that by manipulating the phase over time, it would also be possible to encode faster time resolutions within a slow image frame. Thus, the group designed and built a spinning phase mask. The resulting images capture dynamic events that happen faster than the camera s intrinsic frame rate. The shape of each image within a frame effectively gives it a unique time stamp. The technique takes advantage of a characteristic of microscopy familiar to anyone who s ever taken a blurry picture. Point spread functions are a measure of the shape of images both in and out of focus. When the subjects are as small as single molecules, shifting in and out of focus happens easily, and the size and shape of the resulting blur can tell researchers how far from the focal plane the subject is. Phase-mask engineering makes it possible to make focus-dependent blur easier to detect by introducing distinct point spread functions. On film they look like the lobes of a barbell and rotate with respect to focus. STReM uses point spread function changes from the spinning mask to collect temporal information, Landes said. With the new technique, changes in the lobes  angles reveal the time an event has occurred within each frame.  The purpose is to allow scientists to study fast processes without the need to buy faster and much more expensive cameras,  said Rice graduate student Wenxiao Wang, lead author of the paper.  This involves extracting more information from single images.  Landes, who recently won ACS s prestigious Early Career Award in Experimental Physical Chemistry for her work to integrate super-resolution microscopy with information theory to understand protein separations, said designing and building the mechanism cost the lab only a few hundred dollars, a fraction of the cost of buying a faster camera. The phase mask is based on work by Kelly, who drew upon his contributions to Rice s single-pixel camera to design what amounts to a piece of plastic with variable thickness that distorts light en route to the CCD.  Like the single-pixel camera, we re doing compressive analysis,  Landes said.  With the static phase mask, three-dimensional information is compressed into a 2-D image. In this particular case, we have compressed faster information into a slower camera frame rate. It s a way to get more information in the pixels that you have.  Source: Story from Rice University.

In 2015, antibiotic resistance continued to increase for most bacteria and antibiotics under surveillance. In particular, the EU average percentage of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 6.2% in 2012 to 8.1% in 2015, and combined resistance to carbapenems and polymyxins (e.g. colistin) was sometimes reported. These two groups of antibiotics are considered last-line antibiotics as they usually are the last treatment options for patients infected with bacteria resistant to other available antibiotics. While antibiotic consumption in hospitals significantly increased in several EU Member States, antibiotic consumption in the community decreased in six EU Member States. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:  Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. If we don t tackle it, we can go back to a time when even the simplest medical operations were not possible, and organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy or intensive care even less so . He added:  The European Commission will launch a new Action Plan next year so that we can, together with our partners in the EU Member States and internationally, continue to ensure that the prevention and control of antibiotic resistance is strengthened within a one-health approach . ECDC Acting Director, Dr Andrea Ammon, said:  Antibiotic resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae is of increasing concern in Europe. More than one third of the isolates reported to ECDC for 2015 were resistant to at least one of the antibiotic groups under surveillance, and combined resistance to multiple antibiotic groups was common. Moreover, the emergence of K. pneumoniae infections with combined resistance to carbapenems and colistin is worrisome and an important warning that options for treatment are now even more limited than in the past . Dr Ammon added:  However, the decrease of antibiotic consumption in the community in six countries is a positive sign and shows that we are starting to use antibiotics more prudently. Prudent use of antibiotics is pivotal, both in the community and in hospitals, to ensure that these drugs remain effective .  ECDC s data also show that antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli, one of the most frequent causes of bloodstream infections and community- and healthcare-associated urinary tract infections, requires close attention as the percentages of isolates resistant to commonly used antibiotics continues to increase throughout Europe. In contrast, the percentage of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed a significantly decreasing trend at EU/EEA level between 2012 and 2015. Despite this positive development, MRSA remains a public health priority as eight out of thirty countries reported percentages above 25%.  Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said:  Surveillance of antibiotic resistance is the backbone of our work in defence of antibiotics  effectiveness. Until we know where resistance is, we cannot prioritize action. This is why we focus on expanding the map of antibiotic resistance beyond the European Union countries through the Central Asian and Eastern European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (CAESAR) network. What the report indicates is of concern: our patients are exposed to resistant bacteria in hospitals due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics and poor infection prevention and control. We urge our leaders to use this evidence and accelerate their response to a major global health threat of our time .  Source: Story from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The key areas for future work so as to transform the successful technique at laboratory/pilot scale into commercial technology have also been discussed. Overall, it has been established that there is immense potential for sonochemical reactors for process intensification leading to greener processing and economic benefits. Combined efforts from a wide range of disciplines such as material science, physics, chemistry and chemical engineers are required to harness the benefits at commercial scale operation.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death and current therapies are not very effective. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that impair the response of cancer patients to chemotherapy, the standard treatment of care for this disease, is essential to design more effective treatments for this lethal disease. Tumour associated macrophages (TAM) and fibroblasts are non-cancerous cells that are found within solid tumours, including pancreatic cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that TAM and fibroblasts can support cancer progression, resistance to therapy and metastasis. However, the precise mechanisms by which these cells contribute to pancreatic cancer progression and response to therapy is not completely understood. Chemo resistance The research team led by Dr Ainhoa Mielgo Iza, a Sir Henry Dale Fellow, from the University s Institute of Translational Medicine, has been studying how these cells contribute to chemo resistance in pancreatic cancer. The study, which has been published in Cancer Research, found that TAM and fibroblasts directly support chemotherapy resistance of pancreatic cancer cells by secreting insulin-like growth factors. These proteins activate a survival signalling pathway on pancreatic cancer cells making them resistant to chemotherapy. Analysis of biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients revealed that this survival pathway is activated in 72% of the patients. More effective treatment Dr Mielgo, said:  These findings are very exciting because they uncover a mechanism that causes pancreatic cancer resistance to chemotherapy.  Our research interest is to understand the complex interactions in the tumour microenvironment with the aim of finding new therapeutic targets for cancer.  These results describe a combination treatment that could be more effective in treating this disease.  Source: Story from University of Liverpool.

Results:A totally green, solvent-free and catalyst-free microwave (MW)-assisted method for peracetylation of natural products such as oleuropein, alpha-hederin, quercetin and rutin is presented. By simply tuning the MW heating program, polyols with chemical diverse -OH groups or thermolabile functionalities can be peracetylated to improve the biological activity without degradation of the natural starting molecules.

Up to 47 per cent of their structure is a mysterious sheath that surrounds the genetic material, researchers say. While the precise function of this sheath is unknown, researchers suggest it may keep chromosomes isolated from one another during the key process of cell division. Researchers say this so-called chromosome periphery could help to prevent errors from occurring when cells divide   a hallmark of some forms of cancer and diseases associated with birth defects. 3D images Using advanced imaging techniques, researchers have for the first time produced detailed 3D models of all 46 human chromosomes   the structures inside cells that contain our genetic material. Since their discovery in 1882, chromosomes have been the focus of intensive study. Despite major technical advances, the complete structure and organisation of chromosomes has remained a mystery, researchers say. Advanced microscopy Scientists at Edinburgh developed a precise microscopy technique that allows them to study the structure of chromosomes in unprecedented detail. The method   known as 3D-CLEM   combines light and electron microscopy with computational modelling software to produce high-resolution 3D images of chromosomes.  The imaging technique we have developed to study chromosomes is truly ground-breaking. Defining the structure of all 46 human chromosomes for the first time has forced us to reconsider the idea that they are composed almost exclusively of chromatin, an assumption that has gone largely unchallenged for almost 100 years.    Dr Daniel Booth, School of Biological Sciences  DNA content Analysis of the images reveals that material containing DNA and supporting proteins   known as chromatin   accounts for between 53 and 70 per cent of the total contents of chromosomes. The remaining 30 to 47 per cent is composed of the chromosome periphery. The study, published in the journal Molecular Cell, was funded by The Wellcome Trust. The research was carried out in collaboration with the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan, National Cancer Institute, US, and the University of Liverpool.  We now have to re-think how chromosomes are built and how they segregate when cells divide, since the genetic material is covered by this thick layer of other material.

Scientists, based at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute at The University of Manchester, isolated tumour cells that had broken away from the main cancer - known as circulating tumour cells (CTCs) - from the blood of 31 patients with this aggressive form of the disease. When researchers analysed these cells, they discovered that patterns of genetic faults measured before treatment were linked to how well and how long a patient might respond to chemotherapy. Obtaining a tumour sample from lung cancer patients using an operation, known as a biopsy, can be difficult because the tumour is hard to reach and samples are often too small to reveal useful clues on how best to treat patients. Liquid biopsies offer an alternative to taking tumour samples, providing a snapshot of the disease from a blood sample. The team also investigated the genetic changes that occurred in patients who initially responded well to treatment but later relapsed. The pattern in these cells was different from patients who didn t respond well to chemotherapy, suggesting different mechanisms of drug resistance had developed. Lead researcher Professor Caroline Dive, based at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, said:  Our study reveals how blood samples could be used to anticipate how lung cancer patients may respond to treatments.  Unfortunately, we have very few treatment options for patients with SCLC, and none at all for those whose cancer is resistant to chemotherapy.  By identifying differences in the patterns of genetic faults between patients, we now have a starting point to begin to understand more about how drug resistance develops in patients with this aggressive form of lung cancer.  Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK s science information manager, said:  Lung cancer causes more than one in five of all cancer deaths in the UK and it s vital that we find effective new treatments to fight the disease and save more lives.  These liquid biopsies are an incredibly exciting area of research. Studies like this help build a bigger picture of the disease, pointing the way to developing new treatments that are urgently needed for people with lung cancer.

Scientists at the Department of Energy s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and the University of Illinois targeted three genes involved in a process plants use to protect themselves from damage when they get more light than they can safely use. By increasing the expression of those genes, the scientists saw increases of 14-20 percent in the productivity of modified tobacco plants in field experiments. The researchers described their findings in a paper published in the journal Science.  Tobacco was used as the model crop plant in this study because it is easy to work with, but we re working to make the same modifications in rice and other food crops,  said co-senior author Krishna Niyogi, a faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab s Division of Molecular Biophysics and Integrative Bioimaging.  The molecular processes we re modifying are fundamental to plants that carry out photosynthesis, so we hope to see a similar increase in yield in other crops.  Niyogi, who is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a UC Berkeley professor of plant and microbial biology, teamed up with Stephen Long, a plant biology and crop sciences professor at the University of Illinois, for the study. In photosynthesis, plants use the energy in sunlight to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into biomass, which we use for food, fuel, and fiber. When there is too much sunlight, the photosynthetic machinery in chloroplasts can be damaged, so plants need photoprotection. Inside chloroplasts, plants have a system called NPQ, or nonphotochemical quenching, for this purpose. Niyogi compared NPQ to a pressure relief valve in a steam engine.  When there is too much sunlight, it s like pressure building up,  said Niyogi.  NPQ turns on and gets rid of the excess energy safely. In the shade, the pressure in the engine decreases. NPQ turns off, but not quickly enough. It s like having a leak in the system with the valve left open. The photosynthetic engine can t work as efficiently.  The highly variable levels of light plants receive, particularly in densely planted crop fields, presents a challenge to the efficient use of solar energy. Plants must adapt to intermittent shading from leaves that are higher in the canopy, or from passing clouds. Niyogi and his postdoctoral research associates Lauriebeth Leonelli, St phane Gabilly, and Masakazu Iwai figured out a way to speed up recovery from photoprotection and demonstrated a proof of this concept in the laboratory. They used a new method to rapidly test gene expression in tobacco leaves. By boosting the expression of three genes involved in NPQ, they showed that NPQ turned off more quickly, and the efficiency of photosynthesis in the shade was higher. Half of crop photosynthesis occurs in the shade, so any improvement in speeding up recovery from photoprotection could have a big benefit, the researchers said. Illinois postdoctoral researchers Johannes Kromdijk and Katarzyna Glowacka took the trio of genes studied at Berkeley and put them into tobacco plants for further testing in greenhouse and field experiments. The work to boost crop productivity comes as concerns about food shortages rise with the world s population. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that food production will need to nearly double by 2050 to meet increasing demand. Yields of the world s major staple crops have not been increasing fast enough to meet this projected need.  My attitude is that it is very important to have these new technologies on the shelf now because it can take 20 years before such inventions can reach farmer s fields,  said Long.  If we don t do it now, we won t have this solution when we need it.  Source: Story from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Original piece written by Sarah Yang.

""A relatively simple mathematical logic underlies our complex brain computations,"" said Dr. Joe Z. Tsien, neuroscientist at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, co-director of the Augusta University Brain and Behavior Discovery Institute and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Cognitive and Systems Neurobiology. See Also: Brain networking: Brain scans used to determine mechanism behind cognitive control of thoughts Tsien is talking about his Theory of Connectivity, a fundamental principle for how our billions of neurons assemble and align not just to acquire knowledge, but to generalize and draw conclusions from it. ""Intelligence is really about dealing with uncertainty and infinite possibilities,"" Tsien said. It appears to be enabled when a group of similar neurons form a variety of cliques to handle each basic like recognizing food, shelter, friends and foes. Groups of cliques then cluster into functional connectivity motifs, or FCMs, to handle every possibility in each of these basics like extrapolating that rice is part of an important food group that might be a good side dish at your meaningful Thanksgiving gathering. The more complex the thought, the more cliques join in. That means, for example, we cannot only recognize an office chair, but an office when we see one and know that the chair is where we sit in that office. ""You know an office is an office whether it's at your house or the White House,"" Tsien said of the ability to conceptualize knowledge, one of many things that distinguishes us from computers. Tsien first published his theory in a 1,000-word essay in October 2015 in the journal Trends in Neuroscience. Now he and his colleagues have documented the algorithm at work in seven different brain regions involved with those basics like food and fear in mice and hamsters. Their documentation is published in the journal Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience. Learn More:  Connector hubs  are the champions of brain coordination ""For it to be a universal principle, it needs to be operating in many neural circuits, so we selected seven different brain regions and, surprisingly, we indeed saw this principle operating in all these regions,"" he said. Intricate organization seems plausible, even essential, in a human brain, which has about 86 billion neurons and where each neuron can have tens of thousands of synapses, putting potential connections and communications between neurons into the trillions. On top of the seemingly endless connections is the reality of the infinite things each of us can presumably experience and learn. Neuroscientists as well as computer experts have long been curious about how the brain is able to not only hold specific information, like a computer, but unlike even the most sophisticated technology to also categorize and generalize the information into abstract knowledge and concepts. ""Many people have long speculated that there has to be a basic design principle from which intelligence originates and the brain evolves, like how the double helix of DNA and genetic codes are universal for every organism,"" Tsien said. ""We present evidence that the brain may operate on an amazingly simple mathematical logic."" ""In my view, Joe Tsien proposes an interesting idea that proposes a simple organizational principle of the brain, and that is supported by intriguing and suggestive evidence,"" said Dr. Thomas C. S dhof, Avram Goldstein Professor in the Stanford University School of Medicine, neuroscientist studying synapse formation and function and a winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Don't Miss: The power of 2 may help explain brain design""This idea is very much worth testing further,"" said S dhof, a sentiment echoed by Tsien and his colleagues and needed in additional neural circuits as well as other animal species and artificial intelligence systems.

Tsien, neuroscientist at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, co-director of the Augusta University Brain and Behavior Discovery Institute and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Cognitive and Systems Neurobiology. Credit: Phil Jones  At the heart of Tsien's Theory of Connectivity is the algorithm, n=2i-1, which defines how many cliques are needed for an FCM and which enabled the scientists to predict the number of cliques needed to recognize food options, for example, in their testing of the theory. N is the number of neural cliques connected in different possible ways; 2 means the neurons in those cliques are receiving the input or not; i is the information they are receiving; and -1 is just part of the math that enables you to account for all possibilities, Tsien explained. See Also: Researchers find the organization of the human brain to be nearly ideal To test the theory, they placed electrodes in the areas of the brain so they could ""listen"" to the response of neurons, or their action potential, and examine the unique waveforms resulting from each. They gave the animals, for example, different combinations of four different foods, such as usual rodent biscuits as well as sugar pellets, rice and milk, and as the Theory of Connectivity would predict, the scientists could identify all 15 different cliques, or groupings of neurons, that responded to the potential variety of food combinations. The neuronal cliques appear prewired during brain development because they showed up immediately when the food choices did. The fundamental mathematical rule even remained largely intact when the NMDA receptor, a master switch for learning and memory, was disabled after the brain matured. The scientists also learnefd that size does mostly matter, because while the human and animal brain both have a six-layered cerebral cortex the lumpy outer layer of the brain that plays a key role in higher brain functions like learning and memory the extra longitudinal length of the human cortex provides more room for cliques and FCMs, Tsien said. And while the overall girth of the elephant brain is definitely larger than the human brain, for example, most of its neurons reside in the cerebellum with far less in their super-sized cerebral cortex. The cerebellum is more involved in muscle coordination, which may help explain the agility of the huge mammal, particularly its trunk. Read Next: Identification tags define neural circuits Tsien noted exceptions to the brain's mathematical rule, such as in the reward circuits where the dopamine neurons reside. These cells tend to be more binary where we judge, for example, something as either good or bad, Tsien said. The project grew out of Tsien's early work in the creation of smart mouse Doogie 17 years ago while on faculty at Princeton University, in studying how changes in neuronal connections lay down memories in the brain.

The discovery revises the current models for homeostatic control the mechanisms by which the brain maintains the body's status quo of feeding behavior. Published in Nature Neuroscience, the findings offer new insight into the regulation of hunger and satiety and could help researchers find solutions to the ongoing obesity epidemic. See More: 'Hunger' neurons in the brain are regulated by protein activated during fasting""Current models lack a rapidly-acting satiety mechanism analogous to the hunger-promoting neurons,"" said corresponding author Bradford B. Lowell, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at BIDMC. ""This component we identified provides the full 'yang' to the hunger-promoting neurons' 'yin.'"" Researchers have long known that hunger is regulated by two kinds of neurons: Agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. AgRP neurons drive hunger; stimulating these nerves triggers eating within minutes. The opposing group of neurons, POMC, has been shown to promote satiety. Lab mice engineered to lack POMC neurons eat large quantities of food and become massively obese. New model for neurological control of hunger - Current models for homeostatic control of hunger/satiety lack a rapidly-acting satiety mechanism that is temporally analogous to that provided by rapidly-acting, hunger-promoting ARCAgRP neurons. New findings report the discovery of this missing component, namely glutamate-releasing oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus. These neurons converge with ARCAgRP and ARCPOMC neurons on downstream targets and rapidly increase / decrease satiety when experimentally activated / inhibited. Thus, in contrast to the hunger-promoting system where slow- (AgRP) and rapid-acting signals (GABA and NPY) are conveyed by one group of neurons (ARCAgRP neurons), the counteracting satiety-promoting system is split into two parallel-projecting neurons, the previously known ARCPOMC neurons which deliver slow-acting  -MSH, and the previously unknown ARCOxtr neurons which release the rapid-acting transmitter, glutamate. Importantly, these two satiety neurons interact as  -MSH released by ARCPOMC neurons postsynaptically increases glutamatergic transmission across the ARCOxtr PVHMC4R synapse. This missing rapid-acting component, with ARCPOMC neurons, now provides the full 'yang' to the ARCAgRP neuron's 'yin'. Our work also provides a mechanism for  -MSH /MC4R regulation of satiety plasticity of the novel ARCOxtr PVHMC4R synapse. Credit: B.B. Lowell  Learn More: Multitasking hunger neurons also control compulsive behaviors However, in recent years, new technology has allowed scientists to selectively manipulate neurons in living animals, demonstrating specific neurons' direct effect on behavior. About five years ago, this type of research revealed that POMC neurons act over the course of many hours not minutes like their AgRP counterparts. ""The lack of a rapid effect strongly suggested that the POMC neurons, by themselves, are not the full counterpart to the AgRP neurons,"" said lead author Henning Fenselau, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Lowell's laboratory at BIDMC. ""We hypothesized that an important but unknown neural component of the satiety system was missing from the current models."" What's more, because the team was looking for neurons that would suppress eating quickly, they narrowed their search for ones that release the fast-acting, excitatory neurotransmitter called glutamate. In the current paper, Lowell and colleagues investigated a third subset of neurons, Vglut2, the function of which was previously unknown. Don't Miss: Imaging the effects of hunger on the brain's response to food cues In a series of experiments, Lowell and colleagues used optogenetics (the use of light to activate genetically-modified neurons) and chemogenetics (the use of molecules to activate targeted neurons) to manipulate specific neurons to determine their roles in feeding behavior. First, the team demonstrated that, unlike POMC neurons, Vglut2 neurons could in fact rapidly suppress feeding behavior in mice. When the researchers chemically stimulated the neurons in question, it markedly decreased eating. When they inhibited the Vglut2 neurons, eating increased. They also found that all three types of neurons the hunger promoting AgRP neurons and the two satiety promoting neurons, Vglut2 neurons and POMC neurons interact in the same circuit. All three converge downstream in a site in the hypothalamus known to suppress hunger, the subject of previous research by Lowell and colleagues. AgRP neurons inhibit activity in this downstream site, causing hunger, while the rapidly-acting Vglut2 neurons excite it, suppressing hunger. The third member of this circuit, POMC neurons, indirectly decrease hunger by releasing a hormone that bolsters Vglut2 neurons' ability to suppress hunger. ""We think this is very important because it may be one explanation why individuals lacking POMC genes become extremely obese, even if those neurons by themselves do not directly promote satiety,"" said Fenselau. ""Without POMC, the Vglut2 neurons are ineffective in stimulating the downstream hypothalamic site. You need both POMC neurons and Vglut2 neurons for the satiety mechanism to work properly."" Read Next: Early poverty disrupts link between hunger and eating Finally, the team sequenced the genes expressed by this subset of neurons and found they possess receptors for the hormone oxytocin. Known to play a role in social bonding, oxytocin is linked to feelings of contentment and is already being investigated for its potential as a satiety-inducing weight loss medication. ""Our findings could definitely explain why oxytocin is effective in satiety,"" said Fenselau.

The approvals for NSCLC continue a trend that began last year, when nivolumab (Opdivo ) became the first immunotherapy to be approved for second-line treatment of NSCLC.   Until recently, for patients with advanced lung cancer, effective treatments were very limited.  Immunotherapy is providing new treatment options, and that is great news for patients,  said Shakun Malik, M.D., of NCI s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. Two Trials Support Atezolizumab Approval The FDA approved atezolizumab based on the results of two randomized clinical trials that compared the immunotherapy with docetaxel, which is a standard chemotherapy for NSCLC that has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Results from one of the trials, a 287-patient study called POPLAR, which was funded by the pharmaceutical companies that developed the drug, were published on April 30 in The Lancet. Median overall survival for patients who received atezolizumab was 12.6 months, compared with 9.7 months for patients in the docetaxel group. Side effects were less frequent and less severe for patients treated with atezolizumab. Full data from the second trial leading to approval, which enrolled 1,225 participants, have not yet been published. However, data released by the FDA (from the first 850 randomly assigned participants) and presented last month at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical OncologyExit Disclaimer also showed improved overall survival for atezolizumab compared with docetaxel: 13.8 months versus 9.6 months. Pembrolizumab Approval Expanded In the clinical trial of pembrolizumab that led to its approval as a first-line treatment for NSCLC, 305 patients newly diagnosed with advanced lung cancer were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or platinum-based chemotherapy. To enroll in the trial, patients  tumors had to have high expression of PD-L1, which is defined as expression on at least 50 percent of tumor cells, as measured by an FDA-approved test. Patients in the pembrolizumab group lived a median of 10.3 months without their tumors progressing, compared with 6.0 months for patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy; and they also lived longer overall. In the trial of pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, patients had to have progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy and have PD-L1 expression of 1% or greater, based on an FDA-approved test. Patients in the trial who received either of two different doses of the immunotherapy drug lived longer than patients who received docetaxel: 10.4 months and 12.7 months compared with 8.5 months for the docetaxel group. Before treatment with either atezolizumab or pembrolizumab, patients  tumors must also be tested for alterations in the EGFR or ALK genes. If a tumor has either alteration, the patient must first be treated with approved drugs that target those mutations. If their cancer progresses on these treatments, they are then eligible to receive immunotherapy. Who Benefits? Gains in the overall survival of patients with advanced lung cancer in trials of checkpoint inhibitors have been modest, Dr. Malik said. But, she continued, in these trials there has consistently been a small subset of patients who benefit substantially, with their disease not progressing for months or even years. This consistent pattern, she explained, highlights how much is left to be learned about how immunotherapy actually works.  There s a tail end of the [survival] curves, where some patients are seen to be helped by these drugs for a long period of time,  she said. Research is ongoing to better identify who is most likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This work, Dr. Malik explained, could potentially help scientists understand exactly how these drugs disrupt cancer progression and why they work so well in some patients but not others, ultimately leading to the ability to better select patients for treatment.

A Dundee team led by Professor Alessio Ciulli in the School of Life Sciences have used pioneering techniques to develop a `small molecule  chemical probe called VH298, which offers highly targeted access to the parts of the cell which regulate hypoxia, known as the hypoxic signalling pathway.  Using a small molecule like this offers a highly targeted option to control the hypoxic pathway, and one which can sneak in under the cell s natural defences to perform its work, a bit like a molecular commando,  said Professor Ciulli. The research has been published in Nature Communications.Active hypoxic signalling can be both good and bad, depending on context. In diseases like cancer it can be a bad thing as it can help tumour cells to survive and prosper. However, a hypoxic response can provide therapeutic benefits in conditions such as ischaemic injuries to the brain or heart, including stroke, and anaemia due to chronic kidney disease or chemotherapy. Being able to control the hypoxic signalling pathway offers the prospect of finding new drugs which could be deployed in those cases. Existing methods include genetic knockouts which affect the entire pathway and chemical tools which interfere with multiple processes, and until now it had been hard to be more selective in picking a single target.  The difficulty with some of the existing methods of tackling this pathway are that they affect stages which are also involved in other processes, meaning you are potentially triggering side effects, which makes it harder to control the overall outcomes,  said Professor Ciulli.  We have identified a stage of the pathway that is very specific and doesn t have this broad range of activity. By targeting it we can be much more specific in the actions we are triggering in the cell.  This is important as a chemical probe because it means we can make better measurements of cause and effect and build more information about how hypoxia works and how we may be able to control it. It also offers a potentially drug target in itself.  The difference in approach between for example gene knockouts and our small molecule method is a bit like between blowing up the whole factory or sneaking someone in to take out the little bit that you want to.  The use of small molecules like this is a growing area of drug development, offering the prospect of highly specific treatments for many conditions. Successfully identifying and developing suitable small molecules, however, is extremely complex.  We have been able to develop this project due to the world-class expertise we have at Dundee, bringing together people from different laboratories and areas of knowledge,  said Professor Ciulli.  So in my lab we work on design and studying how this types of molecules work but we are also able to call on scientists like Sonia Rocha, with expertise in oxygen sensing pathways, Doreen Cantrell, whose world-renowned work includes the role of hypoxia in immune cells, and Kevin Read in our Drug Discovery Unit, who has helped us maximise the drug-like properties of the molecule.  It is this combination of world-class work that has helped make Dundee the top-ranked place in the UK for biological sciences research. Our new molecule will be made available to the wide scientific community for use as inhibitor in biological research.  Source: Story from the University of Dundee.

The discovery can help researchers create novel targeted therapies potentially reducing deaths from this devastating cancer.  ""New treatment options for brain cancer patients are desperately needed,"" said Joe W. Ramos, PhD, UH Cancer Center deputy director and lead researcher on the study. ""Treatment options include chemotherapy in combination with radiation, but they only prolong a patient's life by a few months.""  Glioblastoma remains a lethal cancer with only a 14-month average survival rate after initial diagnosis.  The study published in ""Oncotarget"" reveals that a protein called RSK2 is increased in many patients with glioblastoma. The protein pushes glioblastoma cells into surrounding healthy brain tissue. The invasion of these cells throughout the brain makes it difficult to remove the tumor by surgery, which contributes to high recurrence and poor survival rates in patients. The invading glioblastoma cells are less sensitive to current standard therapies. The research team found that inhibiting RSK2 stops invasion of the tumor cells and enhances the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy in tumor cells obtained from patients.  ""This study paves the way for development of new brain cancer therapies focused on RSK2 inhibitors for brain invasion,"" said co-author Dr. Santosh Kesari, chair of Department of Translational Neurosciences and Neurotherapeutics of the John Wayne Cancer Institute and Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center.  ""The next steps include identifying better compounds to target the RSK2 protein. We are hoping to discover a powerful new drug to treat this aggressive brain cancer,"" said Dr. Ramos.  The findings resulted from several years of collaboration among the labs of Drs. Ramos and Michelle Matter at the UH Cancer Center, Kesari at the John Wayne Cancer Institute, and Dirk Geerts of Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands.  ""The new discovery can potentially lead to a new class of drugs to treat not only brain cancers, but other invasive cancers as well. With about 60 new cases of brain cancer diagnosed every year in Hawai'i, and about 40 deaths, an effective treatment can help many patients in our state,"" said Dr. Randall Holcombe, UH Cancer Center director.

Getting two complementary strands of DNA to zip up into a double helix can serve as the basis of intricate physical mechanisms that can push and pull molecular-scale devices. Engineers and chemists at the University of Pennsylvania have developed nanoscale  muscles  that work on this principle. By carefully incorporating strands of custom DNA into different layers of flexible films, they can force those films to bend, curl and even flip over by introducing the right DNA cue. They could also reverse these changes by way of different DNA cues. One day, the flexing of these muscles could be used in diagnostic devices, capable of signaling changes in gene expression from within cells. The researchers demonstrated this system in a study published in Nature Nanotechnology.  The study was led John C. Crocker and Daeyeon Lee, professors of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in Penn s School of Engineering and Applied Science, So-Jung Park, a an adjunct professor of Chemistry in Penn s School of Arts & Sciences and professor in the Department of Chemistry and Nano Science at Ewha Womans University, Seoul, along with Tae Soup Shim, who was then a post-doctoral associate in the researchers  groups. David Chenoweth, an assistant professor of chemistry in in Arts & Sciences also contributed to the study. Other Penn co-authors include Zaki G. Estephan, Zhaoxia Qian, Jacob H. Prosser and Su Yeon Lee, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the departments of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering and Chemistry. The nanoscale muscles in the study are comprised of gold nanoparticles, which are connected to one another by single-stranded DNA. The researchers built up the films layer-by-layer, introducing different sets of DNA-linked nanoparticles at different depths. Each set of nanoparticles contained links with different sequences.    The way the actuation works,  Crocker said,  is that we add single-stranded DNA that is complementary to a portion of the bridges between the particles. When that DNA diffuses in, it turns just those bridges into double-stranded DNA helices.  Because the specific sequence of the added DNA is tailored to match different sets of nanoparticle bridges, the researchers could target individual layers of the film, forming double-stranded bridges in just those layers. This mechanism was critical to getting the films to flex, as single-stranded and double-stranded bridges are different lengths.  It so happens that double-stranded DNAs are longer than single-stranded DNAs with the same number of bases,  Crocker said,  so when the added strand binds, the bridge gets a little longer and the material expands.  If only one layer of the film expands, the film curls.  The researchers also designed a way of reverting the bridges to their original, single-stranded state, undoing this curl. The strands that give the curling cue also have a  handle  that does not bind to the bridges. Pulling on this handle splits apart the double helix the added DNA forms.  We make the strand that we added to expand the bridges a little longer than it needs to be,  Crocker said.  After it forms a double helix with the bridge, there are another 7 bases of leftover single-stranded DNA dangling off to the side of the bridge. To reverse the process, we add a 'stripper' strand that is complementary to the 'expander' strand and the extra dangling 'handle.   It actually hybridizes to the dangling handle, and then pulls the expander strand off the bridge, forming a double helix in solution that floats away, allowing the bridge to revert to its shorter, single-stranded form.  Getting the films to curl or to flip over entirely is just a proof-of-concept for now, but this muscle-like flexing behavior could have a host of applications at the nanoscale. Being able to respond to one cue and totally ignore the other impossible for systems that flex based on temperature or acidity changes is critical for their ability to work as diagnostic devices.  A 'far-out' application we have thought of is in intracellular situations where we can't exactly control things with wires or wireless equipment, Crocker said.  We could make a device that absorbs or reflects a certain wavelength of light based upon the spacing of its internal layers, and we could then alter that spacing using a chemical signal. This signal could be a messenger RNA, so the device provides a single-cell gene expression readout.  These intracellular devices could be read out under a microscope, or inside the body using infrared imaging.  Source: Story from the University of Pennsylvania.

Juices released from damaged leaves also enhance the pathogen s ability to attach to the salad s plastic container. The research is published November 18th in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. In the study, salad juices in water to mimic the grocery salad bag environment more than doubled motility, or movement of individual Salmonella bacteria, abetting salad leaf colonization. During a typical five-day refrigeration storage time, around 100 Salmonella bacteria multiplied to approximately 100,000 individual bacteria. Salad juices also boosted formation of biofilms on salad leaves. Microbial biofilms generally cling tenaciously to the surfaces they coat medical implants, stainless steel, or one s teeth, in the form of dental plaque and Salmonella biofilms on salad leaves are no exception. They are powerfully resistant to being washed off. Yet surprisingly, the normal microbial flora on salad leaves did not respond to leaf juices, suggesting that the leaf juices give Salmonella a marked advantage in colonizing salad leaves as compared to competing bacteria, according to the report.  Salad leaf crops are usually grown in open fields where they can be exposed to Salmonella, via insects, bird poop, and manure, among other sources. While outbreaks of Salmonellosis due to such contamination are uncommon, they are nonetheless a public health problem. Such outbreaks may occur despite practices used to mitigate the problem, such as irrigation with clean water, good hygiene, leaf washing, and the like, said co-author Primrose Freestone, PhD, Associate Professor in Clinical Microbiology, University of Leicester, UK. In fact, salad leaves can acquire Salmonella from recycled wash water, she said. Moreover, earlier studies have shown that Salmonella are so powerfully attracted to salad leaf and root juices that they can find their way into the plant vasculature during the salad plant s germination, and once inside, there is no way to wash them out, said Freestone. Pre-prepared salads are sold increasingly commonly in grocery stores, said Freestone. They also appear in fast food and in airline meals. However, few studies had previously investigated the behavior of Salmonella within ready-to-eat bagged salad, she said.  We wanted to investigate what happens to Salmonella in a bag of salad to better understand the potential risks to consumers and inform future research on reducing attachment of this pathogen to salad leaves. This study is part of our ongoing research into ways to reduce the risk of Salmonella persisting and growing when it is present in bagged salad.  Source: Story from the University of Leicester.

The replicon system research was spearheaded by Dr. Xuping Xie and recently published in EBioMedicine. Replicons are segments of viral genome that can replicate on their own, independent of the cellular chromosome. The new Zika replicon system has deleted some of the genes that give the virus its structure. Because of this, the altered Zika virus is no longer infectious, lowering the safety risk involved in working with it.  One of these replicons can be used to locate portions of the viral molecule that block or halt viral replication, making it a powerful tool for vaccine development,  said senior author Pei-Yong Shi, a professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology. The replicon system was engineered by attaching genes that allow researchers to tag certain parts of the virus that they are interested in. Luciferase, the chemical that gives fireflies their signature glow, was used to make targeted viral components light up - making processes like replication much easier to observe.  The other newly-developed replicon was designed to study potential antiviral agents by differentiating between when the virus is making copies of itself and when it s altering its structure,  Shi said.  Knowing when and how the virus is mutating is important, as evolution is what makes viruses more adept at invading hosts like humans or animals or become more damaging once inside the host.  The recent Zika virus outbreak has highlighted the urgent need to establish genetic tools for studying how the virus multiplies and causes disease within a newly infected person in order to develop countermeasures. This is especially important because the Zika virus is spreading rapidly and behaves differently than many other viruses   for instance, it can be transmitted sexually and is associated with microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome.

The development of novel therapies or vaccines requires improved understanding of how viruses, pathogenic fungi or bacteria cause illnesses.  Some bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella invade and replicate within human cells. Science is steadily shifting its focus towards studying infected cells and how differences between individual host cells affect the cellular response to pathogens. A research team headed by Professor J rg Vogel from the University of W rzburg has made significant progress in this area. They have developed a novel technique that allows them to investigate the interplay of individual host cells with infecting bacteria. This study is based on close collaboration between J rg Vogel s team at the Institute of Molecular Infection Biology, the core unit Systems Medicine of the Medical Faculty and researchers at Imperial College in London. Their results have now been published in the scientific journal  Nature Microbiology .  Salmonella pursue two strategies The team used a technique called  single-cell RNA-seq  to study the infection of macrophages by Salmonella. Macrophages are immune cells that belong to the group of white blood cells. Salmonella on the other hand are pathogenic bacteria that may be taken up by the ingestion of contaminated water or food to cause local gastroenteritis and diarrhea. In immunocompromised patients, however, Salmonella may disseminate throughout the entire body and cause life-threatening diseases. Upon the invasion of macrophages, Salmonella pursue two strategies: The bacteria either replicate to high numbers inside the host cell or adopt a non-growing state that allows them to persist for years within the body of their host.  This disparate growth behavior impacts disease progression and plays a major role in the success of antibiotic treatment  says lead researcher J rg Vogel. Analyzing single macrophages infected with Salmonella To date, very little is known if and how macrophages respond to these disparate lifestyles of intracellular Salmonella. To answer this question the W rzburg scientists cultured macrophages in the laboratory and infected them with Salmonella.  The RNA from the infected cells was subsequently extracted and analyzed using deep-sequencing, leading to the detection of more than 5,000 different transcripts per macrophage. These data on the host s gene expression were combined with information about the growth behavior of the intracellular pathogens.  The results: Macrophages containing non-growing bacteria adopt the hallmark signature associated with inflammation. They express signaling molecules to attract further immune cells to the site of infection. In this respect, they respond similarly to macrophages that have encountered Salmonella, but have not been infected.  These macrophages cannot detect their intracellular bacteria   they are below their radar  explains Emmanuel Saliba, first author of the study. In contrast, macrophages with fast-growing bacteria develop an anti-inflammatory response. These interesting results open many questions, Do Salmonella induce this different response? Do they manipulate the macrophages so they do not raise the alarm to facilitate the bacteria to evade an immune response? Are there situations where Salmonella are unable to perform this trick? In these cases, will there still be an immune response forcing the bacteria to switch to their resting growth state? Of interest for many biomedical areas   Currently we have just looked at a single time point after infection and thus cannot differentiate between cause and consequence  explains Alexander Westermann, another member of the team. Follow-up studies are required. Nevertheless, the current findings already provide a new perspective on the host response to pathogenic microbes. And using the new technology, bacterial infections can be studied in unprecedented resolution   namely on the single-cell level. The method established at the W rzburg core unit Systems Medicine should be of great interest for many further biomedical projects.  Among others, heterogeneity amongst tumor cells or the effect of drugs on single cells may be analyzed in unknown accuracy  says Professor Vogel.

Researchers will develop an entirely novel approach towards food safety monitoring. Recently, the European Research Executive Agency granted almost  3 million to this consortium, which consists of RIKILT Wageningen University & Research) and institutes from five other countries. Testing on the spot At present, samples are still taken throughout the food production chain, registered and sent to laboratories where they are tested for residues of pesticides, antibiotics, natural toxins, allergens and other contaminants. Depending on the numbers of samples and the difficulty of testing, it may then take several days before the results are available, even though nothing is wrong in most cases. It is envisaged that in the future some of these tests will done on site by food inspectors using their smartphone. This would not only save time and money, but also mean that laboratories can use their more advanced equipment to focus on the much more relevant suspected cases and to obtain evidence of any food safety violations. Use your smartphone for food testing With American and German partners, RIKILT previously developed a smartphone attachment and app for detecting a banned hormone injust one drop of milk.  Besides enabling more efficient monitoring of food quality by professionals, it is quite conceivable that even consumers will be able to use their smartphones for food testing in the future. They will be supported by intelligent apps and wireless support to ensure the accuracy and quality of the measurement. Another example of this approach is the RIKILT food scanner, with which future consumers will be able to determine the origin, shelf-life and composition of food.

The finding could lead to an additional strategy to block LDL accumulation, which could help prevent or slow the clogging of arteries that leads to heart disease, the researchers said. The study was published on Nov. 21 in Nature Communications. Arteries become clogged with fats and cholesterol when certain proteins in the body, known as lipoproteins, combine with and transport fats in the blood to cells. Scientists have long believed that the LDL receptor molecule was responsible for the transport of LDL within cells. But given that some individuals lacking the LDL receptor still have high levels of LDL, questions remained about the mechanism. To identify the mechanism, the research team screened more than 18,000 genes from the endothelium   the inner layer of human blood vessels. They examined the transfer of LDL into endothelial cells and then focused on possible genes involved in the process. The researchers found that a protein called ALK1 facilitated LDL s pathway into cells.  We confirmed that ALK1 directly binds to LDL,  said William C. Sessa, senior author and the Alfred Gilman Professor of Pharmacology and professor of medicine (cardiology). The team also determined that the  LDL-ALK1 pathway  aided the transport of LDL from blood into tissue. The role of ALK1 in LDL accumulation was not previously known, said Sessa.  The discovery of ALK1 as an LDL-binding protein implies that it might initiate the early phases of atherosclerosis,  he noted.  If we can find a way of blocking ALK1 using small molecules or antibodies, it might be used in combination with lipid-lowering strategies.    Current lipid-lowering strategies include statins, which target LDL cholesterol levels in the blood. A therapeutic that blocks ALK1  would be a unique strategy for reducing the burden of atherosclerosis and be synergistic with lipid- lowering therapies,  Sessa noted.

Glycoproteins are formed when sugars attach to and modify a protein. In some cases, a combination of glycoproteins present in a sample of blood or urine could be an indicator of disease or cancer. But those glycoproteins can be elusive. There has been no antibody to differentiate between them and regular proteins. And the complex and bulky sugar groups can make it difficult for even standard protein-detection antibodies to find their targets. W. Andy Tao, a Purdue professor of biochemistry, has developed a novel protein array, a high throughput platform to analyze multiple proteins in parallel, for separating glycoproteins from unmodified proteins. Tao also demonstrated its effectiveness for identifying glycoproteins associated with bladder cancer. The findings were published Monday (Nov. 14) in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Tao developed a nano-sized polymer, called polyGPA, that attaches to the sugar groups of glycoproteins and brings them to the surface of the protein array. The nanopolymer also repositions the glycoprotein so that the antibodies used to detect unmodified proteins can better reach their targets.  There are many sugar types and combinations. Sugar modification can be a very important indication of disease state,  Tao said.  A panel of proteins modified by sugars may be an indication of a particular disease.  Tao said tests showed his method is 17 times to 25 times more likely to identify proteins that might have otherwise been missed in regular testing procedures. He was also able to identify glycoproteins associated with bladder cancer in a urine sample.  It is possible to use our platform to identify these sugar-modified proteins as a biomarker for bladder cancer,  Tao said. Source: Story from Purdue University.

The technique, which the team showed was able to partially restore visual responses in blind rodents, will open new avenues for basic research and a variety of treatments, such as for retinal, heart and neurological diseases.  We are very excited by the technology we discovered because it s something that could not be done before,  says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in Salk s Gene Expression Laboratory and senior author of the paper published on November 16, 2016 in Nature.  For the first time, we can enter into cells that do not divide and modify the DNA at will. The possible applications of this discovery are vast.  Until now, techniques that modify DNA such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system have been most effective in dividing cells, such as those in skin or the gut, using the cells  normal copying mechanisms. The new Salk technology is ten times more efficient than other methods at incorporating new DNA into cultures of dividing cells, making it a promising tool for both research and medicine. But, more importantly, the Salk technique represents the first time scientists have managed to insert a new gene into a precise DNA location in adult cells that no longer divide, such as those of the eye, brain, pancreas or heart, offering new possibilities for therapeutic applications in these cells. To achieve this, the Salk researchers targeted a DNA-repair cellular pathway called NHEJ (for  non-homologous end-joining ), which repairs routine DNA breaks by rejoining the original strand ends. They paired this process with existing gene-editing technology to successfully place new DNA into a precise location in non-dividing cells.  Using this NHEJ pathway to insert entirely new DNA is revolutionary for editing the genome in live adult organisms,  says Keiichiro Suzuki, a senior research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab and one of the paper s lead authors.  No one has done this before.  First, the Salk team worked on optimizing the NHEJ machinery for use with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which allows DNA to be inserted at very precise locations within the genome. The team created a custom insertion package made up of a nucleic acid cocktail, which they call HITI, or homology-independent targeted integration. Then they used an inert virus to deliver HITI s package of genetic instructions to neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells.  That was the first indication that HITI might work in non-dividing cells,  says Jun Wu, staff scientist and co-lead author. With that feat under their belts, the team then successfully delivered the construct to the brains of adult mice. Finally, to explore the possibility of using HITI for gene-replacement therapy, the team tested the technique on a rat model for retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited retinal degeneration condition that causes blindness in humans. This time, the team used HITI to deliver to the eyes of 3-week-old rats a functional copy of Mertk, one of the genes that is damaged in retinitis pigmentosa. Analysis performed when the rats were 8 weeks old showed that the animals were able to respond to light, and passed several tests indicating healing in their retinal cells.  We were able to improve the vision of these blind rats,  says co-lead author Reyna Hernandez-Benitez, a Salk research associate.  This early success suggests that this technology is very promising.  The team s next steps will be to improve the delivery efficiency of the HITI construct. As with all genome editing technologies, getting enough cells to incorporate the new DNA is a challenge. The beauty of HITI technology is that it is adaptable to any targeted genome engineering system, not just CRISPR-Cas9. Thus, as the safety and efficiency of these systems improve, so too will the usefulness of HITI.  We now have a technology that allows us to modify the DNA of non-dividing cells, to fix broken genes in the brain, heart and liver,  says Izpisua Belmonte.  It allows us for the first time to be able to dream of curing diseases that we couldn t before, which is exciting.  Source: Story from Salk Institute.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/nutty-cancer-drug-discovery-204029,Nutty Cancer Drug Discovery Researches have identifed a component  found in areca nuts  to have anticancer properties  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Arecoline   the stimulant component of areca nuts   has anticancer properties, researchers at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University have discovered. The findings were published November 17 in Molecular Cell. Areca nuts are chewed for their stimulant effects in many Asian countries, and evidence links the practice to the development of oral and esophageal cancer. Analogous to nicotine, arecoline was identified as an inhibitor of the enzyme ACAT1, which contributes to the metabolism-distorting Warburg effect in cancer cells. Observers of health news have complained that coffee, as a widely cited example, is implicated in causing cancer one week and absolved the next. Arecoline is not another instance of the same trend, stresses senior author Jing Chen, PhD, professor of hematology and medical oncology at Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute. ""This is just a proof of principle, showing that ACAT1 is a good anticancer target,"" Chen says. ""We view arecoline as a lead to other compounds that could be more potent and selective."" Chen says that arecoline could be compared to arsenic, a form of which is used as a treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia, but is also linked to several types of cancer. Plus, arecoline's cancer-promoting effects may be limited if it is not delivered or absorbed orally, he says. When arecoline first arose in a chemical screen, Chen says: ""It sounded like a carcinogen to me. But it all depends on the dose and how it is taken into the body."" The Warburg effect, named after 1931 Nobel laureate Otto Warburg, describes how cancer cells tend to favor the inefficient use of glucose, known as glycolysis, and de-emphasize their mitochondria. Cancer cells benefit from this metabolic distortion because the byproducts of glycolysis can be used as building blocks for fast growth. Chen's laboratory had previously identified the mitochondrial thiolase ACAT1 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase) as a control valve regulating the Warburg effect. In this paper, the researchers showed that ACAT1 enzymatic activity was higher in several types of cancer cells, even though the levels of ACAT1 protein are about the same. The reason is that the protein clusters together as tetramers in cancer cells. Tyrosine kinases, often on overdrive in cancer cells, ""hijack"" ACAT1 and nudge it into tetramers, which are enzymatically more active. But arecoline, identified in a screen of 2000 FDA-approved small molecule compounds, can inhibit ACAT1 and prevent it from forming tetramers. Arecoline forms a chemical bond with part of the ACAT1 protein, the researchers showed. Arecoline appears to do what the researchers proposed it would: it steers cells' metabolism away from glycolysis. The compound inhibited the growth of human lung cancer and leukemia cells both in culture and grafted into mice, and did not affect the growth of normal blood cells. Could ACAT1 inhibitors be toxic? The enzyme ACAT1 seems to have a double role. It breaks down ketones and the amino acid isoleucine, and it also modifies other proteins through acetylation, which is how it regulates the Warburg effect. Genetic mutations in ACAT1 lie behind a very rare metabolic disorder called beta-ketothiolase deficiency. Complete inhibition of ACAT1 could induce side effects resembling that disorder. But when the Winship team incompletely ""knocked down"" ACAT1 in cells using arecoline or genetic tools, the main effect was on protein acetylation, not on ketone metabolism, Chen says. While the researchers did not see obvious toxicity when treating mice with arecoline, more extensive pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies with arecoline and similar compounds are needed, he says.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-identifies-asymptomatic-ebola-210579,Study Identifies Asymptomatic Ebola Research team determines that     of individuals in a Sierra Leone village were infected with the Ebola virus but had no symptoms  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A year after the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine and other institutions identified 14 individuals previously unknown to have had the disease in a Sierra Leone village that was an Ebola hot spot. These individuals had antibodies to the virus, indicating they had been infected at one time. Yet 12 said they had had no symptoms during the time of active transmission in the village. The research confirms previous suspicions that the Ebola virus does not uniformly cause severe disease, and that people may be infected without showing signs of illness, said Gene Richardson, MD, a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford who is now a PhD candidate in anthropology at the university. The findings also suggest that the epidemic was more widespread than previously believed. Based on the results of the study, the researchers calculated the prevalence of minimally symptomatic infection to be 25 percent.  The study corroborates previous evidence that Ebola is like most other viruses in that it causes a spectrum of manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection,  Richardson said.  It provides important evidence on that front. It also means a significant portion of transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. This shows there was a lot more human-to-human transmission than we thought.  The study was published online Nov. 15 in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. The study also was presented Nov. 14 at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene s annual meeting in Atlanta. Richardson is lead author of the study, and Paul Farmer, MD, PhD, a Harvard professor and director of Partners In Health, is the senior author. Testing individuals The research was done in the rural village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a country where Richardson and his colleagues cared for hundreds of patients in Ebola treatment units managed by Partners In Health. The village, with about 900 residents, had been one of three major hot spots in the Kono District, in the eastern part of the country, during the heat of the Ebola crisis between November 2014 and February 2015. There were 34 reported cases of Ebola in the village, including 28 deaths. More than 28,000 cases of Ebola infection were reported in Africa during the epidemic, the largest and longest in history. More than 11,000 people are estimated to have died because of the disease. In the aftermath, Richardson and his colleagues decided to go back to the village to try to determine whether the Ebola infection could be minimally symptomatic, as previous studies have suggested. He worked with a local physician and two community health workers in gathering data for the study, a process that was approved by the local village chief. They used a test known as the ELISA assay, a technique that can detect the presence of an antibody. They first made sure the test was accurate by comparing results from 30 Ebola survivors in Sukudu with those of 132 people in other villages where the virus had not been reported. Richardson said the test proved to be a reasonable measure of viral antibodies. The researchers then recruited 187 men, women and children from Sukudu who had likely been exposed to Ebola, either because they were living in the same household or had shared a public toilet with a person confirmed to have had the disease. Of these, 14 were found to be carrying antibodies to Ebola, indicating they had been infected at some point, though they had not been included in the original count. Twelve of them said they had had no symptoms of the disease, which typically causes fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhoea, breathing problems and difficulty swallowing. Two recalled having had a fever at the time of the outbreak, the scientists reported. Public health efforts not entirely effective In combining the initial reports of 34 infections with the 14 newly identified cases, the researchers calculated the prevalence of minimally symptomatic infection in the village to have been 25 percent. Richardson said it is unknown if an asymptomatic individual is capable of transmitting the virus. Because these individuals did not have an active case of the disease,  They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhoea,  he said.  It s unclear if they can pass it along it sexually.  The virus has been shown to hide out for months in semen, even after symptoms have subsided, with some published cases of survivors transmitting the virus through sexual contact. Richardson said the study indicates that public health efforts to prevent infection and contain the virus during the epidemic were not entirely effective.  It reminds us that we need to do a much, much better job in future epidemics,  Richardson said. He and his colleagues are now working in other villages in Sierra Leone where public health surveillance was poor during the epidemic, testing and interviewing individuals to get a better handle on the true number of people affected during the crisis.  We expect to find a lot more undocumented survivors, so we can begin to answer the question of what was the true burden of disease,  he said.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/capsule-achieves-longterm-drug-delivery-189759,Capsule Achieves Long Term Drug Delivery Novel drug delivery method could aid in elimination of malaria and treatment of many other diseases  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at MIT and Brigham and Women s Hospital have developed a new drug capsule that remains in the stomach for up to two weeks after being swallowed, gradually releasing its drug payload. This type of drug delivery could replace inconvenient regimens that require repeated doses, which would help to overcome one of the major obstacles to treating and potentially eliminating diseases such as malaria. In a study described in the Nov. 16 issue of Science Translational Medicine, the researchers used this approach to deliver a drug called ivermectin, which they believe could aid in malaria elimination efforts. However, this approach could be applicable to many other diseases, says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.  Until now, oral drugs would almost never last for more than a day,  Langer says.  This really opens the door to ultra-long-lasting oral systems, which could have an effect on all kinds of diseases, such as Alzheimer s or mental health disorders. There are a lot of exciting things this could someday enable.  Langer and Giovanni Traverso, a research affiliate at the Koch Institute and a gastroenterologist and biomedical engineer at Brigham and Women s Hospital, are the senior authors of the paper. The paper s lead authors are former MIT postdoc Andrew Bellinger, MIT postdoc Mousa Jafari, and former MIT postdocs Tyler Grant and Shiyi Zhang. The team also includes researchers from Harvard University, Imperial College London, and the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Washington. The research has led to the launching of Lyndra, a Cambridge-based company that is developing the technology with a focus on diseases for which patients would benefit the most from sustained drug delivery, including neuropsychiatric disorders, HIV, diabetes, and epilepsy. Long-term delivery Drugs taken orally tend to work for a limited time because they pass rapidly through the body and are exposed to harsh environments in the stomach and intestines. Langer s lab has been working for several years to overcome this challenge, with an initial focus on malaria and ivermectin, which kills any mosquito that bites a person who is taking the drug. This can greatly reduce the transmission of malaria and other mosquito-borne illnesses. The team envisions that long-term delivery of ivermectin could help with malaria elimination campaigns based on mass drug administration   the treatment of an entire population, whether infected or not, in an area where a disease is common. In this scenario, ivermectin would be paired with the antimalaria drug artemisinin.  Getting patients to take medicine day after day after day is really challenging,  says Bellinger, now a cardiologist at Brigham and Women s Hospital and chief scientific officer at Lyndra.  If the medicine could be effective for a long period of time, you could radically improve the efficacy of your mass drug administration campaigns.  To achieve ultra-long-term delivery, drugs need to be packaged in a capsule that is stable enough to survive the harsh environment of the stomach and can release its contents over time. Once the drug is released, the capsule must break down and pass safely through the digestive tract. Working with those criteria in mind, the team designed a star-shaped structure with six arms that can be folded inward and encased in a smooth capsule. Drug molecules are loaded into the arms, which are made of a rigid polymer called polycaprolactone. Each arm is attached to a rubber-like core by a linker that is designed to eventually break down. After the capsule is swallowed, acid in the stomach dissolves the outer layer of the capsule, allowing the six arms to unfold. Once the star expands, it is large enough to stay in the stomach and resist the forces that would normally push an object further down the digestive tract. However, it is not large enough to cause any harmful blockage of the digestive tract.  When the star opens up inside the stomach, it stays inside the stomach for the duration that you need,  says Grant, now a product development engineer at Lyndra. In tests in pigs, the researchers confirmed that the drug is gradually released over two weeks. The linkers that join the arms to the core then dissolve, allowing the arms to break off. The pieces are small enough that they can pass harmlessly through the digestive tract.  This is a platform into which you can incorporate any drug,  Jafari says.  This can be used with any drug that requires frequent dosing. We can replace that dosing with a single administration.  This type of delivery could also help doctors to run better clinical trials by making it easier for patients to take the drugs, Zhang says.  It may help doctors and the pharma industry to better evaluate the efficacy of certain drugs, because currently a lot of patients in clinical trials have serious medication adherence problems that will mislead the clinical studies,  he says. Amplified effects The new study includes mathematical modeling done by researchers at Imperial College London and the Institute for Disease Modeling to predict the potential impact of this approach. The models suggest that if this technology were used to deliver ivermectin along with antimalaria treatments to 70 percent of a population in a mass drug administration campaign, disease transmission could be reduced the same amount as if 90 percent were treated with antimalaria treatments alone.  What we showed is that we stand to significantly amplify the effect of those campaigns,  Traverso says.  The introduction of this kind of system could have a substantial impact on the fight against malaria and transform clinical care in general by ensuring patients receive their medication.  Peter Agre, director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, who was not involved in the research, described the new approach as a  remarkable  advance that could improve treatment of malaria and any other disease that requires long-term treatment.  If you could reduce the frequency of dosing, and one treatment would continue to release medicine until the course is completed, that would be very beneficial,  Agre says.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/heart-atlas-196789,Heart Atlas Single cell sequencing gives new insights into how genetic activity in mouse heart cells changed over time  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.It s not simple, making a heart. In the womb, the organ begins as a tube, sprouts bead-like lumps, folds in on itself and eventually morphs into the more familiar-looking four-chambered structure. But exactly how heart cells follow their genetic programming to create an intricate, life-sustaining pump remains something of a mystery.  We would love to have a blueprint that tells us how the heart gets from start to finish,  says cardiology researcher Jonathan Seidman, the Henrietta B. and Frederick H. Bugher Foundation Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. Seidman and colleagues from HMS and beyond, including senior investigator Christine Seidman, the Thomas W. Smith Professor of Medicine at HMS, have just filled in that sketchy diagram a little more. The researchers sampled heart cells from seven different stages of embryonic development in mice. Using recent single-cell RNA sequencing techniques, they sorted the cells into three known categories myocardial, or heart-muscle, cells; endothelial cells that make blood vessels; and fibroblasts that hold everything together and watched how their genetic activity changed over time.  It s the first opportunity we ve had to look at a map of the heart with 100-cell resolution,  said Jon Seidman. The results, reported Nov. 10 in Developmental Cell, help clarify which cell types are present in various parts of the heart at each time period and uncover a previously unknown cell type. The researchers also describe errors in specific cell types in mice with a genetic mutation that causes congenital heart defects in humans.  The study provides both a temporal and spatial atlas that plots the development of the different cell populations in each of the four chambers,  Jon Seidman said.  The converse is also true: By looking at a cell s RNA expression, we can gather clues to its origins.  Mouse hearts, of course, are not human hearts. For instance, adult mouse hearts are 3,000 times smaller than ours and beat 10 times faster. However, many features are  remarkably conserved  between the two species, the authors say, including the organs  four-chambered structure, the electrical signals that direct muscle contraction and relaxation and the molecules that are involved in muscle function. This builds the team s confidence that their findings will ultimately inform knowledge of the human cardiovascular system. As the researchers catalogued both new and known genetic markers to identify cells from specific locations and developmental stages, they noticed that one group of cells unexpectedly displayed a blend of genes typically found in either myocardial cells or fibroblasts. The team is now investigating the role of these unusual cells in heart maturation. The ability to track individual cells and cell types in the developing heart should also help researchers study how gene mutations change the way each cell population matures, the authors said.  The hope is that now we re beginning to understand at a single-cell level how perturbations in genes and cells lead to changes in cardiac structure and clarify what the important steps are for how the heart is built,  said Seidman. Although chances are slim that the researchers  observations will lead to new therapeutic approaches anytime soon, Seidman said they do plan to investigate how particular defects that lead to congenital heart disease  actually cause the changes that pediatric cardiologists have been seeing for years.

The findings also come as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) postponed hearings which were due to explore glyphosate s link to cancer in humans. Last year, 17 leading global cancer experts from the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) sparked a firestorm when they classified glyphosate as a class 2A  probable human carcinogen . On the heels of the growing controversy surrounding glyphosate s safety, this unique testing project has so far found alarming levels of glyphosate in General Mills  Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios, Kellogg s Corn Flakes, Raisin Bran and Frosted Flakes and PepsiCo s Doritos Cool Ranch, Ritz Crackers and Stacy s Simply Naked Pita Chips, as well as other products at levels that present significant risks according to the latest independent peer-reviewed science on glyphosate.  Frankly, such a high level of glyphosate contamination found in Cheerios, Doritos, Oreos and Stacy s Pita Chips are alarming and should be a wake-up call for any parent trying to feed their children safe, healthy and non-toxic food,  said Dave Murphy, Executive Director of Food Democracy Now!, a grassroots advocacy organization based in Iowa with more than 650,000 members, that commissioned the new glyphosate residue food tests. Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project are now set to go much further by testing a huge range of off-the-shelf products to discover the full picture of glyphosate contamination in America s food supply. With the widespread increase in glyphosate use over the past 20 years and the fact that independent peer-reviewed science has confirmed that exposure to glyphosate at levels as low as 0.05 ppb can alter gene function in the livers and kidneys of rats fed a diet of glyphosate for two years, the American public should be concerned about glyphosate residues on their food. The latest independent peer-reviewed scientific evidence calls for a much lower allowable daily intake (ADI) to be set at 0.025 mg/ kg bodyweight per day or  12 times lower than the ADI  currently set in Europe and 70 times lower than the level currently allowed by the EPA in the U.S.  These results show that both the U.S. regulators and food companies have let down consumers in America. Independent science shows that glyphosate may be a hormone hacker at these real-life exposure levels found in the food products,  said Henry Rowlands, Director of The Detox Project, an international organization dedicated to testing our food and our bodies for toxic hormone hacking chemicals.  The safe level of glyphosate ingestion is simply unknown despite what the EPA and Monsanto would have everyone believe,  Rowlands concluded.  With increasing evidence from a growing number of independent peer-reviewed studies from around the world showing that the ingestion of glyphosate-based herbicides like Roundup can result in a wide range of chronic illnesses, it s urgent that regulators at the EPA reconsider the allowed levels of glyphosate in American s food and work to limit continued exposure to this pervasive chemical in as large a section of the human population as possible,  said Dr. Michael Antoniou, a molecular geneticist from London, UK reacting to the shocking food testing results released today. Glyphosate has never been studied by regulators or the chemical industry at levels that the human population in the U.S. is being exposed to (under 3 mg/kg body weight/day). This is a huge hole in the global risk assessment of glyphosate, as there is peer-reviewed scientific evidence that shows how low levels of the chemical may hack hormones even more than at mid and high levels   a higher dose does not necessarily make a more toxic, hormone disruptive effect.

Half of them die within five years, and the annual cost for health care, medications and missed work is $32 billion. Knowledge of the dysfunctional lipid signaling that triggers heart inflammation and heart failure could be essential to discovering therapeutic treatments for the millions of aging patients at risk of heart failure after heart attacks. The problem of heart failure is a nonresolving, overactive inflammation at the heart. After a tissue injury, such as death of muscle tissue in a heart attack, the body has a beneficial, early acute inflammation response that removes dead cells and begins repairs to the injured area. In healthy healing, the acute inflammation resolves, and a healing process follows. In healthy healing, particular lipids that the body produces from essential dietary fat appear to act as signals to resolve the early acute inflammation, including a group of lipids called resolvins. In contrast to such healthy healing, UAB researchers have found that a combination of age and excess omega-6 fatty acid in the mouse diet led to increased heart inflammation as compared to aged mice that ate a lower-fat, lab chow diet. Intriguingly, the typical Western diet is much higher in the ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids, similar to the excess omega-6 fatty acid diet given to the mice. The so-called Mediterranean-style diet, which has much less meat, has a much lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, and people who eat a Mediterranean-style diet are known to develop less heart disease. UAB researchers, led by Ganesh Halade, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, UAB Department of Medicine, report that four steps led to the nonresolving inflammation. The aged mice that were fed with excess omega-6 fatty acid, in contrast to lean aged mice, had: 1) lower amounts of three types of lipoxygenase enzymes in the dead area of the heart muscle, enzymes that can produce resolving signal lipids such as the resolvins from dietary omega-3 fatty acids; 2) lesser amounts of resolvins and several other lipid signals that help resolve acute inflammation; 3) increased amounts of macrophage immune cells that are pro-inflammatory; and 4) increased kidney injury and increased levels of two signaling cytokines that promote inflammation   tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1-beta. Thus, as Halade and colleagues report in the journal Aging, excess fatty acid intake magnifies chemokine signaling after a heart attack in aged mice, and this drives the signaling network between the heart and spleen and the heart and kidneys toward a nonresolving microenvironment. The excess omega-6 fatty acid for the mice came from enriching their diet with safflower oil. Techniques used to elucidate the dysregulated lipid signaling pathway in the aged mice included liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolipidomics to analyze lipid mediators and flow cytometry to analyze immune cells.

The study supports stevia's naturality and found all nine of the steviol glycoside molecules required by the specifications set by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), a committee jointly administered by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), were present and unchanged in the dried stevia leaf, through the commercial extraction and purification process and in the final stevia leaf extract product.  This research looked at three separate batches of stevia leaf that went through commercial production to final product, the 95 percent purity stevia leaf extract. The study samples were provided by PureCircle and each of the three, commercial batches included the dried stevia leaf, the first water extract and the final product from each of the three corresponding leaf samples. The research found that the stevia leaf extract end products were of 95 percent purity, which is required by JECFA. This is the first time a study has examined steviol glycosides from multiple commercial stevia leaf samples through different stages in the extraction and purification process, starting with the leaf and ending with the stevia sweetener end product.  This study used well-known analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with C18 and/or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) columns to separate, identify and quantify the individual steviol glycoside molecules.  ""Finding the same nine steviol glycoside molecules unchanged in the stevia leaf, the water extract and in the final product confirms that the commercial extraction and purification process of high purity stevia leaf extract does not alter the sweet steviol glycoside molecules in the leaf,"" said Dr. Ursula W lwer-Rieck, the scientist at the University of Bonn, Germany who conducted the stevia research. ""Showing that it is unchanged is important in this whole naturality debate because there are people who still call into question the naturality of high purity stevia leaf extract.""   Dr. W lwer-Rieck is a well-known stevia expert and a tenured academic Councilor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Bonn. She is also a board member of the European Stevia Association (EUSTAS) and a member of the Advisory Board of the Global Stevia Institute. As a food chemist, her academic research has focused on steviol glycosides and she has published papers on their analysis and stability in food.  ""For us, this study supports something that we have believed all along,"" said Dr. Priscilla Samuel, Director of the Global Stevia Institute. ""That the sweet molecules of high purity stevia leaf sweetener are the same sweet molecules in the leaf and have the ability to completely change the way we sweeten foods and beverages. So many people today want that zero-calorie sweetness from a natural source and this research supports its naturality from the leaves through the finished product.""

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/blood-tests-for-brain-cancer-189010,Blood Tests for Brain Cancer Neurosurgeon works to develop the first blood based test for patients with brain tumors  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. During his residency, Mass General neurosurgeon Brian Nahed, MD, MSC, became intrigued by the emerging promise of a blood-based test for cancer. To pursue it, he completed a post-doctoral fellowship in the lab of Daniel Haber, Director of the Mass General Cancer Center, and Shyamala Maheswaran, PhD, who had developed the first microfluidic device to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) shed from a tumor into the blood stream. The idea was of interest to Nahed because distinguishing brain tumor recurrence from changes that occur from radiation therapy can be difficult using modern imaging tools. Some patients must undergo a brain biopsy for a clear diagnosis. The ability to provide clinicians with a more definitive test to identify the recurrence of a tumor using a blood test rather than brain surgery had strong appeal. Yet the promise of this new technology was uncertain. Brain cancer rarely metastasizes outside of the brain and previous attempts by others had failed to find CTCs in brain tumor patients. The blood-brain barrier has been known to limit what comes in and out of the brain, so the idea of developing a blood-based diagnostic tool for brain cancer was seen by many as a non-starter.  It was a pretty high risk, high reward project,  says Nahed. The scales have recently begun to tip towards high reward, however. Nahed, along with co-principle investigator Shannon Stott, PhD, a bioengineer at the Center for Cancer Research at Mass General, have developed the first device that detects both glioblastoma CTCs and smaller tumor products called exosomes that contain information about the tumor and its genetic makeup in patients.  My hope is that our test will diagnose brain tumors, detect mutations, monitor for recurrence and differentiate it from normal reaction to treatment   all through a routine blood test,  says Nahed.  That s the reward.  Nahed s first task in realizing this vision was to show, unequivocally, that CTCs could be detected in glioblastoma patients. In an effort to capture as many CTCs as possible, Nahed devised a cocktail of five antibodies to select glioblastoma cells from other cells in the blood stream.  It was difficult because this is a really heterogeneous tumor and it s in the blood at low levels,  he says. Using the test, Nahed, Dr. James Sullivan, and his team successfully identified the first evidence of circulating tumor cells in the blood of patients with glioblastoma. They also performed molecular analysis of these cells, something that could previously be done only on brain tumor tissue samples. Nahed wanted the test to gather as much information from the blood as possible to make it even more clinically valuable. To help improve the test, Stott, a mechanical engineer by training, expanded the test to detect not only CTCs but also exosomes. Every cell in the body, including tumor cells, releases tiny packets of cellular material, presumably as some form of cell-to-cell communication. These packets contain proteins, DNA and other identifying information. Also, since their membranes are formed from a pinched off portion of the membrane of the cell that produced them, they can be picked out of the blood stream using the same external markers. Exosomes are a promising target for Nahed s and Stott s microfluidic device because they are tiny and may be more likely than tumor cells to flow across the blood-brain-barrier and into the blood stream.  The big thing we re trying to do with our technology is improve the cancer signal overall,  says Stott. They aim to use their test to monitor glioblastoma patients during treatment. At the time of diagnosis, an MRI clearly shows the glioblastoma. But after it has been removed surgically, the image becomes less definitive. The effects of treatment can cause the image to falsely suggest that the tumor has returned. To answer this definitively, Nahed may need to perform a surgical biopsy.  If patients can avoid a second operation and instead use blood to detect the things we need to detect, this will have all been worth it,  says Nahed. Nahed and Stott have begun enrolling patients to detect CTCs and exosomes using their blood test for glioblastoma. Patients who are being evaluated and treated for a brain tumor at Mass General can enroll in their research study and have their blood tested using the microfluidic device. They have been enrolling glioblastoma patients before surgery and intend to follow them as they progress through their care. They are also extending this study, with the support of a private donor, to begin testing children with gliomas.  We re over the moon because these patients have such small tumors that we can t get biopsies,  says Stott.  We re really excited to be doing something new for these children who are in desperate need for new diagnostic and treatment options.  Source: Story from Massachusetts General Hospital.

Using a pioneering technique developed at the Babraham Institute, the results are beginning to make biological sense of the mountains of genetic data linking very small changes in our DNA sequence to our risk of disease. Discovering these missing links will inform the design of new drugs and future treatments for a range of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and other types of autoimmune disease. Comparing the genome sequences of hundreds of thousands of patients and healthy volunteers has revealed single-letter changes found more frequently in the DNA sequences of individuals with specific diseases. In most cases, the disease-linked changes occur in the large swaths of DNA located between genes, often referred to as junk DNA. The fact that the changes are not in or near genes has made it challenging to understand how they could cause disease. Now, as reported in the leading journal Cell, the Promoter Capture Hi-C technique is being used to fill in the missing pieces by charting interactions between genes and sequences far away on the DNA thread. Understanding the genome's connections in 3DThe Promoter Capture Hi-C technique works by identifying parts of the genome that physically contact and regulate genes. The long thread of DNA is highly folded inside cells, allowing regions very far apart on the thread to contact each other directly. Dr Peter Fraser, Head of the BBSRC-funded Nuclear Dynamics research programme at the Babraham Institute which coordinated the study and a senior author on the paper, explained:  By identifying which parts of the genome connect with which genes we have discovered hundreds of thousands of regions that are necessary to switch genes on and off. Small changes to the DNA sequence of these distal regulatory regions can interfere with the normal control of genes, leading to a greater chance of developing a specific disease. The power of this approach is that it allows us to make biological sense of very tiny changes in the genome that have big impacts on health. By mapping the regions of the genome that interact with genes in 17 different blood cell types the researchers were able to create an  atlas  of contacts between genes and the remote regions that regulate them in each cell type. They then matched this information to known changes in DNA at these regions that are linked to specific diseases. This allowed them to uncover which genes are affected by these DNA changes, pointing to their roles in disease. The different blood cell types were obtained from blood samples donated by healthy volunteers of the NIHR Cambridge BioResource or by culture of blood stem cells in the laboratory of Dr Mattia Frontini, leader of the blood cell epigenome team at the University of Cambridge s Department of Haematology. Professor John Todd, Director of the JDRF/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory and founder and former principal investigator of the Cambridge BioResource said:  These results are a giant leap in understanding the inherited and cellular origins of common diseases and in how the human genome works.  The team found thousands of new genes linked to specific diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and Crohn s disease that are currently incurable and notoriously difficult to treat or prevent. This knowledge could enable new drugs to be designed targeting those genes, or repurposing of already existing drugs to treat these conditions. Dr Mikhail Spivakov, group leader in the Nuclear Dynamics research programme at the Babraham Institute and a senior author on the paper, said:  Mapping the genome s regulatory interactions establishes the missing link between a genetic change at one part of the genome with the gene it ultimately affects. While the results currently look promising, it will take many more years of work and rigorous testing before new treatments become available as a result of this fundamental research . As a large multi-partner study, this research was collaboratively undertaken by the Babraham Institute, the JDRF/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory in the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and the Departments of Medicine and Haematology at the University of Cambridge, the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute, the NHS Blood and Transplant organisation and the MRC Biostatistics Unit.

A diverse group of scientists have come together at the first sbv IMPROVER Datathon in order to do just that and explore new ways of collaborating across disciplines and approaching large datasets. The Datathon was a working session in which participants collaborated to turn datasets into scientific insight. Data was provided to teams who then developed research questions and preliminary findings. In advance of the event, the sbv IMPROVER team prepared protocols to explore the dataset, which enabled participants to access the data as well as to understand and design novel workflows which connect the data to analytics. Custom analytics modules (called  gadgets ) for data exploration, visualization and comparison, were built for the Datathon, enabled by an open connectivity platform technology called Garuda. This community-built open platform provides a unique framework to dynamically connect data with publicly available tools or participant developed algorithms. One month prior to the Datathon, participants were able to download data from a dedicated sbv IMPROVER webportal. The data comprised a range of  omics and functional measurements taken from a seven-month inhalation study of heated tobacco,1,2 supplemented with unpublished lung and blood DNA methylation data. Classical toxicological end points were assessed in the study together with additional transcriptomics, proteomics and lipidomics measurements, all generated through high-end profiling technologies and creating a substantial, rich and varied dataset. The Datathon attracted participation from computational biologists, bioinformaticians and data scientists specializing in predictive analytics, text analytics, data mining and statistical analysis. Drivers for participation included the depth and diversity of the dataset on offer, and the ability to explore that dataset within an open, transparent environment that facilitates innovation and discovery. Participants also had the opportunity to have their methodologies made available as gadgets on the platform.  The customized workflows based on an open platform technology have enabled Datathon participants to dive into the data from one of our most ambitious and comprehensive studies to date,  said Dr Nicolas Sierro, Manager Genomics, Biological Systems Research, Philip Morris International (PMI).  sbv IMPROVER is about driving open innovation in scientific discovery, facilitating transparent research frameworks, and enhancing dialogue within and between different scientific specialisms. The open platform has proved to be an innovative partner, helping us realize these goals.  Dr. Samik Ghosh, CTO, SBX Corporation, Tokyo, Japan, commented:  The Datathon has established an exciting new model for biological investigation. It provides a blue-print for the creation of verifiable workflows that are capable of dealing with the complexity and diversity of biomedical data, and ultimately the ability to turn this data into knowledge and understanding.  We are delighted that PMI chose the open platform based technology to empower the first sbv IMPROVER Datathon through our purpose-built gadgets, and also that the participants so clearly demonstrated the depth of the data and the ability to develop multi-modal analytics to verify and reproduce their study findings.  Garuda (www.garuda-alliance.org) is a community-built platform providing an open framework to connect, discover and navigate through different applications, databases and services in biology and medicine. Powered by language-independent Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), it can connect various software packages and combine them into bespoke  gadgets  customized for specific data analysis. sbv IMPROVER is a collaborative initiative, led and funded by PMI, which has run a series of open science challenges, projects and events since 2012. It aims to develop a robust methodology for verifying scientific methods and results in the context of industrial and academic research.

The trial was carried out by Lu You and his group, based at the Sichuan University in Chengdu. On 28 October, they delivered genetically edited immune cells to a single patient who is suffering with aggressive lung cancer. This patient, and others due to receive the same treatment soon, were selected as chemotherapy radiation therapy and other treatments have failed.  This development represents the latest in a series of firsts for Chinese researchers pioneering the use of CRISPR in biomedical research. Following on from the creation of the first CRISPR-edited human embryos in 2015 and the first CRISPR-edited monkeys in 2014.  The target The process begins with the extraction of T Cells from the blood of enrolled patients. CRISPR-Cas9 is then used to target and interfere with a specific gene in the cells that encodes a protein known as PD-1. These immune cells are then cultured to increase their number and then injected back into the patient.  PD-1 is of interest because it s normal function is to limit a cell s immune response; a function that cancers can take advantage of to proliferate, unchecked. The hope is that with this protein removed the edited cells will be able to attack and defeat the cancer.  So far, the results seem promising, and You has confirmed that the initial treatment went well.  PD-1 has previously been exploited as an effective target for the treatment of cancer. In the past, antibodies have been used to neutralize the protein and successfully put lung cancer in check. However, researchers believe that the use of CRISPR will allow them to knock out the gene for PD-1 with greater certainty, therefore improving the efficacy of the treatment. Timothy Chan, an immunotherapy expert from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, told Nature  It will be much more powerful than the antibodies. Competition  The introduction of CRISPR has sparked interest around the world and several similar trials have already been approved in the race to develop clinical applications as soon as possible. Carl June, who specialises in immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania, is acting as the scientific advisor for one such trial, due to start in the U.S in early 2017. Speaking to Nature he said  I think this is going to trigger  Sputnik 2.0  a biomedical duel on progress between China and the United States, which is important since competition usually improves the end -product .  At present, the U.S can be considered to be behind China in this area of research, which may reflect the contrast between China s broad enthusiasm for biotechnology and America s caution when developing such contentious technologies. Despite moving so fast, Lu You was keen to express that his research was not a leap of faith and that all possible safety precautions have been put in place.   As with any ground breaking research, the world must wait to see the full results of this trial and those scheduled for the new year, to decide whether the risks taken were worth it.

To achieve this goal, the hemodynamic response from a group of 31 healthy controls and 30 chronic TBI subjects were recorded as they performed a complexity task. Methods: To determine the optimum hemodynamic features, we considered 11 features and their combinations in characterizing TBI subjects. We investigated the significance of the features by utilizing a machine learning classification algorithm to score all the possible combinations of features according to their predictive power. Results & Conclusions: The identified optimum feature elements resulted in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. Classification improvement was achieved for TBI subject classification through feature combination. It signified the major advantage of the multivariate analysis over the commonly used univariate analysis suggesting that the features that are individually irrelevant in characterizing the data may become relevant when used in combination. We also conducted a spatio-temporal classification to identify regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that contribute in distinguishing between TBI and healthy subjects. As expected, Brodmann areas (BA) 10 within the PFC were isolated as the region that healthy subjects (unlike subjects with TBI), showed major hemodynamic activity in response to the High Complexity task. Overall, our results indicate that identified temporal and spatio-temporal features from PFC's hemodynamic activity are promising biomarkers in classifying subjects with TBI.

In the UK, 8.75 million people suffer osteoarthritis, which is associated with damage to their articular cartilage leading to a range of treatments including joint replacements. In regenerative medicine, scientists are exploring ways of growing cartilage-like material in the lab, which could replace damaged real cartilage. However, researchers have so far not been able to successfully mimic the complex structure of natural articular cartilage in the lab. Researchers in Professor Molly Stevens  group at Imperial College London have been growing cartilage-like material using cells seeded onto scaffolds made from a biologically compatible material.  Now, this team is using Raman spectroscopy, a form of biochemical analysis using the properties of light, to compare how close their engineered cartilage is to the real thing. This could ultimately help scientists to design improvements to enable it to act more like real cartilage, and make implants more functional for patients in the future. Raman spectroscopy involves using lasers to image the structural and chemical composition of samples at the molecular level. The team compared ten natural articular cartilage samples with eighteen engineered cartilage samples. They were able to accurately map human cartilage, and they compared it to the engineered cartilage at various stages while it is being grown in the lab. Raman spectroscopy also has other advantages over standard techniques such as histology - the study of tissue at the microscopic level. Histology requires more time to carry out an analysis, and is less accurate, compared to Raman spectroscopy. Dr Jean-Philippe St-Pierre, co-author of the study from the Department of Materials at Imperial College London, said:  Using Raman spectroscopy is like taking a complex chemical photo of a sample. It means we can analyse a sample and get a deep understanding of its makeup. This approach has great potential in regenerative medicine because it means we can learn more about real tissue like cartilage and compare it to our engineered samples. Ultimately, we want to create the perfect conditions in the lab to enable us to engineer more life-like implants.  In the study, the team s use of Raman spectroscopy gave in-depth insights into human articular cartilage. Articular cartilage has previously been classified as having three distinct zones, but the team were able to image at least six different layers using Raman spectroscopy. They mapped the distribution throughout the layers of the three main components in human cartilage: water, a group of sugars called glycosaminoglycan, and collagen. They were also able to image how the collagen fibres were orientated, which is important for understanding cartilage s mechanical properties. In the engineered cartilage, they used Raman spectroscopy to determine at very high resolutions the chemical composition of each engineered sample. They looked at important indicators during the growth of the engineered cartilage samples such as the amount of collagen and water compared to the real samples, which indicate how closely it mimics real cartilage. The next step will see the team using Raman spectroscopy to systematically evaluate the conditions in the lab that can influence the growth of articular cartilage. This will lead them to identifying the settings that improve conditions for engineering tissue so that it more accurately mimics the structure of real cartilage.

The new discovery advances efforts to find new and effective treatments for heart failure. Heart failure afflicts 5.7 million Americans, costs the country $30.7 billion every year, and has no cures. When heart muscle is damaged, the body is unable to repair the dead or injured cells. Gladstone scientists are exploring cellular reprogramming turning one type of adult cell into another in the heart as a way to regenerate muscle cells in the hopes of treating, and ultimately curing, heart failure. It takes only three transcription factors proteins that turn genes on or off in a cell to reprogram connective tissue cells into heart muscle cells in a mouse. After a heart attack, connective tissue forms scar tissue at the site of the injury, contributing to heart failure. The three factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT), work together to turn heart genes on in these cells and turn other genes off, effectively regenerating a damaged heart with its own cells. But the method is not foolproof typically, only ten percent of cells fully convert from scar tissue to muscle. In the new study, published in Circulation, Gladstone scientists tested 5500 chemicals to try to improve this process. They identified two chemicals that increased the number of heart cells created by eightfold. Moreover, the chemicals sped up the process of cell conversion, achieving in one week what used to take six to eight weeks.  While our original process for direct cardiac reprogramming with GMT has been promising, it could be more efficient,  said senior author Deepak Srivastava, MD, director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease.  With our screen, we discovered that chemically inhibiting two biological pathways active in embryonic formation improves the speed, quantity, and quality of the heart cells produced from our original process.  The first chemical inhibits a growth factor that helps cells grow and divide and is important for repairing tissue after injury. The second chemical inhibits an important pathway that regulates heart development. By combining the two chemicals with GMT, the researchers successfully regenerated heart muscle and greatly improved heart function in mice that had suffered a heart attack. The scientists also used the chemicals to improve direct cardiac reprogramming of human cells, which is a more complicated process that requires additional factors. The two chemicals enabled the researchers to simplify the process bringing them one step closer to better treatments for heart failure.  Heart failure afflicts many people worldwide, and we still do not have an effective treatment for patients suffering from this disease,  said Tamer Mohamed, PhD, first author on the study and a former postdoctoral scholar at Gladstone.  With our enhanced method of direct cardiac reprogramming, we hope to combine gene therapy with drugs to create better treatments for patients suffering from this devastating disease.

See Also: New gene variants present in 3 percent of all ALS patientsPublished in The Journal of Neuroscience, the research team, led by Gregorio Valdez, an assistant professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute and in the Department of Biological Sciences at Virginia Tech, describes a growth factor called FGFBP1, which is secreted by muscle fibers and maintains neuromuscular junctions a critical type of synapse that allows the spinal cord to communicate with muscles, sending signals from the central nervous system to create movements. ALS strikes approximately 6,000 people in the U.S. each year, according to the ALS Association.

This is the first study to investigate the association between age at last pregnancy, which can be a marker of a later surge of pregnancy-related hormones, and cognitive function in later life, said Roksana Karim, lead author of the study and assistant professor of clinical preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the Univerity of Southern California (USC). See Also: Prenatal stress could enhance protective mechanisms of babies ""Based on the findings, we would certainly not recommend that women wait until they're 35 to close their family, but the study provides strong evidence that there is a positive association between later age at last pregnancy and late-life cognition."" Postmenopausal women who had their last pregnancy after 35 had better verbal memory. Those who had their first pregnancy when they were 24 or older had significantly better executive function, which includes attention control, working memory, reasoning and problem solving. The main hormones at play are estrogen and progesterone. In animal studies, estrogen has a beneficial impact on brain chemistry, function and structure; progesterone is linked with growth and development of brain tissue, Karim said. The study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, includes 830 women who, on average, were 60 years old. The data was adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, income, and education. Participants were given a series of tests that included assessments of verbal memory (remembering a list of words or retelling a story after some distraction), psychomotor speed, attention and concentration, planning, visual perception, and memory. Learn More: DHA during pregnancy does not appear to improve cognitive outcomes for children Previous research has shown that many women experience brainpower and memory declines in their postmenopausal years. An outpouring of estrogen and progesterone, especially in later life, appears to be beneficial, Karim said. The study found that other reproductive events were also important to later life cognition. More time between first and last period longer reproductive life proved valuable for executive function. ""Starting your period early means you have higher levels of the female sex hormone being produced by the ovaries,"" Karim said. ""Girls are receiving the optimal levels early, so it's possible that their brain structures are better developed compared to those who are exposed to estrogen levels associated with menstrual cycles at a later age."" Use of the pill or other hormonal contraceptives for at least 10 years was beneficial for verbal memory and critical thinking ability. ""Oral contraceptives maintain and sustain a stable level of sex hormones in our blood stream,"" Karim said. ""Stable is good."" Women who didn't carry their pregnancy to term and those who gave birth to two children had better overall cognitive ability, verbal memory and executive function when compared to women who had only one full-term pregnancy.

Human error can include when to begin and finish timing a standardized intelligence test, how closely a clinician monitors the subject and interpretations of activity. Research has shown that adults including experimenters are biased toward subjects who appear intelligent, giving them a benefit of the doubt over subjects who appear less so. ""Testing has always been standardized, but this is more fine-tuned and more accurate,"" Short said.

""This way, I can get to the skill problem: they can't rotate the block, or can't invert the block."" The blocks can then be used to train the children or adults to use the blocks in certain ways, to try to address the skill problem.

Under the terms of the agreements, Horizon will provide HDx Reference Standards for novel Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay development, clinical trials, and ultimately for inclusion as in-kit controls under Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreements.   Under these agreements, Horizon will support the development of new NGS diagnostic assays that, upon approval by the Chinese FDA, will be used to identify which patients would benefit from receiving novel targeted therapies to treat solid and liquid tumours.  The developers will initially pay Horizon for Reference Standards for use as quality controls in their assay development and clinical trial programmes, with typical revenues expected from each programme in the mid- to high five figure (sterling) range.  Assays in China are under obligation by the Chinese FDA not to make any changes in the format of the test for a period of five years from approval, and so Horizon is in discussions with each developer to provide Reference Standards as in-kit controls for a minimum of five years post-clearance. Cleared assays under such agreements would provide Horizon with expected revenues in the six figure (sterling) range per annum. Each developer is anticipated to develop three to four assays per year over the next several years with Horizon providing Reference Standards for each. The first assays are anticipated by partners to be approved in 2018. Based on this initial work, Horizon is now being approached for additional partnerships with the estimated 20-30 other players in a market which is among the fastest growing in the world, with strong double digit growth rates expected to reach US$ 10 Billion by 20211.

The primary goal of the funding and partnership initiative will be to accelerate breeding and development of new corn hybrids utilizing CropOS , a cognitive engine that uses cloud biology to empower a new era of plant genomics innovation, subsequently introducing new choices for growers in the U.S. corn marketplace. In an era of unprecedented agriculture industry consolidation, innovation in corn genetics is being further limited to a few large companies with budgets for significant R&D investment. Benson Hill s CropOS platform empowers organizations of any size to innovate and provide growers choice, whether that be for disease, maturity or specific environmental requirements. With a handful of companies owning roughly 85 percent of the corn market, there is limited incentive to address more geographic-specific needs; Benson Hill s CropOS opens up new research opportunities. The financial and broader support of NCGA underscores our opportunity to empower innovation and help level the playing field for those seeking to develop high performing varieties, even on a local or regional level,  said Benson Hill Co-Founder and CEO Matthew Crisp.  The more responsive and competitive the industry is, the better equipped growers will be to sustainably meet demand for increasingly diverse solutions that benefit farms, communities, consumers and our society. CropOS s ability to remove barriers to innovation directly aligns with NCGA s mission to  create and increase opportunities for corn growers.  This association represents more than 40,000 dues-paying corn farmers nationwide and the interests of more than 300,000 growers who contribute through corn checkoff programs.  Our members are telling us loud and clear that they need more choices in the corn marketplace,  said Larry Hoffmann, a leading grower and Chairman of NCGA s Corn Productivity & Quality Action Team.  We believe that the CropOS platform offers a fresh approach to leverage big data and technology and foster a more competitive industry. Our partnership heralds an exciting new era of opportunity for our members to access better hybrids from a more diversified market.  CropOS combines vast amounts of genomic data and expert biological knowledge from public and private sources to pinpoint which plants will produce desired traits and improved performance prior to ever being planted in the field. CropOS provides decision support in breeding programs, allowing researchers to bypass multiple generations of experimentation. The CropOS cognitive engine uses machine learning to grow smarter and more predictive with every experiment and data set. With each additional breeder that takes advantage of the analytical power and machine learning of CropOS, progress in corn breeding has the potential to accelerate significantly, making the industry more responsive to the needs of growers.

The technique, which the team showed was able to partially restore visual responses in blind rodents, will open new avenues for basic research and a variety of treatments, such as for retinal, heart and neurological diseases.  We are very excited by the technology we discovered because it s something that could not be done before,  says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in Salk s Gene Expression Laboratory and senior author of the paper published on November 16, 2016 in Nature.  For the first time, we can enter into cells that do not divide and modify the DNA at will. The possible applications of this discovery are vast.  Until now, techniques that modify DNA such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system have been most effective in dividing cells, such as those in skin or the gut, using the cells  normal copying mechanisms. The new Salk technology is ten times more efficient than other methods at incorporating new DNA into cultures of dividing cells, making it a promising tool for both research and medicine. But, more importantly, the Salk technique represents the first time scientists have managed to insert a new gene into a precise DNA location in adult cells that no longer divide, such as those of the eye, brain, pancreas or heart, offering new possibilities for therapeutic applications in these cells. To achieve this, the Salk researchers targeted a DNA-repair cellular pathway called NHEJ (for  non-homologous end-joining ), which repairs routine DNA breaks by rejoining the original strand ends. They paired this process with existing gene-editing technology to successfully place new DNA into a precise location in non-dividing cells.  Using this NHEJ pathway to insert entirely new DNA is revolutionary for editing the genome in live adult organisms,  says Keiichiro Suzuki, a senior research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab and one of the paper s lead authors.  No one has done this before. Pictured above is a part of the adult mouse brain. Cell nuclei are blue and genome-edited neurons are green. First, the Salk team worked on optimizing the NHEJ machinery for use with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which allows DNA to be inserted at very precise locations within the genome. The team created a custom insertion package made up of a nucleic acid cocktail, which they call HITI, or homology-independent targeted integration. Then they used an inert virus to deliver HITI s package of genetic instructions to neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells.  That was the first indication that HITI might work in non-dividing cells,  says Jun Wu, staff scientist and co-lead author. With that feat under their belts, the team then successfully delivered the construct to the brains of adult mice. Finally, to explore the possibility of using HITI for gene-replacement therapy, the team tested the technique on a rat model for retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited retinal degeneration condition that causes blindness in humans. This time, the team used HITI to deliver to the eyes of 3-week-old rats a functional copy of Mertk, one of the genes that is damaged in retinitis pigmentosa. Analysis performed when the rats were 8 weeks old showed that the animals were able to respond to light, and passed several tests indicating healing in their retinal cells.  We were able to improve the vision of these blind rats,  says co-lead author Reyna Hernandez-Benitez, a Salk research associate.  This early success suggests that this technology is very promising.  The team s next steps will be to improve the delivery efficiency of the HITI construct. As with all genome editing technologies, getting enough cells to incorporate the new DNA is a challenge. The beauty of HITI technology is that it is adaptable to any targeted genome engineering system, not just CRISPR-Cas9. Thus, as the safety and efficiency of these systems improve, so too will the usefulness of HITI.  We now have a technology that allows us to modify the DNA of non-dividing cells, to fix broken genes in the brain, heart and liver,  says Izpisua Belmonte.  It allows us for the first time to be able to dream of curing diseases that we couldn t before, which is exciting.  Source: Story from The Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

The agreement covers all potential opportunities for combining daratumumab and carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with cancer. Janssen licensed daratumumab from Genmab A/S and is responsible for all global development, marketing and manufacturing.1 Carfilzomib is developed and commercialized by Amgen. The first study under this collaboration agreement will focus on a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, registration study to determine if daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib (56 mg/m2 twice weekly) and dexamethasone improves progression-free survival (PFS), compared to carfilzomib and dexamethasone alone, in patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. The study is anticipated to start dosing patients in 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, the trial will be sponsored by Amgen. Financial terms have not been disclosed. As part of an earlier collaboration agreement, a separate, ongoing study is evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of this combination regimen, in addition to a second regimen of daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib (70 mg once weekly), lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. This research will build on clinical findings from the Phase 3 POLLUX and CASTOR clinical studies evaluating daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and bortezomib and dexamethasone, respectively, in patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Findings from the POLLUX trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, with an accompanying editorial, in October 2016, and findings from the CASTOR trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in August 2016.  We are delighted to partner with Amgen to continue to explore the potential role of daratumumab in combination with novel treatment regimens, especially now that we have results from the Phase 3 POLLUX and CASTOR studies,  said Peter F. Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Oncology Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC.  This collaboration reflects our shared vision to better meet the needs of patients with multiple myeloma who are still in need of new therapeutic options.  DARZALEX is the first CD38-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma. It was first approved by the FDA in November 2015 as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double refractory to a PI and immunomodulatory agent.2 This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.3 DARZALEX is also approved in Europe and Canada for a similar patient population. KYPROLIS is a PI approved in the U.S. and Canada as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy and in combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy. In August 2016, Janssen submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide (an immunomodulatory agent) and dexamethasone, or bortezomib (a PI) and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.4 Daratumumab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for this indication in July 2016.5 Source: Story from Janssen Biotech Inc.

In a recent study, young adults with ADHD, when performing a continuous motor task, had more difficulty inhibiting a motor response compared to young adults who did not have ADHD. The participants with ADHD also produced more force during the task compared to participants without ADHD. See Also: Inside the adult ADHD brainAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that can continue to affect up to 65 percent of these children as they become adults, according to the researchers. ""A large group of individuals have the label 'ADHD,' but present with different symptoms,"" said Kristina A. Neely, assistant professor, kinesiology. ""One of the goals of our ADHD research is to discover unique physiological signals that may characterize different subgroups of the disorder."" Previous studies have shown that some individuals with ADHD may have poor control of their motor systems, but until recently, the way that it was measured was not very sensitive. ""In previous tasks, motor and cognitive function was evaluated with a key-press response: You hit the button or you didn't,"" said Neely. ""We measure precisely how much force an individual is producing during a continuous motor task. This type of task provides us with more information than the dichotomous 'yes/no' response."" Learn More: The higher the elevation, the lower the rate of ADHD: Utah study links rates of ADHD to altitude In a recent study using a continuous motor task, participants produced force with their index finger and thumb in response to cues on a visual display. Participants were instructed to produce force when the visual cue was any color except blue. In the ""blue"" trials, participants were told to withhold force production. Neely and colleagues found that participants with ADHD symptoms produced more force on trials when they were told to withhold a response, compared to those without ADHD. Further, the amount of force that was produced during these trials was correlated with specific ADHD-related symptoms. The researchers presented their findings at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting November 12-16 in San Diego, California. ""The use of a precise and continuous motor task provides a more nuanced understanding of inhibitory control, compared to a button-press task,"" said Neely. ""We found that young adults with ADHD produced more force on the 'blue' trials compared to young adults without ADHD. And the amount of force produced was related to self-report of ADHD-related symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.

The fluorescent dye technique, originally developed by surgeons at the Penn Center for Precision Surgery to treat lung cancer, illuminated brain tumors in real-time during surgery, helping physicians distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissue. Each year, over 15,000 people in the United States undergo surgeries to remove brain tumors. See Also: Laser-based imaging tool could increase accuracy, safety of brain tumor surgery Findings from the pilot study, led by first author John Y.K. Lee, MD, MSCE, an associate professor of Neurosurgery in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and co-director of the Center for Precision Surgery, are reported in Neurosurgery. A big challenge with brain surgery is ensuring the entire tumor is removed. It is difficult to identify the margins of the tumor with current approaches. Cancer tissue not visible to the naked eye or felt by fingers is often missed during tumor removal, leading to recurrence in some patients - about 20 to 50 percent. Penn's approach, which relies on an injectable dye that accumulates in cancerous tissues more so than normal tissues, may help change that. ""Fluorescent contrast agents take visualization to a whole new level,"" Lee said. ""It has the potential for real-time imaging, identification of disease, and most importantly, precise detection of the tumor's margins. With this, we know better where to cut."" The study also includes co-author, Sunil Singhal, MD, an associate professor of Surgery, and co-director the Center for Precision Surgery at Penn's Abramson Cancer Center, who first started work on this approach in his lab nearly 10 years ago. Learn More: Tool helps guide brain cancer surgery The technique uses near-infrared, or NIR, imaging and the contrasting agent indocyanine green (ICG), which fluoresces a bright green under NIR light. ICG was developed during World War II as a dye in photography and, in 1958, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in medicine, primarily in liver diagnostics and later in cardiology. However, for this study, researchers used a modified version of ICG at a higher concentration delivered intravenously about 24 hours before surgery to ensure margins were included. This is the first time, to the authors knowledge, that this delayed imaging of ICG has been used to visualize brain tumors. Patients enrolled in the clinical study were between the ages of 20 and 81 with a diagnosis of a solitary brain tumor and a presumed glioma based on imaging or prior surgery or biopsy. Twelve of the 15 tumors demonstrated strong intraoperative fluorescence. The lack of glow in the three remaining tumors could potentially be due to their disease grade and timing of the injection, the authors suggested. Eight of the 15 patients demonstrated a visible glow through the dura, a thick membrane on the meninges of the brain, was opened, demonstrating the technology's ability to see deeply within the brain before the tumor is exposed. Once opened, all tumors were picked up by NIR imaging. The researchers also studied the surgical margins using neuropathology and magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI) to assess the accuracy and precision of NIR fluorescence in identifying tumor tissue. Of the 71 specimens collected from MRI-enhanced tumors and their surgical margins, 61 (85.9 percent) fluoresced and 51 of these (71.8 percent) were classified as glioma tissue Of the 12 MRI-enhancing gliomas, four patients had biopsy specimens that were both non-fluorescent and negative for tumor, which matched the gross total resection seen on their MRI. In contrast, 8 patients had residual fluorescent signal in the resection cavity. Only 3 of these patients showed gross total resection on MRI. This suggests a benefit of true-negative NIR signal after resection, the authors said. Read Next: Modeling and simulation help optimize chemotherapy to combat brain tumorOver the past three plus years, Singhal, Lee, and their colleagues have performed more than 300 surgeries with the imaging tool in patients with various types of cancer, including lung, brain, bladder and breast.

Other studies have associated deficits in odor identification with established Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and with greater rates of cognitive decline, but the most commonly used test of olfactory ability the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test has a number of limitations and does not take into account the great variation in olfactory ability among healthy individuals. Don't Miss: Can autism be measured in a sniff?The battery of four tests developed by the MGH team addresses both olfactory and cognitive functions: The study recruited 183 participants, most of whom were enrolled in ongoing studies at the MGH-based Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. At the time of the olfactory testing, 70 were cognitively normal, 74 tested normal on cognitive tests but were personally concerned about their cognitive abilities, 29 had mild cognitive impairment and 10 had been diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease. As part of the studies they were enrolled in, all of them had comprehensive medical and neurological examinations including annual tests of their memory and cognitive abilities and several had brain imaging studies of Alzheimer's-associated factors. Learn More: Why you smell better with your nose than with your mouthResults of the OPID-20 test significantly differentiated among the four groups of participants, and those results correlated with the thinning of two brain regions the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex previously associated with Alzheimer's risk. Participants' ability to remember a previously presented aroma, as reflected in the POEM score, also showed significant differences between the two cognitively normal groups and participants with Alzheimer's disease, whose results were no better than chance. Because the ability of normal individuals to recognize and discriminate between odors can vary by as much as 40 times, the POEM scores of the two cognitively normal groups were compared with what would have been predicted based on their ability to identify and differentiate between odors, as reflected in the OAS and OD tests. That comparison determined whether each individual was a good or poor POEM performer, and poor POEM performers were more likely to have the variant of the APOE gene associated with increased Alzheimer's risk. While results of an annual test of short-term memory improved year-to-year for the good POEM performers, no such improvement was seen among the poor performers, who also showed thinning of the entorhinal cortex.

To do this, they developed a computer program that could differentiate between amino acid sequences that can kill bacteria and those that cannot. However, along the way, the researchers also discovered that the program started to recognize features of peptides that could alter the shape of membranes. This shape-altering feature helps peptides travel through the membrane and into the cell, making it possible for the peptides to carry and deliver medicines directly into diseased cells. Using a screening method, researchers not only found new peptides that had this property, but they also discovered that many known human proteins, longer chains of amino acids, also had this ability, even though membrane-crossing is not their primary known function. This discovery, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has a wide range of applications in biomedicine, such as combatting infections and delivering drugs directly into cells. The UCLA researchers, led by Gerard Wong, a professor of bioengineering, spearheaded the experimental work, while the computational tools were developed in collaboration with Andrew Ferguson, a professor of materials science and engineering at Illinois.  Using machine learning, we developed a computer program that can differentiate between a peptide sequence that is antimicrobial and one that isn t antimicrobial,  said Wong, the co-senior author of the project and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA.  During this process, we serendipitously discovered a way to differentiate between peptides that permeate membranes and peptides that don t.  They studied a class of well-known peptides called antimicrobial peptides, which are proteins that help the immune system by killing bacteria primarily by permeating the membrane. During their experiments, the researchers found that the program, originally created to recognize anti-microbial peptides, was simultaneously finding peptides that generate saddle-shaped curvature on the cell membrane. This curvature is much more conducive to allowing a puncture through the membrane into the cell. Using this new tool, the researchers performed a search of possible peptide sequences to find new membrane-active peptides that do not occur naturally, but can be created chemically.  Not only are we able to design better antimicrobials to combat drug-resistant infections, we can also design peptides to deliver medicines or other cargo into cells, understand how viruses and bacteria bypass membranes, and uncover membrane activity in proteins that previously have not been characterized to have membrane activity,  said Ernest Lee, the paper s lead author and a student in the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/injectable-biologic-therapy-reduces-triglycerides-198253,Injectable Biologic Therapy Reduces Triglycerides  Study finds first of its kind therapy promising for patients with high triglycerides  cholesterol  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. When an adult gets an annual physical, physicians commonly check the levels of fat cells, known as triglycerides, in their blood stream. Triglycerides are a type of fat, or lipid, which are consumed when you eat, and are normally stored in fat tissue to be used later as an energy source. However, some people accumulate fat in the blood that should otherwise be stored in the fat tissue, causing high triglycerides. Extremely high triglycerides can lead to inflammation of the pancreas   pancreatitis   and moderate elevations are associated with higher risk for heart disease such as atherosclerosis.  At the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2016, Richard Dunbar, MD, an assistant professor of Translational Medicine and Medical Genetics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, will present early data from a study which evaluated the use of a new injectable biologic drug therapy for reducing triglyceride levels.   In this study, we tested a new approach for lowering triglycerides using an injectable drug that inhibits a specific protein which enables high triglycerides   Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3).  As expected, suppressing AngPTL3 resulted in a profound drop in triglyceride levels, as compared to a placebo,  said Dunbar.  Encouragingly, the kinds of drops we saw appear to push beyond the boundaries of what is usually experienced with current oral medications.  Researchers conducted this phase I, first-in-human, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to test the safety and efficacy of the injectable biologic drug, Evinacumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody specifically engineered to inhibit ANGPTL3. Results from 41 participants, 32 of whom received Evinacumab and nine the placebo, showed the biologic therapy was well-tolerated by participants with only mild adverse events being reported, including headaches in seven participants. Triglyceride levels were monitored for at least five months following the injection, with the maximum reduction seen on day four. Six doses were tested, and in the top three dose-groups, triglycerides were lowered by 64 to 73 percent.   Current medications such as fibrates or prescription fish oils effectively lower triglycerides, but leave much to be desired, each only lowering levels by 20 to 50 percent,  Dunbar said.  Validating a drug that lowers triglycerides well beyond that range would undoubtedly take us to the next level, particularly since it could be combined with current oral medications for those patients with extraordinarily high triglycerides who often can t achieve safe levels with our usual medications. A similar approach has been taken for lowering certain cholesterol with the advent of PCSK9 inhibitors, which utilize a similar monoclonal antibody mechanism.  Dose-dependent reductions in cholesterol were also observed, most notably cholesterol from low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which is thought to contribute significantly to atherosclerosis   plaque buildup and the narrowing of the heart s arteries. Curiously, the drug also lowered cholesterol from high-density lipoproteins (HDL)   the  good  cholesterol   consistent with the drug s mechanism targeting the AngPTL3 protein.  Though the preliminary results give us a lot of hope that we could significantly improve triglyceride management, there is still a lot of work to be done to validate this approach,  Dunbar said.  If all goes well and if this therapy makes it into clinical practice, the implications of this research are twofold. In the short term, profoundly lowering triglycerides may render hospital admissions less frequent in patients prone to pancreatitis, while long term, lowering triglycerides and associated cholesterol could also help reduce the risk of certain heart disease.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/tissueengineered-arteries-for-transplant-212123,Tissue Engineered Arteries for Transplant The Morgridge Institute for Research and the University of Wisconsin Madison will work towards creating artery  banks  available for cardiovascular surgery  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The prospect of creating artery  banks  available for cardiovascular surgery, bypassing the need to harvest vessels from the patient, could transform treatment of many common heart and vascular ailments. But it s a big leap from concept to reality. The Morgridge Institute for Research and the University of Wisconsin Madison will address both the engineering and biomedical hurdles in this process through a five year, $8 million project funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Patients needing bypass surgeries would benefit from a better source for arteries, says project leader James Thomson, a stem cell research pioneer and director of regenerative biology at Morgridge. Replacement tissue currently comes from another part of the patient s body, and suitable tissue can t be found for many patients. Current synthetic alternatives also fail at a high rate. Diseases of blood vessels   including coronary artery disease   kill more people worldwide than any other single cause.  Tissue engineering for blood vessels is a pretty mature field,  says Thomson.  But there are still two major problems: One is the time it takes to make the vessels, and the other is the source of the cells to grow them.  For example, taking induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells from an individual patient, growing the relevant cells and assembling them into an artery would overcome the problem of transplant rejection, Thomson says. However, it would be cost-prohibitive and take months to complete   too long to be clinically useful to a patient. The promising alternative is to create tissue with cells banked from a unique population of people who are genetically compatible donors, based on rare alleles that circumvent rejection. Alleles are gene pairings that control certain characteristics, such as blood type. It has been estimated that about 100 different cell lines from this rare population would be enough to cover a majority of the U.S. population. The Morgridge and UW Madison effort covers four phases and addresses key questions about the feasibility of this approach. The model for the project is designed around treating critical limb ischemia, a debilitating condition that restricts blood flow to limbs and often leads to amputation or death. The Thomson group is working to create the optimal cellular building blocks of the artery   endothelial and smooth muscle cells   that will be most suitable for transplantation and continue to grow and remodel in the patient. In tandem, a team led by UW Madison engineer Tom Turng will develop scaffolds from natural and synthetic materials to provide structure and shape for the artery. UW Madison engineer Naomi Chesler will build a bioreactor that provides an environment in which the arterial cells can grow around the scaffolding. The transplant surgery and resulting immune response will then be tested using a monkey limb ischemia model at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center. Having a primate model is important to produce results more relevant to human health than those from mice or other short-lived animals. Pathology and laboratory medicine Professor Igor Slukvin is leading the primate center effort. Finally, the UW Madison Waisman Biomanufacturing facility will lead the production of arterial cells that meet FDA standards for human clinical trials, paving the way for potential treatments for limb ischemia in humans. If the entire process works, Thomson estimates that potential human therapies remain about 10 years away.  This is a collaboration that really highlights what the Morgridge Institute does well because we are able to bring together multiple investigators from different departments and centers around campus,  Thomson says.  We have an unusual combination of resources in Madison to be able to pull this off.  The heart of the partnership to date has been between Thomson s team and the BIONATES program in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, led by Turng. Both labs operate on the same floor of the Discovery Building, and the three-year collaboration is a prime example of how the public and private institutes work together to foster innovation. As Turng works to determine the optimal choice of materials and methods for construction of the blood vessel scaffolds   biopolymers versus synthetic polymers, or a combination of both   the partnership inside the Discovery Building is vital to progress.  We have direct feedback with Thomson and the other researchers, and the iterative process can be facilitated,  says Turng.  We can speak the same language.  Providing proof of concept on the blood vessel work should benefit other forms of stem cell therapy, Thomson says.  This has implications beyond making vessels for transplantation. It s sort of the stepping stone to more advanced tissue engineering,  he says.  Any form of cellular transplant therapy is going to need a blood supply, and we need to learn how to engineer that blood supply to work with more complex tissues.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gut-bacteria-control-glucose-metabolism-196618,Gut Bacteria Control Glucose Metabolism  Researchers have uncovered a link between the immune system  gut bacteria and glucose metabolism  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at Oregon State University and other institutions have discovered an important link between the immune system, gut bacteria and glucose metabolism   a  cross-talk  and interaction that can lead to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome when not functioning correctly. The findings, published in Nature Communications, are one example of how different mammalian systems can affect each other in ways not previously understood. A better understanding of these systems, researchers say, may lead to new probiotic approaches to diabetes and other diseases. The research also shows the general importance of proper bacterial functions in the gut and the role of one bacteria in particular   Akkermansia muciniphila -  in helping to regulate glucose metabolism. This bacteria s function is so important, scientists say, that it has been conserved through millions of years of evolution to perform a similar function in both mice and humans.  We re discovering that in biology there are multiple connections and communications, what we call cross-talk, that are very important in ways we re just beginning to understand,  said Dr. Natalia Shulzhenko, an assistant professor in the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine, and one of the corresponding authors on this study.  It s being made clear by a number of studies that our immune system, in particular, is closely linked to other metabolic functions in ways we never realized. This is still unconventional thinking, and it s being described as a new field called immunometabolism. Through the process of evolution, mammals, including humans, have developed functional systems that communicate with each other, and microbes are an essential part of that process.  It had been previously observed that an immune mediator - one type of interferon, or signaling protein called IFN-y   can affect the proper function of glucose metabolism. IFN-y helps fight several pathogens and infections, but a decrease in its levels can lead to improvement in glucose metabolism. However, this actual process has not been understood.  Before this, no one had a clue exactly how IFN-y affected glucose tolerance,  said Andrey Morgun, an assistant professor in the OSU College of Pharmacy and also a corresponding author on the study.  The involvement of microbes had not really been considered. But with the help of a statistical model and an approach we call a transkingdom network, we were able to pinpoint some likely bacterial candidates.  The bacteria A. muciniphila, was found to play a critical role in this communication process   in their study, the scientists called it a  missing link.  Research showed that mice specially bred with reduced levels of IFN-y had higher levels of A. muciniphila, and significantly improved glucose tolerance. When IFN-y levels increased, A. muciniphila levels declined, and glucose tolerance was reduced. Similar observations were also made in humans. It s been observed, for instance, that athletes who are extremely fit have high levels of the gut bacteria A. muciniphila, which is a mucus-degrading bacteria. The research makes clear that two systems once believed to be functionally separate   immunity and glucose metabolism   are, in fact, closely linked, and the bridge can be provided by gut bacteria. There s probably more than one bacteria involved in this process of communication and metabolic control, researchers said. The gut harbors literally thousands of microbes that appear to function almost as a metabolically active organ, emphasizing the critical importance of gut bacterial health. Bacteria-mediated communication, of course, is just one part of complex human systems   issues such as proper diet, exercise, and appropriate weight control are all still important, the researchers said.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/personalized-antibiotic-treatment-205085,Personalized Antibiotic Treatment Researchers have developed a sensor platform that quantifies antibiotics in human blood within minutes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A team of researchers from the University of Freiburg has developed a system inspired by biology that can detect several different antibiotics in human blood or other fluids at the same time. This biosensor system could be used for medical diagnostics in the future, especially for point-of-care testing in doctors  practices, on house calls and in pharmacies, as well as in environmental and food safety testing.  The researchers focused their study on the antibiotics tetracycline and streptogramin in human blood.  The analysis takes only 10 minutes, from sample to result,  said the microsystems engineer Dr. Can Dincer, who is the head of the research team:  Our study was about demonstrating the applicability of the platform.  The researchers have recently published their results in Analytical Chemistry. Based on these findings, the group is currently working on developing a method to determine how quickly the human body breaks down antibiotics, thus enabling the dosage of medications to be adjusted to each patient.  This technology could pave the way for personalized antibiotic treatments in the future,  Dincer said. The all-too-frequent use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine causes pathogens to develop resistance. Multidrug resistant bacteria are the reason for an increasing number of life-threatening infections that are difficult to treat with medications available today. In this context, biosensors have so much potential in research, since they are inexpensive and easy to work with. It is expected that biosensors can be employed to customize antibiotic treatments to fit each patient`s requirements, thereby decreasing the development of resistant bacteria in the future. The electrochemical biosensor platform was developed by Prof. Dr. Gerald Urban s research group. It works with extremely small amounts of liquid.  The major advantage of this system is that we can measure up to eight different substances at the same time, quickly and simply,  Dincer said. The researchers combined their chip technology with a method developed earlier by the bioengineering expert Prof. Dr. Wilfried Weber, also from the University of Freiburg. The method is based on a naturally occurring sensor protein in resistant bacteria to recognize antibiotics and activate their defence mechanisms. These bacterial sensors react quickly, sensitively and specifically to antibiotics, which makes them ideal for analytical testing. Essentially, the bacteria are providing the researchers with a tool that can be applied to fight them back in the long-run. Source: Story from Albert-Ludwigs-Universit t Freiburg.

In the past, this was thought to be impossible   the crystals, which have special magnetic properties, were so small that scientists could not control their movement. But now a team of Chinese researchers has found the solution, and opened new applications that use these crystals to save lives. If some magnetic materials, such as iron oxides, are small enough   perhaps a few millionths of a millimetre across, smaller than most viruses   they have an unusual property: their magnetisation randomly flips as the temperature changes. By applying a magnetic field to these crystals, scientists can make them almost as strongly magnetic as ordinary fridge magnets. It might seem odd, but this is the strongest type of magnetism known. This phenomenon is called superparamagnetism. Superparamagnetic particles could be ideal for drug delivery, as they can be directed to a tumour simply by using a magnetic field. Their tiny size, however, has made them difficult to guide precisely. Until now. Kezheng Chen and Ji Ma from Quingdou University of Science and Technology, Quingdou, China have demonstrated a method of producing much larger superparamagnetic crystals and have recently published their findings in Physics Letters A. These large crystals do not show the unwanted magnetic properties of the small crystals.  The largest superparamagnetic materials that we have been able to make before now were clusters of nanocrystals that were together about a thousand times smaller than these,  says Chen. The large crystals are about the width of a human hair. This discovery paves the way for superparamagnetic bulk materials that could revolutionise drug delivery in the body. And this is just the beginning. Chen's crystals might, for example, be useful in the many engineering projects that need ""smart fluids"" to build safer car parts or better human prostheses.

Managing crop pests without fully understanding the impacts of tactics   related to resistance and nontarget plants or insects   costs producers money,  said Antonio DiTommaso, professor of soil and crop science and lead author of a new study,  Integrating Insect, Resistance and Floral Resource Management in Weed Control Decision-Making,  in the journal Weed Science (October-December 2016).  We are taking a renewed look at a holistic, sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) approach,  DiTommaso said. In corn production, for example, maintaining a few villainous milkweed plants in the middle of a cornfield may help minimize crop loss from the destructive European corn borer. The milkweed plants can harbor aphids (destructive sap-sucking flies) that produce a nectar food source for beneficial parasitic wasps Trichogramma. The wasps, in turn, lay eggs inside the eggs of the European corn borer, killing the corn borer eggs   reducing damage to the crop.  Production management rarely considers the benefits of weeds in agricultural ecosystems,  said DiTommaso.  Let s look at the big picture. If we open our eyes   even if it s a weed growing in the cornfield   we show it could be beneficial. Integrating weed benefits will become increasingly important, as pest management is likely to move from total reliance on herbicides and transgenic crop traits for control, because of increasing resistance of weeds to these products.  One additional side benefit for having a few milkweed plants in a field of corn is that it serves as a breeding place and food source for monarch butterflies. As of late, monarch numbers are down, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is evaluating a petition to have them protected under the Endangered Species Act. While some growers elect not to use engineered crops, producers may see a return to IPM methods from two decades ago, as resistance could easily occur when relying on a single tactic. With increasing no-till production, producers will inevitably see rebounds in perennial weeds   such as milkweed, the researchers said. Thus, some growers may be willing to tolerate a low milkweed population in favor of providing livable plant space for monarchs.  Every organism in an agricultural system plays multiple roles,  said John Losey, professor of entomology.  If management decisions are based solely on the negative aspects, yield and profit can be lost in the short term and broader problems can arise in the longer term.  Integration of the weed costs and advantages will become important.  The benefits of weeds have been neglected. They re often seen as undesirable, unwanted. We re now beginning to quantify their benefits,  said Kristine M. Averill  05, M.S.  09, weed research associate.  It s very important to recognize the benefits of all the species within the crop field   that includes both the crops and the weeds   not to mention cover crops. Weeds can offer ecosystem services, such as soil erosion protection and pollination services for the benefit of insects,  Averill said.  They can be part of a restorative cycle.

Now, a new study performed using mice demonstrates how doctors might one day better regulate those therapeutic microbes by engineering them to respond to temperature. For instance, if engineered bacteria were administered to a patient with a disease, doctors could, in theory, instruct the bacteria to release medicine to just the site of interest, and nowhere else in the body, by using ultrasound to gently heat up the tissue. ""Bacteria can be designed to act like special agents fighting disease in our bodies,"" says Caltech's Mikhail Shapiro, assistant professor of chemical engineering and Heritage Principal Investigator, whose overall research goal is to create new ways to both visualize and control cells   bacterial cells and human cells   for medicinal purposes. ""We're building walkie-talkies for the cells so we can both listen and talk to them."" Shapiro is principal investigator on a paper about the new research published November 14 in the journal Nature Chemical Biology. The colead authors are Dan Piraner and Mohamad Abedi, graduate students in Shapiro's lab. The research also shows how these engineered bacteria, once in a patient, could be programmed to stop administering a therapeutic or to self-destruct if the patient's temperature rises from a fever. A fever might signal that the therapy is not working, and thus it would be in the patient's best interest for the bacteria to terminate its activity. In another application of the technology, the researchers demonstrated how the bacteria could be designed to destroy themselves once they leave a patient's body through defecation. The lower temperature outside of a host's body would signal the engineered bacteria to activate a genetic kill switch, thereby alleviating concerns about the genetically altered microbes spreading to the environment. ""We can use these thermal switches in bacteria to control a variety of behaviors,"" says Shapiro. The strategy of using engineered bacteria to fight disease   part of a growing field called microbial therapeutics   has shown some promise in animal models and humans. Previous research has demonstrated that some bacteria naturally make their way to tumor sites because they prefer the tumors' low-oxygen environments. Studies have shown that these bacteria can be directed to release a medicine onto tumors, such as the tumor-destroying drug hemolysin. Other studies have shown that bacteria administered to the gut can release molecules to reduce inflammation. But these bacteria might end up in other portions of the body, and not just at the sites of interest. The method developed by Shapiro's lab solves this problem by providing a mechanism through which bacteria can be instructed to direct drugs only to a specific anatomical site. The idea is that the genetically engineered bacteria would activate their therapeutic program at a certain temperature induced via ultrasound tools, which gently heat tissues with millimeter precision. A doctor could, in theory, administer genetically altered bacteria to a cancer patient and then, by focusing ultrasound at the tumor site, trigger the bacteria to fight the tumor.   ""We can spatially and temporally control the activity of the bacteria,"" says Abedi. ""We can communicate with them and tell them when and where something needs to be done."" To create thermally controllable bacteria, the team first needed to find candidate genetic switches whose activity depends on temperature changes. They ultimately identified two candidates. The first is a protein in Salmonella bacteria, and the second originates from a bacterial virus called a bacteriophage. Both proteins bind to DNA to turn a genetic circuit on or off in response to temperature. Next, the scientists used a protein engineering technique   ""directed evolution,"" pioneered by Caltech's Frances Arnold   to evolve the proteins in the lab and tune their switching temperatures. For instance, the Salmonella protein was originally activated by temperatures ranging between 42 and 44 degrees Celsius. Using directed evolution, the scientists generated versions with activation temperatures between 36 and 39 degrees Celsius. When these genetic switches are used to control the expression of therapeutic proteins, they can act like thermal controls to turn the therapy on or off at a given temperature. ""When we were thinking about how to get bacteria to sense temperature, we looked at nature and found a few systems where bacteria can do this,"" says Piraner. ""We tested the performance, found the ones that had the best switching performance. From there, we went on to find that they could be tuned and amplified. It all started with what nature gave us, and engineering took us the rest of the way."" Source: Story from California Institute of Technology. Original piece written by Whitney Clavin.

Their motivation? Saving time. Traditionally, scientific studies are published in peer-reviewed journals, which require other scientists to evaluate submitted research to determine its soundness for publication. Peer review is supposed to be a good thing, in theory acting as a stopgap for science that isn t sound, but it s increasingly getting a bad rap. Beyond the time it takes to actually get the science done, peer review has become the slowest step in the process of sharing studies. Cycles of peer review-revise-resubmit in biology can span months to more than a year for a single manuscript. This situation hampers progress because it delays how long it takes for breakthroughs to become available to other scientists and the public.  How did things get so bad? It s all about competition, supply and demand. Modern science is done in the context of a tournament mentality, with a large number of competitors (scientists) vying for a small number of prizes (jobs, tenure, funding). To be competitive, scientists must prove their  worth  through publications, and this pressure has created unanticipated challenges in how scientists report their own work and evaluate that of others   ultimately resulting in unacceptable delays in sharing sound science.  But trying to bypass this traditional route for sharing scientific results is not likely to advance scientific progress. As a journal editor and practicing scientist, I suggest we need to fix the real problem: our standards for publication. Done right, a recalibration would lead to fewer research papers   but that counterintuitive outcome may be exactly what s needed to more efficiently advance scientific progress.  More money, more journals, more problems Between 1995 and 2003, the U.S. National Institutes of Health s budget increased by 2.4-fold. With more research being funded, publishers expanded the number of journals dedicated to biomedical research and the number of studies published by twofold, creating a US$9.4 billion scientific publishing industry. But while the numbers have all increased in proportion, the quality has not. Scientific journals have a pecking order, and more  prestigious  journals are thought to have higher standards for publication. These standards are based on a hazy mix of perceived quality of the work, its potential to significantly influence thinking in the field and the possibly unfounded reputation of the journal itself. How one ranks journal prestige is the subject of heated debate, but one flawed and pervasive metric is the impact factor. The impact factor of a journal reflects the number of times publications in that journal are cited by other scientific publications. It s often used by other scientists as a shorthand measure of recognition of published work. Between 1997 and 2014, the number of journals publishing basic biological research increased by 212, but only four of these journals ranked in the top half of the impact factor scale. If one overlooks the flaws of the metric, these new journals may be seen as publishing work of perhaps lesser quality and limited impact. Indeed, I was told by a senior colleague when I was just starting my career that  a manuscript, once written, will be published somewhere,  insinuating that the quality of the work was irrelevant. The proliferation of  low impact  scientific journals has also expanded the  publish or perish  mantra of academia. It now matters not only how much you publish but also where you publish. This striving for exclusivity allows  top tier  journals to demand even more from scientists, who are willing to extend their studies beyond what was previously considered a standalone report (the so-called  least publishable unit ) for the prize of a  good  publication. For example, one analysis revealed that journal manuscripts published in 2014 contained significantly more data than those published in 1984. Producing more data takes longer and delays the release of studies that would previously have been considered complete. For instance, Ph.D. students are spending an average of 1.3 years longer at one top graduate program over the same period.  And this high bar is elevated even further when individual journals reduce the numbers of studies that they publish. Buried in a barrage of papers The overall increased number of papers being written has also created a bottleneck in peer review, which negatively affects both quality and speed of publication. I spend most of my editorial time trying to recruit qualified reviewers, who are increasingly too busy to fulfill this professional responsibility. There s no restriction on how far down the list I m permitted to go in my attempts. When I receive invitations myself, they now often give me the option to choose people in my lab group to complete the review on their own, expanding the scope of  peer  to include  student.  I have also recently been invited, with no obvious check of my credentials, to join a service that will pay me to review manuscripts, a divergence from the norm, where reviewing papers has traditionally been considered part of an academic s responsibility to the field and thus unpaid. With this erosion of the peer review system, spectacular failures are inevitable, such as the study crediting a divine  Creator  for the link between the structure of the hand and its grasping ability in a peer-reviewed publication. Even without the explosion of preprints that may be on the horizon, scientists are having a hard time keeping up with the literature as it is. In a survey by the magazine The Scientist on the prevalence of omitted references, 85 percent of respondents said the failure to cite previous studies in new publications is a serious or potentially serious problem in the life sciences. This slip in keeping current may lead to the persistence of incorrect conclusions and to duplicated and therefore wasted effort. I recently reviewed a manuscript and pointed out that the vast majority of what was reported had been previously published, although none of the three other reviewers made this connection. Thus, calls for self-publishing need to take scale into account; it may work for physics and mathematics, but in 2015 there were sixfold and 24-fold more manuscripts published in biology than in either field, respectively.  Keeping sight of the goal: Facilitating scientific progress Without question, scientific advances, funded by the public, should be shared without delay, a goal championed by the #ASAPbio movement. Indeed, reporting observations quickly for other scientists to use may seem like a good way to facilitate progress; but in reality, context is everything. There s simply no way to remember the vast number of details if they re not associated with a breakthrough in understanding. It s these breakthroughs that provide a framework for not only organizing the details but vetting their accuracy. As a practical example, I know what I was wearing (detail) on Oct. 28, 2007, the day my son was born (context), but I have no idea what I wore (out-of-context detail) on Oct. 27. To realize a faster pace of scientific progress, we need to balance the goal of sharing data with an assessment of quality and impact. Proponents of self-publication on internet servers such as bioRxiv suggest that scientists are so concerned with their reputations that they will not release unsound studies, but the increasing prevalence of retracted peer-reviewed articles, irreproducible results and text reuse argues that the pressures of the tournament can sometimes trump individual restraint.  Peer review clearly isn t perfect, but rather than simply bypassing it and releasing even more information into an overloaded system, we should focus on making it better. The first step is to reset and clearly state our standards for quality in both publishing and peer reviewing. The outcome will certainly be fewer publications in biomedicine, but their individual impact will be greater. As a result, scholars will have a fighting chance to dedicate more time to evaluating new research and keeping up with the literature, which will facilitate progress. Scientists and journals have driven the more-is-better mentality and don t have the incentives to make these corrections. Instead, universities and granting agencies, which use publications as standards for evaluation, and the public, which funds much of the research, must lead the charge to develop a mechanism for journal accreditation, with clear standards for publication and peer-review quality. If publishing scientific advances is worth doing, it is worth doing right. Source: Story from The Conversation. Original piece written by Tracia Serio.

The study was discussed during the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, the world's largest source of emerging news about brain science and health. Hohmann was joined by three other international researchers whose work focuses on similar topics. ""The most exciting aspect of this research is the potential to produce the same therapeutic benefits as opioid-based pain relievers without side effects like addiction risk or increased tolerance over time,"" said Hohmann, a Linda and Jack Gill Chair of Neuroscience and professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Chronic pain is estimated to affect nearly 50 million adults in the United States. The rise in opioid-based pain relievers to treat chronic pain has also contributed to an opioid addiction epidemic in the United States, with 19,000 deaths linked to prescription opioid abuse in 2014. In Indiana, the use of needles associated with prescription opioid abuse led to a major HIV outbreak in the state s southeastern region, prompting the governor to declare a public health emergency in 2015. ""The fact that deaths associated with prescription opioid abuse have surpassed cocaine and heroin overdose deaths combined is a significant factor in exploring cannabinoids as an alternative treatment for pain,"" said Richard Slivicki, a graduate student in Hohmann's lab who led the study. ""It's a major epidemiological crisis, and one that helps motivate our work."" The IU study found that a compound that modulates the activity of the brain s receptors for THC and endocannabinoids reduced chronic pain in mice. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana; endocannabinoids are natural pain-relieving compounds released by the brain. These modulating compounds, called positive allosteric modulators, or PAMs, work by binding to a recently discovered site on a cannabinoid receptor in the brain called CB1, which is different from the site that binds THC. The PAMs were synthesized by Ganesh A. Thakur at Northeastern University, who is a collaborator on the study. The IU scientists specifically tested the effects of CB1 PAM on neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage, which is estimated to affect as many as 40 percent of cancer patients as a side effect of chemotherapy. The scientists gave mice paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug known to damage nerves and cause pain, and then treated them with CB1 PAM. After receiving paclitaxel, mice became hypersensitive to both mechanical and cold stimulations to the paw, indicating increased pain. After treatment with the CB1 PAM, the mice behaved like normal mice that did not experience pain. The study also found evidence that the use of CB1 PAM amplified the therapeutic effect of endocannabinoids without the negative side effects of a  marijuana high,  such as impaired motor function. The PAMs were administered in combination with a compound to increase endocannabinoid levels in the brain by preventing their breakdown in the body. Moreover, the team found that the use of the CB1 PAM remained effective over time to prevent pain in mice, as opposed to THC and endocannabinoid breakdown inhibitors, both of which stopped working with repeated dosing. ""We found that the compound did not produce reward on its own, so it's unlikely that a CB1 PAM would be abused as a recreational drug,"" Hohmann added. ""Our studies show that we can maintain or preserve therapeutic efficacy in ways that we haven t seen with some of the other classes of analgesics that are used in the clinic.""

The integration of Seven Bridges  platform for cloud-based biomedical data analysis with SolveBio enables biotech and pharmaceutical researchers to seamlessly transition from the analysis of large NGS datasets to clinical analysis and interpretation, speeding the progress of their precision medicine initiatives. This integration is available in Seven Bridges  Public Apps repository, meaning any joint customer may immediately use this end-to-end workflow.  Through the integration of our respective platforms, Seven Bridges and SolveBio are helping to accelerate the pace of precision medicine research from  bench to bedside,  said James Sietstra, President of Seven Bridges.  Seven Bridges brings the scale of the cloud and national-scale genomic datasets, while SolveBio s deep knowledge base and contextual intelligence tools help researchers take their work to the next level in discovering new treatments for patients.   The Seven Bridges Platform gives our customers access to the workflows and computational power they need to uncover variants that might be linked to disease and that are candidates for further study,  said Mark Kaganovich, CEO of SolveBio.  Through this integration, our customers can now immediately and easily incorporate these data into SolveBio, so that translational scientists can get contextual, up-to-date, in-depth views of biomarkers and variants.  As a result of Seven Bridges  integration with SolveBio, joint customers can analyze and annotate large genomic datasets using Seven Bridges tools and customizable workflows and then push relevant findings to SolveBio for deep functional interpretation and assessment of clinical impact. This integration gives large pharmaceutical and governmental clients an end-to-end solution for analysis and interpretation. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) are already using the two integrated platforms to analyze data from The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) research program, one of the world s most comprehensive cancer epidemiology research groups. The group s epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention.  As the DCEG's genomic research transitions to whole genome sequencing with larger datasets, our local HPC and database technology will no longer be enough,  said David Roberson, Bioinformatics Analyst at the NCI and Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.  The combination of Seven Bridges  scalable cloud analysis platform and SolveBio s deep genomic intelligence tools provide an important opportunity to advance the goals of cancer research. Being able to quickly search and annotate hundreds of millions of variant records and create multiple data builds that can be shared securely with collaborators will be critical.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/biomarker-to-speed-inflammation-diagnosis-188537,Biomarker to Speed Inflammation Diagnosis Researchers identify new biomarker for brain and spinal cord inflammation  allowing faster diagnosis and treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Research from Mayo Clinic included in the November issue of JAMA Neurology identifies a new biomarker for brain and spinal cord inflammation, allowing for faster diagnosis and treatment of patients. Vanda Lennon, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues identified the new biomarker in spinal fluid and blood serum of patients with a neurological disorder called autoimmune meningoencephalomyelitis. The biomarker is an antibody. Antibodies are molecules used by the immune system to fight infections or cancer. When an antibody is directed against healthy tissue by a misguided immune system, as it is in this disorder, it is called an autoantibody. In autoimmune meningoencephalomyelitis, the autoantibody targets a protein called glial fibrillary acidic protein within cells called astrocytes that are found in the brain and spinal cord.  Headache is a prominent symptom reported by the patients,  says Dr. Lennon, who is senior author on the study.  It is accompanied by neurological findings of varying severity. Inflammatory cells in the spinal fluid and MRI images raise suspicion for brain infection, other inflammatory brain disease or a cancer spreading to the lining of the brain.  Dr. Lennon notes that this disease rapidly reverses with therapy directed at the immune system, such as prednisone, in contrast to infections that need antibiotics and cancer that requires aggressive treatment. A positive test for glial fibrillary acidic protein autoantibody should bring the correct diagnosis earlier and hasten the most appropriate treatment. The glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody biomarker initially was identified in Mayo Clinic s Neuroimmunology Laboratory, which is within the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. The biomarker was identified using a test developed in the 1960s. The process involves applying a patient s serum or spinal fluid to thin sections of mouse tissues. If an autoantibody is present, it will stick to the targeted tissue. After the serum or spinal fluid is washed off, a probe in the form of another antibody is applied to the tissue to detect any human antibody that remains bound to the tissue. The probe antibody is tagged with a fluorescent dye. When viewed under a fluorescence microscope, the tagged antibody shows the location of the bound human autoantibody, revealing the cells targeted by the immune system. In this case, the pattern of binding to mouse brain tissue resembles the pattern of abnormalities seen in MRI images of the patients  brain and spinal cord.  That method has been a tremendous tool of discovery as well as a diagnostic tool for the last 35 years since I set up this lab,  says Dr. Lennon.  It had fallen out of fashion about 20 years ago when we were encouraged to use modern molecular techniques. Well, we certainly do use molecular techniques, which are important validation steps, but we did not give up on the valuable older technology as a component of our 21st-century screening protocol to detect informative autoantibodies. In the process, we have continued to discover new autoantibodies of clinical importance.  With the discovery of this biomarker, Dr. Lennon and the team expect that diagnosis and treatment for patients will improve in another important way.  At this stage, we ve identified about 103 patients,  says Dr. Lennon.  And about a third of them are turning out to have an unsuspected cancer in a remote part of the body.  The research team suspects that, because cancer cells and the nervous system use some of the same mechanisms for communication, the immune response that is attacking a cancer is causing collateral damage to the nervous system in the process.  It appears from evidence to date that the antibody does not itself cause the brain inflammation,  says Dr. Lennon.  It is a proxy marker of a more aggressive component of the immune system called killer T cells, which target the same brain protein.  The next steps are to verify the glial fibrillary acidic protein autoantibody s diagnostic performance. At that point, Mayo Clinic s Neuroimmunology Laboratory anticipates offering this test for diagnostic purposes. Source: Story from the Mayo Clinic. Original piece written by Susan Barber Lindquist.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus in vivo. In this preclinical study, 100 percent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.  Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,  said lead researcher David B. Weiner, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the W.W. Smith Charitable Trust Professor in Cancer Research at Wistar.  As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.  This study is the first of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner. J. Joseph Kim, Ph.D., MBA, President and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., added,  Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than six months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation. In this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly. One important aspect of Zika and many other mosquito-borne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 percent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host. This Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc. and is currently being tested in two human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a second study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. The CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study s placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017. A total of nearly 4,000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to the CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquito-borne transmission of the disease.

The service includes comprehensive molecular analysis of a patient s tumor leveraging the expertise of various medical specialists including oncologists, medical researchers and computational biologists who work as partners on the patient s cancer care team. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S., with almost 160,000 Americans expected to die from it in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. Andrew Mignatti, CEO and president of Perthera, said that precision medicine has often been wrongly defined as the equivalent of genomic medicine.  Understanding the patient s genomic makeup is a very significant part of the precision medicine analysis, but it is hardly enough,  he said.  In addition to genomic analysis, for example, patients who use our program will have proteomic testing so that protein-level and protein activation level changes, which are often more relevant to treatment response, can be identified. In addition to quantitative analysis by tissue testing and computer analysis, Perthera provides medical expertise by its own team, and also provides dedicated service in response to the patient s needs and requests. Emanuel Petricoin, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Perthera said the company s unique multi-omic-based precision medicine service provides the broadest molecular analysis that a patient can get using commercial testing platforms. He said that  the benefit to the patient and their treating physicians is that the more actionable information they obtain, the more chances of identifying a successful treatment option for each patient.   We are excited about the potential of this effort to increase access to this type of testing,  said Jennifer C. King, PhD, Director of Science and Research, Lung Cancer Alliance.  Now, more than ever, having detailed knowledge about the characteristics of a tumor is a critical component to determining a patient s most effective treatment options and this program makes that a reality no matter where that patient may be.

The research efforts include a focus on building an AI framework called CANDLE (Cancer Distributed Learning Environment), which will provide a common discovery platform that brings the power of AI to the fight against cancer. CANDLE will be the first AI framework designed to change the way we understand cancer, providing data scientists around the world with a powerful tool against this disease. Teams collaborating on CANDLE include researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research and DOE, as well as at Argonne, Oak Ridge, Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories. NVIDIA engineers and computational scientists will contribute to all elements of this framework by jointly developing an AI software platform optimized for the latest supercomputing infrastructure, with the goal of achieving 10X annual increases in productivity for cancer researchers. ""AI will be essential to achieve the objectives of the Cancer Moonshot,"" said Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at Argonne National Laboratory. ""New computing architectures have accelerated the training of neural networks by 50 times in just three years, and we expect more dramatic gains ahead."" ""GPU deep learning has given us a new tool to tackle grand challenges that have, up to now, been too complex for even the most powerful supercomputers,"" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. ""Together with the Department of Energy and the National Cancer Institute, we are creating an AI supercomputing platform for cancer research. This ambitious collaboration is a giant leap in accelerating one of our nation's greatest undertakings, the fight against cancer."" The Cancer Moonshot strategic computing partnership between the DOE and NCI to accelerate precision oncology includes three precision medicine pilot projects that aim to provide a better understanding of how cancer grows; discover more effective, less toxic therapies than existing ones; and understand key drivers of their effectiveness outside the clinical trial setting, at the population level. Deep learning techniques are essential for each of these projects. First, CANDLE will be used to help discover the underlying genetic signatures present in DNA and RNA of common cancers that are predictive of treatment response from the mass of molecular data collected by the NCI genomic data commons. Second, CANDLE will accelerate the molecular dynamic simulations of key protein interactions to understand the underlying biological mechanisms creating conditions for cancer. Third, through semi-supervised learning, CANDLE will automate information extraction and analysis of millions of clinical patient records to build a comprehensive cancer surveillance database of disease metastasis and recurrence. ""Large-scale data analytics -- and particularly deep learning -- are central to LLNL's growing missions in areas ranging from precision medicine to assuring nuclear nonproliferation,"" said James M. Brase, Deputy Associate Director for Computation, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ""NVIDIA is at the forefront of accelerated machine learning, and the new CORAL/Sierra architectures are critical to developing the next generation of scalable deep learning algorithms. Combining NVLink-enabled Pascal  GPU architectures will allow accelerated training of the largest neural networks."" Georgia Tourassi, Director of the Health Data Sciences Institute at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said, ""Today cancer surveillance relies on manual analysis of clinical reports to extract important biomarkers of cancer progression and outcomes. By applying high performance computing and AI on scalable solutions like NVIDIA's DGX-1 , we can automate and more readily extract important clinical information, greatly improving our population cancer health understanding.""

The Salk Institute scientists who discovered these circular ""Princess Leia"" oscillations, which are described in the journal eLife think the waves are responsible each night for forming associations between different aspects of a day's memories. See Also: No dream: Electric brain stimulation during sleep can boost memory""The scale and speed of Princess Leia waves in the cortex is unprecedented, a discovery that advances the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative,"" says Terrence Sejnowski, head of Salk's Computational Neurobiology Laboratory. Short-term memory of events is stored in the brain's hippocampus. Long-term memories, however, are encoded in the neocortex. The transfer of memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex is called memory consolidation, and happens while we sleep. Sleep spindles a type of brain wave pattern known to occur in the earliest stages of non-REM sleep are associated with memory consolidation. Previous studies showed that the more sleep spindles a human brain exhibits overnight, the more numbers one would remember the next day. But exactly how these sleep spindles related to memory was unclear, and scientists were limited by the fact that electrodes could only detect these spindles at one place in the brain at a time. ""Princess Leia"" brainwaves dubbed so for their twin hair bun-like shape are tied to memory and sleep. Researchers at the Salk Institute found that electrical activity forms into rotating waves during these oscillations. This video illustrates five oscillation cycles during which potential measured from the surface of the cortex exhibits stereotyped rotating patterns. Credit: Salk Institute Learn More: Infants create new knowledge while sleeping ""For a long time, neuroscience researchers had to record activity at one point in the brain at a time and put many data points together without seeing the whole picture simultaneously,"" says Lyle Muller, a Salk research associate and first author of the new work. Scientists had long believed that each sleep spindle oscillation peaked at the same time everywhere in the neocortex of the brain. Sejnowski and Muller wanted to see the broader picture, however, and turned to large-scale recordings, called intracranial electrocorticograms (ECoGs), that can measure activity in many areas of the brain at once. Patients with epilepsy often have ECoG arrays temporarily implanted in their brains to determine the location in the brain of epileptic seizures, so the scientists were able to study all the data collected from five such patients on healthy, seizure-free nights. When they crunched the ECoG data from each night, the researchers were in for a surprise: the sleep spindles weren't peaking simultaneously everywhere in the cortex. Instead, the oscillations were sweeping in circular patterns around and around the neocortex, peaking in one area, and then a few milliseconds later an adjacent area. ""We think that this brain activity organization is letting neurons talk to neurons in other areas,"" says Muller. ""The time scale that these waves travel at is the same speed it takes for neurons to communicate with each other."" Throughout the night, the researchers observed the same rotating patterns, each lasting about 70 milliseconds but repeating hundreds and hundreds of times over a matter of hours. Don't Miss: Power naps produce a significant improvement in memory performance Why would different areas of the neocortex need to communicate to store memories? One single memory is composed of different components (smell, sound, visuals) that are stored in different areas of the cortex. As a memory is being consolidated, Muller and Sejnowski hypothesize, circular sleep spindle waves help form the links between these different aspects of a single memory. ""If we understand how memories are being linked up like this in the brain, we could potentially come up with methods for disrupting memories after trauma,"" says Sejnowski. ""There are also disorders including schizophrenia that affect sleep spindles, so this is really an interesting topic to keep studying."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

This sensation of pain was previously thought to be caused by abnormal plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex of the brain, and rehabilitative therapies have focused on restoring normal motor function to relieve the pain. However, conflicting results left the question of whether and how phantom pain is caused by changes in sensorimotor activity unanswered. See Also: Cause of phantom limb pain in amputees, and potential treatment, identifiedIn a new study, researchers based at Osaka University reported on their use of brain-machine interface (BMI) training with a robotic hand on 10 phantom limb patients to investigate the association between changes in symptomatic pain and cortical currents during phantom hand movements. The BMI decodes the cortical signals that instruct the affected hand to move. It then converts this decoded phantom hand movement into movement of the robotic neuroprosthesis. Previous research has shown that BMIs can precisely decode hand movements in real time. Patients were asked to either open the robotic hand or grasp with it. The cortical currents activated by hand movements were measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. Results were compared with movement of the intact hand to check that motor information obtained from the sensorimotor cortex was specific. As expected, training with the prosthesis partially restored functioning of the affected hand and increased motor activity in the cortex. However, unexpectedly, participants reported a significant increase in the sensation of pain. This approach provided a method for inducing localized changes in cortical activity and directly and reversibly studying the relationship with pain. Indeed, when the patients were asked to move the phantom hand based on MEG signals decoded from movement of the intact hand, cortical sensorimotor activity was disrupted, reducing pain. In contrast with what was previously thought, these findings showed that pain is not reduced by reconstruction of motor function but by changes in cortical plasticity.

It turns out that noradrenaline regulates our estimates of how unstable the environment is, acetylcholine helps us adapt to changing environments, and dopamine pushes us to act on our beliefs about uncertainty. Read Next: A study shows how the brain switches into memory modeThe research, published in PLOS Biology, was led by Louise Marshall and Dr. Sven Bestmann at the University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology. The study involved 128 healthy participants who took part in a reaction-time task designed to test how they handled uncertainty. Participants were all given either a placebo or a drug to block noradrenaline, acetylcholine or dopamine before starting the task. Participants responded to symbols that were presented one after the other by pressing a corresponding button. The probability of each symbol appearing was dependent on the symbol that appeared previously; for example, if a participant had just seen symbol A, there was an 85% chance that symbol B would appear next. Every 50 trials, these probability patterns changed without warning, so participants had to detect these new patterns and adjust their responses accordingly. Lead author Louise Marshall said: ""Interacting with our dynamic and ever-changing environment requires us to frequently update our beliefs about the world. By learning the relationships that link events occurring in our environment, we can predict future events, and execute fast, accurate responses. However, the environment's complex dynamics give rise to uncertainty about the relationships between events, and uncertainty about the stability of these relationships over time."" See Also: Understanding molecular mechanism leading to addiction in humans She continued: ""Several brain chemicals have been proposed to modulate how we handle uncertainty.

This is where long chains of amino acids are formed like on an assembly line. An interdisciplinary research group from Goethe University Frankfurt, the EMBL in Heidelberg, and the Gene Center of the University of Munich (LMU) has now succeeded in solving the structure of a central player in this process bound to the small ribosomal subunit: the protein containing a unique iron-sulphur domain with the nickname  Iron Hammer  splits the two subunits of the ribosome when a protein chain is completed so that production of a new protein can begin. The two subunits of the ribosome must be actively split once the protein chain is complete otherwise errors occur in mRNA translation: research ignored this fact for a long time. Central player in this  ribosome recycling  process is the essential and highly dynamic metalloenzyme ABCE1. The iron-sulphur domain of ABCE1, known as the  Iron Hammer , rotates and presses the ribosomal subunits apart like a lever. To uncover this, the research group led by Professor Robert Tamp  at the Institute of Biochemistry at Goethe University Frankfurt isolated a complex of the small ribosomal subunit with ABCE1 (post-splitting complex) by means of an innovative preparation method. This complex was chemically fixed and cut into pieces, while the original distance information was preserved. At the EMBL in Heidelberg, the researchers used highly advanced mass spectrometry to analyse these small fragments and relate them to each other revealing their original distances on nanometre scale. The group in Munich then examined the reconstructed complex with a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscope and was able to reconstruct a 3D model of the post-splitting complex with tightly bound ABCE1 from a vast collection of single-particle images. Professor Robert Tamp  summarizes the significance of these results:  We have forced the rebellious and aggressive multi-domain enzyme ABCE1 into a new, unexpected state on the ribosome and used the combined expertise of three institutes to enrich textbook knowledge for coming generations of students.

Their discovery, published in Cancer Cell, could hasten development and testing of new drug therapies. Pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the (4;11) translocation is responsible for about 70 percent of infant and 10 percent of both childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The new mouse model replicates the human genetic flaw that causes this disease, making it much easier to study. This subtype of leukemia results from a genetic fusion t(4;11), known as a translocation. This combines parts of two separate genes. One of those genes, MLL (short for mixed-lineage leukemia), comes from chromosome 11. The other fragment, AF4 (short for ALL fused gene) from chromosome 4. The hybrid MLL-AF4 gene results in leukemia. Children and adults with this disease produce vast numbers of dysfunctional blood cells, which eventually crowd out functional cells. MLL-AF4 leukemia has a dismal prognosis, among the worst of any subset of acute leukemia.  For 20 years, scientists have repeatedly tried and consistently failed to make a model of MLL-AF4 Pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia,  said Michael Thirman, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago.  Even though we understood the basic genetic flaw, no one had been able create a mouse model that mimicked the human disease, which is crucial for evaluating potential therapies.  That frustrated many researchers, who shifted their focus to test alternative hypotheses on the causes of this leukemia or refocused their laboratories to study different aspects of this disease. Thirman s team, including longtime colleague Roger Luo, PhD, began working on this problem  years ago,  he said, and stayed with it. They quickly identified two hurdles. The first was a problem with the retrovirus that scientists used to insert the leukemia-causing gene into mouse cells. That gene, acquired from leukemia patients, consisted of a human gene fragment from MLL linked to the human fragment from AF4.  We soon discovered that the virus wasn t working,  Thirman explained.  We knew that certain parts of human DNA can decrease viral titers. So we switched from the human version of AF4 to the mouse version, Af4, which is slightly different. This increased viral titers 30 fold.  That worked, but it led to hurdle two. The mice injected with virus transporting MLL-Af4 developed leukemia, but it was the wrong kind. They developed acute myeloid instead of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Despite the use of lymphoid conditions,  the study authors wrote,  no lymphoid leukemia was observed.  Next, they collaborated with James Mulloy, PhD, at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center, whose graduate student Shan Lin inserted the fused MLL-Af4 gene into human CD34 cells, derived from cord or peripheral blood from volunteer donors. They transferred those cells to mice with immune systems that permit the growth of human cells. This time, the mice developed Pro-B ALL, identical to the leukemia found in humans.  The model worked perfectly,  Thirman said. Within 22 weeks, all of the mice developed exactly the same type of leukemia as observed in patients. Expression of MLL-Af4 in human cells  recapitulates the pro-B ALL observed in patient with t(4:11) as shown by immunophenotype, chromatin targeting of the fusion, nuclear complex formation, and gene expression signatures,  the authors wrote.  It mimics the disease found in humans both phenotypically and molecularly.   The differences in the type of leukemia that developed using mouse versus human cells were striking,  said Mulloy.  Researchers need to consider these differences carefully when choosing which model to use to mimic human disease. The available evidence now indicates that the approaches are not equivalent.  They conclude that  our MLL-Af4 model will be a valuable tool to study this most prevalent MLL-fusion leukemia with such a poor prognosis.  However, there is more work to be done.  MLL fusion disease is not a single genetic entity,  the authors note.  Each has its own genetic and biological features associated with particular fusion partners.  This highlights the need for  more models specific to each fusion. Our MLL-Af4 model will be a valuable tool.

The results, published today in Nature, show the game-changing potential of X-ray free-electron lasers, or XFELs, for studying RNA, which guides protein manufacturing in the cell, serves as the primary genetic material in retroviruses such as HIV and also plays a role in most forms of cancer. And because this particular type of RNA switch, known as a riboswitch, is found only in bacteria, a deeper understanding of its function may offer a way to turn off protein production and kill harmful germs without causing side effects in the humans they infect.  Previous experiments at SLAC s X-ray laser have studied biological reactions like photosynthesis that are triggered by light. But this is the first to observe one that is triggered by the chemical interaction of two biomolecules in real time and at the atomic scale,  said Yun-Xing Wang, a structural biologist at the National Cancer Institute s Center for Cancer Research who led the international research team.  This really demonstrates the unique capability that X-ray free-electron lasers offer that no current technology, or any other technology on the horizon, can do. It s like you have a camera with a very fast shutter speed, so you can catch every move of the biomolecules in action.  The experiments were carried out at SLAC s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), a DOE Office of Science User Facility. They are the first to demonstrate how XFELs can take snapshots and potentially make movies of RNA and other biomolecules as they chemically interact   offering glimpses into fundamental workings of the cell that can t be obtained any other way. Seeing RNA Shape Shifting RNA is a key part of the genetic material in all living cells. It comes in several types that work together to guide the production of proteins by the cell s ribosomes, according to blueprints encoded in DNA. But both DNA and RNA also contain extensive regions that don t code for any protein   the so-called genetic  dark matter.  Scientists thought for many years that these regions didn t do anything. Now they know that they play an important role in determining where and when genes turn on and off and otherwise fine-tuning their function. The vast majority of cancers are due to mutations in these non-coding regions, Wang said, so understanding how these regions work is important for cancer research as well as fundamental biology. However, figuring out what the RNA non-coding regions do is difficult. RNA molecules are wobbly and flexible, so it s hard to incorporate them into the large crystals typically needed to study their atomic structure at X-ray light sources. LCLS removes this barrier by allowing scientists to get structural information from much smaller, nanosized crystals, which are much easier to make. Its powerful X-ray laser pulses, a billion times brighter than any available before, are so short that they collect data from each crystal in a few millionths of a billionth of a second, before damage from the X-rays sets in. Wang s team studied a riboswitch from Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterium related to the one that causes cholera. The riboswitch sits in a long strand of messenger RNA (mRNA), which copies DNA s instructions for making a protein so they can be read and carried out by the ribosome. The switch acts like a thermostat that regulates protein production. In this case, the mRNA guides production of a protein that in turn helps to produce a small molecule called adenine. When there is too much adenine in the bacterial cell, adenine molecules enter pockets in the riboswitches and flip the riboswitches into a different shape, and this changes the pace of protein and adenine production. First Stills of an Elegant Film For the LCLS experiments, the researchers made nanocrystals that incorporated millions of copies of the riboswitch and mixed them with a solution containing adenine molecules. Each crystal was so small that adenine could quickly and uniformly penetrate into every corner of it, enter riboswitch pockets and flip them almost instantaneously, as if they were millions of synchronized swimmers executing a single flawless move. The scientists took snapshots of this interaction by hitting the crystals with X-ray laser pulses at carefully timed intervals after the mixing started. This gave them the first glimpse of a fleeting intermediate stage in the process, which occurred 10 seconds in. Separately, they obtained the first images of the riboswitch in its initial, empty-pocket state, and discovered that it existed in two slightly different configurations, only one of which participates in switching. The researchers were surprised to discover that the sudden change in the shape of the riboswitches was so dramatic that it changed the shape of the entire crystal, too. Normally a major change like this would crack the crystal and spoil the experiment. But because these crystals were so small they held together, so the X-ray laser could still get structural information from them.  To me it s still a mystery how the crystal managed to do that,  said Soichi Wakatsuki, a professor at SLAC and at the Stanford School of Medicine and head of the lab s Biosciences Division, who was not part of the research team.  This actually opens up a lot of new possibilities and gives us a new way to look at how RNA and proteins interact with small molecules, so this is very exciting.

A team of scientists led by the National Institutes of Health reviewed the growing body of research on the subject and has published its analyses in a special issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases. Traditional infectious disease surveillance   typically based on laboratory tests and other data collected by public health institutions   is the gold standard. But, the authors note it can have time lags, is expensive to produce, and typically lacks the local resolution needed for accurate monitoring. Further, it can be cost-prohibitive in low-income countries. In contrast, big data streams from internet queries, for example, are available in real time and can track disease activity locally, but have their own biases. Hybrid tools that combine traditional surveillance and big data sets may provide a way forward, the scientists suggest, serving to complement, rather than replace, existing methods.  The ultimate goal is to be able to forecast the size, peak or trajectory of an outbreak weeks or months in advance in order to better respond to infectious disease threats. Integrating big data in surveillance is a first step toward this long-term goal,  says Cecile Viboud, Ph.D., co-editor of the supplement and a senior scientist at the NIH s Fogarty International Center.  Now that we have demonstrated proof of concept by comparing data sets in high-income countries, we can examine these models in low-resource settings where traditional surveillance is sparse.  Experts in epidemiology, computer science and modeling collaborated on the supplement s 10 articles. They report on the opportunities and challenges associated with three types of data: medical encounter files, such as records from healthcare facilities and insurance claim forms; crowdsourced data collected from volunteers who self-report symptoms in near real time; and data generated using social media, the internet and mobile phones, which may include self-reporting of health, behavior and travel information to help elucidate disease transmission. But big data s potential must be tempered with caution, the authors say. Non-traditional data streams may lack key demographic identifiers such as age and sex, or provide information that underrepresents infants, children, the elderly and developing countries. Social media outlets may not be stable sources of data, as they can disappear if there is a loss of interest or financing. Most importantly, any novel data stream must be validated against established infectious disease surveillance data and systems, the authors said. Each article features a promising example of the use of big data to monitor and model infectious diseases activity:   In the United States, researchers found what they describe as  excellent alignment  between medical insurance claim data for flu-like illnesses and proven influenza activity reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   A European surveillance system that began collecting crowdsourced data on influenza as part of a research project is now considered an adjunct to existing surveillance activities. Influenzanet uses standardized online surveys to gather information from volunteers who self-report their symptoms on a weekly basis. Several European Union member states are now using the tool and expanding it to include Zika, salmonella and other diseases.   An online platform, ResistanceOpen, was developed by U.S. and Canadian scientists to monitor antibiotic resistance at the regional level. The site takes advantage of publicly available, online data from community healthcare institutions as well as regional, national and international bodies. An analysis showed online information compared favorably with traditional reporting systems in the two countries.   Multiple studies have looked at social media and internet health forums for information on drug use and to detect adverse drug reactions. While there are technical and ethical challenges, the authors suggest internet search logs and social media posts can provide information more quickly than traditional physician-based reporting systems.   In a comparison of the relatively new field of epidemic forecasting to the better-established one for weather forecasting, the authors note the former is much more difficult given that there is less observational data for disease, and because human behavior has the potential to rapidly alter the course of an epidemic.   An examination of spatial data   including from insurance claims and social media posts   shows their potential for filling geographical information gaps but also presents technical, practical and privacy challenges that must be addressed.   With appropriate safeguards to ensure anonymity, call data records from mobile phones may provide  an unprecedented opportunity  to determine how travel affects disease transmission. Studies of malaria and rubella in Kenya showed call data improved the understanding of the spatial transmission of those diseases.   Online news articles and health bulletins from public health agencies were manually extracted and modeled to elucidate transmission patterns for two recent outbreaks the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in South Korea. Internet findings were in line with traditional data, providing a proof of concept that this approach can be generalized and automatized to a variety of online sources and generate information on disease transmission.   Researchers also describe the benefits of a novel, publicly available epidemic simulation data management system, called epiDMS, which provides storage and indexing services for large data simulation sets, as well as search functionality and data analysis to aid decision makers during healthcare emergencies. While the new hybrid models that combine traditional and digital disease surveillance methods show promise, the scientists agree there is still an overall scarcity of reliable surveillance information, especially compared to other fields such as climatology, where the data sets are huge.  To be able to produce accurate forecasts, we need better observational data that we just don t have in infectious diseases,  notes Professor Shweta Bansal of Georgetown University, a co-editor of the supplement.  There s a magnitude of difference between what we need and what we have, so our hope is that big data will help us fill this gap.  Source: Story from the National Institutes of Health.

Knowledge about this protein, called Piezo 1, could be relevant for designing better pain medications and exploring future therapies for blood disorders, hypertension and more.  This latest work provides definitive proof that Piezos are, by themselves,  mechanosensitive,  said senior author Ardem Patapoutian, a professor at TSRI and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. The study was published recently in the journal Cell Reports. A  Sense  of Mystery Piezo 1 is an  ion channel,  or gateway through the cell membrane. When it senses mechanical force, it opens to allow ions to pass into the cell, starting a chain of events that send a signal to the brain in other words, Piezo proteins control the sensation of touch.  Out of all our senses, the sense of touch is the least understood, so significant efforts are being made to acquire a more complete understanding,  said Ruhma Syeda, a professional scientific collaborator at TSRI and first author of the new study.  We are only now unraveling the physiological roles of Piezo proteins.  The new study addressed a lingering question about Piezo 1: Does it sense touch directly, or is it influenced by nearby proteins and other cellular components? To study this, the researchers used a  reductionist  approach, which Syeda helped develop during her postdoctoral research. In this system, scientists extract a protein from its native environment in the cell and study it in a simpler membrane environment. This enables the scientists to see how the protein behaves on its own, without influence from other cellular players. The researchers found that Piezo 1 does appear to directly sense force by detecting tension in the cell membrane.  It seems like it has a built-in sensor,  said Syeda. The next step in this research is to better understand the molecular structure of Piezo 1 which could lead to a  map  of the protein and further insights into its function.  I m also very excited that this reductionist approach can be applied to other channels,  said Syeda.  We ll be able to understand more channels and proteins and their physiological roles.

In fact, most cells don t. Over 99 percent of the innumerable cells on our planet exist in a state of quiescence. Pick up a handful of soil: it contains thousands of microorganisms, almost every one of which would not grow if you placed it in a culture dish. These cells are metabolically active yes, alive but they are not dividing. And they will remain in a reproductively  quiet  state unless stimulated under specific conditions to re-enter the cell cycle and gear up to divide once again. Some of our most important cells, in fact, are quiescent, including stem cells, cells of the adaptive immune system, and oocytes eggs that women can carry for decades before being activated through fertilization. Dividing cells, although always a tiny minority in nature s big picture, command most of our attention, and for reasons that are not hard to figure. Cells that gear up to divide are those that carry all life on the planet forward, into the next generation. And when replication runs amok, as in human cancer, that basic life-sustaining function is transmuted into a weapon threatening survival itself. Today in the journal Science, a team of biologists led by Robert A. Martienssen, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor and HHMI-GBMI Investigator, presents evidence supporting a theory that places in profound perspective a battle within all cells between mechanisms that prompt them to replicate their DNA and those that enable them to transcribe their DNA into RNA.  It s an inherent choice that has to be managed, and accounts for much of what our cellular machinery is doing at any given time,  Martienssen says. The evidence Martienssen s team reports today is the result of turning the spotlight, for a change, on that multitudinous silent cellular majority cells in the quiescent state. Postdoctoral investigator Benjamin Roche performed experiments demonstrating for the first time that most cells cannot survive in a quiescent state unless an epigenetic mechanism called RNA interference (RNAi) is up and running. RNAi and other epigenetic processes induce changes in where and when specific genes are expressed without altering their genetic code. Using simple fission yeast (S. pombe) cells as a model, the team discovered that mutants lacking RNAi were unable to enter, maintain or exit quiescence. Yeast without RNAi could survive only if they were in the process of dividing. This suggested there was something about quiescence itself that required RNAi to be present if a eukaryotic cell was to stay alive. It made sense to ask what was happening in quiescent cells in which RNAi was functioning. These dovetailed questions led to the following explanations, in research in Martienssen s lab led by Dr. Roche over a five-year period in collaboration with Dr. Beno t Arcangioli at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. When a cell exits the cell cycle, leaving the reproductive state, it needs to be reprogrammed in order to enter quiescence. This reprogramming is accomplished in part by RNAi, which acts to silence genes by causing a ubiquitous enzyme called RNA polymerase to physically detach from the double helix, where at some earlier point it had attached in order to translate the DNA of the genome into RNA messages that encode proteins. RNA polymerase comes in several forms. In cycling cells the release of RNA polymerase II also has the effect of stimulating the cell to produce highly compressed areas called heterochromatin, typically near the centromere in the central part of chromosomes. RNAi is part of a more complex epigenetic machinery in higher organisms that silences the heterochromatin once it is established. In cells in which RNAi is missing or disabled, heterochromatin, normally silent, is activated. This was pointed out by Martienssen and colleagues in 2002, in epigenetics research cited by Science as  Breakthrough of the Year.  The new research shows that cells missing RNAi cannot enter or maintain quiescence precisely because heterochromatic regions spin out of control and end up killing the cell. The team now places this observation a context that significantly broadens its implications.  We found through genetic analysis that RNAi not only interacts with RNA polymerase II in the formation and regulation of heterochromatin,  says Martienssen.  We also found that in quiescent cells, it is the RNAi-induced release of RNA polymerase I, another enzyme active during transcription, that enables quiescent cells to maintain their quiescent state.  It is the release of RNA polymerase I specifically from regions of the genetic material occupied by rDNA that is key here. rDNA is the genetic material that encodes the RNA that helps make up ribosomes, protein factories found in all cells. rDNA, much like the DNA that encodes heterochromatin, is highly repetitive and occurs in many copies across the genome. The action of RNAi releases RNA polymerase I from rDNA regions, and in so doing prevents the over-accumulation of heterochromatin during the maintenance of quiescence.  This research may explain the key role that RNAi plays in stem cells, which are quiescent for much of their life; and also in cancer, which, after all, is the stimulation of cells that are normally quiescent to begin dividing and proliferating. That transition, interestingly, is often accompanied by mutations in RNAi,  Martienssen says. Source: Story from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/solving-the-puzzle-of-necroptosis-209775,Solving the Puzzle of Necroptosis Researchers discover novel mechanism for necroptosis and inflammation regulation  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cells can die in many ways. Apoptosis is a regulated cell death process that ensures the orderly disassembly and removal of the dying cell. Necroptosis is a more recently identified cell death pathway that results in the release of cellular components that can trigger inflammation. Researchers from the Cluster of Excellence CECAD at the University of Cologne discovered a novel mechanism that regulates necroptosis and inflammation. Cell death is an essential physiological process for all multicellular organisms. Throughout life, cells in many tissues die naturally and are replaced by new cells. A proper balance between the death and production of new cells is important for the maintenance of healthy tissue function and for regeneration after injury. Increased cell production coupled with reduced cell death can lead to tumor development. On the other hand, excessive cell death can cause tissue damage and disease. Normally our tissues are healthy, but some individuals develop inflammation and disease.  What causes inflammation?  asks Manolis Pasparakis, Professor at the Institute for Genetics of the University of Cologne, who is the senior author of the paper published on November 7th in Nature.  Can necroptosis be the trigger of inflammation in some cases and how is necroptosis regulated?  RIPK1 is a protein mainly known as an inducer of necroptosis. Researchers in the group of Manolis Pasparakis generated mice in which the RIPK1 gene was inactivated specifically in skin cells called keratinocytes.  We expected that the lack of RIPK1 would prevent necroptosis   but we observed the opposite. Keratinocytes in these mice died by necroptosis, causing skin inflammation. This was puzzling: How could the removal of RIPK1 cause necroptosis?  asked Snehlata Kumari, one of the three main authors of the paper. The researchers have now found an answer to this question: they discovered that RIPK1 inhibits another inducer of necroptosis, a protein called ZBP1. Genetic elimination of ZBP1 inhibited necroptosis and inflammation caused by RIPK1 deficiency.  ZBP1 was known as a sensor of DNA that contributes to immunity against some viruses, but so far it has not been implicated in inflammation,  commented Chun Kim, who is also a main author of the study. The researchers asked how RIPK1 can inhibit ZBP1. To answer this question, they used CRISPR gene editing to modify three amino acids in the so called RHIM domain that allows RIPK1 to interact with other proteins regulating necroptosis. Mice expressing this mutant RIPK1 in all cells did not survive after birth. Moreover, the expression of mutated RIPK1 only in keratinocytes caused skin inflammation. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments, the researchers could show that when the RHIM domain of RIPK1 was mutated, ZBP1 triggered necroptosis. This is what caused perinatal death, but also skin inflammation in adult mice.  This was a surprising result. These three amino acids of RIPK1 prevent ZBP1 from inducing necroptosis, and this is essential for mouse survival and the prevention of skin inflammation,  said Juan Lin, one of the leading authors of the manuscript.  We made progress, but many pieces of the greater puzzle remain unclear,  says Manolis Pasparakis.  ZBP1 has been known as a viral sensor, and now our results linked it to inflammation and disease. The triggers of chronic inflammation in humans are, in most cases, entirely unclear. Why does inflammation occur in a certain person at a certain moment? Bacterial and viral infections are discussed as possible triggers of chronic inflammation. In our work, we discovered the role of ZBP1 by experimentally altering RIPK1. Now we are wondering whether viruses or bacteria could activate ZBP1 to cause inflammation.  The researchers are now working to put the next pieces of the puzzle in place and explore a possible link between ZBP1 and chronic inflammatory diseases in humans.

The new discovery advances efforts to find new and effective treatments for heart failure. Heart failure afflicts 5.7 million Americans, costs the country $30.7 billion every year, and has no cures. When heart muscle is damaged, the body is unable to repair the dead or injured cells. Gladstone scientists are exploring cellular reprogramming   turning one type of adult cell into another   in the heart as a way to regenerate muscle cells in the hopes of treating, and ultimately curing, heart failure. It takes only three transcription factors proteins that turn genes on or off in a cell to reprogram connective tissue cells into heart muscle cells in a mouse. After a heart attack, connective tissue forms scar tissue at the site of the injury, contributing to heart failure. The three factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT), work together to turn heart genes on in these cells and turn other genes off, effectively regenerating a damaged heart with its own cells. But the method is not foolproof typically, only ten percent of cells fully convert from scar tissue to muscle.  In the new study, published in Circulation, Gladstone scientists tested 5500 chemicals to try to improve this process. They identified two chemicals that increased the number of heart cells created by eightfold. Moreover, the chemicals sped up the process of cell conversion, achieving in one week what used to take six to eight weeks.  While our original process for direct cardiac reprogramming with GMT has been promising, it could be more efficient,  said senior author Deepak Srivastava, MD, director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease.  With our screen, we discovered that chemically inhibiting two biological pathways active in embryonic formation improves the speed, quantity, and quality of the heart cells produced from our original process.  The first chemical inhibits a growth factor that helps cells grow and divide and is important for repairing tissue after injury. The second chemical inhibits an important pathway that regulates heart development. By combining the two chemicals with GMT, the researchers successfully regenerated heart muscle and greatly improved heart function in mice that had suffered a heart attack.  The scientists also used the chemicals to improve direct cardiac reprogramming of human cells, which is a more complicated process that requires additional factors. The two chemicals enabled the researchers to simplify the process bringing them one step closer to better treatments for heart failure.   Heart failure afflicts many people worldwide, and we still do not have an effective treatment for patients suffering from this disease,  said Tamer Mohamed, PhD, first author on the study and a former postdoctoral scholar at Gladstone.  With our enhanced method of direct cardiac reprogramming, we hope to combine gene therapy with drugs to create better treatments for patients suffering from this devastating disease.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/turning-greenhouse-gas-into-gasoline-212526,Turning Greenhouse Gas into Gasoline New catalyst provides design principles for producing fuels from carbon dioxide emissions   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new catalyst material developed by chemists at MIT provides key insight into the design requirements for producing liquid fuels from carbon dioxide, the leading component of greenhouse gas emissions. The findings suggest a route toward using the world s existing infrastructure for fuel storage and distribution, without adding net greenhouse emissions to the atmosphere. The new catalyst takes the process only through its first stage   converting carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO), explains assistant professor of chemistry Yogesh Surendranath, the senior researcher on a new study describing the advance. But that s a key initial step toward converting CO2 to other chemicals including fuels, he says; there are already established methods for converting CO and hydrogen to a variety of liquid fuels and other products. The study appears this week in the international chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie. Its authors are Youngmin Yoon, a graduate student at MIT; Anthony Shoji Hall, a former MIT postdoc who is now a professor of materials science at Johns Hopkins University; and Surendranath, who is the Paul M. Cook Career Development Assistant Professor at MIT.  The problem in CO2 conversion is how to selectively convert it,  Surendranath says. While this basic molecule can form the basis of virtually any carbon-based chemistry, the tricky part is to create a system in which CO2 consistently converts to a single end-product that can then be further processed into the desired material. The new system, he says, provides just that kind of selective, specific conversion pathway   and, in fact, a whole range of such pathways. And if the hydrogen and CO are produced using solar or wind-generated power, the entire process could be carbon neutral. Tunable conversion  What you want is a tunable catalyst,  he says, and that s just what this team developed, in the form of a highly porous silver electrode material. Depending on the exact formulation of this material, he says, it s possible to design variations of this catalyst where  each one may be designed for a different application.  The researchers learned that by tuning the dimensions of the material s pores they could get the system to produce the desired proportion of CO in the end-product. Most efforts to  tune  the selectivity of silver catalysts for CO production have focused on varying the surface active site chemistry. However, with this formulation, a material called a silver inverse opal, it is the pore structure of the material that determines the effect.  What we found was very simple,  Surendranath says.  You can tune the pore dimensions to tune the selectivity and activity of the catalyst, without modifying the surface active site chemistry.  Honeycomb structure The porous material can be made by depositing tiny polystyrene beads on a conductive electrode substrate, then electrodepositing silver on the surface, then dissolving away the beads, leaving pores whose size is determined by that of the original beads. Because of the way spheres naturally organize themselves when packed together, this method produces a honeycomb-like structure of hexagonal cells, Surendranath explains. It turns out that varying the thickness of this porous catalyst produces a double effect: As the porous inverse opal get thicker, the catalyst more strongly promotes the production of CO from CO2 by up to three times, while also suppressing an alternative reaction, the production of H2 (hydrogen gas), by as much as tenfold. Using this combined effect, production of CO can be easily varied to make up anywhere from 5 to 85 percent of the reaction s output. The study s results provide fundamental insights that may be applicable to designing other catalyst materials for fuel production from CO2. This advance represents just one step in the conversion of carbon dioxide into usable fuels, and the initial demonstration is just at a small laboratory scale. So, much work still remains for this to become a practical approach to manufacturing transportation fuels. But because the selectivity and efficiency of this initial conversion step places an upper limit on the overall efficiency of fuel production from CO2, in technical terms, Surendranath says, the work provides key fundamental insight into how to engineer carbon-neutral technologies for replacing existing fossil-fuel systems   while still being able to use all of the existing infrastructure of gas stations, delivery vehicles, and storage tanks. Ultimately, conversion plants could be connected directly to the emissions flow from fossil-fuel power plants, for example, to turn the CO2 into fuel instead of releasing it into the atmosphere at all.  We re very optimistic  that the process can be successfully developed, Surendranath says. If so, that could represent  the closing of the anthropogenic carbon cycle,  through the use of renewably generated electricity to turn greenhouse gas emissions into fuel. In essence, he says, the net process would be doing the same thing that plants and cyanobacteria did on Earth millions of years ago to produce fossil fuels in the first place: taking carbon dioxide out of the air and converting it into more complex molecules. But in this case, instead of taking place over millennia, the process needs to be replicated very quickly in a lab or factory.  It s the same thing that got us these fuels in the first place,  he says,  but we need to do it faster and more efficiently than natural photosynthesis.  This paper could have  huge impacts on the basic science of important reactions to produce fuels,  says Ken Sakaushi, a researcher at the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan, who was not involved in this research.  Recently, many works just focus on the application side and thus make less of a contribution on basic science. However, this work seems to try to contribute to this important issue on science from the basics.  Because of that, this research has  high value,  he says.

However, as these circuits become more complex, the genetic components can interfere with each other, making it difficult to achieve more complicated functions.  MIT researchers have now demonstrated that these circuits can be isolated within individual synthetic  cells,  preventing them from disrupting each other. The researchers can also control communication between these cells, allowing for circuits or their products to be combined at specific times.  It s a way of having the power of multicomponent genetic cascades, along with the ability to build walls between them so they won t have cross-talk. They won t interfere with each other in the way they would if they were all put into a single cell or into a beaker,  says Edward Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT. Boyden is also a member of MIT s Media Lab and McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and an HHMI-Simons Faculty Scholar. This approach could allow researchers to design circuits that manufacture complex products or act as sensors that respond to changes in their environment, among other applications. Boyden is the senior author of a paper describing this technique in the Nov. 14 issue of Nature Chemistry. The paper s lead authors are former MIT postdoc Kate Adamala, who is now an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, and former MIT grad student Daniel Martin-Alarcon. Katriona Guthrie-Honea, a former MIT research assistant, is also an author of the paper. Circuit control The MIT team encapsulated their genetic circuits in droplets known as liposomes, which have a fatty membrane similar to cell membranes. These synthetic cells are not alive but are equipped with much of the cellular machinery necessary to read DNA and manufacture proteins. By segregating circuits within their own liposomes, the researchers were able to create separate circuit subroutines that could not run in the same container at the same time, but can run in parallel to each other, communicating in controlled ways. This approach also allows scientists to repurpose the same genetic tools, including genes and transcription factors (proteins that turn genes on or off), to do different tasks within a network.  If you separate circuits into two different liposomes, you could have one tool doing one job in one liposome, and the same tool doing a different job in the other liposome,  Martin-Alarcon says.  It expands the number of things that you can do with the same building blocks.  This approach also enables communication between circuits from different types of organisms, such as bacteria and mammals. As a demonstration, the researchers created a circuit that uses bacterial genetic parts to respond to a molecule known as theophylline, a drug similar to caffeine. When this molecule is present, it triggers another molecule known as doxycycline to leave the liposome and enter another set of liposomes containing a mammalian genetic circuit. In those liposomes, doxycycline activates a genetic cascade that produces luciferase, a protein that generates light. Using a modified version of this approach, scientists could create circuits that work together to produce biological therapeutics such as antibodies, after sensing a particular molecule emitted by a brain cell or other cell.  If you think of the bacterial circuit as encoding a computer program, and the mammalian circuit is encoding the factory, you could combine the computer code of the bacterial circuit and the factory of the mammalian circuit into a unique hybrid system,  Boyden says. The researchers also designed liposomes that can fuse with each other in a controlled way. To do that, they programmed the cells with proteins called SNAREs, which insert themselves into the cell membrane. There, they bind to corresponding SNAREs found on surfaces of other liposomes, causing the synthetic cells to fuse. The timing of this fusion can be controlled to bring together liposomes that produce different molecules. When the cells fuse, these molecules are combined to generate a final product. More modularity The researchers believe this approach could be used for nearly any application that synthetic biologists are already working on. It could also allow scientists to pursue potentially useful applications that have been tried before but abandoned because the genetic circuits interfered with each other too much.  The way that we wrote this paper was not oriented toward just one application,  Boyden says.  The basic question is: Can you make these circuits more modular? If you have everything mishmashed together in the cell, but you find out that the circuits are incompatible or toxic, then putting walls between those reactions and giving them the ability to communicate with each other could be very useful.  Vincent Noireaux, an associate professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, described the MIT approach as  a rather novel method to learn how biological systems work.   Using cell-free expression has several advantages: Technically the work is reduced to cloning (nowadays fast and easy), we can link information processing to biological function like living cells do, and we work in isolation with no other gene expression occurring in the background,  says Noireaux, who was not involved in the research. Another possible application for this approach is to help scientists explore how the earliest cells may have evolved billions of years ago. By engineering simple circuits into liposomes, researchers could study how cells might have evolved the ability to sense their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.  This system can be used to model the behaviour and properties of the earliest organisms on Earth, as well as help establish the physical boundaries of Earth-type life for the search of life elsewhere in the solar system and beyond,  Adamala says.

But what about people who have inherited gene variants known to increase risk? A study led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators has found that, even among those at high genetic risk, following a healthy lifestyle can cut in half the probability of a heart attack or similar event. Their report is receiving early online publication in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions.  The basic message of our study is that DNA is not destiny,  says Sekar Kathiresan, MD, director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), senior author of the NEJM report.  Many individuals   both physicians and members of the general public   have looked on genetic risk as unavoidable, but for heart attack that does not appear to be the case.  In order to investigate whether a healthy lifestyle can mitigate genetic risk, the multi-institutional research team analyzed genetic and clinical data from more than 55,000 participants in four large-scale studies. Three of these   the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Women s Genome Health Study, and the Malm  Diet and Cancer Study   are prospective studies that have followed participants for up to 20 years. The fourth, the BioImage Study, assessed a variety of risk factors, including the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries when participants joined the study. Each participant in the current analysis was assigned a genetic risk score, based on whether they carried any of 50 gene variants that previous studies associated with elevated heart attack risk. Based on data gathered when participants entered each study, the investigators used four AHA-defined lifestyle factors   no current smoking; lack of obesity, defined as a body mass index less than 30; physical exercise at least once a week, and a healthy dietary pattern   to determine a lifestyle score, whether participants had a favorable (three or four healthy factors), intermediate (two factors) or unfavorable (one or no healthy factors) lifestyle. For participants in the prospective studies, the research team investigated how each individual s genetic risk score and lifestyle factors related to the incidence of heart attack, the need for procedures designed to open blocked coronary arteries, or sudden cardiac death. Among participants in the BioImage study, genetic and lifestyle factors were compared to the extent of atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries at baseline. Across all three prospective studies, a higher genetic risk score significantly increased the incidence of coronary events   as much as 90 percent in those at highest risk. While known risk factors such as a family history and elevated LDL cholesterol were also associated with an elevated genetic risk score, genetic risk was the most powerful contributor to cardiac risk. Similarly, each healthy lifestyle factor reduced risk, and the unfavorable lifestyle group also had higher levels of hypertension, diabetes and other known risk factors upon entering the studies. Within each genetic risk category, the presence of lifestyle factors significantly altered the risk of coronary events to such an extent that following a favorable lifestyle could reduce the incidence of coronary events by 50 percent in those with the highest genetic risk scores. Among participants in the BioImage study, both genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with levels of calcium-containing plaque in the coronary arteries, and healthy lifestyle factors were associated with less extensive plaque within each genetic risk group.  Some people may feel they cannot escape a genetically determined risk for heart attack, but our findings indicate that following a healthy lifestyle can powerfully reduce genetic risk,  says Kathiresan, who is director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and an associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Now we need to investigate whether specific lifestyle factors have stronger impacts and conduct studies in more diverse populations, since most of the participants in these studies are white.

The companies will collaborate to support OpGen s development of rapid DNA tests and a genomic knowledgebase of antibiotic-resistant pathogens for predicting antibiotic susceptibility based on test results. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck will provide access to its archive of over 200,000 bacterial pathogens gathered over the last 15 years through the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), one of the world s largest surveillance studies of antimicrobial resistance supported by Merck in collaboration with International Health Management Associates (IHMA). OpGen will perform genomic analysis, microbiology testing for drug resistance, and incorporate this information into its Acuitas  Lighthouse Knowledgebase and the development of rapid DNA tests. This new molecular testing and informatics approach is being developed to help transform antibiotic decision making for doctors managing acute care patients with blood, respiratory, urinary tract, and soft tissue infections. In addition to identifying resistance determinants to predict antibiotic failures, the OpGen technology is being evaluated as the foundation for utilizing molecular diagnostic tests to predict pathogen susceptibility and guide patient management choices to improve patient outcomes.  This collaboration builds upon the promise of our DNA-based genetic tests, Lighthouse Knowledgebase and antibiotic resistance decision making tools to make a significant impact on hospital infections,  said Evan Jones, chairman and CEO of OpGen.  Access to Merck s SMART surveillance network data has the potential to greatly accelerate our internal development efforts in validating our rapid diagnostic tools and bolster data acquisition for our Lighthouse Knowledgebase.  Recent studies have indicated that antimicrobial resistant infections currently claim 50,000 lives each year across the United States and Europe alone, with many hundreds of thousands more dying in other areas of the world. In September, world leaders at the United Nations called rising antimicrobial resistance a fundamental threat to human health, development, and security. As a result, for the first time, Heads of State committed to taking a broad, coordinated approach to combat rising antimicrobial resistance including the development of new medicines and rapid diagnostics.  Rapid diagnostics for pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing are central to developing global solutions for antimicrobial resistance,  said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, Infectious Diseases and Vaccines Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories.  By providing OpGen with access to our archive of bacterial pathogens, we hope to expedite the development of rapid diagnostic tests and enable prompt and informed antibiotic prescribing to improve patient outcomes.  OpGen will initially perform molecular analyses on up to 10,000 pathogens to identify markers of resistance to support rapid decision making using the Acuitas Lighthouse  MDRO Management System ( Lighthouse Portal ), and to speed development of OpGen s rapid diagnostic platforms. OpGen s Lighthouse Portal and Knowledgebase are being developed to provide antibiotic stewardship and tracking information for drug resistant pathogens in hospitals and health systems. Merck will gain access to the high-resolution genotype data for the SMART isolates as well as access to OpGen s Lighthouse Portal to support internal research and development programs.

If approved, the universal gene panel could be the first of its kind in the United States, and would serve as a companion diagnostic (CDx) utilized to select patients for specific NSCLC therapies. The test would also be accessible to global pharmaceutical companies for ongoing development of therapeutic drugs. The universal CDx is designed to simultaneously screen patient tumor samples for multiple gene variants with a single test - minimizing the need to perform numerous sequential tests that identify individual biomarkers one at a time. Sequential testing is difficult in NSCLC cases. Samples are often limited and can create the need for additional invasive and sometimes dangerous biopsies if the tissue is depleted before a complete genetic profile is obtained. This traditional approach can also significantly delay identification of the right treatment, time that the patient often does not have given the rapid progression of the disease and that it is often detected at later stages. Alternatively, the Oncomine Universal Dx Test can return genetic data in less than five days using just 10ng of DNA.  As pharmaceutical companies shift toward developing new targeted therapies as opposed to 'one-size-fits-all' drugs, there is a clear need to more efficiently stratify cancer patients and tailor their treatments to enable better health outcomes,  said Joydeep Goswami, president of clinical next generation sequencing at Thermo Fisher Scientific.  A companion diagnostic of this kind holds the promise to make precision medicine a reality. We are excited to reach this significant milestone, which brings us a step closer to realizing the potential that targeted NGS may bring to advance treatment for cancer patients.  The Oncomine Universal Dx Test has been optimized as part of Thermo Fisher s previously announced long-term collaboration with Novartis and Pfizer aimed at driving a paradigm shift in the way cancer patients are selected for drug therapies and the speed at which new NSCLC drugs are developed and registered. Thermo Fisher s PMA submission includes clinical and analytical claims associated with NSCLC biomarkers, and comes after the successful completion of clinical trials using patient samples provided by Novartis and Pfizer. The end-to-end, highly sensitive solution has been developed using Thermo Fisher s Oncomine and AmpliSeq technologies and validated on the Ion PGM Dx System. The genes and biomarkers included in the test were selected from the Oncomine Knowledgebase, one of the world s largest collections of curated oncology data, and confirmed with industry-leading pharmaceutical partners.

The human visual system is trichromatic: in the retina, the light-sensitive organ of the eye, there are three classes of photoreceptors (cones) tuned preferentially to three different bands of the visible spectrum. This implies that we can see a large number of colors (more than monochromatic and dichromatic animals, less than those with 4, even 5 types of photoreceptor). ""We are particularly efficient at distinguishing red from green,"" says Rumiati. This sophistication testifies to the fact that we are ""visual animals,"" unlike others, dogs, for example, who depend on their sense of smell. ""It is mainly the color of food that guides us, and our experiments show how,"" explains Rumiati. ""To date, only a few studies have been focused on the topic.""

Learn More: Decoding characteristic food odors ""In natural foods, color is a good predictor of calories,"" explains Francesco Foroni, SISSA researcher and first author of the study. ""The redder an unprocessed food is, the more likely it is to be nutritious, while green foods tend to be low in calories."" Our visual system is clearly adapted to this regularity. ""The participants in our experiments judged foods whose color tended towards red as higher in calories, while the opposite was true for greens,"" continues Giulio Pergola, a researcher at the University of Bari, and one of the authors of the study. ""This is also true for processed, or cooked foods, where color loses its effectiveness as an indicator of calories."" Actually, the scientific literature shows clearly that cooked foods are favored over natural foods and the phenomenon has been observed even in other species besides humans. ""Cooked foods are always preferred because, compared to natural foods, there is more nutrition for the same quantity,"" explains Rumiati. ""With cooked foods, however, the dominance of red over green no longer provides reliable information, which might lead us to believe that the brain would not apply the rule to processed foods. On the contrary, it does, which hints at the presence of ancient evolutionary mechanisms from before the introduction of cooking."" Don't Miss: Research indicates food craving is  hard-wired  in the brain Another nod in favor of this hypothesis is the fact that the color code in the Rumiati and colleagues experiments does not come into play for items other than food: ""The preference for red over green is not observed with non-edible objects,"" says Rumiati. ""This means that the color code of the visual system activates correctly only with food stimuli.""

""Adolescent binge drinking not only is dangerous to the brain development of teenagers, but also may impact the brains of their children,"" said senior author Toni Pak, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. The study by Dr. Pak, first author Anna Dorothea Asimes, a PhD student in Dr. Pak's lab, and colleagues was presented November 14, 2016 at Neuroscience 2016, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. The study, which was based on an animal model, found that adolescent binge drinking altered the on-off switches of multiple genes in the brains of offspring. When genes are turned on, they instruct cells to make proteins, which ultimately control physical and behavioral traits. The study found that in offspring, genes that normally are turned on were turned off, and vice versa. Teenage binge drinking is a major health concern in the United States, with 21 percent of teenagers reporting they have done it during the past 30 days. Among drinkers under age 21, more than 90 percent of the alcohol is consumed during binge drinking episodes. Binge drinking is defined as raising the blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 percent, the legal driving limit, within two hours (generally about five drinks for a male and four drinks for a female). In the study, one group of adolescent male and female rats was exposed to alcohol in amounts comparable to six binge drinking episodes. The rats mated after becoming sober and the females remained sober during their pregnancies. (Thus, any effects on offspring could not be attributed to fetal alcohol syndrome). The alcohol-exposed rats were compared to a control group of rats that were not exposed to alcohol. In the offspring of alcohol-exposed rats, researchers examined genes in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in many functions, including reproduction, response to stress, sleep cycles and food intake. Researchers looked for molecular changes to DNA that would reverse the on-off switches in individual genes. They found 159 such changes in the offspring of binge-drinking mothers, 93 gene changes in the offspring of binge-drinking fathers and 244 gene changes in the offspring of mothers and fathers who both were exposed to binge drinking. The study is the first to show a molecular pathway that teenage binge drinking by either parent can cause changes in the neurological health of subsequent generations. While findings from an animal model do not necessarily translate to humans, there are significant similarities between the study's animal model and humans, including their metabolism of alcohol, the function of the hypothalamus, and the pattern and amount of binge drinking, Pak said.

The sound of that gate opening on subsequent walks will elicit an emotional response, and the power of this response will be different if the dog was a German shepherd or a poodle. Through repeated experiences, the neighborhood, the gate and the dog all become part of the brain's emotional memory system. See Also: Researchers stimulate human amygdala for first time; breathing loss recorded The core of this system the amygdala forges indelible links of experience when we are attacked or threatened but, thanks to the power of expectation, the strength of these emotional memories is proportional to the unpleasantness of the experience. ""Forming an emotional memory is all about learning and calibrating our internal expectations with repeated external stimuli from the environment,"" says Joshua Johansen, a team leader at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute. An instructive signal like a dog attack should startle you and your amygdala the first time it happens, but over time, both your brain activity and your behavior will temper the reaction to the dog attack once you learn to expect when and how it happens, for example on a particular street, outside of a particular house. In a study published in Nature Neuroscience, Johansen and colleagues discovered a neural circuit that can temper the strength of emotional memories by restraining the amygdala's over-responsiveness to expected but unpleasant stimuli. In the key experiment, rats were trained to learn the association between a mild shock and a preceding sound. The initially unexpected shocks strongly activated the lateral amygdala which, in turn, led to fearful freezing behavior in response to the sound. This freezing behavior increased with higher shock intensities, but once this association was learned, the shock-related activity in amygdala neurons diminished. ""The first unpleasant experience sets off an 'instructive' signal, which is gradually turned off as the amygdala learns to use the sound to predict the shock,"" explains Johansen. Learn More: Maturing brain flips function of amygdala in regulating stress hormones How neural circuits in the amygdala generate such 'predictions' to calibrate memory formation was unknown. The authors traced the origin of this modulation to a bundle of axons that leave the amygdala and flow into the PAG, a midbrain area that processes pain. There, the axons are well-positioned to dampen pain-related neural signals like shocks before they reach higher brain areas. The authors hypothesized that this circuit generates 'prediction error' signals that indicate how much an expectation differs from what actually happens, which are then used by the amygdala and other brain areas to set emotional memory strength and expectation levels. If their idea was correct, then artificial inhibition of the amygdala-PAG circuit should interfere with normal prediction errors and expectations. Indeed, when they shut down a well-trained circuit, neurons in the lateral amygdala responded as if the shocks were being experienced for the first time. Johansen added, ""By disrupting the circuit we deprive the amygdala of feedback, reset its learning level, and the shock memory becomes hyper-emotional, causing rats to freeze more."" The authors concluded that this neural circuit calibrates memory strength and helps the brain to form appropriate emotional memories. ""We think that prediction-error signaling in such feedback-type neural circuits represents a general principle for brain learning systems,"" says Johansen. ""Because the feedback originates very early in the pain pathway, the nervous system can broadcast the prediction error to many brain areas like the amygdala, where it is then used to fine-tune memories."" Understanding this circuit may also shed light on what might go wrong when feedback is absent. ""PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is fear learning that has compounded over numerous exposures to bad experiences, like multiple tours of combat duty,"" says Johansen. Such intense repeated activation of learning circuits could disturb normal prediction error signals in some individuals and make mildly aversive experiences seem much worse than they actually are. Read Next: First direct evidence for ultra-fast responses in human amygdala to fearHuman brain imaging studies on predicting unpleasant experiences indicate a related role for the PAG and amygdala. Johansen speculates that similar circuits that set memory strength based on prediction errors could perturb expectations in anxious people, a hypothesis deserving of further study.

The research reveals that macrophages can  drill  through tumors to create new vessel-like structures for delivering oxygen and nutrients as tumors grow.  This may represent a whole new therapeutic target for treating tumors,  said TSRI Professor Martin Friedlander, senior author of the new study, which was published November 11 in the journal Scientific Reports. A Different Kind of Vessel Blood vessels are normally built by endothelial cells. In cancer, tumor cells can induce endothelial cells to build new vessels to bring in blood rich with oxygen and nutrients, a process called angiogenesis. Recent research has revealed that not all vessels are lined by endothelial cells. In cancer, vessel-like structures can be created by a non-endothelial cell type. This phenomenon, called  vascular mimicry,  has been observed in several types of solid tumors, including glioblastoma, breast cancer and melanoma, and has been attributed to a sub-population of cells within the tumor called cancer stem cells. Yet the scientists in this study found that macrophages can form vascular mimicry channels in tumors, as well as in other low-oxygen environments. Although macrophages are key cells of the immune system that recognize and attack foreign invaders and cancer cells, macrophages can be re-programmed within the tumor environment to promote tumor growth. The scientists in the new study presented a new and unrecognized structural role for macrophages in the formation of a vascular mimicry network connected to the systemic circulation.  These conduits have an architecture distinct from that of traditional blood vessels,  said Faith H. Barnett, a cancer researcher and neurosurgeon at Scripps Clinic who served as co-first author of the study with Mauricio Rosenfeld. Using an intravenously injected dye to delineate the established vasculature as well as the newly formed vascular mimicry conduits, the researchers found that macrophages quickly migrate to oxygen-deprived environments and form these vessel-like channels. Experiments spearheaded by Barnett and Rosenfeld showed that these tubular structures are lined with cells that express macrophage cell surface markers.  Macrophages are capable of forming a three-dimensional network,  said Rosenfeld. These vessel-like channels appeared too small to carry red blood cells, but the researchers believe that the low oxygen concentrations within tumors drive macrophages to form this network of channels to transport dissolved oxygen and glucose. A Possible Cancer Target The findings could explain why current drugs to slow angiogenesis do not slow tumor growth in some patients. Friedlander said future cancer therapies could starve tumors by combining current vessel-targeting drugs with drugs to influence macrophage activity.  There may be an opportunity to intervene therapeutically,  Friedlander said. Source: Story from The Scripps Research Institute.

For their results, they used computational metabolomics and information theory. This approach was specifically designed for this study and enabled the researchers to study plant metabolism at the level of single organs. This new method allows for a more efficient access to the diversity of plant metabolites and for a more rapid identification of the genes which regulate their biosynthesis. Plants are master organic chemists. They are able to produce very complex blends of different chemical substances. The biosynthesis and the accumulation of plant secondary metabolites are physiologically adapted to the individual requirements in the respective plant tissues. A team of scientists led by Emmanuel Gaquerel from the University of Heidelberg and Ian Baldwin from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology has now analyzed the metabolome, the entire set of chemicals, in the tissues of the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata.  The following questions were of central interest: Which plant tissues exhibit distinct metabolic profiles, which plant secondary metabolites are primarily accumulated locally in the tissues of particular organs, and finally, how can this information contribute to the identification of the genes that regulate metabolite production? To answer these questions, the researchers harnessed the emerging research field of metabolomics and developed new computational methods for the assessment of analytical data retrieved from the mass spectrometric substance analyses. The goal of metabolome research is to identify and quantify the entirety of metabolites of an organism and their interactions.  We implemented a workflow that allows metabolite spectra to be rapidly aligned so as to make predictions about metabolite identity,  Emmanuel Gaquerel explains.  Computational metabolomics encompasses all bioinformatics approaches that facilitate computer-based inferences on the annotation of unknown metabolites from large-scale complex metabolomics data.  For their study, the scientists analyzed the metabolic profiles of 14 different dissected tissues of tobacco plants, such as the floral organs, the stem, leaves, seeds and roots.  We had expected that the metabolic profiles of floral organs would differ significantly from other parts of the plant. However, there were also considerable differences between the individual floral organs. The very high degree of metabolic specialization we found in the anthers of tobacco flowers came as a particular surprise,  Dapeng Li, first author of the study and a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute, reports. The anthers belong to the stamens, which are considered the male parts of a flower. They contain the pollen sacs in which pollen is produced. Anthers contain specific phenolic derivatives, which have also been found in the pollen coat in previous studies. The biosynthesis of these phenolic derivatives and their accumulation in the anthers substantially contribute to the unique metabolic profile of the male reproduction organs.  The application of tools and concepts based on information theory approaches in order to score metabolic diversity facilitated new insights into the function of single substances in this study. The key idea is to consider tissue metabolic diversity as a type of information, like any other, which can be statistically analyzed. In order to link metabolic function to individual genes, the scientists developed an atlas of genes and secondary metabolites which share similar activation patterns in the different tissues of tobacco plants. Based on these patterns, they were able to identify candidate genes which may be responsible for regulating the biosynthesis of ecologically-important secondary metabolite. Particularly with respect to metabolites whose biosynthesis has not yet been elucidated, this new approach has a trend-setting potential and will contribute considerably to further research in plant metabolism.

The study, led by principal investigator Tracy Grikscheit, MD, a pediatric surgeon and scientist at The Saban Research Institute of CHLA, was published this week in the online version of the journal Tissue Engineering. Lung disease causes more than 200,000 deaths annually in the United States. Although the lung is generally considered slow to respond to disease and injury, it does undergo regenerative processes, most of which are not fully understood. Building an understanding of these processes might lead to harnessing these innate mechanisms to help damaged lungs repair.  A first step is a proper three-dimensional model in which the disease process can be studied. Previously, Grikscheit s lab developed tissue-engineered small intestine (TESI) and showed that this regenerated tissue was functional and contained all of the key components of the native tissue. The Grikscheit lab employed a similar strategy to recapitulate the human lung and trachea, transplanting stem and progenitor cells on biodegradable polymer scaffolds.  The tissue that grows from this strategy is termed tissue-engineered lung or TELu. Transplanting regionally specific lung tissue (proximal or distal) from mice and humans generates TELu with typical location-specific tissue markers such as particular alveolar or air sac cells in the distal TELu or tracheal epithelial cells organized with cartilage and ciliated appendages for proximal lung.  TEtrach, or tissue-engineered trachea, grew from the most proximal cells.  We think that understanding lung regeneration in this model will allow several steps forward,  said Grikscheit, who is also a tenured associate professor of Surgery at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.  For example, advanced stages of disease can be studied with TELu that would be impossible to fully understand in our patients.  Likewise,we can more quickly apply many more therapies in this model in order to   hopefully   deliver future human therapies.

Monoclonal antibodies are revolutionizing our approach to many diseases in oncology and rheumatology,  said Edgar T. Overton, M.D., co-director of the UAB Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic.  In this study, we tested whether a broadly neutralizing antibody against HIV could stop replicating virus. While a single antibody only modestly delayed viral rebound, we demonstrated that this strategy can be improved and potentially lead us to effective therapeutic HIV vaccine strategies. We are excited to pursue this approach in our ongoing efforts to end the HIV epidemic.  Two clinical trials were conducted under the National Institutes of Health and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group in 24 HIV-1 infected individuals undergoing analytical treatment interruption, which measures changes in immunological response. The open-label trial in which both the researchers and participants were aware of the administered treatment showed that markers of HIV virus replication were suppressed for at least four weeks after the VRC01 was administered and HIV treatment was stopped, but all participants failed to maintain durable viral suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Further studies looking at more potent antibodies and combinations of bNAbs like VRC01 will likely be required to achieve sustained remission of the virus in HIV-1 infected individuals after halting ART.  We are excited to be on the forefront of the global efforts to end AIDS,  Overton said. Source: Story from University of Alabama at Birmingham. Original piece written by Alicia Rohan.

The team consists of researchers from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Grenoble, France and the Department of Physics in Kerbala, Iraq. The interactions of molecules in liquids determines chemical reactions and biological processes. In ordinary liquids, the interactions between the molecules is too strong and overshadows the subtle features of rotations. By choosing a very special liquid composed of helium atoms the researchers reduced the strength of the molecular interactions so that they had the chance to see single molecules rotating. Lead author Dr Klaus von Haeften from the University of Leicester Department of Physics and Astronomy said:  To introduce molecules into the liquid helium we had to excite the helium using a discharge.   This was necessary because ordinary molecules would freeze once they are introduced into liquid helium. By exciting helium in the discharge tiny gas bubbles were formed.  The researchers observed that by applying pressure the molecules within these bubbles would collide with the ultra-cold liquid and begin to cool and slow down their rotations. This happened at a rate of more than 100 billion degrees Kelvin per second. At pressures of several atmospheres the molecules reached the slowest possible rotational speed. The researchers believe that with these molecules they can investigate liquid helium at even lower temperatures. At these temperatures friction disappears, and the team expects to be able to measure with great precision how molecules respond to this 'superfluid' state. Dr von Haeften added:  The results of these studies in liquid helium will also be important to understand ordinary liquids, where such observations are impossible to make.  This may trigger new applications of drugs for diagnostics and therapy and the development of new materials.  Source: Story from the University of Leicester.

But it may be a long-term health risk for children up to 10 years of age who consume high amounts of foods containing this substance. EFSA also found that levels of erucic acid present in animal feed may be a health risk for chickens.  Erucic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, which is present in the oil-rich seeds of the Brassicaceae family of plants, particularly rapeseed and mustard. It mainly enters the food chain when rapeseed oil is used in industrial food processing and home cooking in some countries. It is present in pastries, cakes and infant/follow-on formulae and is also found in some animal feed (e.g. rapeseed meal). Although natural forms of rapeseed and mustard contain high levels of erucic acid (over 40% of total fatty acids), levels in rapeseed cultivated for food use are typically below 0.5%. In 1976 the EU set maximum limits for erucic acid as a contaminant in vegetable oils and fats, and foods containing added vegetable oils and fats as an ingredient. Also, specific maximum limits for infant formulae and follow-on formulae were set five times lower than for other foods. EFSA was asked for a new risk assessment as part of a review of these maximum levels. Heart condition Tests on animals show that ingesting oils containing erucic acid over time can lead to a heart condition called myocardial lipidosis. This is temporary and reversible. Other potential effects observed in animals   including changes in the weight of the liver, kidney and skeletal muscle   occur at slightly higher doses. Based on this information, experts on EFSA s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) established a tolerable daily intake of 7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg bw) per day. High-consuming children Average consumer exposure ranges from 0.3 to 4.4 mg/kg bw per day across age groups. But among consumers with higher exposure, infants and other children could be exposed to up to 7.4 mg/kg bw per day. The experts noted however that they are likely to have overestimated this risk to account for limitations in the available scientific information. For most consumers, especially for toddlers (1-2 years old) and other children (3-10), the main contributors to erucic acid exposure in the diet are pastries, cakes and biscuits. For infants (0-12 months), infant formulae is the main source. Risks to animals The CONTAM Panel s scientific opinion also covers the risks for animal health from exposure to erucic acid. In pigs, feed levels of erucic acid are unlikely to represent a health concern. EFSA experts said there may be a health risk for poultry but noted that the calculation method used overestimated exposure. The risk for ruminants (cattle, sheep and other species), horses, fish and rabbits could not be assessed as no adequate data were available. Scientific follow-up To address information gaps, the Panel recommended further data collection on erucic acid concentrations in processed foods such as fine bakery wares and food for infants and small children. Levels in animal-derived products (meat, milk, eggs) transferred through animal feed would also be useful. New toxicity studies could also improve understanding on the effects for humans and animals, particularly for target livestock animals and fish. Source: Story from European Food Safety Authority.

The disposable test could be used for HIV patients to monitor their own treatment. Furthermore, the technology could enable patients with HIV to be managed more effectively in remote locations. New research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, shows the device is not only very accurate, but can produce a result in under 30 minutes. The new technology monitors the amount of virus in the bloodstream. This is crucial to monitoring a patient s treatment. Current tests to detect the amount of virus take at least three days, often longer, and involves sending a blood sample to a laboratory.  In many parts of the world, particularly those with the highest number of HIV infections, such testing does not exist at all. The current treatment for HIV, called anti-retroviral treatment, reduces virus levels to near zero. However, in some cases the medication may stop working   perhaps because the HIV virus has developed resistance to the drugs. The first indication of this would be a rise in virus levels in the bloodstream. Furthermore, regularly monitoring of viral levels enables healthcare teams to check a patient is taking their medication. Stopping medication fuels HIV drug-resistance, which is an emerging global problem. Viral levels cannot be detected by routine HIV tests which use antibodies, as these can only tell whether a person has been infected. Monitoring Viral load is crucial Dr Graham Cooke, senior author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial explained: ""HIV treatment has dramatically improved over the last 20 years - to the point that many diagnosed with the infection now have a normal life expectancy. ""However, monitoring viral load is crucial to the success of HIV treatment. At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result. We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.  Dr Cooke added that this technology, although in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in much the same way that people with diabetes check their blood sugar levels. The technology could be particularly powerful in remote regions in sub-Saharan Africa, which may not have easy access to testing facilities. Finding out quickly if a patient, particularly a baby, is infected with the virus is crucial to their long term health and survival. The device, which uses a mobile phone chip, just needs small sample of blood. This is placed onto a spot on the USB stick. If any HIV virus is present in the sample, this triggers a change in acidity which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. This is sent to the USB stick, which produces the result in a programme on a computer or electronic device. In the latest research, the technology tested 991 blood samples with 95 per cent accuracy. The average time to produce a result was 20.8 minutes. Source: Story from Imperial College London. Original piece written by Kate Wighton.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-repurposing-195806,Genetic Repurposing New study suggests that a mammalian bone and muscle gene may be repurposed to fuel cognition in humans ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A gene that regulates bone growth and muscle metabolism in mammals may take on an additional role as a promoter of brain maturation, cognition and learning in human and nonhuman primates, according to a new study led by neurobiologists at Harvard Medical School.  Describing their findings in the Nov. 10 issue of Nature, researchers say their work provides a dramatic illustration of evolutionary economizing and creative gene retooling mechanisms that contribute to the vast variability across species that share nearly identical set of genes yet differ profoundly in their physiology. The research reveals that osteocrin a gene found in the skeletal muscles of all mammals and well-known for its role in bone growth and muscle function is completely turned off in rodent brains yet highly active in the brains of nonhuman primates and humans. Notably, osteocrin was found predominantly in cells of the neocortex the most evolved part of the primate brain, which regulates sensory perception, spatial reasoning and higher-level thinking and language in humans.  The gene s marked presence in an area of the brain responsible for higher-level function and thought, the researchers said, suggests a possible role in the development of cognition, a cardinal feature that distinguishes the brains of human and nonhuman primates from those of other mammals.  Brain development in humans and other primates is profoundly affected by sensory experience and social interactions. Scientists have long sought to unravel genes in the brain that are turned on and off by experiences to fuel the rise of brain functions unique to such complex species. The HMS team s findings part of an ongoing quest to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie human brain development, function and disease reveal that osteocrin is precisely one such gene, activated by sensory stimulation. Furthermore, the team added, this is the first illustration of evolutionary gene repurposing in the brain.  We have uncovered what we believe is a critical clue into the evolution of the human brain, one that gives us a glimpse into the genetic mechanisms that may account for differences in cognition between mice and humans,  said senior investigator Michael Greenberg, the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and chair of the HMS Department of Neurobiology.  For their experiments, the team analysed RNA levels the molecular footprints of gene activity in the brain cells of mice, rats and humans. Although many of the same genes were activated in both mouse and human brain cells, the scientists observed, a small subset of genes was activated solely in human brain cells. Much to the scientists  surprise, the bone gene osteocrin was most highly expressed in the human brain, yet completely shut off in the brain cells of mice.  Going a step further, the scientists placed brain cells from all three species in lab dishes and chemically re-created conditions that mimic sensory stimulation. Chemical stimulation activated osteocrin selectively in excitatory neurons, so called for their role in stimulating rather than dampening nerve signalling. But researchers noted something even more intriguing: The activity of the gene was most intense in neurons of the neocortex, the topmost layer of cells covering the brain and responsible for higher-level cognition, such as long-term memory, thought and language. At the same time, osteocrin was noticeably absent from other parts of the brain responsible for noncognitive functions such as spatial navigation, balance, breathing, heart rate and temperature control. When researchers compared osteocrin levels to levels of another brain protein, BDNF, well known for its role in neuronal growth and repair, they noticed another striking difference. While BDNF was present throughout the brain, osteocrin was restricted to the neocortex and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala, an area of the brain thought to play a role in memory formation, decision making and emotional responses. Osteocrin was also markedly expressed in cells of the temporal lobe, which houses functions such as learning, memory and audio-visual processing and the occipital lobe, which houses the visual cortex, the area of the brain responsible for the processing of visual information. Further analysis revealed that in the primate brain, sensory stimulation appears to switch on osteocrin through a previously unknown DNA enhancer. Enhancers snippets of DNA that act as the genome s regulators are the  handles  that turn on some genes while shutting off others. In doing so, enhancers can profoundly alter genetic expression, fuelling dramatic differences between organisms with nearly identical DNA. The rodent versions of osteocrin lacked the stimulation-activated DNA enhancer, the analysis showed. In yet another critical observation, researchers found the osteocrin enhancer was, in turn, switched on by a protein called MEF2. Mutations in MEF2 are a well-established cause of intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders, so the link between the two begs further study, the researchers said, as it may portend a role for osteocrin in such developmental anomalies.  Humans share many genes with rodents and as much as 90 percent of their DNA in some parts of the genome,  says co-first author Gabriella Boulting, a neurobiologist at HMS.  In this case we see how turning up the expression of the same gene in a different location may precipitate dramatic differences in the function of brain cells.  Further analysis revealed that osteocrin s activation curbed the growth of neuronal dendrites branchlike projections responsible for transmitting signals from one brain cell to the next.  Restricting dendritic growth is a precision-enhancing mechanism, essential to ensuring that neuronal wires don t get crossed and compromise signal transmission from one cell to the next,  says study first co-author Bulent Ataman, a neurobiologist at HMS. This observation, Ataman added, suggests that osteocrin s activity may help enhance nerve cell agility and proper signal transmission to ensure robust communication across neurons. To confirm that the activity-induced gene expression observed in nerve cells in the lab also occurred in the functioning, intact brain, researchers temporarily blocked vision in one eye of a macaque, a common technique to study activity-triggered brain plasticity and visually-induced gene activation in the visual cortex. This proof-of-concept experiment, they surmised, would reveal whether osteocrin is, indeed, awakened by visual stimulation and shut off by its absence. A day later, the researchers observed that osteocrin expression was markedly higher in cells from the visually intact parts of the macaque brain, compared with cells in vision-deprived areas. The findings illustrate a foundational principle in neurobiology abnormal visual experiences can interfere with the development and function of brain cells in the visual cortex, a phenomenon first described more than 50 years ago by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, two of the founding members of the Department of Neurobiology at HMS. The two shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on visual information processing in the brain.   Nature and nurture interact to wire up the brain, and abnormal vision can alter that wiring,  said Margaret Livingstone, the Takeda Professor of Neurobiology at HMS.  Our observations reveal the molecular basis for what Hubel and Wiesel observed more than half a century ago.  Source: Story from Yale University. Original piece written by Ekaterina Pesheva.

The consequences can be fatal. Yet researchers do not fully understand how exposure to radiation triggers this damage at the molecular level. Led by Yale professor of immunobiology Richard Flavell, an international team of researchers studied the radiation response using animal models. They identified a novel mechanism of radiation-induced tissue injury involving a protein called AIM2, which can sense double-strand DNA damage and mediate a special form of cell death known as pyroptosis. They observed that in animals lacking AIM2, both the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow were protected from radiation. While the role of AIM2 as a sensor that detects infectious threats to the body was known, this study is the first to describe the protein s function in the detection of radiation damage to the chromosomes in the nucleus, said the researchers. When a cell receives a high dose of radiation, the DNA is broken into pieces, which can be joined together again. However, this aberrant rejoining of chromosomal fragments can lead to chromosomal abnormalities and cancer. Flavell and his team believe that when this chromosomal damage is inflicted, the AIM2 pathway is activated in order to kill the cell to avoid the deleterious consequences of these chromosomal translocations, such as those commonly seen in cancer cells. For this reason, the cells that accumulate this chromosomal damage are dangerous to the person or animal and are therefore killed by this AIM2 pathway. This pathway is beneficial to the person or animal under normal circumstances because it eliminates dangerous cells, but when a high dose of radiation is given the pathway is detrimental because it leads to bone marrow and digestive tract injury. These findings suggest that a drug that blocks or inhibits the AIM2 pathway could potentially limit the deleterious side effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy on cancer patients, said the researchers.

In 2013, the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES) recognized the importance of wildlife forensics, and in September, at the most recent CITES meeting in Johannesburg, forensics hit the mainstream. Several conference workshops and NGO seminars sought to teach airport officials and police different wildlife forensic techniques, such as how to take tissue samples, gather intelligence, and use genetic evidence. The parties also passed a resolution that encourages CITES members to create and maintain reference collections of wood samples that forensic scientists might use when analyzing wood they suspect has been illegally traded. Experts also presented the first-ever global survey of wildlife forensic labs.  Until recently, wildlife crime investigators largely focused on seizing contraband, identifying the species in a seized shipment, and prosecuting those caught red-handed   usually poachers lower down the criminal food chain.  The developing science of wildlife forensics, however, makes it possible for investigators to perform tests that were just dreams a decade or two ago. Separating out genetic and chemical markers from physical samples such as rhino horn or a piece of rosewood, forensic scientists can often tell the age of the sample, exactly where the animal or plant came from, what its parentage might be, and how this relates to other seized shipments. Sometimes, forensic scientists can even shed light on the structure of the criminal networks behind the trade by showing where poached animals and plants are killed, and what ports are used to transport them.  In recent years, trade in endangered wildlife has soared. Some scientists estimate that 40,000 African elephants are killed for their tusks each year, nearly 10 percent of the estimated wild population of 400,000. Only 5,000 black rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. Rhino poaching deaths have quadrupled since 2010. And those are just the most charismatic of the thousands of illegally traded species: Proboscis monkeys, rosewood, pangolin (an armadillo-like mammal), and many others suffer similar pressures.  In many countries where endangered wildlife is poached or traded, forensics is just beginning to gain traction. Experts universally lament the lack of funding, equipment, and international cooperation. But there are hopeful cases that show how the field could have a profound impact.   [There is] still insufficient capacity for conducting wildlife forensic casework, particularly in regions with the greatest need for the identification of CITES-listed species in trade,  the report states.  The review, prepared by the Society for Wildlife Forensic Science and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, tallied 110 questionnaire responses from 39 countries. The investigators found that only one-third of labs cooperated internationally, only one half operated according to any quality assurance standard, only one-quarter reported being involved in actual legal cases, and only six wildlife forensic labs in the world have been audited by any external accrediting agency.  The report does point out that standardization in the field remains in its infancy, and expresses hope that these numbers will increase in the next five years. But many issues   data sharing, lab and sample collecting standards, budgets   need to be worked out for wildlife forensics to reach its potential, experts say.  In 2013, CITES formally urged countries seizing elephant tusk shipments of more than half a ton to turn over samples within 90 days.   At this stage we receive samples several months or years after seizure and the matches are merely a matter of interest and to give an indication of the movement of the products, rather than evidence in prosecutions,  says Cindy Harper, director of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Genetics Laboratory that manages the rhODIS database at the University of Pretoria. She said it was vital to rapidly link all wildlife product seizures with international databases.  In the last five years, many countries have begun to invest in wildlife forensic labs, including Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Botswana, Kenya, and South Africa. The Society for Wildlife Forensic Science now has approximately 150 members in 60 labs around the world, and has begun to circulate an international test for certifying laboratories. Meanwhile, new methods are coming out of forensic labs all the time.  A new technique presented at the last CITES meetings enables law enforcement officials to measure isotopes in ivory, dating the age of seized tusks. Atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s released carbon-14 that was taken up by plants worldwide. That carbon-14 remains, gradually decreasing by a known amount each year. When elephants eat plants, some of that carbon-14 travels to their tusks, and scientists can pinpoint the year of an animal s death by measuring the amount of carbon-14 in a tusk. If a tusk dates from after 1989   when the global ivory trade was banned   it s probably illegal. Though this method has been used in a few cases, it is not widespread.

A home is burglarized. Investigators identify a suspect and find a sliver of what appears to be glass embedded in his shoe. In the forensics lab, examiners determine, using advanced microscopy and chemical analysis, that the characteristics of that sliver match those of the broken glass in the burgled home. Pretty strong evidence, right? Not so fast, says Shannan Williams, who manages the trace evidence research program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  If those characteristics are common, that sliver of glass might match half the windows in town. But if they re rare, the evidence can be extremely powerful.  That s why one of the most important tools available to trace evidence examiners is not a microscope or a chemical reagent, but a database. Besides glass, trace evidence includes hair and fibers, fire debris, metal, paint, adhesives, and explosives, to name just a few. Large databases that describe these materials and the variability among them make individual pieces of trace evidence far more powerful than they would be alone. Unfortunately, much data on trace evidence is scattered in databases at forensic labs and research departments where they are unavailable to the wider forensic community. But Williams and many others are working to change that. Many of those individuals attended a workshop at NIST on July 19-20, 2016, where experts discussed trace evidence databases and the steps needed to make them more useful and widely available. During his presentation, Claude Roux of the Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia, said that trace evidence faces an uncertain future as an investigative tool, in part because, unlike DNA evidence, it does not have the power to directly identify suspects. Roux argued that this emphasis on identification can lead people to undervalue trace evidence, which can be used to generate leads, eliminate suspects, reconstruct sequences of events, and identify links in serial crimes. Sandra Koch, who sits on the Materials Subcommittee of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science, presented findings that also pointed to an uncertain future for trace evidence. Koch surveyed trace evidence lab managers, with many reporting that trace evidence is often perceived as a  junk science  with little or no value. An increasing number also face shrinking budgets. In the face of these uncertainties, workshop participants discussed ways to increase the power of trace evidence through expanded access to trace evidence databases. In addition, experts from NIST, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Institute of Justice gave presentations on databases that their agencies make available to the forensic science community.  Workshop participants also discussed ways to make other trace evidence databases and collections many compiled by individual forensic laboratories during years of casework, others created by manufacturing companies more widely accessible to the forensic community. Williams hopes that these efforts will help ensure that trace evidence remains a vital tool for crime fighters.  Trace evidence databases are force multipliers,  Williams said.  They make every lab that uses them more effective.  Information about the Trace Evidence Workshop, including video and downloadable presentations, can be found here. Stay tuned for other outputs from the conference, which over the next several months will include a roadmap for prioritizing data expansion efforts for specific trace evidence types, and a  database of databases  that will list over 500 publicly available, online databases relevant to forensic investigations.

The findings, described online in the journal Forensic Science International, will assist law enforcement officials investigating overdose and death investigations involving illicit substances. New psychoactive substances have been associated with fatalities and severe injuries in a number of cases in the U.S. and have led investigators to rethink traditional drug monitoring protocols. Of particular interest are the variable phenethylamine chemical structures known as NBOMes. Given that compounds such as NBOMes are modified with the goal of avoiding detection by routine techniques, forensic laboratories are faced with the challenge of identifying these compounds quickly and accurately. Researchers  used a method known as Direct Sample Analysis Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS) to identify NBOMe compounds on blotter paper in as little as 15 seconds.  According to the researchers this technique will help increase the efficiency for forensic laboratories that are faced with growing caseloads and limited resources. An additional benefit is that TOFMS has the unique capacity to use data from previously analyzed drug material that couldn t be identified to be reevaluated for possible identification.  Over the past five to 10 years, types of illicit drugs used around the world have been created or repurposed from research chemicals to mimic the effects of traditional drugs of abuse in order to circumvent legal control and detection,  explained corresponding author Sabra Botch-Jones, MS, MA, D-ABFT, forensic toxicologist and instructor in the Biomedical Forensic Sciences program in the department of anatomy and neurobiology. Botch-Jones hopes that the development of this faster and more accurate analytical method will assist the public health sector and law enforcement in conducting risk assessments and implementing control measures for designer drugs. This research was performed in collaboration with PerkinElmer and the use of their instrumentation. Source:  Story from Boston University School of Medicine.

The system will cost around $5,000, which is about one-tenth the cost of systems commercially available, and represents an alternative to the traditional method of plaster casting, said Song Zhang, an associate professor in Purdue University's School of Mechanical Engineering. The project is funded with a $788,167, two-year grant from the National Institute of Justice. The portable 3-D imaging system will have ""auto-exposure control,"" allowing investigators with no technical expertise to take high-quality images, and an intuitive user interface. ""This is the biggest contribution we are making to the forensics community,"" said Zhang, director of Purdue's XYZT Lab. ""Current 3-D imaging products on the market are very difficult to use. You need expertise to be able to capture good images. What we want to do is bring in some intelligence to the algorithms so the forensic examiner just has to click a button to capture good images."" He will be working with two researchers in crime-scene forensics: forensic research scientist David Baldwin at the Special Technologies Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy-National Nuclear Security Administration facility in Santa Barbara, California; and retired forensic scientist and footwear and tire track examiner James R. Wolfe. The team also will include two doctoral students. The research team will work to develop a system that produces images with a resolution of 600 dpi. Such an innovation would provide more precise results than casting and would produce images immediately, whereas casting takes up to an hour. (A YouTube video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiaqiFOpb4) ""Most shoes have very small cracks from wear in addition to their design pattern, and our system will be able to capture these distinct features,"" Zhang said. ""These marks are unique to a specific shoe."" Zhang's team has invented a ""binary defocusing technique"" that provides accurate depth imaging by encoding data in LED light that is projected onto the snow or soil surface. The light bouncing back to the camera contains the pre-encoded information, allowing the system to determine the depth of surface features while using a single camera. A laptop computer will perform necessary computations needed to operate the projector and camera. Unlike some other systems, the new approach is ""eye-safe"" because it does not require the use of lasers. ""Our project has promise to deliver a device that will improve the quality and accuracy of tire and footwear impression evidence,"" Baldwin said. ""We plan to develop an affordable and easy-to-use system that will provide the forensic science community with more and better evidence from crime scenes."" One challenge is to develop a system capable of taking high-quality images of shoeprints and tire tracks on mixed soil and snow. ""Some substrates like snow and light sand pose major difficulties for crime-scene investigators when photographing and casting shoeprints and tire tracks,"" Wolfe said. ""This project has the potential to develop a system that can quickly obtain the 3-D detail in such impressions, maximizing the value of this type of evidence in a criminal investigation."" Another challenge is to take high-quality images for both diffuse and ""specular"" surfaces. Some objects evenly reflect light, which is said to be diffuse, whereas shiny objects reflect bright highlights. ""This specular light presents problems for 3-D imaging because cameras do not respond properly to those highlights,"" Zhang said. ""So we have to adapt our sensor to be able to deal with both specular and diffuse light."" Source: Story from Purdue University. Original piece written by Emil Venere.

Among youth with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the study found structural differences between the sexes in one part of the insula, a brain region that detects cues from the body and processes emotions and empathy. The insula helps to integrate one's feelings, actions and several other brain functions. See Also: MRI shows brain disruption in children with PTSDThe study, published in Depression and Anxiety, is the first to show differences between male and female PTSD patients in a part of the insula involved in emotion and empathy. ""The insula appears to play a key role in the development of PTSD,"" said the study's senior author, Victor Carrion, MD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford. ""The difference we saw between the brains of boys and girls who have experienced psychological trauma is important because it may help explain differences in trauma symptoms between sexes."" Among young people who are exposed to traumatic stress, some develop PTSD while others do not. People with PTSD may experience flashbacks of traumatic events; may avoid places, people and things that remind them of the trauma; and may suffer a variety of other problems, including social withdrawal and difficulty sleeping or concentrating. Prior research has shown that girls who experienced trauma are more likely to develop PTSD than boys who experience trauma, but scientists have been unable to determine why. Read Next: Does sexual aggression alter the female brain?The research team conducted MRI scans of the brains of 59 study participants ages 9-17. Thirty of them 14 girls and 16 boys had trauma symptoms, and 29 others the control group of 15 girls and 14 boys did not. The traumatized and nontraumatized participants had similar ages and IQs. Of the traumatized participants, five had experienced one episode of trauma, while the remaining 25 had experienced two or more episodes or had been exposed to chronic trauma. The researchers saw no differences in brain structure between boys and girls in the control group. However, among the traumatized boys and girls, they saw differences in a portion of the insula called the anterior circular sulcus. This brain region had larger volume and surface area in traumatized boys than in boys in the control group. In addition, the region's volume and surface area were smaller in girls with trauma than among girls in the control group. ""It is important that people who work with traumatized youth consider the sex differences,"" said Megan Klabunde, PhD, the study's lead author and an instructor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. ""Our findings suggest it is possible that boys and girls could exhibit different trauma symptoms and that they might benefit from different approaches to treatment."" Learn More: Imaging shows impact of PTSD in earthquake survivors The insula normally changes during childhood and adolescence, with smaller insula volume typically seen as children and teenagers grow older. Thus, the findings imply that traumatic stress could contribute to accelerated cortical aging of the insula in girls who develop PTSD, Klabunde said. ""There are some studies suggesting that high levels of stress could contribute to early puberty in girls,"" she said. The researchers also noted that their work may help scientists understand how experiencing trauma could play into differences between the sexes in regulating emotions. ""By better understanding sex differences in a region of the brain involved in emotion processing, clinicians and scientists may be able to develop sex-specific trauma and emotion dysregulation treatments,"" the authors write in the study. To better understand the findings, the researchers say what's needed next are longitudinal studies following traumatized young people of both sexes over time. They also say studies that further explore how PTSD might manifest itself differently in boys and girls, as well as tests of whether sex-specific treatments are beneficial, are needed.

The two companies will collaborate on the clinical analysis, annotation and interpretation of oncology cases processed through Philips  new precision medicine solution for oncology. This healthcare informatics solution integrates genomic information with full patient context to empower clinicians with precision diagnostics and therapeutics, to enable them to measure the success of precision healthcare programs. Profiling tumors using genomic information is critical for complex cancer cases, yet challenges remain in rapidly and accurately interpreting genomic findings in the context of a patient s condition. While most cancer patients have thousands of gene variants and mutations, only a small number actually drive the individual s specific cancer or may have actionable therapeutic implications for a particular patient. The Philips IntelliSpace Genomics solution, which uniquely integrates complete patient information, is coupled with N-of-One s rich experience and extensive knowledge-bases. For the first time, clinicians will have full access to N-of-One s variant database during the case filtering and interpretation process, providing them ready access to the vast amount of available reference literature, guidelines, and evidence, in a fully interactive framework. The aim is to help clinicians determine which treatment options, clinical trials or medications are best suited to a specific case. N-of-One has been a pioneer in the field, and by integrating their information directly on our IntelliSpace Genomics solution, we aim to reduce the turn-around time for these cancer cases,  said Louis Culot, General Manager, Philips Genomics.  Providing specialists with the most relevant treatment options through the analysis of each patient s unique molecular profile will help extend the reach and scale of personalized medicine. Philips is a clear leader in clinical informatics, integrating and managing big data in the healthcare settings,  said Chris Cournoyer, CEO of N-of-One.  We believe that incorporating N-of-One s Variant Database along with its patient case analysis and interpretation services will be further enabled by tight integration with this leading digital health solution. In addition to integrating and processing genomic information from an array of high-throughput platforms, IntelliSpace Genomics provides full traceability of data processing and cases for unprecedented reproducibility and audit of interpretation and results. Uniquely, it can also leverage existing patient information available in healthcare settings including past treatment history and lab results, while providing analytics to empower precision healthcare decision support. Earlier, Philips and Westchester Medical Center (WMCHealth) Health Network announced the launch of WMCHealth s new precision medicine initiative for personalized cancer treatment, which will use Philips  IntelliSpace Genomics solution to integrate large-scale genomic analysis with extensive patient clinical data. The WMCHealth precision medicine initiative will be covering 15 hospitals and oncology practices in the New York Metro area and Hudson Valley. Source: Story from Royal Philips.

The financing will fuel the completion and launch of Genomenon s initial product, Mastermind, a novel analytic and visualization tool for DNA variant interpretation. Investors included two University of Michigan funds, Michigan Angel Fund and an angel group formed by Rehmann owners. Mastermind is used for clinical diagnostics and academic research to eliminate the DNA analysis bottleneck in cancer and genetic disease diagnostics. It reduces the time pathologists and geneticists spend researching and interpreting genetic variants by automatically mining millions of medical publications to find correlations between genes, variants required for clinical diagnosis.  The fundamental bottleneck in diagnosing cancer and genetic diseases is the time spent manually researching DNA mutations  said Mark Kiel MD, Founder and CSO of Genomenon.  We have been able to dramatically reduce the time pathologists and geneticists spend interpreting genetic mutations by automatically mining millions of medical publications to find correlations between genes, variants required for clinical diagnosis.  Genomenon spun out of the University of Michigan in 2015, which enabled it to attract the investments from two different university funds. MINTS (Michigan Investment in New Technology Start-ups) and the newly formed Monroe-Brown Fund both invested in the company. Genomenon was Monroe-Brown s first investment. The company originally set out to raise $1.0M in new financing and with the strong interest, the investment was oversubscribed.  We re really grateful to the Michigan start-up and investment community  said Mike Klein, CEO of Genomenon.  It s a testimony to the eco-system in Michigan that companies like Genomenon can spin great technology out of the university and find the local funding to launch a successful venture.  Mastermind, Genomenon s first product, is a comprehensive knowledge-base built on mining millions of medical publications that automatically finds correlations between genes, variants and diseases tied to the primary scientific literature required for clinical diagnosis of cancer and genetic diseases. It is due to launch in December of 2016. Source: Story from Genomenon Inc.

It s a discovery that is likely to be controversial,  says Kathy Cullen, the senior researcher on a paper on the subject that was published recently in Nature Communications. She has been working on this problem for over a decade with her colleague Maurice Chacron who also teaches in McGill University s Department of Physiology. See Also: Study investigates the significance of the vestibular system for optimization of motor coordination  What we ve found is that there are two sensory channels that transmit information to the brain about how we move around in the world using fundamentally different approaches. No one has ever demonstrated anything of the kind before,  says Cullen.  But what is even more exciting to us is that we believe that the different ways that each of these channels sends information to the brain is a legacy of the differences between needing to navigate in water and in air.  By recording and analyzing the activity in the brains of macaques during movements experienced in their daily lives doing things like foraging, walking, running, climbing and grooming the researchers found that there were two very different kinds of signals being sent to their brains as the monkeys moved around.  Scientists already knew that there were two different types of receptors that sense motion in the inner ears of animals that live on land, but we ve never really understood why before,  says Mohsen Jamali whose PhD research at McGill is responsible for the discovery. He is now a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard.  We found that it s because there are two very different kinds of signals that are being transmitted to neurons in the brain to keep us in balance. One is like the fluid stylings of a crooner sliding slowly from one note to the next, the other is rapid and very precisely timed a bit like the beat of a drum,as it responds to a guitar solo.  Learn More: What happens when your brain can't tell which way is up? The researchers believe that the different kinds of signals used by these two channels to give us a sense of how we move around in the world are related to the major evolutionary changes in our pasts. They are, in fact, no less than echoes of the different strategies needed to navigate the changing sensory environments in which we were living.  If you can imagine swimming in the sea, you have a sense of the resistance of water along with its muffling, almost viscous effect. So it makes sense that information about our movements would be transmitted to our brains using these smooth, slowly varying patterns that resemble the peaks and dips of sound in a singer s voice,  says Chacron.  But because on land there is far less resistance than in the water, as we move around we need to be able to perceive and be prepared to react with extreme rapidity in order to keep our balance. That s where timing with millisecond precision becomes important.  Read Next: New treatment successful for rare and disabling movement disorder, mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) Now that they have identified that these two separate channels exist in the inner ear to send varying kinds of sensory signals to the brain to keep us in balance, the researchers are concentrating on trying to gain a better grasp of how the brain interprets and processes this information. Indeed, Kathleen Cullen is currently working with colleagues at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to improve the design of vestibular implants to better help those with vertigo and balance disorders. The first clinical trials of the implants are currently in progress, and Cullen is eager and excited about this new information being put to use to improve the lives of patients suffering from vertigo and balance disorders.

Could it lead to earlier detection and therefore better treatment? See Also: Can autism be measured in a sniff?A study co-authored by a University at Buffalo (UB) undergraduate and presented at the IEEE Wireless Health conference at the National Institutes of Health (U.S.) last month could provide the answer. It involves the creation of an app for cell phones, tablets or computers that tracks eye movement to determine, in less than a minute, if a child is showing signs of autism spectrum disorder. Early detection is important Early detection of autism can dramatically improve the benefits of treatment, but often the disability is not suspected until a child enters school. ""The brain continues to grow and develop after birth. The earlier the diagnosis, the better. Then we can inform families and begin therapies which will improve symptoms and outcome,"" said Michelle Hartley-McAndrew, MD, clinical assistant professor of pediatrics and neurology at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. Hartley-McAndrew, medical director of the Children's Guild Foundation Autism Spectrum Disorder Center at Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo, is a co-author of the study. ""Although it's never too late to start therapy, research demonstrates the earlier we diagnose, the better our outcomes,"" said Kathy Ralabate Doody, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Exceptional Education at SUNY Buffalo State College and a co-author of the study. ""We offer many educational interventions to help children with autism reach the same developmental milestones met by children with typical development."" Learn More: Brain representations of social thoughts accurately predict autism diagnosis The principal author is Kun Woo Cho, an undergraduate majoring in computer science and engineering. She worked with her research advisor Wenyao Xu, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""This is an ongoing study on how to analyze ASD by monitoring gaze patterns. I used the Wasserstein metric, designed the system protocol, and visual stimuli using social scenes. This is teamwork, and I learned from my advisor and graduate students in the lab,"" Cho said. ""On all the research work, we are working together."" Those lab co-workers and study co-authors are Feng Lin, PhD, research scientist, and Chen Song and Xiaowei Xu, PhD, students in UB's Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The app tracks eye movements of a child looking at pictures of social scenes for example, those with multiple people. The eye movements of someone with ASD are often different from those of a person without autism. In the study, the app had an accuracy rating of 93.96 percent. ""Right now it is a prototype. We have to consider if other neurological conditions are included, like ADD, how that will affect the outcome,"" Cho said. Related: Ear test may identify autism risk The study, entitled ""Gaze-Wasserstein: A Quantitative Screening Approach to Autism Spectrum Disorder,"" was one of the top-ranked papers at the flagship Wireless Health conference this year, Xu said. Autism spectrum disorder affects 1 to 2 people per 1,000 worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 1 in 68 children in the U.S. has been diagnosed with ASD. ""The beauty of the mobile app is that it can be used by parents at home to assess the risk of whether a child may have ASD,"" Xu said. ""This can allow families to seek therapy sooner, and improve the benefits of treatment,"" he said. The study found that photos of social scenes evoke the most dramatic differences in eye movement between children with and without ASD. The eye tracking patterns of children with ASD looking at the photos are scattered, versus a more focused pattern of children without ASD. ""We speculate that it is due to their lack of ability to interpret and understand the relationship depicted in the social scene,"" Cho said. Use of the app takes up to 54 seconds, which makes it less intrusive than other tests and valuable with children with short attention spans, Cho said. Don't Miss: Brain scan method may help detect autism The study included 32 children ranging in age from 2 to 10. Half of the children had been previously diagnosed with autism in accordance with DSM-V diagnostic criteria. The other half did not have ASD. Further research will include expanding the study to another 300 to 400 children, which is about the annual enrollment for new evaluations at Children's Guild Foundation Autism Spectrum Disorder Center at Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Xu called the research ""highly interdisciplinary"" because of the need for computer technology, psychology for stimuli selection and medical expertise for the application of autism screening. ""This technology fills the gap between someone suffering from autism to diagnosis and treatment,"" Xu said. Hartley-McAndrew said a lot of research is going into the use of technology to help in detecting autism. ""We still don't have a completely objective measure to diagnose ASD. The diagnosis is based on expert judgment. There are tests considered the 'gold standards,' but they still are somewhat subjective,"" she said.

In an effort to get closer to an answer, a team led by Dr. Mazahir Hasan, a researcher with Charit 's NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, joined forces with colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg. See Also: Major dopamine system helps restore consciousness after general anesthesia, study finds By visualizing neuronal activity in the brains of mice, they were able to compare how brain activity differs in conscious and anesthetized mice. NeuroCure's Dr. Hasan explains: ""We used a fluorescent protein that converts electrical signals into light signals. This enabled us to visualize the frequency and average amplitude of neuronal responses, and allowed us to reveal the existence of neuronal synchrony."" Results from this research would suggest that consciousness is not simply dependent on the number of active neurons inside the cortex; instead, it seems to be dependent upon the way these nerve cells communicate and on the degree to which they manage to differ in terms of their activity patterns. The awake cortex showed complex activity patterns, with individual cells firing at different times. Under anesthesia, all neurons displayed identical activity patterns and fired at the same time. Related: How anesthesia's brain effects differ in older adults and in children""While one might expect the brain to cease its activity under anesthesia, in reality, the situation is quite different. Neurons remain highly active but change their communication mode. During unconsciousness they become highly synchonized in simple terms all neurons start doing the same thing. "" explains Mr. Thomas Lissek, a neurobiologist from Heidelberg and the study's first author. Another surprising finding was that neurons were more sensitive to environmental stimuli under anesthesia than when the brain was awake. ""This is especially surprising, as anesthesia is used to block both pain and environmental stimuli during surgery,"" says Lissek. Some of the brain regions that are normally dedicated to tactile perception even responded to sound information. These new insights into neuronal activity patterns provide information regarding the identity of the cellular parameters involved in producing consciousness and the loss of consciousness. Once combined with further advances that would allow us to measure neuronal activity inside the human brain, these findings could contribute to improving our diagnostic capabilities in conditions such as coma and locked-in syndrome.

Studies show promising initial evidence that specific ""neuroimaging markers"" might help in predicting the chances of a good response to psychotherapy, or choosing between psychotherapy or medications, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other diagnoses. See Also: Patients with recurrent depression have smaller hippocampi ""While some brain areas have emerged as potential candidate markers, there are still many barriers that preclude their clinical use,"" comments lead author Dr. Trisha Chakrabarty of University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The researchers analyzed previous research evaluating brain imaging scans to predict the outcomes of psychotherapy for major depressive and anxiety disorders. Psychiatrists are interested in identifying brain imaging markers of response to psychotherapy comparable to electrocardiograms and laboratory tests used to decide on treatments for myocardial infarction. The review found 40 studies including patients with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and other diagnoses. Some studies used structural brain imaging studies, which show brain anatomy; others used functional scans, which demonstrate brain activity. Although no single brain area was consistently associated with response to psychotherapy, the results did identify some ""candidate markers."" Studies suggested that psychotherapy responses might be related to activity in two deep brain areas: the amygdala, involved in mood responses and emotional memories; and the anterior insula, involved in awareness of the body's physiologic state, anxiety responses, and feelings of disgust. Learn More: New biological evidence reveals link between brain inflammation and major depression In MDD studies, patients with higher activity in the amygdala were more likely to respond to psychotherapy. In contrast, in some studies of anxiety disorders, lower activity in the amygdala was associated with better psychotherapy outcomes. Studies of anterior insula activity showed the converse: psychotherapy response was associated with higher pretreatment activity in anxiety disorders and lower activity in MDD. Other studies linked psychotherapy responses to a frontal brain area called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which plays a critical role in regulating emotions. Most of the evidence suggested that MDD patients with lower activity in some parts of the ACC (ventral and subgenual) were more likely to have good outcomes with psychotherapy. ""Future studies of psychotherapy response may focus further on these individual regions as predictive markers,"" according to Dr. Chakrabarty. ""Additionally, future biomarker studies may focus on pretreatment functional connectivity between these regions, as affective experience is modulated via reciprocal connections between brain areas such as the ACC and amygdala.""

See Also: Unprecedented 3-D view of important brain receptor At Emory University, the labs of Stephen Traynelis and Hongjie Yuan have published an analysis of ExAC data, focusing on the genes encoding twoN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, GRIN2A and GRIN2B. These receptors are central to signaling between brain cells, and rare mutations in the corresponding genes cause epilepsy (GRIN2A) or intellectual disability (GRIN2B). GRIN2B mutations have also been linked with autism spectrum disorder. The new paper in the American Journal of Human Genetics makes a deep dive into ExAC data to explore the link between normal variation in the healthy population and regions of the proteins that harbor disease-causing mutations. In addition, the paper provides a detailed look at how 25 mutations that were identified in individuals with neurologic disease actually affect the receptors. For some patients, this information could potentially guide anticonvulsant treatment with a repurposed Alzheimer's medication. Also included are three new mutations from patients identified by whole exome sequencing, one in GRIN2A and two in GRIN2B. ""This is one of the first analyses like this, where we're mapping the spectrum of variation in a gene onto the structure of the corresponding protein,"" says Traynelis, PhD, professor of pharmacology at Emory University School of Medicine. ""We're able to see that the disease mutations cluster where variation among the healthy population disappears."" Learn More: Glutamate plays previously unknown role in neuromuscular development Postdoctoral fellow Sharon Swanger, PhD is first author of the paper, and Yuan, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pharmacology, is co-senior author. It's not always obvious, looking at the sequence of a given mutation, how it's going to affect NMDA receptor function. Only introducing the altered gene into cells and studying protein function in the lab provides that information, Traynelis says. NMDA receptors are complicated machines: mutations can affect how well they bind their ligands (glutamate and glycine), how they open and shut, or how they are processed onto the cell surface. On top of that complexity, mutations that make the receptors either stronger or weaker can both lead the brain into difficulty; within each gene, both types of mutation are associated with similar disorders. With some GRIN2A mutations, the functional changes identified in the lab were quite strong, but the effect on the brain was less dramatic (mild intellectual disability or speech disorder), suggesting that other genetic factors contribute to outcomes. Traynelis and Yuan previously collaborated with the NIH's Undiagnosed Disease Program to show that the Alzheimer's medication memantine can be repurposed as an anticonvulsant for a child with intractable epilepsy coming from a mutation in the GRIN2A gene. (Nature Communications, Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology) Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist and was aimed at counteracting the overactivation of the receptor caused by the mutation. Memantine has also been used to treat children with epilepsy associated with mutations in the related GRIN2D gene. However, memantine doesn't work on all activating mutations, and could have effects on the unmutated NMDA receptors in the brain as well.

Researchers at Rice's Center for Theoretical Biological Physics used computer models to analyze proteins suspected of misfolding and forming plaques in the brains of patients with neurological diseases. Their simulations confirmed experimental results by other labs that showed the length of repeating polyglutamine sequences contained in proteins is critical to the onset of disease. See Also: New evidence: How amino acid cysteine combats Huntington's diseaseThe study led by Rice bioscientist Peter Wolynes appears in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Glutamine is the amino acid coded for by the genomic trinucleotide CAG. Repeating glutamines, called polyglutamines, are normal in huntingtin proteins, but when the DNA is copied incorrectly, the repeating sequence of glutamines can become too long. The result can be diseases like Huntington's or spinocerebellar ataxia. The number of repeats of glutamine can grow as the genetic code information is passed down through generations. That means a healthy parent whose huntingtin gene encodes proteins with 35 repeats may produce a child with 36 repeats. A person having the longer repeat is likely to develop Huntington's disease. Aggregation in Huntington's typically begins only when polyglutamine chains reach a critical length of 36 repeats. Studies have demonstrated that longer repeat chains can make the disease more severe and its onset earlier. The paper builds upon techniques used in an earlier study of amyloid beta proteins. That study was the lab's first attempt to model the energy landscape of amyloid aggregation, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This time, Wolynes and his team were interested in knowing how the varying length of repeats as few as 20 and as many as 50 influenced how aggregates form. Related: Team finds method to reduce accumulation of damaging Huntington's disease protein ""The final form of the protein detected in people who have Huntington's disease is a macroscopic aggregate made of many molecules, much like an ice crystal formed out of water has many molecules in it,"" Wolynes said. ""This process needs to start somewhere, and that would be with a nucleus, the smallest-size cluster that will then be able to finish the process and grow to macroscopic size. ""People knew that the length of the repeats is correlated with the severity of a disease, but we wanted to know why that matters to the critical nucleus size,"" he said. Experiments had demonstrated that sequences of 20 repeats or less remained unfolded - or ""noodle-y,"" as Wolynes described them; they were able to clump into a nucleus only when four or more were gathered together in proximity. The researchers' simulations showed how sequences with 30 repeats or more are able to fold by themselves without partners into hairpin shapes, which are the building blocks for troublesome aggregates. Thus, for the longer sequences, even a single protein can begin the aggregation process, especially at high concentrations. The Rice team found that at intermediate lengths between 20 and 30 repeats, polyglutamine sequences can choose between straight or hairpin configurations. While longer and shorter sequences form aligned fiber bundles, simulations showed intermediate sequences are more likely to form disordered, branched structures. ""We don't know if branching is good or bad,"" Wolynes said. ""But it explains the weird shapes the experimentalists get in the test tube."" Read Next: Study identifies new biomarkers for Huntington's diseaseMutations that would encourage polyglutamine sequences to remain unfolded would raise the energy barrier to aggregation, they found. ""What's ironic is that while Huntington's has been classified as a misfolding disease, it seems to happen because the protein, in the bad case of longer repeats, carries out an extra folding process that it wasn't supposed to be doing,"" Wolynes said. The team's ongoing study is now looking at how the complete huntingtin protein, which contains parts in addition to the polyglutamine repeats, aggregates.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hiv-test-performed-on-usb-stick-196971,HIV Test Performed on USB Stick  New technology could be especially beneficial in remote locations to help HIV patients monitor their own treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists have developed a type of HIV test on a USB stick.  The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, and then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device.  The disposable test could be used for HIV patients to monitor their own treatment. Furthermore, the technology could enable patients with HIV to be managed more effectively in remote locations.  New research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, shows the device is not only very accurate, but can produce a result in under 30 minutes.  The new technology monitors the amount of virus in the bloodstream. This is crucial to monitoring a patient's treatment. Current tests to detect the amount of virus take at least three days, often longer, and involves sending a blood sample to a laboratory.  In many parts of the world, particularly those with the highest number of HIV infections, such testing does not exist at all. The current treatment for HIV, called anti-retroviral treatment, reduces virus levels to near zero.  However, in some cases the medication may stop working - perhaps because the HIV virus has developed resistance to the drugs. The first indication of this would be a rise in virus levels in the bloodstream.  Furthermore, regularly monitoring of viral levels enables healthcare teams to check a patient is taking their medication. Stopping medication fuels HIV drug-resistance, which is an emerging global problem. Viral levels cannot be detected by routine HIV tests, which use antibodies, as these can only tell whether a person has been infected. Dr Graham Cooke, senior author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial explained: ""HIV treatment has dramatically improved over the last 20 years - to the point that many diagnosed with the infection now have a normal life expectancy.  ""However, monitoring viral load is crucial to the success of HIV treatment. At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result. We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.""  Dr Cooke added that this technology, although in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in much the same way that people with diabetes check their blood sugar levels. The technology could be particularly powerful in remote regions in sub-Saharan Africa, which may not have easy access to testing facilities. Finding out quickly if a patient, particularly a baby, is infected with the virus is crucial to their long term health and survival.  The device, which uses a mobile phone chip, just needs small sample of blood. This is placed onto a spot on the USB stick. If any HIV virus is present in the sample, this triggers a change in acidity which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. This is sent to the USB stick, which produces the result in a programme on a computer or electronic device. In the latest research, the technology tested 991 blood samples with 95 per cent accuracy. The average time to produce a result was 20.8 minutes. The team are also investigating whether the device can be used to test for other viruses such as hepatitis. The technology was developed in conjunction with the Imperial spinout company DNA Electronics which is using the same technology to develop a device for detecting bacterial and fungal sepsis and antibiotic resistance. Professor Chris Toumazou, DNAe's Founder, Executive Chairman and Regius Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial added: ""This is a great example of how this new analysis technology has the potential to transform how patients with HIV are treated by providing a fast, accurate and portable solution. At DNAe we are already applying this highly adaptable technology to address significant global threats to health, where treatment is time-critical and needs to be right first time.""

Until now, it was believed that previous exposure to a flu virus conferred little or no immunological protection against new influenza viruses that can jump from animals into humans. The results, published in Science on Nov. 11, could hold important clues for public health measures aimed at curbing the risks of a major flu outbreak.  Even a comparatively weak, mild pandemic flu event like the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak is a trillion-dollar affair,"" said Michael Worobey, head of the UA's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and one of the two senior authors of the study. ""A major pandemic like the one we saw in 1918 has the potential to kill large numbers of people and shut down the world's economy."" The research team studied two avian-origin influenza A (""bird flu"") viruses, H5N1 and H7N9, each of which already has caused hundreds of spillover cases of severe illness or death in humans. Both strains are of global concern because they might at some point gain mutations that allow them not only to readily jump from birds into humans, but also spread rapidly between human hosts.  Analyzing data from every known case of severe illness or death from influenza caused by these two strains, the researchers discovered that whichever human influenza strain a person happened to be exposed to during his or her first infection with flu virus as a child determines which novel, avian-origin flu strains they would be protected against in a future infection. This effect of ""immunological imprinting"" appears to be exclusively dependent on the very first exposure to flu virus encountered in life   and difficult to reverse. When an individual gets exposed to flu virus for the first time, the immune system makes antibodies targeting hemagglutinin, a receptor protein shaped like a lollipop that sticks out from the virus surface. Like lollipops that come in different colors and flavors, influenza viruses differ from each other in the parts that make up their hemagglutinins. But each of the 18 known influenza A virus hemagglutinin subtypes falls into one of just two main ""flavor"" groups. ""In this analogy, let's say you were first exposed to a human 'orange lollipop' flu as a kid,"" Worobey said. ""If later in life you encounter another subtype of flu virus, one from a bird and one that your immune system has never seen before but whose proteins also are of a similar 'orange' flavor, your chances of dying are quite low because of cross-protection. But if you were first infected with a virus from the 'blue lollipop' group as kid, that won't protect you against this novel, 'orange' strain."" The results provide a functional explanation for a pattern that had vexed epidemiologists for a long time: Why are certain age groups more likely than others to suffer serious or even fatal complications from an infection with novel influenza strains?   ""All sorts of possibilities have been put forth,"" Worobey said, ""and here my colleagues from UCLA and I present a strong result showing that whatever other minor factors are at play, there is one really major one, and that is   surprise, surprise   we're not a completely blank slate when it comes to how susceptible we are to these emerging flu viruses. Even if we've never been exposed to H5 or H7 viruses, we have some kick-ass protection against one or the other."" All 18 subtypes of influenza A virus hemagglutinin circulate in non-human hosts, primarily birds. But only three   H1, H2 and H3   have circulated in humans over the last century. Until now, there has been no way to predict which of the 18 subtypes might cause the next flu pandemic by successfully jumping from animals, and which age groups would be most at risk if this happened. The new study provides insights on both counts by revealing that immunological cross-protection appears to exist within each major branch of the evolutionary tree of influenza A. One branch includes human H1 and H2 viruses as well as avian H5, while the other includes human H3 and avian H7.  In the lollipop analogy, people born before the late 1960s were exposed to ""blue lollipop"" influenza as children (H1 or H2). The researchers found that these older groups rarely succumb to avian H5N1   which shares a ""blue"" hemagglutinin   but often die from ""orange"" H7N9. People born after the late 1960s and exposed to ""orange lollipop"" influenza as children (H3) show the mirror-image pattern: They are protected from H7N9 but suffer severe disease and death when exposed to H5 viruses mismatched to their childhood exposure. Based on previous work, Worobey thinks that a similar process may explain the unusual mortality patterns caused by the 1918 flu pandemic, which was more deadly among young adults.  ""When I was finishing up that work and looking at the age patterns, I noticed something interesting,"" he said. ""Those young adults were killed by an H1 virus, and from blood analyzed many decades later there is a pretty strong indication that those individuals had been exposed to a mismatched H3 as children and were therefore not protected against H1.  ""The fact that we are seeing exactly the same pattern with current H5N1 and H7N9 cases suggests that the same fundamental processes may govern both the historic 1918 pandemic and today's contenders for the next big flu pandemic."" In their latest paper, Worobey and co-authors not only show that there is a 75 percent protection rate against severe disease and 80 percent protection rate against death if patients had been exposed to a matched virus as children, but also that one can take that information and make predictions about H5N1, H7N9 and other potential causes of future pandemics.  ""If either of these viruses were to successfully jump from birds into humans, we now know something about the age groups that they would be hit the hardest,"" Worobey said, adding that efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine hinge on such insights because ""such a vaccine would likely target the same conserved protein motifs on the virus surface that underlie this age-specific pattern.""  Based on these findings, Worobey said future research should try to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the immunological imprinting and finding out possible ways to modify it with a vaccine.  ""In a way it's a good-news, bad-news story,"" he said. ""It's good news in the sense that we can now see the factor that really explains a big part of the story: Your first infection sets you up for either success or failure in a huge way, even against 'novel' flu strains. The bad news is the very same imprinting that provides such great protection may be difficult to alter with vaccines: A good universal vaccine should provide protection where you lack it most, but the epidemiological data suggest we may be locked into strong protection against just half of the family tree of flu strains.""

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/promising-new-zika-vaccine-206108,Promising New Zika Vaccine A DNA based Zika vaccine developed by researchers from The Wistar Institute has shown protection from infection  brain damage and death   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. As the global spread of the Zika virus continues, efforts are underway to halt the disease s transmission. While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus in vivo. In this preclinical study, 100 percent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.  Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,  said lead researcher David B. Weiner, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the W.W. Smith Charitable Trust Professor in Cancer Research at Wistar.  As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.  This study is the first of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals.  Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika.  This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.   J. Joseph Kim, Ph.D., MBA, President and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., added,  Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than six months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.     In this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly. One important aspect of Zika and many other mosquito-borne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 percent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host. This Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc. and is currently being tested in two human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a second study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. The CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study s placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017. A total of nearly 4,000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to the CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquito-borne transmission of the disease.

The five year, $50 million project will study thousands of drug resistant tumors and draw on Watson s computational and machine learning methods to help researchers understand how cancers become resistant to therapies. The anonymized data will be made available to the scientific community to catalyze research worldwide.While a growing number of cancer treatments can hold cancers in check for months or years, most cancers eventually recur. This is in part because they acquire mutations that make them drug resistant. The development of drug resistance is a major cause of nearly 600,000 annual cancer deaths in the United States alone(1). In a limited number of cases, scientists have discovered the cause of drug resistance, allowing the development of new drugs to overcome resistance. In most cases, however, the causes of drug resistance are not fully understood.To help understand how cancers become resistant to specific therapies, Broad Institute will generate tumor genome sequence data from patients who initially respond to treatment but who then become drug-resistant. Broad will use new genome-editing methods to conduct large-scale cancer drug resistance studies in the laboratory, to help identify tumors  specific vulnerabilities. IBM scientists will use Watson to analyze this data and identify genomic patterns that may help researchers and clinicians predict drug sensitivity and resistance.This new partnership is expected to help lay a new foundation for understanding the basis of drug resistance in cancer   especially the genetic mechanisms observed in patients   and accelerate research across the cancer community to turn knowledge of resistance mechanisms into therapies.  Defeating cancer involves playing a high-stakes game of biological chess. When we make a move with a therapy, cancer often responds with a counter-move by finding a way to become resistant. The key will be learning from clinical experience, so that we know cancer s moves in advance and can plan strategies to cut off its escape routes,  said Eric Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute. Knowing how cancers can become resistant will ultimately require learning from hundreds of thousands of patients  experiences. We re proud to work with IBM to make an important start toward this goal, and to make the information broadly available to the scientific community.   The Broad Institute is leading the industry in areas of cancer biology, genomics and computational biology, and we are proud to bring Watson s data prowess to help researchers learn more about one of most important medical challenges that too often stands in the way of effective cancer treatment,  said John Kelly III, senior vice president, Cognitive Solutions and IBM Research. Watson is already being used in the clinic to aid clinicians in cancer care. Our hope is that this effort, if successful, could eventually lead to significant breakthroughs. Someday, patients who would not otherwise have options in their battle against cancer may have reason for hope. Currently, cancer researchers have access to genomic information from only a few hundred drug-resistant cancers samples. In addition to the goals of this specific study, IBM and Broad are committed to advancing cancer research by sharing the data from thousands of tumor samples with the scientific community to accelerate progress everywhere against cancer,  said Todd Golub, M.D., chief scientific officer and founder of the cancer program at the Broad Institute. What we and many others will learn with this information will have important implications for the future of cancer precision medicine and cancer diagnostics. Earlier this month, IBM and Quest Diagnostics launched IBM Watson Genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a service available to oncologists nationwide to help advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The collaboration with the Broad Institute announced is the latest application of Watson for Genomics to help researchers and clinicians tackle the challenges and opportunities of cancer genomics.

In particular, huperzine A shows potential for protecting against febrile seizures, which are a feature of both Dravet syndrome, a severe form of childhood epilepsy, and a related condition, GEFS+ (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus). See Also: Researchers find an important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures The findings are published in Frontiers in Pharmacology. Huperzine A comes from the club moss Huperzia serrata and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The compound has been tested for the treatment of inflammation and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Children with Dravet syndrome experience early-life seizures due to high fever as well as other types of seizures and developmental delays. Although the condition can be controlled with some antiepileptic drugs, most patients do not achieve adequate seizure control. Most cases of Dravet syndrome are caused by de novo (not inherited) mutations in a sodium channel gene called SCN1A. The channel allows sodium to quickly enter into the cell, and forms part of the molecular machinery that is critical for how an electrical signal forms and travels along a neuron. In Dravet syndrome, the mutations often inactivate the gene, while SCN1A mutations in GEFS+ change properties of the sodium channel without inactivating it completely. Both types of mutations lead to increased neuron excitability. Learn More: Novel biomarker predicts febrile seizure-related epilepsy, study finds ""We think that huperzine A could normalize the balance between neuronal inhibition and excitation in patients with SCN1A mutations, thereby protecting against seizure generation,"" says senior author Andrew Escayg, PhD, associate professor of human genetics at Emory University School of Medicine. At Emory, Escayg and his colleagues have developed mice in which one copy of the SCN1A gene has been modified as mouse models for the study of Dravet syndrome and GEFS+. Co-first authors of the paper are postdoctoral fellow Jennifer Wong, PhD and Stacey Dutton, PhD, now an assistant professor of biology at Agnes Scott College. SCN1A mutant mice exhibit increased susceptibility to seizures induced by hyperthermia, which serves as a model of human febrile seizures. In the Frontiers paper, almost all SCN1A mutant mice exhibited a seizure when their core body temperature reached 40 C. In contrast, when the mice were pre-treated with huperzine A, they only experienced a seizure at significantly higher temperatures. Escayg's team also found that huperzine A can reduce the frequency and severity of electrically and chemically induced seizures, both in normal mice and in SCN1A-mutant mice. In these experiments, the scientists observed that the protective effect against electricity-induced seizures in normal mice diminishes after 12 days of daily huperzine A administration, but ""complete protection"" is maintained in the SCN1A-mutant mice. Related: New mechanism for febrile seizures in young children discovered ""The protection observed in normal mice suggest huperzine A might also increase seizure resistance in other forms of treatment-resistant epilepsy. While these results are encouraging, further research will be required to determine suitability of using huperzine A as a clinical treatment for epilepsy,"" Escayg says. Biscayne Pharmaceuticals has plans to begin a phase 1b clinical trial of huperzine A in adults with refractory complex partial epilepsy in 2017. Clinical studies in children with Dravet syndrome are planned after additional toxicology studies are performed, as required by regulatory authorities. Huperzine A is thought to work, in part, by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Thus, huperzine A can increase the levels of acetylcholine in the brain.

However, they determined that hypothermia does not contribute to seizure protection. Previous clinical studies have reported side effects such as nausea and vomiting.

The knowledge about the way cannabinoids work has been expanded in recent years when it was shown that the CB1 receptor is also located in and functions in the mitochondria of the neurons; mitochondria are the organelles responsible for producing cell energy. See Also: Previously unknown function of cannabinoid receptor discovered A new piece of research, which has been published in Nature, has now gone a step further on discovering that the amnesia caused by cannabinoids needs the activation of the CB1 cannabinoid receptors located in the mitochondria of the hippocampus, the brain structure involved in memory formation. The reseach was led by Giovanni Marsicano of the University of Bordeaux. Contributors also included Nagore Puente, Leire Reguero, Izaskun Elezgarai and Pedro Grandes, all neuroscientists in the Department of Neurosciences of the University of the Basque Country's Faculty of Medicine and Nursing and of the Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience. In this new work, the researchers used a broad range of techniques and saw that the genetic elimination of the CB1 receptor from the mitochondria of the hippocampus prevents memory loss, the reduction in mitochondrial movement and the decrease in neural communication induced by the cannabinoids. Related: Structure of primary cannabinoid receptor is revealedThis research also revealed that the amnesia caused by cannabinoids and the related cell processes are linked to an acute alteration in bioenergetic mitochondrial activity owing to the direct activation of the CB1 receptors in the mitrochondria. This activation leads to the inhibiting of the cannabinoid signalling cascade inside the mitochondria and cell respiration diminishes as a result. This reduction in cell respiration through cannabinoids is not restricted to the brain as a similar phenomenon occurs in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as has recently been published in another piece of research by the group of Dr. Grandes. ""Mitochondrial malfunctioning could have serious consequences for the brain. For example, chronic mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, strokes or disorders associated with aging. However, the involvement of the acute variation in mitochondrial activity in higher brain functions, such as memory, was unknown,"" pointed out Grandes. So this research has revealed that the CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the mitochondria regulate the memory processes by modulating mitochondrial energy metabolism. Furthermore, although cannabinoid by-products have a well-known therapeutic potential, their use is limited by the significant adverse effects that emerge when acting on CB1 receptors, including memory loss. The results of this research suggest that ""a selective intervention on specific CB1 cannabinoid receptors located in the brain in certain specific neurone compartments could be of interest with a view to developing new therapeutic tools based on the most effective and safest cannabinoids in the treatment of certain brain diseases,"" explained Grandes.

A team of researchers led by Dr. Daniel Cox, associate professor of neuroscience at Georgia State University, has discovered that fruit flies have cold-sensing neurons that when activated drive specific, aversive behaviors to damaging cold, which requires the function of evolutionarily conserved ion channels known as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. See Also: Study finds experience of pain relies on multiple brain pathways, not just one In the journal Current Biology, the researchers establish the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a powerful genetic and behavioral model for unraveling questions about the cellular and molecular bases of damaging cold perception, which have not been well understood. The study explores the concept of nociception, the peripheral and central nervous systems' perception of painful or potentially tissue damaging stimuli, which is generated by activating sensory nerve cells called nociceptors. This evolutionarily conserved process is critically important for survival. Nociception, coupled with pain sensation, alerts an organism to possible environmental dangers and allows it to execute behavioral responses to protect against incipient damage. Acute and chronic pain can manifest as altered nociception in neuropathic pain states. The study found that one of the implicated TRP channel genes called Pkd2 has been causally linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD), the most common monogenic disease in humans. Pkd2 ion channels appear to function as cold sensors and misexpression of Pkd2 can confer cold sensitivity to normally insensitive neurons. While it is not yet known if PKD patients have cold nociception defects, these new findings suggest this merits further investigation as a potential non-invasive diagnostic. These same cold-sensing neurons also function as mechanosensors for touch, revealing that they, as well as the TRP channels identified in this study, are multimodal and raising the question of how neurons and ion channels distinguish between harmless and harmful stimuli to drive specific behavioral responses. Using sophisticated optical assays of neural activation by touch versus cold stimuli, the researchers demonstrate that these sensory neurons have different activation thresholds, with touch having a low threshold and cold having a high threshold, that ultimately determine the appropriate behavioral response. ""This new model sets the stage for uncovering evolutionarily conserved molecular control of nociception,"" said Cox. ""It also provides a powerful genetic platform for unraveling the neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms that integrate multimodal sensory input to produce specific behaviors in response to diverse environmental stimuli.""

Describing their findings in their paper in Nature, the researchers say their work provides a dramatic illustration of evolutionary economizing and creative gene retooling mechanisms that contribute to the vast variability across species that share nearly identical set of genes yet differ profoundly in their physiology. See Also: Intertwined evolution of human brain and brawn The research reveals that osteocrin a gene found in the skeletal muscles of all mammals and well-known for its role in bone growth and muscle function is completely turned off in rodent brains yet highly active in the brains of nonhuman primates and humans. Notably, osteocrin was found predominantly in cells of the neocortex the most evolved part of the primate brain, which regulates sensory perception, spatial reasoning and higher-level thinking and language in humans. The gene's marked presence in an area of the brain responsible for higher-level function and thought, the researchers said, suggests a possible role in the development of cognition, a cardinal feature that distinguishes the brains of human and nonhuman primates from those of other mammals. Brain development in humans and other primates is profoundly affected by sensory experience and social interactions. Scientists have long sought to unravel genes in the brain that are turned on and off by experiences to fuel the rise of brain functions unique to such complex species. The HMS team's findings part of an ongoing quest to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie human brain development, function and disease reveal that osteocrin is precisely one such gene, activated by sensory stimulation. Furthermore, the team added, this is the first illustration of evolutionary gene repurposing in the brain. ""We have uncovered what we believe is a critical clue into the evolution of the human brain, one that gives us a glimpse into the genetic mechanisms that may account for differences in cognition between mice and humans,"" said senior investigator Michael Greenberg, the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and chair of the HMS Department of Neurobiology.

Although many of the same genes were activated in both mouse and human brain cells, the scientists observed, a small subset of genes was activated solely in human brain cells. Much to the scientists' surprise, the bone gene osteocrin was most highly expressed in the human brain, yet completely shut off in the brain cells of mice. Going a step further, the scientists placed brain cells from all three species in lab dishes and chemically re-created conditions that mimic sensory stimulation. Chemical stimulation activated osteocrin selectively in excitatory neurons, so called for their role in stimulating rather than dampening nerve signaling. But researchers noted something even more intriguing: The activity of the gene was most intense in neurons of the neocortex, the topmost layer of cells covering the brain and responsible for higher-level cognition, such as long-term memory, thought and language. At the same time, osteocrin was noticeably absent from other parts of the brain responsible for noncognitive functions such as spatial navigation, balance, breathing, heart rate and temperature control. When researchers compared osteocrin levels to levels of another brain protein, BDNF, well known for its role in neuronal growth and repair, they noticed another striking difference. While BDNF was present throughout the brain, osteocrin was restricted to the neocortex and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala, an area of the brain thought to play a role in memory formation, decision making and emotional responses. Osteocrin was also markedly expressed in cells of the temporal lobe, which houses functions such as learning, memory and audio-visual processing and the occipital lobe, which houses the visual cortex, the area of the brain responsible for the processing of visual information. Further analysis revealed that in the primate brain, sensory stimulation appears to switch on osteocrin through a previously unknown DNA enhancer. Enhancers (snippets of DNA that act as the genome's regulators) are the ""handles"" that turn on some genes while shutting off others. In doing so, enhancers can profoundly alter genetic expression, fueling dramatic differences between organisms with nearly identical DNA. The rodent versions of osteocrin lacked the stimulation-activated DNA enhancer, the analysis showed. Related: Insect diet helped early humans build bigger brains, study suggestsIn yet another critical observation, researchers found the osteocrin enhancer was, in turn, switched on by a protein called MEF2. Mutations in MEF2 are a well-established cause of intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders, so the link between the two begs further study, the researchers said, as it may portend a role for osteocrin in such developmental anomalies. ""Humans share many genes with rodents and as much as 90 percent of their DNA in some parts of the genome,"" says co-first author Gabriella Boulting, a neurobiologist at HMS. ""In this case we see how turning up the expression of the same gene in a different location may precipitate dramatic differences in the function of brain cells."" Further analysis revealed that osteocrin's activation curbed the growth of neuronal dendrites. ""Restricting dendritic growth is a precision-enhancing mechanism, essential to ensuring that neuronal wires don't get crossed and compromise signal transmission from one cell to the next,"" says study first co-author Bulent Ataman, a neurobiologist at HMS. This observation, Ataman added, suggests that osteocrin's activity may help enhance nerve cell agility and proper signal transmission to ensure robust communication across neurons. To confirm that the activity-induced gene expression observed in nerve cells in the lab also occurred in the functioning, intact brain, researchers temporarily blocked vision in one eye of a macaque, a common technique to study activity-triggered brain plasticity and visually-induced gene activation in the visual cortex. This proof-of-concept experiment, they surmised, would reveal whether osteocrin is, indeed, awakened by visual stimulation and shut off by its absence. A day later, the researchers observed that osteocrin expression was markedly higher in cells from the visually intact parts of the macaque brain, compared with cells in vision-deprived areas. The findings illustrate a foundational principle in neurobiology abnormal visual experiences can interfere with the development and function of brain cells in the visual cortex, a phenomenon first described more than 50 years ago by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, two of the founding members of the Department of Neurobiology at HMS. The two shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on visual information processing in the brain. ""Nature and nurture interact to wire up the brain, and abnormal vision can alter that wiring,"" said Margaret Livingstone, the Takeda Professor of Neurobiology at HMS. ""Our observations reveal the molecular basis for what Hubel and Wiesel observed more than half a century ago.""

The researchers, who describe their work in the journal Nature, say this is the first time a neural prosthetic has been used to restore walking movement directly to the legs of nonhuman primates. See Also: In a first, brain computer interface helps paralyzed man feel againThe study was performed by scientists and neuroengineers in a collaboration led by Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, together with Brown University, Medtronic and Fraunhofer ICT-IMM in Germany. The work builds upon neural technologies developed at Brown and partner institutions, and was tested in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux, Motac Neuroscience and the Lausanne University Hospital. ""The system we have developed uses signals recorded from the motor cortex of the brain to trigger coordinated electrical stimulation of nerves in the spine that are responsible for locomotion,"" said David Borton, assistant professor of engineering at Brown and one of the study's co-lead authors. ""With the system turned on, the animals in our study had nearly normal locomotion."" The work could help in developing a similar system designed for humans who have had spinal cord injuries. ""There is evidence to suggest that a brain-controlled spinal stimulation system may enhance rehabilitation after a spinal cord injury,"" Borton said. ""This is a step toward further testing that possibility."" Gr goire Courtine, a professor at EPFL who led the collaboration, has started clinical trials in Switzerland to test the spine-part of the interface. He cautions: ""There are many challenges ahead and it may take several years before all the components of this intervention can be tested in people."" Walking is made possible by a complex interplay among neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Electrical signals originating in the brain's motor cortex travel down to the lumbar region in the lower spinal cord, where they activate motor neurons that coordinate the movement of muscles responsible for extending and flexing the leg. See Also: Optical magnetic field sensor can detect signals from the nervous systemInjury to the upper spine can cut off communication between the brain and lower spinal cord. Both the motor cortex and the spinal neurons may be fully functional, but they are unable to coordinate their activity. The goal of the study was to re-establish some of that communication. The brain-spinal interface used a pill-sized electrode array implanted in the brain to record signals from the motor cortex. The sensor technology was developed in part for investigational use in humans by the BrainGate collaboration, a research team that includes Brown, Case Western Reserve University, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Providence VA Medical Center, and Stanford University. The technology is being used in ongoing pilot clinical trials, and was used previously in a study led by Brown neuroengineer Leigh Hochberg in which people with tetraplegia were able to operate a robotic arm simply by thinking about the movement of their own hand. A wireless neurosensor, developed in the neuroengineering lab of Brown professor Arto Nurmikko by a team that included Borton, sends the signals gathered by the brain chip wirelessly to a computer that decodes them and sends them wirelessly back to an electrical spinal stimulator implanted in the lumbar spine, below the area of injury. That electrical stimulation, delivered in patterns coordinated by the decoded brain, signals to the spinal nerves that control locomotion. To calibrate the decoding of brain signals, the researchers implanted the brain sensor and wireless transmitter in healthy macaques. The signals relayed by the sensor could then be mapped onto the animals' leg movements. They showed that the decoder was able to accurately predict the brain states associated with extension and flexion of leg muscles. Related: Self-calibration enhances BrainGate ease, reliability The ability to transmit brain signals wirelessly was critical to this work, Borton said. Wired brain-sensing systems limit freedom of movement, which in turn limits the information researchers are able to gather about locomotion. ""Doing this wirelessly enables us to map the neural activity in normal contexts and during natural behavior,"" Borton said. ""If we truly aim for neuroprosthetics that can someday be deployed to help human patients during activities of daily life, such untethered recording technologies will be critical."" The researchers combined their understanding of how brain signals influence locomotion with spinal maps, developed by Courtine's lab at EPFL, which identified the neural hotspots in the spine responsible for locomotor control. That enabled the team to identify the neural circuits that should be stimulated by the spinal implant. With these pieces in place, the researchers then tested the entire system on two macaques with lesions that spanned half the spinal cord in their thoracic spine. Macaques with this type of injury generally regain functional control of the affected leg over a period of a month or so, the researchers said. The team tested their system in the weeks following the injury, when there was still no volitional control over the affected leg. Don't Miss: Researchers use video gamelike test to study learning and recovery in stroke patientsThe study showed that with the system turned on, the animals began spontaneously moving their legs while walking on a treadmill. Kinematic comparisons with healthy controls showed that the lesioned macaques, with the aid of brain-controlled stimulation, were able to produce nearly normal locomotor patterns. While demonstrating that the system works in a nonhuman primate is an important step, the researchers stressed that much more work must be done to begin testing the system in humans. They also pointed out several limitations in the study. For instance, while the system used in this study successfully relayed signals from the brain to the spine, it lacks the ability to return sensory information to the brain. The team was also unable to test how much pressure the animals were able to apply to the affected leg. While it was clear that the limb was bearing some weight, it wasn't clear from this work how much. ""In a full translational study, we would want to do more quantification about how balanced the animal is during walking and measure the forces they're able to apply,"" Borton said. Despite the limitations, the research sets the stage for future studies in primates and, at some point, potentially as a rehabilitation aid in humans. Read Next: Spinal stimulation helps four patients with paraplegia regain voluntary movement ""There's an adage in neuroscience that circuits that fire together wire together,"" Borton said.

That's one of the major goals of this work and a goal of this field in general."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source.

The new findings were published in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology. Telomeres, composed of repeated sequences of DNA, are shortened every time a cell divides and therefore become smaller as a person ages. When they become too short, telomeres send a signal to the cell to stop dividing permanently, which impairs the ability of tissues to regenerate and contributes to many aging-related diseases, explained lead study author Patricia Opresko, Ph.D., associate professor of Environmental and Occupational Health at Pitt, and member of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Molecular and Cellular Cancer Biology program and Carnegie Mellon University Center for Nucleic Acids Science and Technology. In contrast, in most cancer cells, levels of the enzyme telomerase, which lengthens telomeres, are elevated, allowing them to divide indefinitely.  The new information will be useful in designing new therapies to preserve telomeres in healthy cells and ultimately help combat the effects of inflammation and aging. On the flip side, we hope to develop mechanisms to selectively deplete telomeres in cancer cells to stop them from dividing,  said Dr. Opresko.  A number of studies have shown that oxidative stress   a condition where damaging molecules known as free radicals build up inside cell   accelerates telomere shortening. Free radicals can damage not only the DNA that make up telomeres, but also the DNA building blocks used to extend them.  Oxidative stress is known to play a role in many health conditions, including inflammation and cancer. Damage from free radicals, which can be generated by inflammation in the body as well as environmental factors, is thought to build up throughout the aging process.  The goal of the new study was to determine what happens to telomeres when they are damaged by oxidative stress. The researchers suspected that oxidative damage would render telomerase unable to do its job.   Much to our surprise, telomerase could lengthen telomeres with oxidative damage,  Dr. Opresko said.  In fact, the damage seems to promote telomere lengthening.  Next, the team looked to see what would happen if the building blocks used to make up telomeres were instead subjected to oxidative damage. They found that telomerase was able to add a damaged DNA precursor molecule to the end of the telomere, but was then unable to add additional DNA molecules. The new results suggest that the mechanism by which oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening is by damaging the DNA precursor molecules, not the telomere itself.  We also found that oxidation of the DNA building blocks is a new way to inhibit telomerase activity, which is important because it could potentially be used to treat cancer.

Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill now reveals that this changing global emissions map is creating more total ozone worldwide compared to the amount of pollution being emitted, signaling an effect that could be difficult to reign in without strategic policy planning.  Emissions are growing in places where there is a much greater effect on the formation of ozone,  said Jason West, who led the research at UNC-Chapel Hill with former graduate student and first author Yuqiang Zhang.  A ton of emissions in a region close to the equator, where there is a lot of sunlight and intense heat, produces more ozone than a ton of emissions in a region farther from it.  The work, appearing in the Nov. 7 advance online issue of Nature Geoscience, provides a much-needed path forward on where in the world to strategically reduce emissions of pollutants that form ozone, which when present in the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, is one of the primary causes of air pollution-related respiratory problems and heart disease. (In the upper atmosphere, or stratosphere, ozone helps protect against the sun s ultraviolet rays.) To drive home the point, West explained that China s emissions increased more than India s and Southeast Asia s from 1980 to 2010, but Southeast Asia and India, despite their lower growth in emissions during this period, appear to have contributed more to the total global ozone increase due to their proximity to the equator. The reason is that ozone, a greenhouse gas and toxic air pollutant, is not emitted but forms when ultraviolet light hits nitrogen oxides (basically combustion exhaust from cars and other sources). When these pollutants interact with more intense sunlight and higher temperatures, the interplay speeds up the chemical reactions that form ozone. Higher temperatures near the equator also increase the vertical motion of air, transporting ozone-forming chemicals higher in the troposphere, where they can live longer and form more ozone.  The findings were surprising,  said West.  We thought that location was going to be important, but we didn t suspect it would be the most important factor contributing to total ozone levels worldwide. Our findings suggest that where the world emits is more important than how much it emits.  Zhang, West and colleagues, including Owen Cooper and Audrey Gaudel, from the University of Colorado Boulder and NOAA s Earth System Research Laboratory, used a computer model to simulate the total amount of ozone in the troposphere, the part of the atmosphere where ozone is harmful to humans and agriculture, between 1980 and 2010. Since emissions have shifted south during this period, they wanted to answer, what contributed more to the increased production of ozone worldwide: the changing magnitude of emissions or location?  Location, by far,  said West, associate professor of environmental sciences in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. The findings point to several strategies for reducing ground-level ozone across the world, such as decreasing emissions of ozone precursors in regions close to the equator, particularly those with the fastest growth of emissions. However, concerns exist for policy makers.  A more challenging scenario is that even if there is a net reduction in global emissions, ozone levels may not decrease if emissions continue to shift toward the equator,  said Cooper.  But continuing aircraft and satellite observations of ozone across the tropics can monitor the situation and model forecasts can guide decision making for controlling global ozone pollution.

But in some cases, those variants contribute to diseases, and it s a major challenge for scientists to distinguish between harmless variants and those that are potentially hazardous to our health. Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a new technique to cheaply and rapidly create myriad sets of DNA fragments that detail all possible genetic variants in a particular stretch of DNA. By studying such DNA fragments, scientists can more easily distinguish between genetic variants linked to disease and those that are innocuous. The findings, published Oct. 3 in Nature Methods, allow researchers to create sets of DNA variants in a single day for a few hundred dollars. Current methods take up to a week and cost tens of thousands of dollars.  As a pediatric neurologist who does a lot of genetic studies of kids with developmental disabilities, I frequently will scan a patient s whole genome for genetic variants,  said Christina Gurnett, MD, PhD, the study s senior author and an associate professor of neurology and of pediatrics.  Sometimes I ll find a known variant that causes a particular disease, but more often than not I find genetic variants that no one s ever seen before, and those results are very hard to interpret.  In the past, scientists tested the effect of genetic variants one by one, a laborious process. At a single point in the DNA sequence, they replaced the correct DNA letter   an A, T, C or G   with one of the other three options. Then, they translated that DNA sequence into a protein and evaluated whether the mutated protein behaved differently than the original one. More recently, researchers have begun creating sets of hundreds of variants in which each letter in a particular DNA sequence is changed, and then testing the set all at once. Such studies have been limited, however, by the high cost of creating those sets. Postdoctoral researcher Gabriel Haller, PhD, who was working in Gurnett s lab, realized that he could harness common laboratory techniques and tools to create sets of DNA variants without the expensive equipment and reagents that drove up the price. Haller copied a DNA sequence using the four standard DNA letters and a nonstandard letter known as inosine. Each copy of the sequence was identical except for one inosine, which was located at a random spot and served as a placeholder. Then, he replaced the inosine with one of the standard DNA letters, creating a single mutation in each copy of the sequence. Gurnett and colleagues are applying this technique to genes associated with aortic aneurysms, a weakening and ballooning of the aortic wall that can be fatal.  Over the long term, Gurnett envisions the creation of a catalog listing the effects of every possible variant. The speed and cheapness of the new technique make such a catalog possible.  Then, when clinicians find a variant that s never been seen before in one of these genes associated with aortic aneurysm, they can go through this catalog and say,  Yes, this mutation does have a negative effect on that protein, so it s likely harmful ,  Gurnett said.  It would help them decide what to tell the patient. This would be one piece of the big interpretation puzzle for genetic mutations.

Scientists at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre studied over 200 mouth and over 100 gut microbiome samples from people who had advanced melanoma. They discovered that people whose cancer responded to immunotherapy treatment had more diversity in the types of bacteria found in their gut. They also found significant differences in the type of bacteria found in the gut of people whose cancer responded versus those who didn t. There was no difference in the type of mouth bacteria between patients. Early studies in mice have shown that changing the type of bacteria that live in the gut can improve the response to immunotherapy, but this is one of the first studies to look at the link in patients. Immunotherapy, which harness the body s immune system to target cancer cells, are an exciting avenue of cancer treatment. However, not all patients respond to these treatments, and researchers are trying to understand why. This research suggests that adapting people s gut bacteria, such as giving antibiotics, probiotics, or a faecal transplant before immunotherapy, could increase the benefits already achieved with new immunotherapy drugs now being used to treat several different types of cancer. However, this needs to be tested clinical trials. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK with about 14,600 people being diagnosed each year. And each year about 2,300 die from the disease. Dr Jennifer Wargo, lead researcher at the University of Texas, said:  Our research shows a really interesting link that may mean the immune system is aided by gut bacteria when responding to these drugs. Not all patients respond to immunotherapy drugs and it s hard to know who will benefit from the treatment prior to it being given.  The gut microbiome can be changed through a number of different strategies, so there is real potential here to modify the gut microbiome to boost an immunotherapy response.  Dr Pippa Corrie, Chair of the NCRI's Skin Cancer Clinical Studies Group, said:  There is growing evidence that gut bacteria play a vital role in warding off disease, absorbing nutrients from the food we eat, and maintaining normal function of our immune systems.  Gut microbes have been shown to influence the role of conventional chemotherapy, so it s probably not surprising that they impact on response to new immunotherapies being used in the clinic. Manipulating the gut flora may be a new strategy to enhance activity of immunotherapy drugs, as well as to manage problematic toxicity in the future.  Source: Story from Cancer Research UK.

In doing so, they develop creative and effective ways to counter and evade the antiviral responses of their mammal hosts  immune systems. Researching those mechanisms at the molecular level can reveal key insights into the principles of such strategies relevant to therapy development. An international team of scientists, led by prof. Savvas Savvides of the VIB Inflammation Research Center at Ghent University, set out to do just that. By zooming in on GIF   a protein secreted by the virus that causes Orf, or  thistle disease    they unraveled viral molecular strategies to counter the mammalian immune system. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, provide the basis for developing antiviral therapies and for exploiting the potency of viral proteins to tweak the human immune system to counter inflammatory diseases and cancer. Orf disease is highly contagious and causes painful scabby lesions on the lips and nostrils of animals such as sheep, goats and other livestock. As a zoonotic disease, it can also be transmitted to humans. In fact, Orf is in the top 20 most important viral diseases affecting the rural poor in developing countries   especially in economies that depend heavily on animal farming and agriculture. Although seldom fatal, the disease not only potentially leads to high mortality rates in young animals and children when lesions make it impossible for them to eat; lesions can also impact livestock reproduction and make infected hosts vulnerable to other infections. Determining just how the virus goes about its infectious business is of major socioeconomic significance. An integrative, cross-border approach Coordinated by prof. Savvas Savvides from VIB-Ghent University and spearheaded by Dr. Jan Felix, an international team of scientists rose to the challenge of shedding light onto how Orf cripples the mammalian immune system. The aim? To obtain structural and mechanistic information through an integrative structural biology approach on how GIF   one of the proteins secreted by the Orf virus   inactivates two key cytokines of the host immune system: IL-2 and GM-CFS. Both proteins play key roles in cell signaling and immune system regulation. Prof. Savvides:  Our approach involved the use of various methods in the spirit of integrative structural biology, including x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, combined with biochemical and biophysical studies. To achieve this, we worked closely with colleagues from France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In addition, much appreciated research funding from national and international agencies, as well as access to specialized facilities at the European level proved to be crucial for our research.  A rare and surprising discovery Prof. Savvides:  We investigated GIF because we are intrigued by how viruses use specialized proteins to change the immune system s response. What we discovered was surprising: it is very rare that one viral protein can target two different host proteins to dodge the immune response, yet this functional duality is exactly what characterizes GIF. Most surprising was the finding that GIF uses its structure in distinct ways to target the cytokines IL-2 and GM-CSF with high affinity.  Remarkably, GIF s structure does not look anything like the natural receptors of the cytokines it targets, yet it is able to mimic their ability to bind to IL-2 and GM-CSF to prevent the normal functions of the two cytokines. A scary feat!  Great potential for innovative therapies Prof. Savvides:  By unveiling how GIF works, we have taken an important step towards understanding the molecular virtuosity that viral proteins develop as they evolve, and how they interact with their hosts  immune systems. As our research moves forward, we would like to consolidate our findings. This, in turn, may help us use viral protein structures, like GIF, to target human proteins in a therapeutic context to combat inflammatory diseases and cancer.

This gene was found to change the way brain cells grow and communicate. This finding, published in Cell Reports, provides new insights into ASD that will guide identification of new medications for people with ASD. This is critical because ASD affects one in 68 individuals, and there are no medications that target the core symptoms of this complex disorder. The researchers discovered an important  on  button in DIXDC1 protein that instructs brain cells to form mature connections called synapses with other brain cells during development. Working with the leading geneticist Stephen Scherer from The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, the team identified genetic changes that keep DIXDC1 turned  off  in a group individuals with autism, predicted to cause brain synapses to stay immature, and reduce brain activity.  Because we pinpointed why DIXDC1 is turned off in some forms of autism, my lab at the SCCRI, which specializes in drug discovery, now has the opportunity to begin the searching for drugs that will turn DIXDC1 back on and correct synaptic connections,  said Karun Singh, a scientist with the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute (SCCRI) and leader of the study.  This is exciting because such a drug would have the potential to be a new treatment for autism.  While this discovery holds promise, mutations in DIXDC1 account for only a small number of individuals with autism and related psychiatric conditions, Singh said.  However, there is strong evidence that many other autism genes disrupt the development of synapses similar to DIXDC1; therefore, the key to a new treatment for autism will be to find safe medications that restores brain cell synapse growth and activity.  Mick Bhatia, director of the SCCRI, said the discovery signifies the institute s strategic entry into the area of neural disease and genetic guided personalized drug development.

Scientists around the world are researching its causes and molecular processes in the attempt to find a treatment. The research just published by a group of scientists from the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) led by Eul lia Mart , in cooperation with researchers from the University of Barcelona (UB) and August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), has brought to light new information on the molecular mechanisms that cause Huntington s disease, and defines new pathways to therapy discovery. The results of the study are published in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation. Eul lia Mart  is the lead author, while Laura Ru  and M nica Ba ez are its first authors. Huntington s disease is caused by the excessive repetition of a nucleotide triplet (CAG) in the Huntingtin gene. The number of CAG repetitions varies from person to person. Healthy individuals can have up to 36 repetitions. Nevertheless, as of 36 repetitions, Huntington s disease develops. The direct consequence of this excess of repetitions is the synthesis of a mutated protein different from what would be obtained without the additional CAG repetitions which has been considered the main cause of the disease for the past 20 years.  What we have observed in our study is that the mutated fragment acting as a conveyor the so-called messenger RNA is key in the pathogenesis,  says Dr. Eul lia Mart , lead author of the research project, together with Xavier Estivill, and acting group leader of the Genes and Disease laboratory at the Centre for Genomic Regulation.  The research on this disease being done by most groups around the world seeking new therapeutic strategies focuses on trying to prevent expression of the mutated protein. Our work suggests that blocking the activity of messenger RNA (the  conveyor ), would be enough to revert the alterations associated with Huntington s disease. We hope this will contribute to improving the strategies in place to find a cure,  states the researcher. Going deeper in molecular mechanisms, enables progress to future applications This work underscores the importance of rethinking the mechanisms behind illnesses to find new treatments. The work of scientists at the CRG has helped explore the molecular mechanisms that cause the disease. Now, their results will contribute to better delimit research efforts towards a cure. As opposed to most other research groups, Eul lia Mart s team has sought to identify whether the problem resided in the messenger RNA   which would be the copy responsible for manufacturing the protein   or in the resulting protein. Prior work indicated that mRNA produced, in addition to defective protein, other damages. This previous work was the starting point for Mart  and her fellow researchers, who have finally demonstrated that mRNA has a key role in the pathogenesis of Huntington s disease.  The research we have just published points to RNA s clear role in Huntington s disease. This information is very important in translational research to take on new treatments,  says the researcher.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/potential-therapies-against-drugresistant-bacteria-identified-205727,Potential Therapies Against Drug Resistant Bacteria Identified Researchers create new identification method for drug and drug combinations that may combat resistant infections  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Researchers at the National Institutes of Health s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), Clinical Center and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have created a new way to identify drugs and drug combinations that may potentially be useful in combating infections that are resistant to many different antibiotics. They developed an assay (test) to rapidly screen thousands of drugs to determine how effective they were against a variety of types of resistant bacteria. The screening method provides a potential new approach to repurpose known drugs and compounds to potentially help deal with powerful, hospital-borne infections, as well as emerging infectious diseases. NCATS scientist Wei Zheng, Ph.D., and NIH colleagues Peter Williamson, M.D., Ph.D., of NIAID, and Karen Frank, M.D., Ph.D. of the Clinical Center, used the test to screen approximately 4,000 approved drugs and other biologically active compounds, identifying 25 that suppressed the growth of two drug-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae that have become resistant to most major types of antibiotics. Drug-resistant Klebsiella has been a source of fatal infections in many hospitals across the country. The researchers also used the screening test to gauge the effectiveness of combinations of drugs against antibiotic-resistant bacteria in this study. They found three different three-drug combinations that were effective against 10 common strains of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. The new screening test applies high-throughput screening technology to examine thousands of drugs and compounds that inhibit bacterial growth. The 25 newly identified drugs and compounds consisted of 11 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, and 14 drugs still under investigation. They include antibiotics, antifungals, antiseptics, and an antiviral, antimalarial and anticancer drug/compound.  The results are very promising, and we think that the test can eventually help repurpose approved drugs and other compounds and find clinically relevant drug combinations that can be approved for to use in different ways that we have never used before,  Zheng said.  We re hoping this approach will lead to approvable, effective ways to combat dangerous infections by drug-resistant bacteria.  In recent years, an alarming number of increasingly drug-resistant and sometimes life-threatening bacterial strains have begun to emerge, especially in the hospital setting. For the most part, hospitals don t have the capability to quickly test large numbers of drugs   and combinations of drugs   against drug-resistant bacterial infections, Zheng said. The researchers realized that simply identifying the 25 active drugs and compounds would not be enough to potentially help patients with a drug-resistant infection. Some of the compounds were only weakly active, and at low and ineffective concentrations. The researchers decided to look for combinations of drugs that might work against the drug-resistant bacteria. They paired newly identified drugs from the repurposing screen with a standard-of-care antibiotic that did not work by itself. The goal was to make the drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive again to a standard-of-care antibiotic. That s just what the scientists found. They identified four sets of two-drug combinations that suppressed the growth of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Those antibiotics that previously were inactive due to resistance now became active against Klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of the second drug. For example, while the antibiotic colistin is completely ineffective against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, they showed that combining colistin with the drug doxycycline reversed the drug resistance. The researchers also examined three-drug combinations of broad-acting antibiotics that may be given immediately in the clinic to patients with severe infections, when doctors have little time to make decisions. They screened for 10 commonly seen drug-resistant bacterial strains.   We wanted to see which three-drug combinations made sense,  Zheng said.  We screened hundreds of drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and tested 15 combinations against the 10 strains. We found three sets of three-drug combinations had the most activity, and think these three combinations eventually may be useful to clinicians.  The scientists hope this technology can be developed to help clinicians make  real-time  treatment decisions for several highly resistant infections. Zheng thinks that the screening test could become an important addition to the clinician s toolbox, though commercialization is still some time away.  It can provide crucial information for a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases,  he said. Source: Story from the National Institutes of Health.

Grant Trobridge, an associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences, has altered the way a virus carries a beneficial gene to its target cell. The modified viral vectors reduce the risk of cancer and can be used for many blood diseases. Trobridge and his team report their development in Scientific Reports, an online open-access journal produced by the Nature Publishing Group. The team is translating their findings into a stem cell gene therapy to target a life-threatening immunodeficiency in newborns called SCID-X1, also known as  Boy in the Bubble Syndrome.  Gene therapy holds potential for treating genetic diseases by replacing defective genes with repaired ones. It has shown promise in clinical trials but has also been set back by difficulties delivering genes, getting them to work for a long time and safety issues. A joint French and English trial, for example, successfully treated 17 out of 20 patients with SCID-X1 only to see five of them develop leukemia. Trobridge and his colleagues are using a vector developed from a foamy retrovirus, so named because it appears to foam in certain situations. Unlike other retroviruses, they don t normally infect humans. They also are less prone to activate nearby genes, including genes that might cause cancer. Retroviruses are a natural choice for gene therapy because they work by inserting their genes into a host s genome. With an eye toward making the vector safer, the Trobridge team altered it to change how it interacts with a target stem cell so it would insert itself into safer parts of the genome. They found that it integrated less often near potential cancer-causing genes.  Our goal is to develop a safe and effective therapy for SCID-X1 patients and their families,  said Trobridge.  We ve started to translate this in collaboration with other scientists and medical doctors into the clinic.  Source: Story from Washington State University. Original piece written by Eric Sorensen.

This knowledge could help personalize cancer treatment by revealing which patients are likely to be treated successfully and those who may have a poorer prognosis. Tracking sequence changes over time could also provide a kind of early warning system to identify the emergence of an aggressive form of the cancer by providing a real-time window into tumor evolution. The findings bolster the growing notion that noninvasive, blood-based biopsies of what s known as circulating tumor DNA are likely to transform cancer care.  Now we can identify the subtype of the tumor, watch how it changes over time and begin to tailor our chemotherapy choices based on the presence or absence of specific mutations,  said assistant professor of medicine Ash Alizadeh, MD, PhD.  We ve moved beyond just measuring disease burden based on the amount of tumor DNA in the blood.  Alizadeh and assistant professor of radiation oncology Maximilian Diehn, MD, PhD, share senior authorship of the study, which was published Nov. 9 in Science Translational Medicine. Postdoctoral scholars Florian Scherer, MD, and David Kurtz, MD, and instructor Aaron Newman, PhD, are the lead authors. Longitudinal study of 92 patients The researchers conducted a study of 92 prospectively enrolled patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is highly biologically variable. As a result, patients vary widely in their response to treatment. About one-third of seemingly successfully treated patients eventually relapse, or their tumors become resistant to treatment. Additionally, a form of indolent B cell lymphoma, which progresses slowly with only mild symptoms, can transform without warning into an aggressive form of the disease.   This transformation is very difficult to detect, and usually requires an invasive biopsy to diagnose,  said Diehn.  Our approach will allow us to monitor patients over time with a simple blood test, and may help us identify transformation much earlier.  The researchers used an enhanced version of a technique they developed called CAPP-Seq to isolate and sequence circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, from blood samples from the patients. Unlike previous studies, which tracked lymphoma progression by monitoring the sequence of just one cancer-associated protein, CAPP-Seq can identify a much larger range of mutations in the tumor genome. They then compared the ctDNA sequences obtained from the patients  stored blood samples with those of the tumor cells from invasive biopsies, and paired the information with what was known about the course of the patient s disease and eventual outcome. They found that low levels of ctDNA after diagnosis but before treatment correlated strongly with progression-free survival in the patients. Those with higher levels of ctDNA faired more poorly overall. Furthermore, they were able to detect the presence of ctDNA in the blood of relapsing patients on average six months before any clinical symptoms appeared and as long as 2.5 years before clinical signs of relapse. Determining cancer s cell of origin Perhaps even more importantly, however, the researchers found they could use CAPP-Seq to determine the type of B cell from which the cancer originated and predict prognosis. About two-thirds of people with the germinal center subtype live for five years or more after diagnosis, while those with activated B-cell-like tumors have a poorer prognosis with current treatment regimes. These subtypes are known to predict differential responses to emerging targeted therapies, but they are cumbersome to measure accurately and require biopsies. Finally, the researchers were able to predict from the ctDNA sequences those patients whose disease was transforming into a much more aggressive form prior to the emergence of clinical symptoms, and even to identify and track specific mutations known to inhibit the response to the targeted therapy with a drug known as ibrutinib.  In this study we ve shown five distinct ways   by quantifying tumor burden, identifying disease subtype, cataloging mutations, predicting transformation and providing early warnings of recurrence   that circulating tumor DNA can yield potentially clinically useful information,  said Diehn.  Now we re eager to conduct prospective studies in recently diagnosed patients to learn how we can best improve patient care.  Source: Story from Stanford University School of Medicine.

Over the duration of a year, the researchers found that patients taking high-intensity statins had an increased chance of survival over those on moderate-intensity statins. The study was published online Nov. 9 in JAMA Cardiology. Statins, a class of drugs that lowers cholesterol levels in the blood, are commonly prescribed for preventing the acceleration of cardiovascular disease caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and stroke. Health-care providers have long debated the benefits of prescribing high-intensity statins to their patients with cardiovascular disease. Patients, in turn, have been hesitant to take them because of equivocal messages from their doctors and internet searches of patient and doctor perspectives.    Previously, there was definitely a certain amount of fear on the patient s part because most people don t like taking medication,  said Paul Heidenreich, MD, professor of cardiovascular medicine and the study s senior author. Some studies have shown an increased risk of side effects, such as diabetes or muscle damage, associated with higher-intensity statins. Conflicting recommendations In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association jointly recommended high-intensity statin therapy for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who were no older than 75. The ACC/AHA guidelines differed, however, from guidelines established in 2014 by the Veterans Affairs Health Care System, which recommended only moderate-intensity statins, noting the lack of conclusive evidence that higher-intensity statins are more beneficial than those of moderate intensity. In their study, Heidenreich and his team found evidence to support the ACC/AHA guidelines. They determined that high-intensity statins do in fact increase rates of survival, not only in younger and middle-aged patients with cardiovascular disease, but also in a patient population not well-studied: adults over 75.  The greatest strength of this study is that we used a very large, well-defined clinical cohort,  said Fatima Rodriguez, MD, a cardiology fellow at Stanford and the study s lead author.  The results show that high-intensity statins confer a survival advantage for patients with cardiovascular disease, including older adults.  Large sample size reduces possibility of chance The researchers studied the medical records of 509,766 patients across the country receiving care from the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.  This is a very large patient population rich in cardiovascular disease,  said Rodriguez.  In addition to defining this large, national patient population, we also had access to their detailed clinical data, including comorbidities and cholesterol values.  The primary purpose was to look at overall patient death rates from 2013 to 2014, the researchers said. They included patients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery disease.  These are basically the three main areas affected by plaque buildup   the heart, the brain and the large arteries of the rest of the body,  Heidenreich said. Patients were taking high-intensity, moderate-intensity or low-intensity statins in many different but commonly prescribed forms, such as rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. The researchers also followed one group that wasn t taking any statins. Patients had different severities of cardiovascular disease, making some more likely to be prescribed higher-intensity statins than others. So the researchers assigned each patient a score for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins and adjusted the results of the study accordingly. The results showed a 9 percent increased chance of survival for patients taking high-intensity statins compared to those receiving moderate-intensity treatments.  We found basically the same risk reductions reviewed by the Veterans Affairs guidelines, but they didn t think the benefit was significant because the sample size was small,  Heidenreich said.  We have so many more patients, we can be confident that it wasn t due to chance.  Examining specific patient groups The study considered data from patients over 75   a group little studied in clinical trials. It found that patients between the ages of 75 and 85 taking high-intensity statins had a survival-rate benefit comparable to that of younger patients: a 9 percent higher chance of survival compared to those on moderate-intensity statins.  Our results suggest that clinical trial data from heart studies for those younger than 75 could also be applied to this older population,  Heidenreich said. Finally, they studied the effect of different doses within the high-intensity statin group. Patients treated with the maximum dose of statins were 10 percent more likely to survive than patients on submaximal doses.  This suggests to practitioners that instead of starting a patient on a low dose, just to go ahead and put them on the maximum dose they can tolerate,  Rodriguez said. A limitation of the study was that the researchers were unable to determine whether patients died of cardiovascular disease or another cause. Settling the debate The next step, researchers said, is to find out why some patients who should be on high-intensity statins are not. They hope doctors will take their study s results into consideration when prescribing statins.  There are a lot of guidelines and recommendations out there, so I think we also have to make the system better,  Rodriguez said.  Maybe hospitals can employ a clinical reminder to doctors, a message that pops up on the doctor s screen that asks why a cardiovascular patient isn t on a high-intensity statin.  The researchers also hope to follow up on longer-term data from these patient populations.  Not only do we hope to continue studying this population, but we also hope to study patients without prior cardiovascular disease but who are at high risk for it,  said Rodriguez. Finally, they hope these results will help to settle the debate on which guidelines doctors should use when prescribing statins to patients. Heidenreich said,  We think this should give clinicians, physicians and nurse practitioners more comfort in following the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines and putting people with prior cardiovascular disease on a high-intensity statin.

Yet, as people age and some experience cognitive impairment, they tend to become less physically active. ""Physical activity is very important for brain function,"" said Amber Watts, assistant professor of clinical psychology at the University of Kansas (KU). ""We know that people who are physically active are less likely to develop AD. But we also know that for people already living with AD, physical activity can help them function better, decline more slowly and help them with symptoms like agitation, wandering and sleeplessness."" See Also: Exercise can tackle symptoms of schizophreniaAccording to Watts, too little is known about patterns of activity for people experiencing the early stages of AD. For instance, researchers have lacked useful data about how the progression of the disease itself plays a role in diminishing day-to-day physical activity. ""Part of the issue is they're a difficult population to study,"" she said. ""It's mostly assumed that they're not active, that they don't engage in physical activity, but our research showed people in early stages of AD are capable of being active they just need assistance."" Watts, who researches health behaviors, prevention strategies and bio-behavioral processes tied to cognitive decline and dementia, wanted to know if there were differences in physical activity between the two groups. She recently co-authored research appearing in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease that used state-of-the-art accelerometers to track daily physical activity of healthy people and those in the early stage of AD. Learn More: Exercise keeps hippocampus healthy in people at risk for Alzheimer's ""In researching physical activity, people in the past have collected data using body-worn devices like Fitbit and accelerometers that collect data every second,"" Watts said. ""But instead of using all the data, they've summed it into one score over the entire time the person was wearing the device. What we've done is look at variability in physical activity over course of the entire day. This may help us to customize interventions, and it may help us to understand disrupted sleep cycles as well."" Researchers say understanding daily patterns of physical activity could help design more effective interventions. Credit: KU News Service  With colleague Vijay Varma of the National Institute on Aging, Watts analyzed daily physical activity of 92 volunteers with and without AD at KU's Alzheimer's Disease Center in Kansas City. Participants wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers for a week. ""We found people with AD have different daily patterns of activity than people without AD,"" Watts said. ""They spend less time in moderate-intensity activity. But it has to do with time of day. They're a lot less active in the morning, when most people are at the peak of activity and that may influence caregivers and people who are trying to help people with dementia."" Related: Diet and exercise can reduce protein build-ups linked to Alzheimer's, study shows The KU researcher said understanding this different daily pattern in physical activity could be key to designing interventions and improving sleep for people with early AD, perhaps by targeting more physical activity in morning. Watts said the kinds of physical activity found to be helpful to people with AD might be as simple as finding time to walk around the neighborhood. Her past research includes studies on the benefits of walkable communities for older adults. ""Walking is actually the best thing,"" she said. ""It's low risk, it's safe, anyone can do it, it doesn't require specific equipment, it can be done anywhere. There are other light-intensity activities like stretching, tai chi, household chores, gardening, walking around the mall those are also beneficial. People with AD don't have to go to the gym, they just need to do something that keeps them moving and keeps them from sitting continuously."" Challenges for people with AD to getting physically active include changes to what researchers call ""motor planning"" that come along with typical symptoms of mild AD, even though gross motor function is largely preserved. ""That's the ability to plan out what movements they will do,"" Watts said. ""There's an interaction between cognitive features and motor features. If you have difficulty with cognition, you have trouble with motor function. For instance, if you want to walk, but fear getting lost, you are reluctant because you need cognition to guide motor behavior. In early stages of AD, people are still high functioning physically, but they perceive it's more difficult to get physically active."" Watts will present her latest findings to the annual meeting of the Gerontological Society of America in New Orleans taking place November 16-20, 2016. She's following up the research with a larger study of volunteers from KU's Alzheimer's Disease Center, which is headed by colleague Jeffrey Burns.

This allows neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's to spread through the brain. This the main conclusion of new research led by professor Patrik Verstreken (VIB-KU Leuven), in collaboration with Janssen Research & Development (Johnson & Johnson). If the spreading of these toxic proteins could be prevented, the progression of neurodegenerative diseases might be slowed down substantially. The research paper is published in the journal Cell Reports. See Also: Structure of toxic tau aggregates determines type of dementia, rate of progressionDuring neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's, toxic proteins are known to spread throughout the brain. As the disease progresses, more and more brain areas are affected. Prof. Patrik Verstreken (VIB-KU Leuven) says: ""You can compare it to a drop of ink that falls into a glass of water: gradually, the toxic proteins diffuse through the brain. We knew that the disease follows the existing brain paths but so far it wasn't clear which processes enabled the spread itself."" The researchers now offer proof that synapses are critical to mediate the transmission of toxic protein species and reveal the mechanisms behind this process. They show that the toxic proteins cross from one brain cell to the next by being engulfed by 'vesicles', small bubbles in the receiving brain cell. There the vesicles burst and release the toxic proteins. Verstreken notes ""We also show how familial history has an impact on this process. There are known genetic factors in the human population that increase the risk to develop Alzheimer's and we show that one of the more common genetic variants, dubbed 'BIN1', directly affects the transmission of toxic proteins at synapses. BIN1 'improves' the transmission at synapses but in doing so, it enables the spread of toxic proteins."" These findings open new perspectives for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. By understanding how toxic proteins are passed on between brain cells, researchers may also be able to identify therapeutic avenues to block this process or to shuttle the toxic proteins to the cellular ""waste bins."" Learn More: PET points to tau protein as leading culprit in Alzheimer's""Our work is based on in vitro experiments, so it will now be critical to put our models to the test in in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease.

""In the pancreas, the Kir6.2 channel blockade increases the insulin signaling, and insulin signaling decreases the blood glucose levels,"" says Dr. Shigeki Moriguchi. ""In the brain, insulin signaling increases the acquisition of memory through CaM kinase II activation by Kir6.2 channel blockade."" See Also: New link found between diabetes and Alzheimer s The research group, led by Dr. Moriguchi and Professor Kohji Fukunaga of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, thus concluded that Alzheimer's disease can be described as a diabetic disorder of the brain. Memantine, a drug widely used to treat Alzheimer's disease, is a well known inhibitor of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that prevent excessive glutamate transmission in the brain. Researchers have now found that memantine also inhibits the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (Kir6.2 channel), improving insulin signal dysfunction in the brain. In their experiment with mice, the researchers found that memantine treatment improved impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory-related behaviors in the mice through the inhibition of KATP channel Kir6.2. ""Since KATP channels Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 are critical components of sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) which is downstream insulin receptor signaling, the KATP channel inhibition by Memantine mediates the anti-diabetic drug action in peripheral tissues,"" says Moriguchi.

Their findings, which will be published online November 7 ahead of issue in The Journal of Experimental Medicine, could benefit clinical trials that test new treatments for the disease.  In HD, an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence in the gene encoding huntingtin protein results in the production of a mutant form of huntingtin that can aggregate and damage cells, particularly neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Patients display a progressive loss of voluntary and involuntary movements, as well as psychiatric and cognitive disturbances, and usually die 10 15 years after its onset.  Though genetic testing can identify HD patients long before their first symptoms appear in middle age, there are still no pharmacological treatments that can prevent or ameliorate the disease. A few drugs have shown promise in cell culture or animal models, but clinical trials in humans are time consuming because of the slow onset and progression of the disorder s clinical symptoms. Moreover, researchers are unable to take biopsies of the brain to assess the effects of potential therapeutic compounds. One of the earliest events in HD is that mutant huntingtin aggregates disrupt the function of mitochondria, lowering cellular energy levels and causing oxidative damage. Daria Mochly-Rosen and her team at Stanford have previously identified a molecule, P110, that can restore mitochondrial function and prevent neuronal death in mouse models of HD. Now the researchers set out to identify markers of HD in non-neural tissues that could be used to track the progression of the disease and its response to P110 or other candidate drugs. The team found that the levels of mitochondrial DNA, presumably released from dying neurons, were increased in the blood plasma of mice that were starting to develop the symptoms of HD. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA levels decreased at later stages of the disease. P110 treatment corrected plasma mitochondrial DNA back to the levels seen in healthy mice. Mochly-Rosen and colleagues identified several other potential biomarkers that were elevated in HD model mice, including the levels of 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine, a product of oxidative DNA damage, in the urine and the presence of mutant huntingtin aggregates and oxidative damage in muscle and skin cells. The levels of each of these biomarkers were reduced by P110 treatment. It remains to be seen whether all of these biomarkers are reliable indicators of HD in humans. The Stanford team found, however, that mitochondrial DNA levels were significantly elevated in plasma samples from a small number of HD patients.  We have identified several biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and treatment in mice,  says Mochly-Rosen.  We hope that our work will provide the basis for a larger study of patient samples that may ultimately identify biomarkers that can be used as surrogate markers to determine the benefit of therapeutic interventions in diagnosed but asymptomatic HD patients to prevent or delay disease onset.

It is a development they say could enable these tools to be targeted to specific parts of an individual s genome for use in precision medicine, developing therapies and treating disease. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The tools are polyamides, engineered DNA-binding molecules that are an important component of artificial transcription factors. Transcription factors   both natural and artificial   determine which genes are translated into proteins inside cells.  We know that transcription factors bind to specific sites in the genome and when they misfire they drive many diseases, including cancers,  explains lead study author Graham Erwin, a former graduate student in the lab of Aseem Ansari, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and the Genome Center of Wisconsin.  Using insights gleaned from this research, we hope to design polyamides that can bind to these same sites and outcompete the cancer-inducing factors, helping to repress that gene.  Transcription factors work by binding to a particular gene and then recruiting the cellular machinery necessary to read it and manufacture the desired protein, or they can stop a protein from being created. While polyamides had already been designed to attach to particular regions of the human genome and turn corresponding genes on or off, the new study answers lingering questions about where particular polyamides bind and ultimately function in the cell.  Our big question was, where are these molecules going across the genome?  says Erwin, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University.  With this study, we have a whole new understanding of how they read the genome.  Using a technique called COSMIC (Crosslinking of Small Molecules to Isolate Chromatin), the researchers were able to create polyamides that would bind to DNA in human embryonic stem cells. Then, using a light-activated  handle,  the scientists could search for the location where the polyamide had bound to the genome. This enabled them to build an atlas of specific binding sites within the context of whole cells. To their surprise, the researchers learned some polyamides can bind to DNA previously thought to be inaccessible. Each human genome, nearly five feet in length, must be highly packaged to fit inside the tiny volume of a cell s nucleus. To accomplish this extraordinary task, cells wind up tightly most parts of the DNA that isn t readily needed. At any given time, more than two-thirds of the DNA in the human stem cells the researchers used is packaged in this way. The study team found some of the polyamides were bound to this off-limits DNA. While the DNA is unavailable to most transcription factors, polyamides may be small enough to reach it, the researchers believe.  Being able to target a specific site in the genome is essential for the next generation of rationally designed therapies, and the lessons we ve learned have changed the way we design molecules to target individual genomes,  says Ansari. In a parallel study published Nov. 4 in the journal Angewandte Chemie, Ansari collaborated with Kan Xiong and Paul Blainey of MIT to visualize how these small molecules search long stretches of DNA for their binding sites. The study shows that these synthetic genome readers behave like  molecular sleds  and slide effortlessly across vast tracts of the genome. Together the studies provide new insights into how these molecules locate their preferred target sites in the genome.  For 15 years we ve been working on this idea and now it seems we re finally on the way to being able to intervene in a thoughtful way,  Ansari says.

Data analysis by Professor David Denning and published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B suggests that the opportunity to save lives is being missed. Using 2013 data of 1.5m deaths from AIDS, around 47% (700,000) were attributable to the four most common lethal fungal infections and 24% (360,000) to tuberculosis (TB). Scenarios and projections to 2020 for the reduction of avoidable deaths were constructed based on published outcomes of the real-life impact of diagnostics and generic antifungal drugs. The Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (GAFFI) concluded that access to rapid diagnostics and antifungals could prevent just over 1,000,000 deaths by 2020. GAFFI analysis predicts that on the current trajectory there will be 740,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2020. GAFFI is calling for a global focus on identifying and treating fungal diseases which could reduce this figure by 42% to 426,000. On the third anniversary of GAFFI s inception, the Foundation established to address access to fungal diagnostics and therapy worldwide, an urgent call is being made to focus attention on preventable opportunistic infections which account for most AIDS-related mortality, with a median age of death in the mid-30s. Professor David Denning of GAFFI and The University of Manchester comments:  Too many people die from AIDS, most of them adults in the prime of life. Our analysis shows that diagnosing and treating fungal diseases complicating HIV infection will drive down AIDS deaths in the short term.  Action could and should be taken by donors, national and international public health agencies, non-governmental organisations and governments toward achieving the UNAIDS mortality reduction target and the recently announced 2030 Millennium Development Goals.  Continued failure to focus efforts on advanced HIV infection and the 47% with fungal infections means the current UNAIDS target of fewer than 500,000 annual deaths by 2020 will almost certainly be missed - as was the aspirational target of zero AIDS deaths by 2015. Retention in care is a major factor but it is late presentation with overwhelming infection that is GAFFI s primary concern. Denning continues,  Our projections reveal that by improving access to just 60% of those who need it, over 300,000 lives could be saved per year.  By 2020, a total of over a million lives could have been saved, helping to meet the UNAIDS mortality reduction target reducing AIDS deaths to 500,000 per year.  Dr Meg Doherty, Department of HIV and Global Hepatitis Programme, World Health Organisation, says:  The HIV/AIDS epidemic is one of the greatest global health challenges. We commend GAFFI on drawing attention to undiagnosed and untreated fungal infections among people living with HIV.  We need to do more work to better understand the contribution of fungal infections to HIV morbidity and mortality and assuring that our current recommendations on screening and treating fungal infections are implemented at country level. The identification and early treatment of HIV should be a priority to save lives.  Source: Story from the University of Manchester.

Mutations in genes for the RAS family of proteins are present in nearly 90 percent of pancreatic cancers and are also highly prevalent in colon cancer, lung cancer and melanoma, the most dangerous kind of skin cancer. The group of proteins include three members, K-RAS, H-RAS and N-RAS. The prevalence of RAS mutations in human cancers and the dependence of tumors on RAS for survival has made a RAS a prime target for cancer research and drug discovery. Scientists and drug developers have long studied RAS oncogenes hoping to find a new treatment for cancer, but they have not yet been able to identify drugs that safely inhibit the oncogene s activity. John O Bryan, associate professor of pharmacology in the UIC College of Medicine, led a team of researchers that took a different approach to studying RAS, and discovered that a synthetic binding protein they call  NS1 monobody,  which they created in the lab, can block the activity of the RAS proteins.  We did not look for a drug or specifically for an inhibitor,  said O Bryan, who is also a member of the University of Illinois Cancer Center and holds an appointment at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago.  We used monobody technology, a type of protein-engineering technology, to identify regions of RAS that are critical for its function.  Unlike conventional antibodies, monobodies are not dependent on their environment and can be readily used as genetically encoded inhibitors, O Bryan said.  The beauty of the technology is that when a monobody binds a protein, it usually works as an inhibitor of that protein,  he said. Monobodies were developed by Shohei Koide, a co-author on the study who is professor of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at New York University. They have been used to target a diverse array of proteins that include enzymes and receptors. The researchers found that the NS1 monobody binds to an area of the RAS protein molecule that was not previously known to be important for its oncogenic activity. NS1 strongly inhibits oncogenic K-RAS and H-RAS function by blocking the ability of the protein to interact with an identical one to form a molecular pair. NS1 does not affect N-RAS. O Bryan says the findings, published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology, provide important insight into long-standing questions about how RAS proteins function in cells. These insights may help guide the development of new therapeutic approaches to treating cancer by interfering with mutant RAS function in cancer cells.  Development of effective RAS inhibitors represents a  holy grail  in cancer biology,  O Bryan said.  We now have a powerful tool we can use to further probe RAS function. While future studies and trials are needed before these findings can be leveraged outside the lab, this study provides new insight into how we can potentially inhibit RAS to slow tumor growth.

The advance is announced in an online publication in Nature Chemical Biology. The Leicester team members say they are delighted by their finding which could lead to new anti-cancer drugs thanks to  wonderful interdisciplinary collaboration involving biochemists and chemists from England, Scotland, France and USA.  Professor Ian Eperon and Dr Cyril Dominguez from the University of Leicester s Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology led the team that developed a new method to analyse the RNA step in expressing our genetic code. Dr Dominguez, of the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, said:  Our research aims at understanding how four-stranded RNA structures called G-quadruplexes affect cellular processes such as RNA splicing. In this research, we describe a novel method that, for the first time, allows us to show that G-quadruplexes form in long RNAs and in conditions where the splicing reaction can take place.  G-quadruplexes are specific structures formed when a piece of DNA or RNA folds into a four-stranded structure. DNA G-quadruplexes have been shown to be associated with diseases such as cancer and many small molecules called G-quadruplex binders have been developed as putative novel anti-cancer drugs, the best example being Quarfloxin that reached a phase II clinical trial. RNA G-quadruplexes are also believed to play important roles in cancers but to date there are no straightforward methods to prove that they exist in cells. If they form and do control RNA splicing, then the design of molecules that bind them would be a new route for the development of anti-cancer drugs. During the process of gene expression, DNA is transcribed to RNA molecules that are in turn translated to produce proteins. RNA splicing is an essential step in producing the finished messenger RNA and the RNA copied from one gene can be spliced in different ways. This is how the 20,000 human genes can produce around 130,000 proteins. This process is highly regulated and defects in its regulation are a common cause of many diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and some cancers. Professor Eperon said:  Our novel method, FOLDeR, will allow RNA scientists to investigate the existence of G-quadruplexes in physiological condition allowing a better understanding of their role in cellular processes. It is particularly interesting that the RNA we have been studying is one that plays an important role in some cancers. When the RNA is spliced using one set of sites, it produces a protein favouring cell survival. This is a problem for cancer treatments, many of which work by damaging growing cells in the hope that they will then die. However, when an alternative set of sites is used, the RNA produces a protein that encourages cell death. We have shown that G-quadruplexes form near the alternative sites, and our hope is that we can target these to shift splicing towards the pro-death pattern.  This is a major step forward in the G-quadruplex research field. In a follow-up paper, the team will report their work on drugs that exploit this structure. Dr Dominguez added:  We are delighted that a prestigious journal such as Nature Chemical Biology recognize the importance of our work. This has been a wonderful interdisciplinary collaboration involving biochemists and chemists from England, Scotland, France and USA.  This publication is crucial for us to obtain further funding and carry on with this topic. Our next step is to investigate the effect of G-quadruplex binders on RNA splicing and use this knowledge to design novel drugs with a high degree of specificity for cancer cells.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetically-engineering-diseasefighting-cells-195709,Genetically Engineering Disease Fighting Cells Researchers have engineered T cells to target tumour cells by inserting genes that encode a certain T cell receptor  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The human body produces T cells to recognize and fight disease. Each T cell has a unique T cell receptor (or TCR) on its surface that surveils small fragments of proteins presented by other cells. Upon detecting evidence of cancer or infection, a subset of T cells binds the diseased cells and orchestrates their elimination. When tumors and infections cannot be eradicated naturally, researchers employ immunotherapies to boost the immune system's effectiveness. By inserting genes encoding a tumor-specific TCR into a patient's T cells, researchers can engineer a large population of T cells to target tumor cells. This approach, called TCR gene therapy, has yielded clinical successes where conventional cancer treatments have failed. However, TCR gene therapy is not without risk. The introduced receptor can become tangled with the resident receptor in each engineered T cell, causing some of these cells to attack healthy cells. A new technique developed by Caltech researchers prevents this from happening, increasing the safety of TCR gene therapy. The technique, called domain swapping, was developed in the laboratory of David Baltimore, president emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology. A paper describing the findings appears in the November 8 issue of the journal eLife. The specificity of the TCR in each T cell results from the pairing of two protein chains called an alpha chain and a beta chain each of which has constant domains (shared between all TCRs) and variable domains (unique to each T cell). Normally, each T cell encodes only one alpha chain and one beta chain, which pair to form a single TCR. In TCR gene therapy, the introduction of genes encoding a tumor-reactive TCR results in T cells that express two alpha chains and two beta chains, with four possible pairings. This non-physiological situation poses a risk of autoimmunity. ""As T cells are produced, the immune system 'auditions' them, eliminating those that react to healthy cells and selecting those with potential to recognize diseased cells,"" says Michael Bethune, senior postdoctoral scholar in biology and biological engineering, and lead author on the study. ""However, in T cells engineered to express a second TCR, the introduced chains can mispair with the resident chains, resulting in TCRs with unintended and unpredictable specificity. These mispaired TCRs are not auditioned by the immune system, and some will target healthy cells causing autoimmunity."" Indeed, up to 90 percent of mice administered TCR-engineered T cells develop autoimmune disease, and cultured human T cells that are engineered to express two TCRs also react with healthy cells. The group's solution was to generate hybrid genes encoding TCR chains with their alpha and beta constant domains swapped in a compensatory fashion. When correctly paired, these domain-swapped TCRs retain all of the domains necessary to function. Indeed, the group found that domain-swapped TCRs and unmodified TCRs both function in human T cells, and they prevented tumor growth in mice to a similar extent. However, whereas unmodified TCRs mispaired with resident TCR chains in both mouse and human T cells, and caused autoimmunity in mice, domain-swapped TCRs did not. ""Mispairing between domain-swapped chains and resident chains results in TCRs that lack domains needed for functional assembly of the TCR complex,"" Bethune says. ""This ensures that only correctly paired domain-swapped TCRs function at the surface of the cell."" In addition to preventing mispairing, domain-swapped TCRs highlight a surprising robustness to the function of the TCR complex. The Caltech group teamed with Mike Kuhns at the University of Arizona to determine that domain-swapped TCRs assemble in a similar manner to unmodified TCRs despite significant structural rearrangement of the constituent protein chains. Domain-swapped TCRs may be useful tools for further study of the structure and function of the TCR complex. Finally, in collaboration with Wolfgang Uckert at the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin, the researchers showed that domain-swapped TCRs were expressed at higher levels on the T cell surface when the resident TCR genes were silenced. ""Our paper focuses on the increased safety afforded by domain-swapping, but combining these two solutions may result in a therapy with improved safety and efficacy compared to current practice,"" Bethune says.

The consortium will use antibodies to identify and characterise novel regulatory or allosteric sites on therapeutic target proteins, to stabilise functionally important protein conformational states, and to characterise key structural features of complexes formed with activity modulating antibodies. The unique knowledge gained by this approach will be exploited to guide the discovery and design of novel small molecule therapeutics, addressing unmet clinical needs and delivering significant benefits for patients. Antibody-assisted drug discovery is a relatively new field which builds on world-leading complementary research expertise in the UK, covering all aspects of monoclonal antibody production and structural biology. Combining expertise could lead to a step change in knowledge-based drug discovery and highlights the benefits of a public-private sector partnership approach to future drug discovery. Justin Bryans, Director, Drug Discovery at MRC Technology, said:  As a charity, it is part of MRC Technology s strategy to pursue riskier technologies if it can expedite new treatments to patients. Our capabilities in both antibody and small molecule drug discovery leave us ideally placed to help drive this new technology towards the clinic. Collaborating with UCB and the University of Leicester will undoubtedly help us achieve our ambition in this field.  Alistair Henry, Senior Director of Biological Spectroscopy at UCB, said:  UCB sees partnerships as fundamental to our success as the complexities of treating severe diseases are beyond the expertise and resource of a single organisation. Collaborating with MRC Technology and the University of Leicester to combine our expertise to open up new treatment opportunities through Antibody-Assisted Structure-Based Drug Discovery is a very exciting new venture.  Mark Carr, Professor of Biochemistry, Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology said:  The new consortium builds on very successful existing drug discovery collaborations between structural biology groups at the University and both MRC Technology and UCB. This exciting new venture brings together a world-leading combination of translational research scientists and by combining the expertise and knowledge available in the public and private sectors provides a tremendous opportunity to pioneer antibody-assisted drug discovery.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mislabelled-seafood-may-be-more-sustainable-201161,Mislabelled Seafood May Be More Sustainable Study finds mislabelling of seafood leads to more sustainable consumption as substituted fish are often more plentiful  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It s no secret that mislabeling is rampant around the world. Recent studies estimate up to 30 percent of seafood served in restaurants and sold in supermarkets is actually something other than what is listed on the menu or label. Why mislabeling happens is a little squishier. Fraud, human error or marketing ploys   combined with an often multicountry traverse from boat to restaurant   make it possible you are eating a different fish than what s on the menu. A University of Washington study is the first to broadly examine the ecological and financial impacts of seafood mislabeling. The paper, published online Nov. 2 in Conservation Letters, finds that in most cases, mislabeling actually leads people to eat more sustainably, because the substituted fish is often more plentiful and of a better conservation status than the fish on the label.  One of the motivations and hopes for this study is that we can help inform people who are trying to exert their consumer power to shift seafood markets toward carrying more sustainable options,  said co-author Christine Stawitz, a UW doctoral student in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences and the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management program. The researchers, all UW graduate students in aquatic and fishery sciences, aggregated data from 43 published papers that tested the DNA of fish at various locations, including ports, restaurants, grocery stores and fish markets to determine whether mislabeling occurred. They then matched the conservation status and estimated price for each of the mislabeled and true fishes listed in the studies. They found a wide range of conservation status and price differences, but two general trends emerged: True fish sold are of a better conservation status and slightly less expensive than the species named when fish are mislabeled.  We found a lot of diversity in conservation status across taxa,  said co-author Margaret Siple.  Depending on what you order or purchase, you can get a fish that is more endangered than what you ordered, or something that is actually of better conservation status. What we want to emphasize is how diverse these differences are.  Their analysis found that true fish are valued at about 97 percent of the mislabeled seafood. That means consumers are paying on average a little more for mislabeled fish. The study didn t examine the potential reasons behind this, but the researchers speculate that while it could be intentional mislabeling to rip off consumers, it is just as likely restaurants and markets are serving and stocking fish they think match the label, but are cheaper, more plentiful options. A white-fish filet can look like any number of species, they explained, and substitutions could happen anywhere in the supply chain. The new study also summarizes which fish are most likely to be mislabeled and of those which varied the most in conservation status between true fish and mislabeled fish. For example, snapper is one of the most frequently mislabeled fish. Its conservation status is vulnerable to endangered   meaning its population isn t doing well   but the fishes most often substituted for snapper are considered critically endangered. Results from this study could be useful in helping consumers make sustainable purchasing decisions by avoiding fish that are most likely to be mislabeled. That list is led by croakers, shark catfish (or  basa ), sturgeon and perch. Consumers can also look out for fish commonly replaced with species that are not from sustainable stocks. Examples include eel, hake and snapper. These results could also help seafood certification efforts such as the Marine Stewardship Council and the Monterey Bay Aquarium s Seafood Watch focus efforts on fisheries that are most likely to be mislabeled, the researchers say. The Marine Stewardship Council certifies fisheries for sustainable fishing practices and follows seafood from the port to markets. This study offers information about where mislabeling might happen when products aren t tracked through the whole chain of custody. A fish often travels from the port to processors and several distributors before reaching the end market, and this change of hands is likely where mislabeling happens, the new study found.  We hope this study can help regulators understand where in the chain of custody they should be putting their efforts,  Siple said. Source: Story from the University of Washington.

A team of researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine has used a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR to repair the gene that causes sickle cell disease in human stem cells, which they say is a key step toward developing a gene therapy for the disorder. The team went on to demonstrate that the mended cells could make a functioning  hemoglobin molecule, which carries oxygen in normal red blood cells, and then successfully transplanted the stem cells into mice. The researchers say the study represents a proof of concept for the repair of blood-borne genetic diseases, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. A paper describing the findings was published online Nov. 7 in Nature. Postdoctoral scholars Daniel Dever, PhD, and Rasmus Bak, PhD, are the lead authors; Matthew Porteus, MD, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics, is the senior author. A painful and deadly condition Sickle cell disease affects 70,000 to 100,000 Americans and millions globally, inflicting suffering and high health-care costs. Children born in high-income countries typically survive with the chronic disease, while those born in low-income countries typically die before the age of 5. The disease results from a single mutation in the gene that codes for one of the protein chains that make up the hemoglobin molecule. Hemoglobin is the main constituent of red blood cells and allows the cells to pick up oxygen from the lungs and drop it off in tissues throughout the body, from the brain to the muscles. The sickle mutation causes the red blood cells to make an altered version of the hemoglobin that forces the red cell into a sickle shape when oxygen levels drop. The sickle cells are rigid and sticky. They can clog blood vessels, causing pain and organ damage. In addition, sickle cells die faster than normal red blood cells, often leading to anemia, which can also damage organs. The holy grail Gene therapy, generally, has been the holy grail of gene-based therapeutics since the 1980s, with just a sprinkling of individual successes over the years. Increasingly, though, better techniques are raising hopes for practical therapies that can permanently cure genetic diseases like sickle cell.  What we ve finally shown is that we can do it,  said Porteus.  It s not just on the chalkboard. We can take stem cells from a patient and correct the mutation and show that those stem cells turn into red blood cells that no longer make sickled hemoglobin.  Porteus said that in previous work, he has targeted sickle cell genes with an older gene-editing technology but that the new CRISPR technology is faster and easier to work with.  We spent half a dozen years trying to target the beta globin gene using the old technology,  he noted, adding that within one week of trying CRISPR, they had an editing tool that worked much better. CRISPR is a combination of an enzyme that can cut a selected DNA sequence and a  guide RNA  that takes the enzyme exactly where you want to make the cut   in this case, at the sickle cell mutation. Once the mutated DNA sequence has been removed, other tools can help paste in a copy of the normal sequence. The Porteus team started with human stem cells from the blood of patients with sickle cell disease, corrected the gene mutation using CRISPR and then concentrated the human stem cells so that 90 percent carried the corrected sickle cell gene. The stem cells are a type called hematopoietic stem cells, that make blood cells. The team injected the concentrated, corrected hematopoietic stem cells into young mice.  These stem cells have a property to be able to get from the blood system into the bone marrow where they then set up shop and start making other blood cells,  said Porteus. When the team examined the bone marrow of the mice after 16 weeks, the corrected stem cells were thriving there. The corrected red blood cells needn t replace all of a patient s original sickle cells, said Porteus. If the proportion of sickle cells is below 30 percent, patients have no symptoms of disease. And corrected cells have about a tenfold advantage over uncorrected cells, he said. That s because red blood cells afflicted with sickle cell tend to sickle and die after an average of only 10 days. In contrast, the corrected cells live the length of normal red blood cells, about 120 days. So, the numbers of corrected cells rapidly outstrip those of uncorrected cells. Is it safe? Although gene therapy research has made great strides in recent years, it has yet to be widely deployed, and no CRISPR-edited genes have yet been tested for safety or efficacy in human clinical trials. Examples of potential problems include unforeseen immune reactions or altering the wrong sequence of DNA   so-called off-target effects. The effects of gene editing in general are impossible to predict. As Porteus said,  The consensus in the field is that there s no one test we can do to prove that something is safe. We can t just say,  Oh, just run this test, and that ll show if it s safe or not.  That test doesn't exist.  Instead, he said, a series of different tests may each offer some insights about potential safety. For now, Porteus and his team found that their corrected human hematopoietic stem cells seemed to behave like normal, healthy human hematopoietic stem cells.  We re excited about working to eventually bring this type of therapy to patients,  said Porteus.  Stanford is building the infrastructure so that we can take our discovery in the lab and develop it so we can scale up the laboratory process to a process that will be needed to treat a patient. We hope to develop the entire process here at Stanford.  Source: Story from Stanford University School of Medicine. Original piece written by Jennie Dusheck.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/early-warning-system-for-colorectal-cancer-193094,Early Warning System for Colorectal Cancer  Potential new diagnostic tool identified for the second most common cancer in the world   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Tumor invasion into vein in a case of colorectal cancer. By Patho  [CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons Scientists at Washington State University and Johns Hopkins Medical School have discovered a fast, noninvasive method that could lead to the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Using ultrasensitive, high-speed technology, the researchers identified a suite of molecules in the feces of mice that signifies the presence of precancerous polyps. This  metabolic fingerprint  matches changes in both mouse and human colon tumor tissues and suggests a potential new diagnostic tool for early detection of colorectal cancer in a clinical setting. Herbert Hill, WSU Regents professor, and graduate student Michael Williams conducted the study in collaboration with Raymond Reeves, WSU School of Molecular Biosciences, and Linda Resar, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Better screening tools needed Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Nearly 1.4 million new cases were diagnosed in 2012, according to the World Cancer Research Fund International. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Though early detection is key to successful treatment, most screening tests are limited in diagnostic capability or ease of application. Colonoscopy, for example, is a known lifesaver but is costly and unappealing to many people who might otherwise undergo testing. Decreasing the invasiveness of the procedure could help. Williams said more people would be willing to provide a stool sample than undergo a biopsy through a colonoscope. In addition, colonoscopes can only extend a limited distance into the large intestine, potentially missing some polyps.  With our new test, it could be possible to diagnose cancer occurring throughout the entire colon,  he said.  Sniffing  out cancer Hill and Williams discovered the molecular fingerprint for colon cancer using a technology called ion mobility-mass spectrometry. IMMS is found in sensor devices worldwide that sniff out illicit drugs, chemical warfare agents and explosives in airports. Hill has been an innovator in the field for nearly 40 years. In this case, IMMS was coupled with ultraperformance liquid chromatography. The researchers first identified metabolic products from normal colon tissue in both humans and mice. IMMS can measure hundreds of metabolites simultaneously, such as enzymes, fats, glucose and amino acids. The scientists then compared this normal profile to that found in cancerous colon tissues from humans and research mice with polyps in their colons that mimic those in humans. In both cases, the scientists found that colon cancer caused significant changes in fat metabolism, especially for lipids and fatty acids. These abnormalities created a molecular fingerprint that was similar in humans and mice, said Hill. Diagnostic changes in the feces Next, Hill and Williams examined droppings from transgenic and control mice to see if the molecular fingerprint could be found in feces as well. Indeed IMMS detected many of the same metabolic abnormalities seen in the previous study and could clearly distinguish between healthy mice and those with colorectal cancer.  The feces was not exactly the same as the tissue samples, but it had a lot of similarities to the tissue,  said Hill.  We found the lipids and fatty acids were changing   and there were also changes in the amino acids.  Specifically, an important class of fats called lysophospholipids changed dramatically, said Williams.  These types of lipids are known to be important in the development of cancer and are particularly tied to colorectal cancer.  All of which is encouraging to Hill and Williams as they search for a more user-friendly method to diagnose colorectal cancer in the early stages. Early warning system  The benefit of early detection is that we can catch cancer before it metastasizes to other parts of the body,  said Williams.  Our results represent the zero stage of cancer, the polyp stage   as early as colon cancer can be detected.   The exciting part is being able to see differences in the stool,  said Hill.  This could lead to a noninvasive, more comprehensive early-warning detection method for colorectal cancer, but a lot of research needs to be done before it can be actually realized.  Their next step, if funded, is to evaluate human stool samples to see if the molecular fingerprint is present with colorectal cancer in people. Hill said the laboratory equipment needed to run these diagnostic tests is already commercially available. Source: Story from Washington State University.

To date, more than twenty genes are identified as a causative of inherited ALS, and many researchers investigate the pathomechanism of ALS. A research team led by Prof. Koji Yamanaka of Nagoya University found that collapse of the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) is a common pathological hallmark to two distinct inherited forms of ALS: SOD1- and SIGMAR1- linked ALS. The research findings are reported in EMBO Molecular Medicine. See Also: New gene variants present in 3 percent of all ALS patientsThe researchers focused on the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), which is a contacting site of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recent studies have revealed that the MAM plays a key role in cellular homeostasis, such as lipid synthesis, protein degradation, and energy metabolism. Intriguingly, a recessive mutation in SIGMAR1 gene, which encodes sigma 1 receptor (Sig1R), a chaperone enriched in the MAM, is causative for a juvenile ALS. In this study, the researchers identified a novel ALS-linked SIGMAR1 mutation, c.283dupC/p.L95fs in a juvenile-onset ALS case. Moreover, ALS-linked Sig1R mutant proteins were unstable and non-functional, indicating a loss-of function mechanism in SIGMAR1-linked ALS. A loss of Sig1R function induced MAM disruption in neurons. However, it was still unknown whether the MAM alternation was also involved in the other ALS cases. To address this question, the researchers cross-bred SIGMAR1 deficient mice with the other inherited ALS mice which overexpress a mutant form of SOD1 gene. SIGMAR1 deficiency accelerated disease onset of SOD1-ALS mice by more than 20 percent. In those mice, inositol triphosphate receptor type-3 (IP3R3), a MAM-enriched calcium ion (Ca2+) channel on ER, was disappeared from the MAM. The loss of proper localization of IP3R3 led to Ca2++ dysregulation to exacerbate the neurodegeneration. The researchers also found that IP3R3 was selectively enriched in motor neurons, suggesting that integrity of the MAM is crucial for the selective vulnerability in ALS. Learn More: ALS: Renewing brain's aging support cells may help neurons survive These results provide us with new perspectives regarding future therapeutics, especially focused on preventing the MAM disruption for ALS patients. Together with the research from other groups, collapse of the MAM is widely observed in the other genetic causes of ALS, and therefore it may be applicable to sporadic ALS patients.

Scientists around the world are researching its causes and molecular processes in the attempt to find a treatment. Research recently published by a group of scientists from the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) led by Eul lia Mart , in cooperation with researchers from the University of Barcelona (UB) and August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), has brought to light new information on the molecular mechanisms that cause Huntington's disease, and defines new pathways to therapy discovery. The results of the study are published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Eul lia Mart  is the lead author, while Laura Ru  and M nica Ba ez are its first authors. See Also: New evidence: How amino acid cysteine combats Huntington's diseaseHuntington's disease is caused by the excessive repetition of a nucleotide triplet (CAG) in the Huntingtin gene. The number of CAG repetitions varies from person to person. Healthy individuals can have up to 36 repetitions. Nevertheless, as of 36 repetitions, Huntington's disease develops. The direct consequence of this excess of repetitions is the synthesis of a mutated protein-different from what would be obtained without the additional CAG repetitions-which has been considered the main cause of the disease for the past 20 years. ""What we have observed in our study is that the mutated fragment acting as a conveyor-the so-called messenger RNA-is key in the pathogenesis,"" says Dr. Eul lia Mart , lead author of the research project, together with Xavier Estivill, and acting group leader of the Genes and Disease laboratory at the Centre for Genomic Regulation. ""The research on this disease being done by most groups around the world seeking new therapeutic strategies focuses on trying to prevent expression of the mutated protein. Our work suggests that blocking the activity of messenger RNA (the ""conveyor""), would be enough to revert the alterations associated with Huntington's disease. We hope this will contribute to improving the strategies in place to find a cure,"" states the researcher. Related: Study identifies new biomarkers for Huntington's diseaseGoing deeper in molecular mechanisms enables progress to future applications This work underscores the importance of rethinking the mechanisms behind illnesses in order to find new treatments. The work of scientists at the CRG has helped explore the molecular mechanisms that cause the disease. Now, their results will contribute to better delimit research efforts towards a cure. As opposed to most other research groups, Eul lia Mart 's team has sought to identify whether the problem resided in the messenger RNA which would be the copy responsible for manufacturing the protein or in the resulting protein. Prior work indicated that mRNA produced, in addition to defective protein, other damages. This previous work was the starting point for Mart  and her fellow researchers, who have finally demonstrated that mRNA has a key role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's chorea. ""The research we have just published points to RNA's clear role in Huntington's disease. This information is very important in translational research to take on new treatments,"" says the researcher. Read Next: Activity of Huntington's disease gene curbed for 6 months in miceMore in-depth studies on these mechanisms are yet to be done. For example, research must explore whether it will be possible to revert the effects of Huntington's disease in patients, just as researchers have demonstrated in mouse models. It also remains to be seen whether the proposal of the CRG researchers can be used in a preventive way, as the disease does not generally appear until after 40 years of age (in humans). Despite the remaining gaps, the published work makes for a key step in knowledge of the mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disease that, as of today, remains incurable.

This strong sense of circadian rhythm (the 24 hour time cycle) is generated by a clock that ticks in the brain of all animals including humans. The fly's clock consists of about one hundred neurons in its 100,000-neuron brain, which can fit on a pin head. Inside each clock neuron is a ""molecular clock"" that consists of clock genes, which switch each other on and off every night and day. See Also: Setting the circadian clock Writing in the journal PNAS, a team of researchers, led by Dr. Edgar Buhl and Dr. James Hodge from the University of Bristol in collaboration with Professor Ralf Stanewsky's group at University College London, explain how they identified three novel proteins that act together on the surface of clock neurons to make the clock light responsive. ""To be useful for an organism, circadian clocks need to be synchronized (or reset) to the natural environment cycles of light and temperature, much like you need to reset your alarm clock or watch when you change time zone,"" said Hodge from Bristol's School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience. The findings could ultimately have implications for identifying novel membrane drug targets for sleeping disorders and jetlag, while furthering scientific understanding of the relationship between body clocks and health, as well as aging and neurodegenerative disease. The research builds on one of Professor Stanewsky's earlier discoveries regarding the Quasimodo gene, named after the fact that some mutant versions of the gene caused Drosophila to have hunched backs. Learn More: Human brain clocks exposed: Effects of circadian clocks and sleep loss vary across brain regions, study finds Using a red fluorescent protein to illuminate the clock neurons and record electrical activity in the brain, the authors showed that Quasimodo regulates light responses in the fly's clock neurons, thereby controlling the circadian rhythm. Recordings from the fly clock neurons were taken at different times of the day, showing that they were more excitable in the day as opposed to at night. Using fly genetics to alter the amount of Quasimodo in the clock neurons, the researchers found that increasing Quasimodo caused the clock neurons to be less active as they would be at night, while decreasing Quasimodo had the opposite effect. The Quasimodo protein is localised at the cell surface and electrical activity is generated in the membrane by small pores called ion channels. Therefore attention was turned to ion channels that were known to be active in clock neurons and that could potentially interact with Quasimodo to form a ""membrane clock"", which could control these day-night differences in electrical activity. Read Next: Blast of thin air can reset circadian clocks The first component of the membrane clock was a potassium channel called Shaw (dKv3.1), which Dr Hodge and Professor Stanewsky had previously shown to be important for circadian rhythms. The second component was the ion transporter NKCC, which also plays an important role in the day/activity changes in the mammalian brain clock. This latest study shows that Quasimodo interacts with Shaw and NKCC to form a membrane clock that controls daily changes in electrical activity of clock neurons, which allows the clock to respond to light.

Now, the Journal of Neuroscience Research is dedicating an issue entirely to sex differences at all levels of the brain, from the genetic and epigenetic level, to the synaptic, cellular, and systems levels. See Also: Neural fundamentals: Sex differences in the nervous system In one study in the issue, researchers examined how variants in the gene that codes for a protein called galanin might influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) in males compared with females. Recent studies have found elevated levels of this protein in post-mortem brain samples of patients with MS. In this latest work, investigators compared the frequencies of ""more active"" and ""less active"" variants of the DNA sequences that control expression of the galanin gene between healthy controls and MS patients. Initially they found no difference between the two groups; however, when considering gender, there was a more than twofold decrease in a ""less active"" genetic variant in healthy men compared with healthy women. Moreover, the presence of this variant increased susceptibility to MS in men but not in women. The presence of this variant in men was also associated with delayed onset of MS. Interestingly, the progression rate of MS was significantly accelerated in women if they carried the variant.

This is the first time these cell types have been shown to be a promising marker for prostate cancer spread. In a study of around 80 samples from men with prostate cancer, scientists at the Barts Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University looked for cells that were gaining the ability to migrate and invade through the body. Samples with more of these cells were more likely to come from patients whose cancer had spread or was more aggressive. This means that, in the future, these cells could potentially be used as a marker to monitor prostate cancer patients and predict if the disease is going to spread   alongside other monitoring techniques. There are around 46,500 new cases of prostate cancer each year in the UK, and around 11,000 people die from the disease each year. Dr Yong-Jie Lu, lead author from QMUL s Barts Cancer Institute, said:  Our research shows that the number of these specific cells in a patient s sample is a good indicator of prostate cancer spreading. By identifying these cells, which have gained the ability to move through the body, we have found a potential new way to monitor the disease.  If we re able to replicate these studies in larger groups of people, we may be able to one day predict the risk of someone s cancer spreading so they can make more informed treatment decisions.

Their method uses tiny particles embedded in the material, that give off laser light. The team synthesized these  laser particles  in the shape of tiny chopsticks, each measuring a small fraction of a human hair s width. The particles are made from lead iodide perovskite   a material that is also used in solar panels, and that efficiently absorbs and traps light. When the researchers shine a laser beam at the particles, the particles light up, giving off normal, diffuse fluorescent light. But if they tune the incoming laser s power to a certain  lasing threshold,  the particles will instantly generate laser light. The researchers, led by MIT graduate student Sangyeon Cho, demonstrated they could stimulate the particles to emit laser light, creating images at a resolution six times higher than that of current fluorescence-based microscopes.  That means that if a fluorescence microscope s resolution is set at 2 micrometers, our technique can have 300-nanometer resolution   about a sixfold improvement over regular microscopes,  Cho says.  The idea is very simple but very powerful and can be useful in many different imaging applications.  Cho and his colleagues have published their results in the journal Physical Review Letters. His co-authors include Seok Hyun Yun, a professor at Harvard; Nicola Martino, a research fellow at Harvard and MGH s Wellman Center for Photomedicine; and Matja  Humar, a researcher at the Jozef Stefan Institute. The research was done as part of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. A light in the dark When you shine a flashlight in a darkened room, that light appears as a relatively diffuse, hazy beam of white light, representing a jumble of different wavelengths and colors. In stark contrast, laser light is a pointedly focused, monochromatic beam of light, of a specific frequency and color. In conventional fluorescence microscopy, scientists may inject a sample of biological tissue with particles filled with fluorescent dyes. They then point a laser beam through a lens that directs the beam through the tissue, causing any fluorescent particles in its path to light up. But these particles, like microscopic flashlights, produce a relatively indistinct, fuzzy glow. If such particles were to emit more focused, laser-like light, they might produce sharper images of deep tissues and cells. In recent years, researchers have developed laser-light-emitting particles, but Cho s work is the first to apply these unique particles to imaging applications. Chopstick lasers The team first synthesized tiny, 6-micron-long nanowires from lead iodide perovskite, a material that does a good job of trapping and concentrating fluorescent light. The particles  rod-shaped geometry   which Cho describes as  chopstick-like    can allow a specific wavelength of light to bounce back and forth along the particles  length, generating a standing wave, or very regular, concentrated pattern of light, similar to a laser. The researchers then built a simple optical setup, similar to conventional fluorescence microscopes, in which a laser beam is pumped from a light source, through a lens, and onto a sample platform containing the laser particles. For the most part, the researchers found that the particles emitted diffuse fluorescent light in response to the laser stimulation, similar to conventional fluorescent dyes, at low pump power. However, when they tuned the laser s power to a certain threshold, the particles lit up considerably, emitting much more laser light. Cho says that the new optical technique, which they have named LAser particle Stimulated Emission (LASE) microscopy, could be used to image a specific focal plane, or a particular layer of biological tissue. Theoretically, he says, scientists can shine a laser beam into a three-dimensional sample of tissue embedded throughout with laser particles, and use a lens to focus the beam at a specific depth. Only those particles in the beam s focus will absorb enough light or energy to turn on as lasers themselves. All other particles upstream of the path s beam should absorb less energy and only emit fluorescent light.  We can collect all this stimulated emission and can distinguish laser from fluorescent light very easily using spectrometers,  Cho says.  We expect this will be very powerful when applied to biological tissue, where light normally scatters all around, and resolution is devastated. But if we use laser particles, they will be the narrow points that will emit laser light. So we can distinguish from the background and can achieve good resolution.  Giuliano Scarcelli, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, says the technique s success will hinge on successfully implementing it on a standard fluorescence microscope. Once that is achieved, laser imaging s applications, he says, are promising.  The fact that you have a laser versus fluorescence probably means you can measure deeper into tissue because you have a higher signal-to-noise ratio,  says Scarcelli, who was not involved in the work.  We ll need to see in practice, but on the other hand, with optics, we have no good way of imaging deep tissue. So, any research on this topic is a welcome addition.  To implement this technique in living tissue, Cho says laser particles would have to be biocompatible, which lead iodide perovskite materials are not. However, the team is currently investigating ways to manipulate cells themselves to glow like lasers.  Our idea is, why not use the cell as an internal light source?  Cho says.  We re starting to think about that problem.  Source: Story from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Original piece written by Jennifer Chu.

Proteins are the molecular workhorses of biology   they carry out the instructions written in the genetic code. Their shape plays a crucial role in their function and their ability to interact with other molecules. Scientists study these interactions to develop new insights into protein function and to develop targeted therapies for diseases such as cancer.  The goal of targeted drug design is to create a molecule that interacts specifically with a protein, and this requires a description of protein-drug interactions that is precise down to the placement of each atom,  said Bradley Dickson, Ph.D., a computational biophysicist in the laboratory of Scott Rothbart, Ph.D., at Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) and first author of a paper describing the tool.  The creation of fABMACS is a significant step toward robust virtual drug discovery because it saves time and money. It allows us to better harness the power of existing software while greatly improving our ability to predict the way that a potential drug interacts with a protein.  Scientists often rely on collecting snapshots of proteins to determine how they may interact with a potential drug. However, these images are static and do not depict changes in proteins  shape.  These snapshots provide valuable insight that can be enriched by fABMACS,  said Rothbart, assistant professor at VARI and the study s senior author.  fABMACS allows us to simulate chemical changes to the drug and more quickly predict how those changes impact its interaction with the target protein. Ultimately, this could translate to improved drug potency and efficacy.  To demonstrate the tool s capabilities, the team ran several accelerated computer simulations of the epigenetic regulatory protein BRD4 bound to a drug that is currently in phase I clinical trials for blood cancers. They demonstrated that a slight change to the compound s chemical structure could improve binding to its target protein, thereby improving its effect.

The findings, published in the journal Cancer Research, show regular consumption of dietary emulsifiers in mice exacerbated tumor development. The study was led by Drs. Emilie Viennois, Didier Merlin, Andrew T. Gewirtz and Benoit Chassaing, researchers in Georgia State University s Institute for Biomedical Sciences. Colorectal cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, was responsible for about 700,000 deaths in 2012. There is increasing awareness that the intestinal microbiota, the vast, diverse population of microorganisms that inhabits the human intestines, play a role in driving colorectal cancer. The microbiota is also a key factor in driving Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis, the two most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is known to promote colon tumorigenesis and gave rise to the term  colitis-associated cancer.  Low-grade inflammation, a condition more prevalent than IBD, was shown to be associated with altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic disease and is observed in many cases of colorectal cancer. These recent findings suggest dietary emulsifiers might be partially responsible for this association.  The incidence of colorectal cancer has been markedly increasing since the mid-20th century,  said Viennois, assistant professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences.  A key feature of this disease is the presence of an altered intestinal microbiota that creates a favorable niche for tumorigenesis.   The dramatic increase in these diseases has occurred amidst constant human genetics, suggesting a pivotal role for an environmental factor,  said Chassaing, assistant professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences. Previous reports by the Georgia State research team suggested that low-grade inflammation in the intestine is promoted by consumption of dietary emulsifiers, which are detergent-like molecules incorporated into most processed foods that alter the composition of gut microbiota. The addition of emulsifiers to food seems to fit the time frame and had been shown to promote bacterial translocation across epithelial cells. Viennois and Chassaing hypothesized that emulsifiers might affect the gut microbiota in a way that promotes colorectal cancer. They designed experiments in mice to test this possibility. In this study, the team fed mice with two very commonly used emulsifiers, polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose, at doses seeking to model the broad consumption of the numerous emulsifiers that are incorporated into the majority of processed foods. Researchers observed that consuming emulsifiers drastically changed the species composition of the gut microbiota in a manner that made it more pro-inflammatory, creating a niche favoring cancer induction and development. Alterations in bacterial species resulted in bacteria expressing more flagellin and lipopolysaccharide, which activate pro-inflammatory gene expression by the immune system. When using a well established model of colorectal cancer, the researchers observed that dietary emulsifier consumption was sufficient to make the animals more susceptible to developing colonic tumors because this created and maintained a pro-inflammatory environment associated with an altered proliferation/apoptosis (cell death) balance. The researchers observed that enhanced tumor development was associated with an altered intestinal microbiota, characterized by an increased pro-inflammatory potential. This study demonstrated that emulsifier-induced alterations in the microbiome were necessary and sufficient to drive alterations in intestinal epithelial cells  homeostasis, which is thought to govern tumor development. The effects of consuming emulsifiers were eliminated in mice devoid of microbiota (germ-free mice), and transplanting microbiota from emulsifier-treated mice to germ-free mice was sufficient to transfer alterations in intestinal epithelial cells  homeostasis, suggesting a central role played by the microbiota in tumor development. Overall, these findings support the concept that agitating host-microbiota interactions to cause low-grade gut inflammation can promote colon carcinogenesis. The team is now investigating which microbiota members are triggering this detrimental effect, as well as the mechanism of altered microbiota-induced cancer promotion.

But, made with barley, brews can contain low levels of mycotoxins, which are produced by fungi that can contaminate grains. Although not a major health threat, the industry needs to minimize the risk of contamination. Now scientists have developed a portable sensor that can help. Their report appears in ACS  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Because of its alcohol content and the high temperatures required to make beer, most consumers might assume that contamination by biologically derived compounds is not an issue. But mycotoxins can survive the brewing process and end up in the final product. Some mycotoxins have been shown to cause genetic damage in cells and cancer in animals. Currently, methods to detect mycotoxin contamination in beer are costly and require in-laboratory analysis. Sweccha Joshi, Teris van Beek and colleagues wanted to come up with a less expensive, portable alternative. Building on technology used to detect mycotoxins in grains, the researchers developed a biosensing chip that can bind these compounds when they are present in beer samples. The team also could reuse the chip 450 times before it started to fail. Testing on commercial beer and barley showed that the portable instrument detected levels as low as 0.2 nanograms/milliliter of ochratoxin A and 120 ng/mL of deoxynivalenol   respectively, the estimated safe limits for these mycotoxins.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/two-antibiotics-fight-bacteria-differently-than-thought-212551,Two Antibiotics Fight Bacteria Differently Than Thought Researchers discover that two widely prescribed antibiotics may fight bacteria differently than previously thought  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Two widely prescribed antibiotics   chloramphenicol and linezolid   may fight bacteria in a different way from what scientists and doctors thought for years, University of Illinois at Chicago researchers have found. Instead of indiscriminately stopping protein synthesis, the drugs put the brakes on the protein synthesis machinery only at specific locations in the gene. Ribosomes are among the most complex components in the cell, responsible for churning out all the proteins a cell needs for survival. In bacteria, ribosomes are the target of many important antibiotics. The team of Alexander Mankin and Nora Vazquez-Laslop has conducted groundbreaking research on the ribosome and antibiotics. In their latest study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they found that while chloramphenicol and linezolid attack the catalytic center of the ribosome, they stop protein synthesis only at specific checkpoints.  Many antibiotics interfere with the growth of pathogenic bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis,  says Mankin, director of the UIC Center for Biomolecular Sciences and professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy.  This is done by targeting the catalytic center of the bacterial ribosome, where proteins are being made. It is commonly assumed that these drugs are universal inhibitors of protein synthesis and should readily block the formation of every peptide bond.   But   we have shown that this is not necessarily the case,  said Vazquez-Laslop, research associate professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy. A natural product, chloramphenicol is one of the oldest antibiotics on the market. For decades it has been useful for many bacterial infections, including meningitis, plague, cholera and typhoid fever. Linezolid, a synthetic drug, is a newer antibiotic used to treat serious infections   streptococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), among others   caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Mankin s previous research established the site of action and mechanism of resistance to linezolid. While the antibiotics are very different, they each bind to the ribosome s catalytic center, where they were expected to inhibit formation of any peptide bond that links the components of the protein chain into a long biopolymer. In simple enzymes, an inhibitor that invades the catalytic center simply stops the enzyme from doing its job. This, Mankin said, had been what scientists had believed was also true for antibiotics that target the ribosome.  Contrary to this view, the activity of chloramphenicol and linezolid critically depends on the nature of specific amino acids of the nascent chain carried by the ribosome and by the identity of the next amino acid to be connected to a growing protein,  Vazquez-Laslop said.  These findings indicate that the nascent protein modulates the properties of the ribosomal catalytic center and affects binding of its ligands, including antibiotics.  Combining genomics and biochemistry has allowed the UIC researchers to better understand how the antibiotics work.  If you know how these inhibitors work, you can make better drugs and make them better tools for research,  said Mankin.  You can also use them more efficiently to treat human and animal diseases.

The pre-print comes alongside the announcement of the world s first sequencing-based clinical microbiome test, SmartGut . SmartGut  enables physicians and patients to access a comprehensive microbiome screening test with a simple, at-home sample collection, to identify important commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. The preprint details the simultaneous detection of 28 microbial genera and species associated with gut conditions using next generation sequencing. In addition to advancement in the detection of microorganisms, uBiome s collection method improves the patient experience by allowing for collection of small DNA samples instead of the larger, traditional collection methods used in culture-based methods.  In the article, uBiome demonstrates the power of using a citizen science data set by using the tens of thousands of datapoints from citizen scientists -- all collected under a human subjects  protocol approved by an IRB -- to define a healthy range based on hundreds of healthy individuals. Because many clinically relevant microorganisms associated with disease can be present at some level in healthy individuals, these established ranges allow the new method to clearly identify levels associated with specific conditions and diseases. Dr. Daniel Almonacid, Director of Bioinformatics at uBiome, notes:  One of our team s driving ambitions in developing the new tool was to find ways to accelerate clinical testing while also ensuring rigorous analytic performance characteristics. The new methodology therefore enables microorganisms to be identified automatically by a bioinformatics software, leaving no need for human interpretation or human error.  Dr. Zachary Apte, co-founder and CTO of uBiome, explains:  We developed microbiome reference ranges based on healthy participants selected from the tens of thousands of citizen scientists who have participated in the uBiome research study. This is one of the first full demonstrations of uBiome's model -- empowering citizen scientists to explore their own microbiome and utilize their contributions en masse to develop the next generation of microbiome science and products. As a thank you for everyone s vital contributions to the establishment of these ranges, we will announce new ways for citizen scientists to get involved soon.  Source: Story from uBiome.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease which blights the developing world with 200,000 to 400,000 new cases and an estimated 40,000 deaths annually, making it the second biggest parasitic killer after malaria. The vast majority of cases are seen in seven countries - India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Sudan. There are no vaccines available and current drug treatments all have serious limitations such as prolonged administration (mainly by injection), high cost, drug resistance, toxicity and potential for foetal malformations. The University of Dundee is one of the world s leading centres for research in drug discovery for neglected diseases like leishmaniasis.  Professor Alan Fairlamb, Dr Kevin Read and colleagues at Dundee earlier this year discovered that delamanid   an oral nitro-drug used for the treatment of tuberculosis   shows promise for the treatment of leishmaniasis with potential to provide a much-needed alternative to the current unsatisfactory anti-leishmanial drugs. Now the researchers in the School of Life Sciences at Dundee, working with colleagues at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, have discovered a new protein which may hold the key to developing better, more effective nitro-drugs to tackle the disease. The results of the research are published in the journal PLOS Pathogens. The research has been funded by Wellcome. The protein, NTR2, is a nitroreductase present in leishmania parasites and absent in humans.  NTR2 essentially acts as a trigger converting delamanid and other bicyclic nitro compounds into toxic compounds that specifically damage the parasite.  It can be used in combination with delamanid and related experimental drugs to target the parasite. Recent research by the Fairlamb and Read groups have identified two classes of nitro-drugs (compounds containing a nitro (NO2) group attached to either a single or fused double ring structure) as curative in animal models of VL.  The most advanced of these is the unicyclic drug fexinidazole which is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials in Africa under the auspices of Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi).  A second class of bicyclic nitro-drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis, including the recently approved drug delamanid, were reported as promising fast track options for clinical trials in VL patients.   There has been considerable interest in developing new compounds to target diseases like leishmaniasis, particularly because the existing drugs are very unsatisfactory and increasingly becoming unusable due to resistance in the parasite,  said Professor Alan Fairlamb, Wellcome Principal Research Fellow in the School of Life Sciences at Dundee.  One concern has been that if all nitro-drugs are activated by NTR1, then loss of this protein would lead to widespread drug resistance to both unicyclic drugs (fexinidazole) and bicyclic drugs (delamanid). We have discovered this new protein, NTR2 that specifically activates drugs like delamanid but not fexinidazole.   This knowledge is extremely important in that it allows us to design better drugs activated by NTR2 and to suggest drug combinations that will reduce the risk of emergence of drug resistance through loss of either NTR1 or NTR2 activity. It also provides a potential diagnostic marker for resistance should it arise.   Further work is now needed to find the most appropriate partner drugs to be used to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity in patients, to minimise the risk of drug resistance emerging and in designing second generation drugs.

This is the case in the process of transporting genetic information in cells. How our cells keep errors in this process in check is the subject of a new paper by researchers at the Department of Energy s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). They found that RNA-binding proteins are regulated such that gateway proteins can recognize and block aberrant strands of genetic code from exiting the nucleus. Unused messenger RNA (mRNA) strands that cannot exit the nucleus would eventually disintegrate. Their findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, shed light on a complex system of cell regulation that acts as a form of quality control for the transport of genetic information out of the nucleus. Getting a more complete picture of how genetic information gets expressed in cells is important in disease research, the researchers said.  Some components of this machinery are dysregulated in various types of cancers,  said study principal investigator Mohammad Mofrad, faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab s Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division.  Understanding the molecular mechanism of genetic information transport and quality control would substantially improve the current knowledge about various types of cancers and other human diseases.  Biology textbooks already describe how strands of mRNA copy sections of DNA inside a cell s nucleus and then exit to the cell s cytoplasm. It is in the cytoplasm where the genetic code is used to synthesize proteins, so ensuring that only the correct mRNA strands get used is critical to the formation of properly functioning proteins.  Just like all production lines, the process of genetic information transfer and protein production is quality controlled at different stages,  said Mofrad.  To date, the exact mechanism of this quality control step has remained unclear.  Previous studies have looked at specific steps in this process, but the complex system of sorting out RNA that is ready to leave the nucleus has not been well understood. Mofrad, who is also a professor of bioengineering and of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley, and his Ph.D. student, Mohammad Soheilypour, turned to a computer model to shed light on this process of mRNA export.  With experiments, we can study parts of a system, but there are limitations to their ability to provide the level of spatial and temporal resolution we need to really understand the behavior of a whole system,  said Soheilypour. The researchers focused on the interactions of messenger RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and gateway proteins called  nuclear basket proteins.  For humans and other vertebrates, these nuclear basket proteins are called Tpr, and for yeast they are Mlp1 and Mlp2. The nuclear basket proteins are positioned like guards at the membrane s gateways  the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through which mRNA must pass to leave the nucleus. After validating the computer model with known data from previous studies, the researchers ran simulations to test the factors that influence the transport of mRNA out of the nucleus. They found that a combination of a multitude of protein-protein interactions enables the cell to verify the readiness of mRNA for transport out of the nucleus. RNA-binding proteins are attached to each strand of mRNA, helping to recruit export receptors. Researchers found that regulation of the interaction between RNA-binding proteins and export receptors is the key for nuclear basket proteins to distinguish aberrant mRNAs and retain them inside the nucleus.  Imagine that in order to exit the gate, you need a certain number of validated tickets,  said Soheilypour.  The RNA-binding proteins are like the tickets the mRNA needs to get out, but those tickets need to be validated by the export factors. Without enough validated tickets, the guard proteins do not recognize the mRNA strand as something to let pass through the membrane s gate.  The study also found that longer strands of mRNA have more trouble passing through the nuclear membrane. They theorize that because longer mRNA needs extra time to compact itself while trying to get through the gate, guard proteins have more chances to check for  validated tickets.

Now, scientists have taken early steps toward adding a stinging punch to clinicians  repertoire. A novel targeted therapy using nanoparticles has enabled researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology to purge ovarian tumors in limited, in vivo tests in mice.  The dramatic effect we see is the massive reduction or complete eradication of the tumor, when the  nanohydrogel  treatment is given in combination with existing chemotherapy,  said chief researcher John McDonald. That nanohydrogel is a minute gel pellet that honed in on malignant cells with a payload of an RNA strand. The RNA entered the cell, where it knocked down a protein gone awry that is involved in many forms of cancer. In trials on mice, it put the brakes on ovarian cancer growth and broke down resistance to chemotherapy. That allowed a common chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, to drastically reduce or eliminate large carcinomas, with very similar speed and manner. The successful results treating four mice with the combination of siRNA and cisplatin showed little variance. Chink in the armor The therapeutic short interfering RNA (siRNA) developed by McDonald and Georgia Tech researchers Minati Satpathy and Roman Mezencev, thwarted cancer-causing overproduction of cell structures called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), which extend out of the wall of certain cell types. EGFR overproduction is associated with aggressive cancers. The current in vivo success strengthens the idea that knocking out EGFR at the RNA level may be a worthy goal to explore in the fight against carcinomas in general. The same patented nanohydrogel packed with other types of therapeutic RNA is currently being tested for the treatment of other types cancers. Helper turned killer EGFRs are receptors found in epithelial cells, which line organs throughout the body: Lungs, mouth, throat, intestines and others. In women, it also lines reproductive organs: Ovaries, uterus and cervix.  In many cancers, EGFR is overexpressed,  said McDonald, who heads Georgia Tech's Integrated Cancer Research Center.  The problem is that because of this overexpression, many cellular functions, including cell replication and resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs, are dramatically cranked up.  The cell goes haywire, metabolizes too much sugar, divides too much, and resists chemotherapy. The cancer grows into a tumor and can spread through the body. An overabundance of EGFRs found in a biopsy is usually a sign that cancer patient prognosis is poor.  In 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients, EGFR is overexpressed at very high levels,  McDonald said. Cell suicide: apoptosis EGFR overexpression also makes cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy by thwarting a natural defense mechanism.  The platinum-based chemotherapies used to treat ovarian cancers cause DNA damage, which switches on apoptosis,  McDonald said. Apoptosis is cell suicide. When cells can t repair DNA damage, they re programmed to kill themselves to keep the damaged cells from spreading. The primary chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer works by coaxing cancer cells to trigger the suicide program, but having too many epidermal growth factor receptors gets in the way.  EGFR overexpression hinders apoptosis; they won t die. By knocking down EGFR, we make the cell hypersensitive to the drug. Apoptosis is reactivated,  McDonald said. Existing EGFR targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors disrupt an EGFR function, but their success in treating ovarian cancer has been limited.  Clinicians have tried EGFR inhibitors to treat ovarian cancers for some years, and they only get about 20% of patients responding to it,  McDonald said.  Apparently, the particular EGFR function inhibited by these drugs is not critical to ovarian cancer.  Guided brass knuckles The siRNA designed by the Georgia Tech researchers attacks the cancer much closer to its root. The researchers  siRNA binds to the cell s RNA and stops it transferring its genetic code from DNA.  We re knocking down EGFR at the RNA level,  he said.  Since EGFR is multi-functional, it s not exactly clear which malfunctions contribute to ovarian cancer growth. By completely knocking out its production in ovarian cancer cells, all EGFR functions are blocked.  The nanohydrogel that delivers the siRNA to the cancer cells is a colloid ball of a common, compact organic molecule and about 98 percent water. Another molecule is added to the surface of the nanohydrogel as a guide. It makes the pellets adhere to the cancer cells like sticky cluster bombs. Cancerous tissue may also be aiding the nanohydrogel in targeting it.  When you get into a tumor, there are a lot of blood vessels, and many are broken,  McDonald said.  This may help the nanoparticles get passively trapped in the neighborhood of tumorous tissues.  In the in vivo trials, the siRNA, which contained a fluorescent tag, allowed researchers to observe nanoparticles successfully honing in on the cancer cells. Fortuitous victory  We originally selected to target the EGFR gene because its activity is easily measured, and we wanted to use it simply as an indicator that our nanoparticle siRNA delivery system was working,  McDonald said.  The fact that the EGFR knockdown so dramatically sensitized the cells to standard chemotherapy came as a bit of a surprise.   When we gave the chemotherapy alone, the response was moderate, but with the addition of the nanoparticles, the tumor was either significantly reduced or completely gone,  McDonald said. But he tempered enthusiasm with caution.  Further work will be required to see if the treatment completely destroyed every trace of cancer cells in the tumors that disappeared, or if future recurrence is possible.

Professor Evan brings world-leading expertise in immuno-oncology and cancer stem cell research to support the Group s development of oncology biotherapeutics based on its proprietary Affimer technology. Professor Evan s research focuses on the molecular basis of cancer. He was formerly Gerson and Barbara Bass Baker Distinguished Professor of Cancer Biology at the University of California San Francisco and Co-leader of the Cell Cycling and Signaling Program at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center. In 2009 he was elected to the Sir William Dunn Chair of Biochemistry and Head of Biochemistry in the University of Cambridge. Professor Evan has a BA in Biochemistry from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Molecular Immunology from the University of Cambridge. He was awarded the Pfizer prize in Biology in 1995, and in 1996 was elected as the Royal Society s Napier Professor of Cancer Research. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the European Molecular Biology Organozation. Professor Evan has also held the Neal Levitan Research Chair of the Brain Tumor Society and a Senior Scholarship from the Ellison Medical Research Foundation for Aging. Affimer technology is based on a small protein that can be quickly generated to bind with high specificity and affinity to a wide range of targets to enable diagnostics, research assays and therapeutics. Avacta has created multiple Affimer libraries of around 10 billion individual Affimer molecules each that can be screened to identify those Affimer molecules that bind to a chosen target. Because of their small size and simple structure, Affimer proteins can easily be formatted to deliver the right properties for different therapeutic applications. They can be fused to create multi-specific molecules, modified to carry a toxin, or expressed and remain functional inside cells. Affimer proteins also provide significant advantages over antibodies in terms of manufacturability. Avacta has its own therapeutics development pipeline focusing primarily on immuno-oncology. It has established a research partnership with US biotech Moderna Therapeutics and is actively seeking to leverage further its unique IP position through in-licensing and co-development collaborations and partnerships. Alastair Smith, Avacta Group Chief Executive, commented:   We are delighted that Professor Evan has joined Avacta s therapeutics Scientific Advisory Board. His deep knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of cancer will be a great asset to the Company and in particular his pioneering work in the area of cancer stem cell biology could help create novel and highly valuable Affimer therapies in this emerging area.  Gerard is joining us at an exciting time. We recently announced the important milestone of achieving positive results from the first animal safety and efficacy studies with our lead immuno-oncology candidate, a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. This success, and the continued good progress across all other programmes in the past year, has served to further strengthen our belief that the Affimer technology has huge potential as a therapeutic platform and in other non-therapeutic applications. We continue to focus on developing both our internal and partnered therapeutic programs towards clinical validation and on commercialising Affimer reagents in multiple markets.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-approach-against-salmonella-202317,New Approach Against Salmonella Researchers have developed a strategy to immunize against microbes that invade the gastrointestinal tract  including Salmonella  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The researchers targeted a molecule that Salmonella and other bacteria secrete to scavenge iron, which is essential to many cellular functions. Immunization against this molecule led to the production of antibodies that reduced Salmonella growth, and to much lower levels of the bacteria.  This approach could offer an alternative to antibiotics, which can cause side effects because they also kill beneficial bacteria. Using too many antibiotics can also lead to drug resistance.  We have a huge problem in terms of infectious disease and antibiotic resistance,  says Elizabeth Nolan, an associate professor in MIT s Department of Chemistry.  One aspect we like about our strategy is that it s narrow-spectrum, in contrast to many small-molecule antibiotics that are broad-spectrum and can disrupt the commensal [beneficial] microbiota, which can then have secondary negative consequences for the patient.  Nolan and Manuela Raffatellu, a professor at UC Irvine, are the senior authors of the study, which appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of Nov. 7. The paper s lead authors are Phoom Chairatana, a recent MIT PhD in Chemistry, and Martina Sassone-Corsi, a postdoc at UC Irvine. The team initiated this project in 2011 when Chairatana and Sassone-Corsi were both first-year graduate students. Iron-clad defenses Most bacteria, as well as some fungi, use molecules known as siderophores to obtain iron, a metal that is critical for cellular processes including metabolism and DNA synthesis. Bacteria that live in the intestinal tract secrete siderophores into the gut and then reabsorb them after they have grabbed onto iron. There are hundreds of different types of siderophores, and in this study, the researchers focused on a subset of siderophores that are produced by Salmonella and a few other types of pathogenic bacteria that can live in the gut. The researchers were inspired by the way that some organisms naturally combat microbes by blocking their iron uptake. Humans have a defense protein known as lipocalin 2, which can capture some siderophores and prevent these molecules from carrying iron into bacterial cells. However, lipocalin 2 is not effective against certain types of siderophores, including one type used by Salmonella.  There s no identified human defense mechanism against some of these molecules. That s how we got thinking about how we could boost this metal-withholding response via an immunization,  Nolan says. The siderophore molecules are too small to induce an immune response from a host organism, so the researchers decided to attach it to a protein that does induce an immune response   cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). The siderophore-CTB complex is delivered nasally or injected into the abdomen and makes its way to the lining of the GI tract, where the body begins producing antibodies against both CTB and the siderophore. The researchers gave mice the immunization twice, two weeks apart, and then infected them with Salmonella 36 to 51 days after the first immunization. They found that antibodies against the siderophores peaked around 21 days after the first immunization and then remained at high levels. The immunized mice also had much smaller numbers of Salmonella in their gut and did not experience the weight loss seen in mice that were infected but not immunized. In a paper appearing in the same issue of PNAS, researchers at the University of Michigan used a similar approach to generate an immune response against Escherichia coli that can cause urinary tract infections.  Bacterial benefits The researchers also found that immunization not only reduced the Salmonella population but also led to the expansion of the population of beneficial bacteria known as Lactobacillus   the probiotic bacteria found in yogurt, which help to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbes.  We think that the expansion of Lactobacillus may be conferring additional benefit to the host,  Nolan says. This immunization strategy could be useful to protect people at high risk for certain kinds of infections, such as people who have compromised immune systems or cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, Nolan says. This approach could also be used to generate antibodies to treat people after they become infected with certain pathogens, such as Salmonella. The researchers are now working to isolate and analyze the antibodies that the mice produced in this study, and they are developing immunization strategies against other types of siderophores found in other organisms.

The ZPIV vaccine contains whole Zika virus particles that have been inactivated, meaning that the virus cannot replicate and cause disease in humans. However, the protein shell of the inactivated virus remains intact so it can be recognized by the immune system and evoke an immune response. NIAID partially supported the preclinical development of the ZPIV vaccine candidate, including safety testing and non-human primate studies that found that the vaccine induced antibodies that neutralized the virus and protected the animals from disease when they were challenged with Zika virus. WRAIR, NIAID and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) have established a joint Research Collaboration Agreement to support the development of this vaccine.  We urgently need a safe and effective vaccine to protect people from Zika virus infection as the virus continues to spread and cause serious public health consequences, particularly for pregnant women and their babies,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  We are pleased to be part of the collaborative effort to advance this promising candidate vaccine into clinical trials.  Led by WRAIR principal investigator Maj. Leyi Lin, M.D., the new study aims to enroll 75 people ages 18 to 49 years with no prior flavivirus infection. Flaviviruses include Zika virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. Participants will be randomly divided into three groups: the first group (25 participants) will receive two intramuscular injections of the ZPIV test vaccine or a placebo (saline) 28 days apart; the other two groups (25 participants each) will receive a two-dose regimen of a Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine or one dose of a yellow fever vaccine before beginning the two-dose ZPIV vaccine regimen. Investigators chose to administer additional flavivirus vaccines because U.S. service members are often vaccinated against these diseases before deploying to Zika-endemic areas. Additionally, a subgroup of 30 of the participants who receive the two-dose ZPIV regimen will receive a third dose one year later. All participants in the trial will receive the same ZPIV dose at each injection (5 micrograms). A DoD Research Monitor, an independent physician not associated with the protocol, will monitor the conduct of the trial and report any safety issues to the WRAIR Institutional Review Board. Another independent group, the Safety Monitoring Committee, will also monitor participant safety, review data and report any issues to NIAID. As the regulatory sponsor, NIAID ensures the trial follows the study protocol and informs the FDA of any significant adverse events or risks. NIAID also maintains the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the candidate vaccine. The WRAIR study is expected to be completed by fall 2018. Four additional Phase 1 studies to evaluate the ZPIV investigational vaccine are expected to launch in the coming months. These include   A trial enrolling 90 adults ages 18-49 years at the Center for Vaccine Development at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. This site is an NIAID-funded Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit, and Sarah George, M.D., will serve as principal investigator. All participants will receive either two injections of ZPIV or a placebo 28 days apart. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a high, moderate or low dose at both injections to evaluate the optimal dose for use in larger future studies.   A trial enrolling 90 adults ages 21-49 years at the clinical research center CAIMED, part of Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico. The site is supported by NIAID via a subcontract from the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. This trial will examine the vaccine s safety and immunogenicity in participants who have already been naturally exposed to dengue virus. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a high dose, moderate dose or a placebo. Elizabeth A. Barranco, M.D., will lead the trial.   NIAID s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) will test the ZPIV vaccine candidate as a boost vaccination to its DNA Zika vaccine candidate, which entered Phase 1 clinical trials in August. The next part of the study, which will enroll 60 additional participants ages 18-50 years, will take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine s Institute for Global Health in Baltimore, and Emory University in Atlanta. Half of the participants will receive the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine followed by a ZPIV vaccine boost four or 12 weeks later. The remaining participants will receive only two doses of ZPIV vaccine four or 12 weeks apart. Julie Ledgerwood, D.O., chief of the VRC s clinical trials program, will serve as principal investigator.   A WRAIR-funded trial enrolling 48 adults ages 18-50 years will be conducted at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, part of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston. One group of participants will receive a single dose of the ZPIV vaccine and all other participants will receive two doses of the ZPIV vaccine at varying intervals.

Researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and their collaborators* found smokers accumulated an average of 150 extra mutations in every lung cell for each year of smoking one packet of cigarettes a day. Reported in the Journal Science, the study provides a direct link between the number of cigarettes smoked in a lifetime and the number of mutations in the tumour DNA. The highest mutation rates were seen in the lung cancers but tumours in other parts of the body also contained these smoking-associated mutations, explaining how smoking causes many types of human cancer. Tobacco smoking claims the lives of at least six million people every year and, if current trends continue, the World Health Organization predicts more than 1 billion tobacco-related deaths in this century. Smoking has been epidemiologically associated with at least 17 types of human cancer, but until now no-one has seen the mechanisms by which smoking causes many of these cancer types. Cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA of a cell. In the first comprehensive analysis of the DNA of cancers linked to smoking, researchers studied over 5,000 tumours, comparing cancers from smokers with cancers from people who had never smoked. They found particular molecular fingerprints of DNA damage   called mutational signatures   in the smokers  DNA, and counted how many of these particular mutations were found in the different tumours. The authors found that, on average, smoking a pack of cigarettes a day led to 150 mutations in each lung cell every year. These mutations represent individual potential start points for a cascade of genetic damage that can eventually lead to cancer. The numbers of mutations within any cancer cell will vary between individuals, but this study shows the additional mutational load caused by tobacco. ""Before now, we had a large body of epidemiological evidence linking smoking with cancer, but now we can actually observe and quantify the molecular changes in the DNA due to cigarette smoking. With this study, we have found that people who smoke a pack a day develop an average of 150 extra mutations in their lungs every year, which explains why smokers have such a higher risk of developing lung cancer.  Dr Ludmil Alexandrov, first author from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Other organs were also affected, with the study showing that a pack a day led to an estimated average 97 mutations in each cell in the larynx, 39 mutations for the pharynx, 23 mutations for mouth, 18 mutations for bladder, and 6 mutations in every cell of the liver each year. Until now, it has not been fully understood how smoking increases the risk of developing cancer in parts of the body that don t come into direct contact with smoke. However, the study revealed different mechanisms by which tobacco smoking causes these mutations, depending on the area of the body affected.  The results are a mixture of the expected and unexpected, and reveal a picture of direct and indirect effects. Mutations caused by direct DNA damage from carcinogens in tobacco were seen mainly in organs that come into direct contact with inhaled smoke. In contrast, other cells of the body suffered only indirect damage, as tobacco smoking seems to affect key mechanisms in these cells that in turn mutate DNA. Professor David Phillips, an author on the paper and Professor of Environmental Carcinogenesis at King s College London. The study revealed at least five distinct processes of DNA damage due to cigarette smoking. The most widespread of these is a mutational signature already found in all cancers. In this case, tobacco smoking seems to accelerate the speed of a cellular clock that mutates DNA prematurely.  The genome of every cancer provides a kind of 'archaeological record', written in the DNA code itself, of the exposures that caused the mutations that lead to the cancer. Our research indicates that the way tobacco smoking causes cancer is more complex than we thought. Indeed, we do not fully understand the underlying causes of many types of cancer and there are other known causes, such as obesity, about which we understand little of the underlying mechanism. This study of smoking tells us that looking in the DNA of cancers can provide provocative new clues to how cancers develop and thus, potentially, how they can be prevented.

Diagnosis of a clinically significant concussion, or a mild traumatic brain injury, can be difficult as it currently relies on a combination of patient symptom assessment and clinician judgement. Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury. See Also: Researchers identify concussion treatment for persistent cases in children In the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University. In the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred. ""This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,"" says Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. ""We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion."" Related: Athletes may have white matter brain changes 6 months after a concussionThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients. In this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites. ""We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,"" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. ""There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20 to 40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 percent."" Concussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction. ""The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,"" says Dr. Fraser. ""With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.""

In a study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, the researchers showed that normal patterns of appetite stimulation in the brain are effectively reversed in those with eating disorders. See Also: Genetic risk factor for binge eating discoveredRather than the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite, driving motivation to eat, signals from other parts of the brain can override the hypothalamus in eating disorders. ""In the clinical world we call this `mind over matter,''' said Guido Frank, MD, lead author of the study and associate professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""Now we have physiological evidence to back up that idea."" Frank, an expert on eating disorders, set out to discover the hierarchies of the brain that govern appetite and food intake. He wanted to understand the neurological reasons behind why some people eat when they were hungry and others don't. Using brain scans, the researchers examined how 26 healthy women and 26 women with anorexia or bulimia nervosa reacted to tasting a sugary solution. Related: In anorexia nervosa, brain responds differently to hunger signals They discovered that those with eating disorders had widespread alterations in the structure of brain pathways governing taste-reward and appetite regulation. The alterations were found in the white matter, which coordinates communication between different parts of the brain. There were also major differences in the role the hypothalamus played in each group. Among those without an eating disorder, brain regions that drive eating took their cues from the hypothalamus. In the groups with an eating disorder, the pathways to the hypothalamus were significantly weaker and the direction of information went in the opposite direction. As a result, their brain may be able to override the hypothalamus and fend off the signals to eat. ""The appetite region of the brain should drive you off your chair to get something to eat,"" said Frank. ""But in patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa that is not the case."" According to the study, humans are programmed at birth to like sweet tastes. But those with eating disorders begin to avoid eating sweets for fear of gaining weight. ""One could see such avoidance as a form of learned behavior and more specifically operant conditioning, with weight gain as the feared `punishment,''' the study said. This behavior could eventually alter the brain circuits governing appetite and food intake. Researchers now suggest that being afraid to eat certain foods could impact the taste-reward processing mechanisms in the brain which could then reduce the influence of the hypothalamus.

Their findings, published in The Journal of Experimental Medicine, could benefit clinical trials that test new treatments for the disease. See Also: Test developed to measure effectiveness of treatments for Huntington s disease In HD, an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence in the gene encoding huntingtin protein results in the production of a mutant form of huntingtin that can aggregate and damage cells, particularly neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Patients display a progressive loss of voluntary and involuntary movements, as well as psychiatric and cognitive disturbances, and usually die 10 to 15 years after its onset. Though genetic testing can identify HD patients long before their first symptoms appear in middle age, there are still no pharmacological treatments that can prevent or ameliorate the disease. A few drugs have shown promise in cell culture or animal models, but clinical trials in humans are time consuming because of the slow onset and progression of the disorder's clinical symptoms. Moreover, researchers are unable to take biopsies of the brain to assess the effects of potential therapeutic compounds. Learn More: New evidence: How amino acid cysteine combats Huntington's diseaseOne of the earliest events in HD is that mutant huntingtin aggregates disrupt the function of mitochondria, lowering cellular energy levels and causing oxidative damage. Daria Mochly-Rosen and her team at Stanford have previously identified a molecule, P110, that can restore mitochondrial function and prevent neuronal death in mouse models of HD (*). Now the researchers set out to identify markers of HD in non-neural tissues that could be used to track the progression of the disease and its response to P110 or other candidate drugs. The team found that the levels of mitochondrial DNA, presumably released from dying neurons, were increased in the blood plasma of mice that were starting to develop the symptoms of HD. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA levels decreased at later stages of the disease. P110 treatment corrected plasma mitochondrial DNA back to the levels seen in healthy mice. Mochly-Rosen and colleagues identified several other potential biomarkers that were elevated in HD model mice, including the levels of 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine, a product of oxidative DNA damage, in the urine and the presence of mutant huntingtin aggregates and oxidative damage in muscle and skin cells. The levels of each of these biomarkers were reduced by P110 treatment. Read Next: Healthy tissue grafted to the brains of Huntington s patients also develops signs of the disease It remains to be seen whether all of these biomarkers are reliable indicators of HD in humans. The Stanford team found, however, that mitochondrial DNA levels were significantly elevated in plasma samples from a small number of HD patients. ""We have identified several biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and treatment in mice,"" says Mochly-Rosen. ""We hope that our work will provide the basis for a larger study of patient samples that may ultimately identify biomarkers that can be used as surrogate markers to determine the benefit of therapeutic interventions in diagnosed but asymptomatic HD patients to prevent or delay disease onset.""

Had this discovery been known before the deadly 2011 E. coli outbreak in Germany, doctors may have had one more tool to save some of the victims. The findings, featured in the current issue of the journal Biofouling, show that polysorbates attack the protective biofilm in which E. coli lives and renders the deadly bacteria harmless, said Chris Waters, Michigan State University associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics whose laboratory led the research.  Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria that are usually encased in a protective slime,  he said.  We found that polysorbate 80 obliterates the biofilm and takes away the E. coli s ability to damage the host during infection. We think this is due to blocking the ability of E. coli to produce toxin.  Specifically, the team focused on the potent strain isolated from Germany that swept through Europe in 2011, causing thousands of infections and more than 50 deaths. This strain had been previously studied by Waters and Shannon Manning. Having samples of the bacteria at MSU helped the team, led by Rudolph Sloup, MSU microbiology and molecular genetics graduate student, isolate compounds that inhibited biofilms. However, the results didn t come easily. Waters and his team scoured scientific literature to identify anti-biofilm compounds, but none of them inhibited biofilms of this E. coli strain. Finally, the team found that the 20th compound tested, polysorbate 80, obliterated E. coli s ability to form biofilms in the lab. The next step was to determine if the compound was effective in an animal model of the disease by administering polysorbate 80 to infected mice in their drinking water.  During our animal infection studies, polysorbate 80 had no effect on the numbers of infecting E. coli. This was a little shocking, especially based on how promising our earlier tests had been,  Waters said.  Later, though, our pathology tests showed that polysorbate 80 essentially blocked all toxicity, even though it didn t reduce the number of bacteria.  The later confirmation of the successful in vivo experiment using mice models essentially showed that polysorbate 80 strips E. coli of its ability to cause disease allowing the bacteria to pass through the body s intestinal tract without causing damage. So instead of killing the E. coli like traditional antibiotics, a strategy that works until the E. coli develops resistance to the treatment, this finding suggests an anti-virulence strategy can be quite effective.  Antibiotic use can often cause more harm than good with these types of E. coli infections because it causes the bacteria to release more toxin and it drives antimicrobial resistance,  Waters said.  Our results indicate that polysorbate 80 makes this strain of E. coli harmless, without these negative side effects. This approach also doesn t disrupt patients  natural microbiome leading to a healthier gut.  Since polysorbate 80 is categorized as a GRAS (generally regarded as safe) compound, it doesn t require FDA approval to be used as a treatment. Along with its potential for disarming the deadly German E. coli outbreak, polysorbate 80 could potentially help tackle more-common E. coli infections such as traveler s diarrhea. The next steps for this research will be to identify how polysorbate 80 inhibits biofilm formation and test its activity in other infection models. Source:  Story from Michigan State University.

Results of the human study were recently published online in Oncotarget. ""Our new finding is a step forward in overcoming tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, a clinically significant problem in the management of GIST,"" said Jason Sicklick, MD, associate professor of surgery at UC San Diego School of Medicine and surgical oncologist at Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health. ""By knowing that Hedgehog signaling is altered in human GIST, and that it controls KIT expression, we may have found a way to turn the cancer off."" GISTs eventually become highly resistant to current drug therapies. Clinicians fight the growth with progressively aggressive drugs, the downside being that each later line of therapy has diminishing effectiveness and higher toxicity for patients. More than 95 percent of patients eventually succumb to drug-resistant GIST, necessitating the search for alternative therapeutic targets. ""We may have found this cancer's 'on' switch,"" said Sicklick. ""We are flipping the switch 'off' with arsenic, a drug that is already in clinical practice. With this drug, we are able to kill multidrug-resistant cell lines, offering a new approach to treatment."" GIST is the most common sarcoma with an estimated annual incidence of 6.8 cases per million people in the United States. These tumors start in special cells found in the wall of the GI tract, called the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). ICCs are sometimes called the ""pacemakers"" of the GI tract because they signal the muscles in the digestive system to contract to move food and liquid through the GI tract.

By binding to insulin receptors on cells, Gal3 prevents insulin from attaching to the receptors resulting in cellular insulin resistance. The team led by Jerrold Olefsky, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at UC San Diego School of Medicine, showed that by genetically removing Gal3 or using pharmaceutical inhibitors to target it, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance could be returned to normal, even among older mice. However, obesity remained unchanged.    This study puts Gal3 on the map for insulin resistance and diabetes in mouse model,  said Olefsky, associate dean for scientific affairs and senior author of the study.  Our findings suggest that Gal3 inhibition in people could be an effective anti-diabetic approach.  Olefsky and other researchers have been studying how chronic tissue inflammation leads to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In the paper, published in the journal Cell on November 3, researchers explain that inflammation requires macrophages   specialized cells that destroy targeted cells. In obese adipose tissue (fat), for example, 40 percent of cells are macrophages. Macrophages in turn secrete Gal3, which then acts as a signaling protein attracting more macrophages, thus resulting in the production of even more Gal3. Furthermore, investigators identified bone marrow-derived macrophages as the source of Gal3 that leads to insulin resistance. More importantly, researchers found that Gal3 is secreted by macrophages, and can then cause insulin resistance in liver, fat cells, and muscle cells independent of inflammation.

But University of California, Irvine microbiologists have demonstrated a new approach that may lead to more effective remedies. In the journal Nature, Manuela Raffatellu, associate professor of microbiology & molecular genetics, and colleagues provide the first evidence that small protein molecules called microcins, produced by beneficial gut microbes, play a critical part in blocking certain illness-causing bacteria in inflamed intestines. In their study, the researchers show that a probiotic strain of E. coli called Nissle 1917 utilizes microcins to inhibit the pathogen salmonella and an invasive form of E. coli (isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease).  Although an in vivo role for microcins has been suggested for 40 years, it has never been convincingly demonstrated,  said Raffatellu, who s affiliated with UCI s Institute for Immunology.  We hypothesize that their role was missed because, as our data indicate, microcins do not seem effective in noninflamed intestines. In contrast, we show that in an inflamed intestine, microcins help a probiotic strain limit the growth of some harmful bacteria.  She added that microcins are essential for the therapeutic activity of E. coli Nissle, and her next step is to purify microcins and test whether they can be given as targeted antibiotics.

The sCAV2 virus, measuring over 34,000 base pairs in length, is the longest functional virus synthesized by scientists for oncology research. The sCAV2 virus is a conditionally replicative adenovirus (CRAd), or a class of oncolytic viruses, that selectively targets and destroys tumor cells, avoiding healthy cells in the process. A team of clinicians and scientists led by Dr. Bruce Smith at Auburn University s College of Veterinary Medicine will use the synthetic virus in clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic treatments in dogs with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer with a survival rate of less than 10%.   Our concept is taking personalized medicine to precision medicine. The technology to create a new virus by synthesizing it is a huge leap, but the ability to then make a customized virus tailored to the specific needs of each patient will be transformative,  said Bruce F. Smith, V.M.D, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Pathobiology and Director of the Auburn University Research Initiative in Cancer (AURIC).  This could change the way we fight cancer. It is that revolutionary.  Gen9 s BioFab  DNA synthesis platform was utilized in the synthesis of the sCAV2 oncolytic virus. By leveraging the technology s ability to manufacture hundreds of megabases of high-quality long-length synthetic DNA, the timeframe for development was reduced from months to weeks, enabling Dr. Smith and his team to drastically accelerate their research. Using a synthetic approach also opens the possibility of the rapid creation of therapeutic viruses tailored to specific patients  needs.   The construction of this viral genome is a tremendous step for DNA synthesis and its application to therapeutics research,  said Dr. Devin Leake, Vice President of Research and Development at Gen9.  Our partnership with Autodesk and Auburn sums up what fundamentally excites us the most about the field of synthetic biology and what we do here at Gen9 collaborating with world-class scientists on the groundbreaking research that is shaping the future.   At Autodesk, we ve been prototyping the  3D printing  of medicines for several years,  said Andrew Hessel, distinguished research scientist in the Autodesk BioNano Research Group, and the catalyst behind the project.  This work demonstrates that personalized, made-on-demand therapies are within reach, and our efforts in combatting cancer in dogs could lead the way in next-generation care.  Source: Story from Gen9.

TYG100 is among a range of new treatments that use a patient s own immune system to target hormones that encourage the growth and spread of solid tumours. It works by triggering the production of antibodies that specifically target two members of the gastrin hormone family that help to fuel tumour growth. Under the agreement, Cancer Research UK and TYG will share the cost of the process development and production of TYG100 for the clinic. Cancer Research UK s Centre for Drug Development (CDD) will then sponsor and manage a Phase I clinical trial of TYG100 in cancer patients with advanced solid tumours, mainly to evaluate drug safety and toxicity. It will take place across the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres (ECMC) network, a nationwide initiative funded by Cancer Research UK and the UK s four Health Departments. The collaboration forms part of Cancer Research UK s Clinical Development Partnership (CPD) scheme, meaning that at the end of the trial, TYG oncology has the option of either retaining rights to the new treatment or transferring them to Cancer Research UK to continue development through a new partner. Fred Jacobs, president of TYG oncology, said:  We are very pleased to be working in partnership with the clinical experience and expertise from Cancer Research UK to advance TYG100. Cancer Research UK s sponsorship of the Phase I clinical trial is a significant technical and financial validation of our novel therapeutic vaccine. TYG100 will be attacking some of the most difficult and deadliest solid tumours, including pancreatic and gastro-oesophageal cancers.  Dr Nigel Blackburn, Cancer Research UK s director of drug development, said:  We hope that next generation cancer vaccines like this one will build on the widespread success of existing hormonal treatments   such as those targeting oestrogen in breast cancer and testosterone in prostate cancer. It s a very promising area of research and we re excited to be working with TYG oncology to take this to the next stage.   Our Clinical Development Partnerships are a novel approach that allows companies to benefit from Cancer Research UK s extensive drug development resources in a way that is mutually beneficial and that ultimately helps new treatments reach patients more quickly.

While watching these fish repair their own spinal cord injuries, Duke University scientists have found a particular protein important for the process. Their study, published Nov. 4 in the journal Science, could generate new leads into tissue repair in humans.  This is one of nature s most remarkable feats of regeneration,  said the study s senior investigator Kenneth Poss, professor of cell biology and director of the Regeneration Next initiative at Duke.  Given the limited number of successful therapies available today for repairing lost tissues, we need to look to animals like zebrafish for new clues about how to stimulate regeneration.  When the zebrafish s severed spinal cord undergoes regeneration, a bridge forms, literally. The first cells extend projections into a distance tens of times their own length and connect across a wide gulf of the injury. Nerve cells follow. By 8 weeks, new nerve tissue has filled the gap and the animals have fully reversed their severe paralysis. To understand what molecules were potentially responsible for this remarkable process, the scientists conducted a molecular fishing expedition of sorts, searching for all of the genes whose activity abruptly changed after spinal cord injury. Of dozens of genes strongly activated by injury, seven coded for proteins that are secreted from cells. One of these, called CTGF or connective tissue growth factor, was intriguing because its levels rose in the supporting cells, or glia, that formed the bridge in the first two weeks following injury.  We were surprised that it was expressed in only a fraction of glial cells after the injury. We thought that these glial cells and this gene must be important,  said lead author Mayssa Mokalled, a postdoctoral fellow in Poss s group. Indeed, when they tried deleting CTGF genetically, those fish failed to regenerate. Humans and zebrafish share most protein-coding genes, and CTGF is no exception. The human CTGF protein is nearly 90% similar in its amino acid building blocks to the zebrafish form. When the team added the human version of CTGF to the injury site in fish, it boosted regeneration and the fish swam better by two weeks after the injury.  The fish go from paralyzed to swimming in the tank. The effect of the protein is striking,  Mokalled said. CTGF is a large protein, made of four smaller parts, and it has more than one function. But the second half of the CTGF protein seems to be the key to the healing, the group found. That might make it easier to deliver and more specific as a therapy for spinal injuries. Poss said that unfortunately, CTGF is probably not sufficient on its own for people to regenerate their own spinal cords. Healing is more complex in mammals, in part because scar tissue forms around the injury. Poss s group expects studies of CTGF to move into mammals like mice.  Mouse experiments could be key,  Mokalled said.  When do they express CTGF, and in what cell types?  These experiments may reveal some answers to why zebrafish can regenerate whereas mammals cannot. It may be a matter of how the protein is controlled rather than its make-up, Poss said. The group also plans to follow up on other proteins secreted after injury that were identified in their initial search, which may provide additional hints into the zebrafish s secrets of regeneration.  I don t think CTGF is the complete answer, but it s a great thing to have in hand to inform new ways to think about the real challenge of trying to improve regeneration,  Poss said.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-markers-predict-malaria-treatment-failure-195784,Genetic Markers Predict Malaria Treatment Failure By comparing     parasite genomes to a reference malaria parasite genome  researchers have identified two genetic markers that are strongly associated with the parasites  ability to resist piperaquine  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A frontline malaria treatment that combines fast-acting dihydroartemisinin with long-lasting piperaquine is quickly losing power in Cambodia due to the rapid spread of drug-resistant parasites. The presence of piperaquine-resistant malaria parasites in several Cambodian provinces was confirmed earlier this year by National Institutes of Health researchers and their colleagues. Now, by comparing the complete genomes of 297 parasites isolated from Cambodian malaria patients to a reference malaria parasite genome, the team has identified two genetic markers that are strongly associated with the parasites  ability to resist piperaquine. A simple test, performed after collecting blood from a finger pinprick, can show whether a malaria patient has parasites with the genetic markers. If so, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine therapy is likely to fail, say the study authors, and an alternative drug combination (artesunate-mefloquine) should be used. Information about the distribution of these drug resistance markers is being used by officials in Cambodia and neighboring countries to map the extent and spread of piperaquine resistance and to help guide region-wide malaria treatment approaches. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) scientist Rick Fairhurst, M.D., Ph.D., and Roberto Amato, Ph.D., of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI), Cambridge, UK, led the research team. The first marker they identified is a change of one subunit in a gene on the parasite s chromosome 13. Parasites with this genetic change are much more likely to be resistant to piperaquine than parasites without it. The marker, while associated with drug resistance, likely does not play a functional role in enabling parasites to resist piperaquine, according to the researchers.  In contrast, the second resistance marker identified by the investigators may have such a role. That marker is an increased number of copies of two genes (plasmepsin II and plasmepsin III) in those parasites that resist piperaquine. Malaria parasites use plasmepsins to help them digest human blood and, although the exact mechanism of action of piperaquine is not known, it is believed that the drug targets plasmepsins. Parasites may react to piperaquine by increasing plasmepsin production, and any parasites with extra copies of the plasmepsin II and III genes may be better able to withstand piperaquine treatment. Of note, parasites with increased piperaquine resistance appear to have increased susceptibility to the malaria drug mefloquine. This observation hints at the possibility of devising malaria treatment regimens that combine three or more drugs to exploit opposing resistance-susceptibility attributes.

The report is being published online in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.  A person with HIV who consistently takes anti-HIV medicines but smokes is much more likely to die of a smoking-related disease than of HIV,  says Krishna Reddy, MD, of the MGH Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and the Medical Practice Evaluation Center, who led the study.  The good news is that quitting smoking can greatly increase lifespan, and it is never too late to quit.  While only 15 percent of the general U.S. adult population smokes cigarettes, among people living with HIV the smoking rate is over 40 percent, and an additional 20 percent are former smokers. The widespread use of antiviral medications today allows people with HIV to live longer, but smokers with HIV are developing smoking-related diseases   such as lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, sometimes referred to as emphysema)   at higher rates than are HIV-uninfected individuals.  The researchers used epidemiologic data to estimate the average lifespans of people living with HIV depending on whether they were current, former or never smokers. Extending a validated simulation model of HIV developed by the team, they demonstrated that a person with HIV could lose more than 8 years of life simply because of his or her smoking habits and unrelated to HIV infection. They also found that, if one-quarter of the people receiving care for HIV in the U.S. who smoke were to quit now, more than a quarter million years of life would be saved. The study found that for a 40-year-old person who receives care for HIV but   as is often the case in the U.S.   does not perfectly follow recommended treatment, smoking shortens his or her expected lifespan by more than 6 years, compared with a nonsmoker who is similarly not perfectly adherent to antiviral treatment. For someone who adheres well to anti-HIV medicines, smoking shortens his or her expected lifespan by more than 8 years   about double the impact of HIV itself   compared with a nonsmoker who perfectly adheres to treatment. For those who are smokers when they enter treatment for HIV, quitting smoking, particularly at younger ages, was shown to reverse much of the loss of life expectancy.  Smoking cessation should be a key part of the care of people living with HIV to improve both their lifespan and their quality of life,  says study co-author Travis Baggett, MD, MPH, of the MGH Division of General Internal Medicine and the Tobacco Research and Treatment Center. Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH of the MGH Division of Infectious Diseases, senior author of the study, says,  It is time to recognize that smoking is now the primary killer of people with HIV who are receiving treatment.  Reddy adds,  Unfortunately, smoking cessation interventions have not been widely incorporated into HIV care. Given how common smoking is among people with HIV, now is the time to change that.

The study is one of three related papers published in the Nov. 3rd issue of Cell, the other two looking at genetic and environmental influences, as part of the Human Functional Genomics Project (HFGP).    The underlying premise of the HFGP is that the immune system is a perfect target for studying human variation and the intersection of genes and the environment,  says Ramnik Xavier, MD, PhD, chief of the MGH Gastrointestinal Unit, an institute member at the Broad and a principal investigator of the HFGP.  We know that some people are more susceptible to infections than others; some develop autoimmune diseases while most don t. In these studies, we wanted to see how genes affect the immune system, how environmental factors affect susceptibility and in this investigation, whether and how the gut microbiome influences the immune system s response to various pathogens.  The microbiome study   led by Xavier and Mihai Netea, MD, PhD, of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands   analyzed blood and stool samples from 500 healthy Western European HFGP participants to look for individual variations in immune responses to pathogens, represented by production of molecules called cytokines; variations in the gut microbiome, and how those two factors relate to each other.   Immune cells from individual participants were exposed to three bacterial stimulants   the commensal microbe B. fragilis, the common pathogen S. aureus, and a toxin produced by E. coli   and two forms of the Candida fungus.  Their response was reflected in the production of cytokines, proteins through which immune cells exert many of their effects.  Looking at possible relationships between immune responses and the microbiome in individual participants, the investigators found clear patterns by which both the population of the microbiome and its function, reflected in the production of proteins called metabolites, interact with the immune response. Some of those interactions depended on the pathogen, some on the cytokines, and some on both.  Among the team s observations was how, depending on the specific pathogenic stimulus, breakdown of the amino acid tryptophan into the metabolite tryptophol can inhibit production of the cytokine TNF-alpha.  They also identified an effect of palmitoleic acid   a fatty acid found in several dietary oils and known to suppress some immune activities   on production of the cytokine gamma interferon, although the precise mechanism is yet to be discovered.  The Isselbacher Professor of Medicine in Gastroenterology at Harvard Medical School and a member of the MGH Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Xavier says,  We still don t have all the components, but the overall picture suggests that variations in the gut microbiome change production of the metabolites that go on to educate or influence immune cells, leading to differential outcomes when immune cells are exposed to various infections.   The accompanying studies, on which he is a co-author, found similar influences on immune response by environmental factors   including the season of the year as well as participants  age and gender   and most powerfully, by genetic differences.  Among the next steps, Xavier notes, will be conducting similar studies in individuals with specific diseases and in participants from other parts of the world.  By understanding how all of these complex mechanisms   genetics, microbiome and environment   drive variations in the immune response, we may be able to identify factors responsible for individual patients  susceptibilities and better target therapies,  he says.

Now, a team of researchers led by neurologists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) has pinpointed the regions of the brain that may play a role maintaining it. Their findings, which have garnered multiple awards from the American Academy of Neurology, are published in that society's journal, Neurology. See Also: How the brain produces consciousness in 'time slices'""For the first time, we have found a connection between the brainstem region involved in arousal and regions involved in awareness, two prerequisites for consciousness,"" said Michael D. Fox, MD, PhD, Director of the Laboratory for Brain Network Imaging and Modulation and the Associate Director of the Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation at BIDMC. ""A lot of pieces of evidence all came together to point to this network playing a role in human consciousness."" Classical neurology holds that arousal and awareness are two critical components of consciousness. Arousal is likely regulated by the brainstem the portion of the brain, contiguous with the spinal cord, that is responsible for the sleep/wake cycle and cardiac and respiratory rates. Awareness, another critical component of consciousness, has long been thought to reside somewhere in the cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for many of its higher functions. The researchers analyzed 36 patients with brainstem lesions, of which 12 led to coma and 24 did not. Mapping the injuries revealed that a small ""coma-specific"" area of the brainstem the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum was significantly associated with coma. Ten out of the 12 coma-inducing brainstem lesions involved this area, while just one of the 24 control lesions did. Learn More: Functional brain imaging reliably predicts which vegetative patients have potential to recover consciousness Armed with that information, Fox and colleagues, including lead author David Fischer, MD, then a medical student at Harvard Medical School, used a wiring diagram of the healthy human brain based on a large, shared data set called the Human Connectome to identify which other parts of the brain were connected to these coma-causing lesions. Their analysis revealed two areas in the cortex of the brain that were significantly connected to the coma-specific region of the brainstem. One sat in the left, ventral, anterior insula (AI), the other in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). Both regions have been implicated previously in arousal and awareness. ""We now have a great map of how the brain is wired up in the Human Connectome,"" said Fox, who is also an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""We can look at not just the location of lesions, but also their connectivity. Over the past year, researchers in my lab have used this approach to understand visual and auditory hallucinations, impaired speech, and movement disorders. A collaborative team of neuroscientists and physicians had the insight and unique expertise needed to apply this approach to consciousness."" Related: Brain scans may help predict recovery from coma The team included co-lead author, Aaron Boes, MD, PhD, and co-senior author, Joel Geerling, MD, PhD, both formerly of BIDMC and now of University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. Finally, the team investigated whether this brainstem-cortex network was functioning in another subset of patients with disorders of consciousness, including coma. Using a special type of MRI scan, the scientists found that their newly identified ""consciousness network"" was disrupted in patients with impaired consciousness. The findings bolstered by data from rodent studies suggest the network between the brainstem and these two cortical regions plays a role maintaining human consciousness. ""The added value of thinking about coma as a network disorder is it presents possible targets for therapy, such as using brain stimulation to augment recovery,"" Boes said. A next step, Fox notes, may be to investigate other data sets in which patients lost consciousness to find out if the same, different or overlapping neural networks are involved. Read Next: To recover consciousness, brain activity passes through newly detected states ""This is most relevant if we can use these networks as a target for brain stimulation for people with disorders of consciousness,"" said Fox.

See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression The tragic case of Auguste Deter might have vanished into the recesses of medical history, but for the following fact. Her doctor, Alois Alzheimer, made a thorough examination of her medical condition, including her excised brain, discovering the telltale amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of her illness. Auguste Deter was the first person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Today, society faces an epidemic of Alzheimer's, with some 5 million afflicted in the U.S. alone. The number is projected to swell to 14 million by midcentury, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the top ten leading fatal illnesses, Alzheimer's remains the only one that cannot be prevented, treated or cured. In new research appearing in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia, Diego Mastroeni, Paul Coleman and their colleagues at the Arizona State University- (ASU-) Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center (NDRC) and the Biodesign Center for Bioenergetics investigate the role of mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Mitochondria act as energy centers for cells and are of central importance in health and disease. The study builds on earlier work suggesting gene mutations affecting mitochondrial function may be critical in the development and pitiless progression of the disease. Learn More: Research discovers neuroprotective protein in blood is biomarker of Alzheimer's disease ""Age-related neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, progress over a long period of time before they become clinically apparent. The earliest physiological and molecular events are largely unknown,"" says Mastroeni. ""Findings from our laboratory have uncovered early expression changes in nuclear encoded, but not mitochondrial encoded mRNAs occurring in one's early thirties; giving us a glimpse into what we suspect are some of the earliest cellular changes in the progression of Alzheimer's disease."" Results of the new study show that specific classes of genes associated with mitochondrial cell respiration display reduced expression levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease, compared with normal patients. The study also examines gene expression in subjects whose brains show an intermediate level of illness known as mild cognitive impairment. Here, the opposite effect is observed, with relevant genes exhibiting increased levels of expression. The authors suggest this observation may point to some kind of compensatory mechanism in the brain attempting to stave off the disease in its earlier stages. Further, the study proposes that restoring a specific set of damaged genes linked to mitochondrial function and located in the nuclear DNA of cells may offer a promising strategy for halting the disease's advance. Alzheimer's the most common form of dementia is a progressive, degenerative disease of the brain. While commonly associated with elderly individuals, this devastating illness is now believed to have its origins much earlier, infiltrating the nervous system decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Indeed, the greatest obstacle to successful treatment of Alzheimer's is the fact that the disease is typically not recognized until its progress has irreparably ravaged the brain. Despite the increasingly pronounced effects of dementia, a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease usually requires the post-mortem examination of brain tissue and identification of two stereotypic symptoms, known as plaques and tangles. More recently, new imaging technology has enabled researchers to detect these symptoms in living brains, though Coleman is cautious about their interpretation: ""Although plaques and tangles remain as the definitive neuropathological hallmark of the disease, plaques do not correlate at all with degree of cognitive impairment in AD and tangles correlate only slightly,"" he says. ""We further know that plaques and tangles are late comers in the cascade of events that cause the dementia of AD."" Related: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein Mitochondria membrane-bound organelles found in all eukaryotic organisms are often called the powerhouses of the cell. Through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation, they produce most of the cell's chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate or ATP. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in cell signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as in cellular growth and the maintenance of the cell cycle. Because mitochondria play such an important role in the cell, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a broad range of illness, including cardiovascular disease, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, stroke, Lou Gehrig's, and diabetes along with forms of dementia including Alzheimer's. Unsurprisingly, defects in mitochondrial function more severely affect energy hungry organ systems in the body, particularly muscles, the GI tract and the brain an organ making up just 2 percent of a person's weight while consuming 20 percent of the body's total energy budget. Mitochondria are unique among the cell's organelles, as they possess their own DNA, distinct from the DNA contained within the cell's nucleus. This strange state of affairs is due to mitochondrial evolution. Mitochondria are descended from free-living bacteria that colonized other cells some 2 billion years ago. After being incorporated into nucleated cells, these endosymbionts, as they are known, lost much of their original machinery, yet retained their own complement of DNA. In addition to the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the gradual degradation of mitochondrial integrity is believed to play a central role in the normal process of aging. The current study examines tissue from the hippocampus, a structure critical for memory and one severely impacted by the advance of Alzheimer's. Using microarray technology, the authors examined hippocampal tissue from an aging cohort-44 normal brains from 29 to 99 years of age, 10 with mild cognitive impairment and 18 with Alzheimer's disease. Gene expression was examined for two sets of genes, one encoding mitochondrial DNA and the other, in the nuclear DNA. The two sets of genes both coded for proteins associated with a mitochondrial complex essential for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), producing energy in the form of ATP for the cell. Intriguingly, while the mitochondrial genes themselves were largely unaffected, the nuclear genes associated with the OXPHOS complex underwent significant modification, depending on the tissues examined. The microarray data revealed substantial down-regulation of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes in Alzheimer's tissue, a finding also found in normally aging brains. Read Next: Why do people with Alzheimer's stop recognizing their loved ones? The same genes, however, were up-regulated in the case of mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. The authors suggest this effect may be due to a compensatory mechanism in the brain in response to early pathology. The findings are consistent with earlier work establishing that accumulations of amyloid beta (A ) in neurons, a hallmark of Alzheimer's, are directly implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction. The pronounced effect on nuclear-encoded but not mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes may point to dysfunctions in the transport of molecules from the cell nucleus to the mitochondria. ""Our work on mitochondria offers the promise of a reliable marker appearing earlier in the course of the disease one which more closely correlates with the degree of dementia than the current diagnostic of plaques and tangles,"" Coleman says. Precise mechanisms of mitochondrial decline in aging and Alzheimer's have yet to be teased out and will be the focus of continuing research. The study suggests that therapies aimed at restoring function in nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes may provide an exciting new avenue for treatment of Alzheimer's.

Reinforcement of addictive substance use and stress signaling involves common neural systems, including the brain reward center. Better understanding the brain chemistry involved in stress and increased alcohol consumption could have implications for getting to the root of such disorders as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). See Also: Rat study: Alcohol exposure during adolescence leads to chronic stress vulnerabilityA team led by John Dani, PhD, chair of the department of Neuroscience in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, found that rodents that had been exposed to stress had a weakened alcohol-induced dopamine response and voluntarily drank more alcohol compared to controls. The blunted dopamine signaling to ethanol arose due to changes in the circuitry in the ventral tegmental area, the heart of the brain's reward system. The team published their findings in Neuron. Stress alters the intricate system of checks and balances in the firing and quiescence of many types of neurons. ""These effects happen at the minute level of potassium, chloride, and other ions moving across the neuron outer membrane via channels and transporters,"" Dani said. ""In addition, by chemically blocking stress hormone receptors on neurons, we prevented stress from causing increased drinking behavior."" Rats were exposed to an acute stress for one hour, and then 15 hours later, researchers measured the amount of sugar water laced with ethanol that the mice drank. The stressed rats drank significantly more than controls, and the increase was maintained for several weeks. Learn More: Drink-seeking rats provide sobering look into genetics of alcoholismWhy does stress cause a latent effect on neural circuitry? ""The stress response evolved to protect us, but addictive drugs use those mechanisms and trick our brains to keep us coming back for more,"" Dani said. The most interesting finding, the researchers say, is that after the stress, the reward circuitry looked normal at first glance when they examined the rats' neurons. However, if the circuits were strongly used, in this case via consumption of ethanol, alterations to neurons were noticeable and the dopamine response to alcohol was blunted. The change in neuron physiology means that a specific set of neurons that are normally inhibitory flip and become excitatory. This flip alters the rats' response to ethanol, making them consume more and more. To reverse the negative effects of the erroneous excitatory signal, the team chemically prevented the excitatory switch within the reward circuitry. This correction prevented the blunted alcohol-induced dopamine signal, causing the stressed rats to consume less alcohol. ""We gave the rats a chemical called CLP290 to restore the stress-altered circuitry to normal, which in turn corrected the firing of the dopamine neurons.""

A study published in Brain and Cognition reports subjective experiences and cortical activation patterns that distinguish the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from other meditation practices. See Also: How the brain works during meditation ""Transcendental Meditation uses a mantra, and for this reason some researchers maintain that it involves focused attention and controlling the mind,"" said lead author Fred Travis. ""Those who practice TM know this is not the case. This study supports their experience that Transcendental Meditation is easy to learn and effortless to practice."" This study involved 87 students at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa who had been practicing the Transcendental Meditation technique from one month to five years. Researchers investigated experiences and brain patterns of students as they rested with eyes closed, during Transcendental Meditation practice, and while engaging in a challenging computer task. ""There are two key findings from this study,"" said lead author Dr. Travis. ""First, individuals practicing Transcendental Meditation for just one month reported the same frequency of Transcendental Consciousness experiences during their practice as individuals meditating for five years. This supports the understanding that Transcendental Meditation uses the natural tendency of the mind to transcend to move from active thinking to deep, inner silence. Extensive practice doesn't make a natural process go any better."" Learn More: Neurobiological changes explain how mindfulness meditation improves health The second finding deals with activity in the ""default mode network,"" which is a large-scale brain network involving areas in the front and back of the brain that are active during internal thinking and self-referential activity, such as creating an autobiographical story. Default mode network activity is high when a person just sits with his or her eyes closed, and low when one opens one's eyes and begins to interact with the world. The study reports that activity in the default mode network remained high during Transcendental Meditation practice. Activity in the default mode network is reported to go down in all other types of meditation since they involve focus and control of the mind. ""Deactivation of the default mode network indicates how much effort we are using,"" Dr. Travis says. ""While people may not have had the experience of effortless transcending and so do not know what it feels like to transcend, they can now see the objective high activation in the default mode network and see that something different is happening during Transcendental Meditation practice."" The study found that the default mode network was as high during Transcendental Meditation practice as during eyes-closed rest. ""This is an important finding, since eyes-closed rest is usually used as the benchmark for default mode network activity,"" Dr. Travis said. Read Next: Forever young(er): Meditation might slow the age-related loss of gray matter in the brain However, Dr. Travis found two important differences when comparing the brain states during Transcendental Meditation and eyes-closed rest. Eyes-closed rest had more beta brain waves in areas of the brain associated with memory and motor aspects of speech production. ""This could reflect the mental chatter that goes on when one's eyes are closed,"" Dr. Travis said. Transcendental Meditation had more theta brain waves in orbitofrontal areas associated with reward anticipation. This could indicate the movement of the mind to more charming levels of thought during transcending. The meditators' attention was absorbed in the inner march of the mind, attracted by the increasing charm of finer levels of mental functioning. This process did not involve effort or control of the mind since default mode network activity was high. These differences the activity in the default mode network, as well as the fact that the frequency of transcending is the same regardless of how long one has been practicing contrast Transcendental Meditation with other meditation practices.

However, recent breakthroughs in molecular genetics have shown that the disease may spread, like an infection, across closely connected areas of the brain. These findings underscore the need for research aimed at tracking its spread to the earliest points of origin in the brain, so therapies that target those areas can be developed. See Also: Research discovers neuroprotective protein in blood is biomarker of Alzheimer's disease An international collaboration between Nathan Spreng, Cornell University assistant professor of human development and the Rebecca Q. and James C. Morgan Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow in the College of Human Ecology, and Taylor Schmitz of the University of Cambridge's Cognitive Brain Sciences Unit, sheds light on the basal forebrain region, where the degeneration of neural tissue caused by Alzheimer's disease appears even before cognitive and behavioral symptoms of the disease emerge. Their work is published in Nature Communications. Data used for their work were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The basal forebrain contains very large and densely connected neurons that are particularly vulnerable to the disease. Schmitz and Spreng show that, as Alzheimer's progresses, degeneration of the basal forebrain predicts subsequent degeneration in temporal lobe areas of the brain involved in memory. This pattern is consistent with other research showing that Alzheimer's indeed spreads across brain regions over time, but the study challenges a widely held belief that the disease originates in the temporal lobe. ""We're hoping that this work pushes a bit of a reorganization of the field itself, to reappraise where the disease originates,"" Spreng said. ""That could open up new avenues for intervention; certainly it would for detection."" Learn More: Researchers develop blood test that detects early Alzheimer's disease Their report is the product of a two-year study of a large sample of age-matched older adults. Within this sample, one group was cognitively normal, according to standard tests, while others were characterized by different levels of cognitive impairment: Through analysis of high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging of brain volumes, taken three times over the two-year study period, the researchers were able to determine that individuals with MCI or Alzheimer's showed greater losses in gray matter volume in both the basal forebrain and temporal lobe, compared with cognitively normal controls. Intriguingly, they showed that over the two-year period, degeneration of neural tissue in the basal forebrain predicted subsequent tissue degeneration in the temporal lobe, but not the other way around. A sampling of spinal fluid from healthy adults can detect an abnormal level of beta amyloid, indicative of Alzheimer's, Spreng said. Test results showed that temporal lobes looked the same regardless of amyloid level, but the basal forebrain showed notable degeneration among those seemingly healthy adults with abnormal amyloid levels. Spreng admits that being able to predict who will get the disease doesn't mean a lot without a protocol to treat and, ultimately, cure the disease. ""And it might induce more anxiety,"" he said. But the more knowledge that can be gained now, he said, the better. Read Next: Why do people with Alzheimer's stop recognizing their loved ones?

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, found that scanning people's brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was significantly more effective at spotting lies than a traditional polygraph test. See Also: The lying game Toward a clearer understanding of how humans behave when they bend the truth It has been demonstrated that when someone is lying, areas of the brain linked to decision-making are activated, which lights up on an fMRI scan for experts to see. While laboratory studies showed fMRI's ability to detect deception with up to 90 percent accuracy, estimates of polygraphs' accuracy ranged wildly, between chance and 100 percent, depending on the study. The Penn study was the first to compare the two modalities in the same individuals in a blinded and prospective fashion. The approach adds scientific data to the long-standing debate about this technology and builds the case for more studies investigating its potential real-life applications, such as evidence in the criminal legal proceedings. Researchers from Penn's departments of Psychiatry and Biostatistics and Epidemiology found that neuroscience experts without prior experience in lie detection, using fMRI data, were 24 percent more likely to detect deception than professional polygraph examiners reviewing polygraph recordings. In both fMRI and polygraph, participants took a standardized ""concealed information"" test. Polygraph, the only physiological lie detector in worldwide use since it was introduced in its present form more than 50 years ago, monitors individuals' electrical skin conductivity, heart rate, and respiration during a series of questions. Polygraph is based on the assumption that incidents of lying are marked by upward or downward spikes in these measurements. Despite having been deemed inadmissible as legal evidence in most jurisdictions in the United States or for pre-employment screening in the private sector for almost 30 years, polygraph is widely used for government background checks and security clearances. Don't Miss: Scientists find possible neurobiological basis for tradeoff between honesty, self-interest ""Polygraph measures reflect complex activity of the peripheral nervous system that is reduced to only a few parameters, while fMRI is looking at thousands of brain clusters with higher resolution in both space and time. While neither type of activity is unique to lying, we expected brain activity to be a more specific marker, and this is what I believe we found,"" said the study's lead author, Daniel D. Langleben, MD, a professor of Psychiatry. To compare the two technologies, 28 participants were given the so-called ""Concealed Information Test"" (CIT). CIT is designed to determine whether a person has specific knowledge by asking carefully constructed questions, some of which have known answers, and looking for responses that are accompanied by spikes in physiological activity. Sometimes referred to as the Guilty Knowledge Test, CIT has been developed and used by polygraph examiners to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods to subjects prior to the actual polygraph examination. In the Penn study, a polygraph examiner asked participants to secretly write down a number between three and eight. Next, each person was administered the CIT while either hooked to a polygraph or lying inside an MRI scanner. Each of the participants had both tests, in a different order, a few hours apart. During both sessions, they were instructed to answer ""no"" to questions about all the numbers, making one of the six answers a lie. The results were then evaluated by three polygraph and three neuroimaging experts separately and then compared to determine which technology was better at detecting the fib. In one example in the paper, fMRI clearly shows increased brain activity when a participant, who picked the number seven, is asked if that is their number. Experts who studied the polygraph counterpart incorrectly identified the number six as the lie. The polygraph associated with the number six shows high peaks after the participant is asked the same questions several times in a row, suggesting that answer was a lie. The scenario was reversed in another example, as neither fMRI nor polygraph experts were perfect, which is demonstrated in the paper. However, overall, fMRI experts were 24 percent more likely to detect the lie in any given participant. Read Next: The unconscious mind can detect a liar even when the conscious mind fails Beyond the accuracy comparison, authors made another important observation. In the 17 cases when polygraph and fMRI agreed on what the concealed number was, they were 100 percent correct. Such high precision of positive determinations could be especially important in the United States and British criminal proceedings, where avoiding false convictions takes absolute precedence over catching the guilty, the authors said. They cautioned that while this does suggest that the two modalities may be complementary if used in sequence, their study was not designed to test combined use of both modalities and their unexpected observation needs to be confirmed experimentally before any practical conclusions could be made. ""While the jury remains out on whether fMRI will ever become a forensic tool, these data certainly justify further investigation of its potential,"" Langleben said.

However, most of these patients quickly become resistant to chemotherapy and may not respond as well to this standard treatment for the disease. Researchers at The Wistar Institute have shown that a class of drugs called bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors can be used in combination with cisplatin to reduce a tumor s resistance to chemotherapy, and therefore increase the effectiveness of the drug and improve long-term survival rates. The results were published in the journal Cancer Research. There is a tremendous need for novel therapeutic strategies for patients with chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer, given the prevalence of the clinical challenge and the limited number of other options available,  said Rugang Zhang, Ph.D., professor and co-program leader in the Gene Expression and Regulation program at Wistar and lead author of the study.  This study demonstrates how an existing class of targeted therapies could be used to potentiate the tumor suppression induced by cisplatin.  Several studies have shown how cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Specifically, an increase in the activity of aldehyde dehyrogenase (ALDH) due to higher levels of ALDH1A1 protein expression appears to increase resistance, while reducing its activity sensitizes epithelial ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy, making the treatment more effective. Zhang and colleagues were able to show that BET inhibitors are able to suppress the activity of ALDH in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Prior studies have shown that cisplatin increases ALDH activity, which then leads to cisplatin resistance. They also demonstrated that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), one of the members of the BET family that is inhibited by BET inhibiting drugs, is a regulator of ALDH1A1 expression, and the protein is found in higher levels in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer samples. To test the combination, mice with epithelial ovarian cancer-derived tumor cells were given either the combination of cisplatin and the experimental BET inhibitor JQ1 or cisplatin alone. The group that received the combination therapy experienced significantly extended survival compared with the group of mice that only received cisplatin. Additionally, the outgrowth of tumors in the group of mice that received the combination was significantly delayed.  The use of BET inhibitors for the treatment of cancer appears to be both safe and effective in clinical trials,  said Yuhki Yokoyama, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Zhang lab and first author of the study.  This combination appears to significantly extend the effectiveness of cisplatin, one of the most important drugs for treating ovarian cancer, and we hope our newly discovered approach will be validated in future clinical trials.

Framing a health issue through comparisons to warfare is common in popular media and medical and research communities. While it can motivate efforts to deal with the issue, this type of language and messaging can also create fear and stigma, turn patients into victims and divert resources from critically important prevention and care, said Daniel George, assistant professor of medical humanities, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. See Also: Researchers find a way to improve memory by suppressing a molecule that links aging to alzheimer s diseaseDespite decades of failures in Alzheimer's drug development, scientific attention continues to focus on drugs that ""attack"" a molecular compound called beta amyloid, with the goal of curing the disease. Amyloid is a key component of the plaques in the brain that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Research, however, shows that the appearance of amyloid does not correlate with clinical symptoms and beta amyloid has repeatedly been found in the brains of one-third of ""normal"" elderly people. This suggests that amyloid may be a symptom rather than a cause of damage. A growing number of researchers believe that declaring ""war"" on Alzheimer's by ""attacking"" amyloid may ultimately be an exercise in self-harm, particularly if amyloid is representative of the brain's repair response, and may be channeling resources away from other drug-based approaches that do not assume amyloid toxicity. Scholars have argued that metaphors and narratives that treat disease as something to be attacked can be socially damaging to those affected. The value of such metaphors may be clearer for infectious diseases caused by single pathogens. It becomes more problematic when discussing diverse, age-associated syndromes like Alzheimer's that may not be fully curable. In this way, war metaphors in medicine can invite ways of thinking that may not be scientifically or socially productive. Learn More: Some chronic viral infections could contribute to cognitive decline with aging ""If applied in a careless manner, war metaphors can delude our sense of what's possible therapeutically, and give false hope to people and caregivers who are suffering,"" George said. George and his co-authors propose moving toward different types of metaphors those that encourage use of words like ""slow"" or ""postpone"" rather than ""prevent"" or ""cure,"" and emphasize building ""resilience"" to aging processes in the brain rather than aiming at ""absolute victory"" over a disease. While ""fighting"" and ""defeating"" Alzheimer's through drug development is important, the authors argue it may be wiser to acknowledge that Alzheimer's is not a disease disconnected from the aging process like polio or malaria. The authors note that Alzheimer's has been classified as a disease for the past 40 years. They suggest it may be more beneficial to take a lifespan-oriented approach that includes education about known biological, psychosocial and environmental risk factors, investment in societal programs and infrastructure that support brain health, and ensuring proper care for those affected and their caregivers. ""While not as profitable as drug development, public health initiatives that reduce vascular risk factors, modulate oxidative stress and inflammation, guard against traumatic brain injuries, promote social engagement and lifelong learning, and reduce exposure to neurotoxins, and other commonsense actions should be an explicit component of our societal response (to Alzheimer's),"" the researchers wrote in the American Journal of Bioethics. George drew particular attention to the residents of Flint, Michigan being exposed to lead, a neurotoxin, through the water supply. ""It is inexcusable that we could let our public infrastructure fail to the point where it becomes a contributor to Alzheimer's disease risk for socio-economically disadvantaged citizens,"" George said. ""If we're really serious about addressing the problem of  Alzheimer's, we must start by not poisoning our citizens."" Read Next: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? Moving beyond the notion of being at war against Alzheimer's could also serve to humanize cognitive aging. ""There's a widely-accepted myth that people who have Alzheimer's are sort of non-people, akin to zombies,"" George said. ""There are ways to construct meaning around memory loss that show greater compassion and solidarity toward people with cognitive frailty rather than seeing them as passive victims in our biological war against the disease. We believe in a more humane message that even if you have a diagnosis of 'probable Alzheimer's' you can still have a life with deep purpose, social contribution and meaningful relationships.""

0,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/generegulating-proteins-have-drugsized-pocket-195578,Gene Regulating Proteins Have Drug Sized Pocket bHLH PAS protein family includes proteins involved in cancer  metabolism  and immunity  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An entire class of proteins called transcription factors, which regulate the activity of certain genes by interacting with specific sequences of DNA, has largely been ignored by the pharmaceutical industry because it s difficult to design and screen drugs against them. But a new study from scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute suggests that a key group of transcription factors are in fact  druggable,  including several that could be targeted to treat cancer, metabolic disease, or autoimmune conditions.  We found that at least seven bHLH-PAS proteins have pockets where drugs would fit and remain tightly bound,  said Fraydoon Rastinejad, Ph.D., professor in the Integrative Metabolism Program and senior author of the study.  That strongly suggests that all members of the family have similar, but chemically distinct, crevices that could bind drugs. Since these proteins serve as  master regulators  for controlling whole gene programs, drugs against these targets could have broader effects than traditional ones that block single enzymes.  In the new study, published in eLIFE, Rastinejad and his lab first determined the structures of NPAS 1 and NPAS 3 proteins, each in complex with their partner, ARNT, using X-ray crystallography. All three proteins belong to the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors. NPAS1 and NPAS3 control genes involved in brain and spinal cord development.  Rastinejad s team then compared the new structures to those of four other bHLH-PAS proteins, including two they previously solved, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) 1  and 2 . In all seven proteins, they observed two similarly sized and architecturally positioned cavities in which small molecules could fit. Since three more bHLH-PAS transcription factors were known to interact with small molecules, it s safe to assume that these pockets are a common feature of the whole bHLH-PAS family. Although variations in the NPAS1 and NPAS3 genes have been linked to brain disorders including autism, they aren t obvious drug targets because their function is most important in early life. However, modulating the activity of other bHLH-PAS proteins has been proposed to treat several diseases. For example, using drugs to block HIFs, which help cells survive when little oxygen is available, could stop the growth of certain cancers. Altering the function of the clock circadian regulator (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1), which keep cellular functions synchronized with day-night rhythms, could treat metabolic problems. And the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which controls T cell differentiation, is a potential target for drugs to alleviate autoimmune disease.  The fact that bHLH-PAS proteins have ligand-binding pockets insides their architectures suggests they re regulated by small molecules that are naturally found in the body,  added Rastinejad.  That means we have a lot left to discover about these transcription factors. We anticipate that this research will spur many investigations to find their native activators and inhibitors and determine how they affect each protein s activity.

The trial, which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2016 Congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed LEE011 plus letrozole reduced the risk of progression or death by 44% (HR = 0.556, 95% CI: 0.429-0.720; P = 0.00000329) over letrozole alone, significantly extending progression-free survival (PFS) across all patient subgroups. The company also announced that the EMA has accepted for review the marketing authorization application for LEE011 plus letrozole in the same patient population. ""These regulatory milestones, along with the FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation granted in August, underscore the need for new treatment options for women living with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer,"" said Bruno Strigini, CEO, Novartis Oncology. ""Priority Review allows a shorter review period compared with FDA standard review in the US, helping us to potentially bring LEE011 plus letrozole to patients more quickly. We also are working diligently with the EMA and other Health Authorities to bring this treatment to patients around the world as fast as possible.""  FDA Priority Review designation requires the agency to act on an application within six months of its filing date compared to ten months under standard review. FDA grants Priority Review to applications for new drug candidates that treat serious conditions, such as advanced breast cancer for which there is currently no cure, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treatment safety or efficacy.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/engineers-design-new-weapon-against-bacteria-193450,Engineers Design New Weapon Against Bacteria Researchers have successfully engineered antimicrobial peptides that can kill bacterial strains resistant to existing antibiotics  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Over the past few decades, many bacteria have become resistant to existing antibiotics, and few new drugs have emerged. A recent study from a U.K. commission on antimicrobial resistance estimated that by 2050, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections will kill 10 million people per year, if no new drugs are developed. To help rebuild the arsenal against infectious diseases, many scientists are turning toward naturally occurring proteins known as antimicrobial peptides, which can kill not only bacteria but other microbes such as viruses and fungi. A team of researchers at MIT, the University of Brasilia, and the University of British Columbia has now engineered an antimicrobial peptide that can destroy many types of bacteria, including some that are resistant to most antibiotics.  One of our main goals is to provide solutions to try to combat antibiotic resistance,  says MIT postdoc Cesar de la Fuente.  This peptide is exciting in the sense that it provides a new alternative for treating these infections, which are predicted to kill more people annually than any other cause of death in our society, including cancer.  De la Fuente is the corresponding author of the new study, and one of its lead authors along with Osmar Silva, a postdoc at the University of Brasilia, and Evan Haney, a postdoc at the University of British Columbia. Timothy Lu, an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and of biological engineering, is also an author of the paper, which appears in the Nov. 2 issue of Scientific Reports. Improving on nature Antimicrobial peptides, produced by all living organisms as part of their immune defenses, kill microbes in several different ways. First, they poke holes in the invaders  cell membranes. Once inside, they can disrupt several cellular targets, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. These peptides also have another critical ability that sets them apart from traditional antibiotics: They can recruit the host s immune system, summoning cells called leukocytes that secrete chemicals that help kill the invading microbes. Scientists have been working for several years to try to adapt these peptides as alternatives to antibiotics, as bacteria become resistant to existing drugs. Naturally occurring peptides can be composed of 20 different amino acids, so there is a great deal of possible variation in their sequences.  You can tailor their sequences in such a way that you can tune them for specific functions,  de la Fuente says.  We have the computational power to try to generate therapeutics that can make it to the clinic and have an impact on society.  In this study, the researchers began with a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide called clavanin-A, which was originally isolated from a marine animal known as a tunicate. The original form of the peptide kills many types of bacteria, but the researchers decided to try to engineer it to make it even more effective. Antimicrobial peptides have a positively charged region that allows them to poke through bacterial cell membranes, and a hydrophobic stretch that enables interaction with and translocation into membranes. The researchers decided to add a sequence of five amino acids that would make the peptides even more hydrophobic, in hopes that it would improve their killing ability. This new peptide, which they called clavanin-MO, was very potent against many bacterial strains. In tests in mice, the researchers found that it could kill strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus that are resistant to most antibiotics.  By using the thereby designed molecule, infected animals could be rescued from infections that were untreatable (and thus lethal) with standard antibiotic therapies. Whether this specific compound makes it to the hospital in the short run, the strategy of merging a killer activity with immunomodulant properties opens new avenues for dealing with the phenomenal AMR [antimicrobial resistance] problem,  says Victor de Lorenzo, a research group leader at the National Center of Biotechnology in Madrid, who was not involved in the study.  Suppressing sepsis Another key advantage of these peptides is that while they recruit immune cells to combat the infection, they also suppress the overactive inflammatory response that can cause sepsis, a life-threatening condition.  In this single molecule, you have a synthetic peptide that can kill microbes   both susceptible and drug-resistant   and at the same time can act as an anti-inflammatory mediator and enhance protective immunity,  de la Fuente says. The researchers also found that these peptides can destroy certain biofilms, which are thin layers of bacterial cells that form on surfaces. That raises the possibility of using them to treat infections caused by biofilms, such as the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections that often affect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Or, they could be embedded into surfaces such as tabletops to make them resistant to microbial growth. Other possible applications for these peptides include antimicrobial coatings for catheters, or ointments that could be used to treat skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus or other bacteria. If these peptides are developed for therapeutic use, the researchers anticipate that they could be used either in stand-alone therapy or together with traditional antibiotics, which would make it more difficult for bacteria to evolve drug resistance. The researchers are now investigating what makes the engineered peptides more effective than the naturally occurring ones, with hopes of making them even better.

Now, in a surprise finding, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified a possible trigger of chronic inflammation. Too much fat in the diet promotes insulin resistance by spurring chronic inflammation. But the researchers discovered, in mice, that when certain immune cells can t manufacture fat, the mice don t develop diabetes and inflammation, even when consuming a high-fat diet.  The number of people with diabetes has quadrupled worldwide over the last 20 years,  said senior investigator Clay F. Semenkovich, the Irene E. and Michael M. Karl Professor and director of the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Lipid Research at the School of Medicine.  We have made modest progress in making it less likely for some people with diabetes to have heart attacks and strokes. However, those receiving optimal therapy are still much more likely to die from complications driven by chronic inflammation that is, at least in part, generated by these immune cells.  But by blocking the production of fat inside these cells, it may be possible to prevent inflammation in people with diabetes and even in other conditions, such as arthritis and cancer, in which chronic inflammation plays a role. This could have a profound impact on health.  Semenkovich s team made genetically altered mice that could not make the enzyme for fatty acid synthase (FAS) in immune cells called macrophages. Without the enzyme, it was impossible for the mice to synthesize fatty acids, a normal part of cell metabolism.  We were surprised to find that the mice were protected from diet-induced diabetes,  said first author Xiaochao Wei, PhD, an instructor of medicine.  They did not develop the insulin resistance and diabetes that normally would have been induced by a high-fat diet.  Through a series of experiments in the animals and in cell cultures, the researchers, including Douglas F. Covey, PhD, a professor of developmental biology and biochemistry, and Daniel S. Ory, MD, a professor of medicine and of cell biology and physiology, found that if macrophages could not synthesize fat from within, the external membranes of those cells could not respond to fat from outside the cells. That prevented the cells from contributing to inflammation. But eliminating inflammation altogether is not the answer to preventing diabetic complications because inflammation is also vital for clearing infectious pathogens from the body and helps wounds heal. Still, Semenkovich said the new findings may have profound clinical implications.  An inhibitor of fatty acid synthase actually is now in clinical trials as a potential cancer treatment,  he explained.  And other drugs have been developed to inhibit fatty acid synthase in diabetes, too. One possibility that our work suggests is that altering the lipid content in the cell membrane may help block cancer metastases and complications of diabetes.  Drugs currently in use to block fatty acid synthase, as well as other developing strategies, potentially could allow for chronic inflammation to be blocked, without eliminating the ability of macrophages to fight infection. The researchers also plan to look at existing drug compounds that change the lipid composition in cells. Such medications failed in clinical trials, but they may influence the membranes of macrophages and therefore may lower the risk of diabetes complications, Semenkovich said.

In their paper receiving advance online publication in Nature, a team led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard identifies for the first time cancer stem cells and their differentiated progeny in human brain tumor samples.   Our work strongly supports that cancer stem cells are the main source of growth in these tumors and, as such, should be considered promising targets for treatment,  says Mario Suv , MD, PhD, of the MGH Department of Pathology, co-senior author of the Nature paper.  It has become clear that cancer stem cells   cells within tumors that exhibit stem cell characteristics and can differentiate into other specialized types of cancer cells   have a role in the progression and treatment resistance of several types of tumors, most prominently blood system tumors like leukemia. Several studies have supported a role for cancer stem cells in the aggressive brain tumors called glioblastoma, but those studies involved inducing human tumors to grow in mice, and as such their relevance to cancer in humans has been questioned. To more accurately reflect the mechanisms driving oligodendrogliomas, the researchers used RNA sequencing to study directly, on a single-cell level, gene expression in samples from six early-stage human tumors.  Their analysis of more than 4,000 individual tumor cells, the largest effort to date in brain tumors, finds three developmental categories of cancer cells   one resembling neural stem cells and two characterized by sets of genes indicting paths towards differentiation. The authors then observed that only a subset of cancer stem cells in each patient was showing signs of proliferation, while all other cancer cells were not. Importantly, these three developmental signatures were found in distinct genetic clones   cells with identical patterns of genetic mutations   of tumor cells.   Finding that different subclones within tumors show the same developmental patterns suggests that developmental programs   whether in stem cells or differentiated cancer cells   set the context within which genetic evolution of oligodendroglioma occurs, which is key to supporting the cancer stem cell model,  says Suv , who is an assistant professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School, an investigator with the MGH Center for Cancer Research, and an associate member of the Broad Institute.  Trying to understand as much as we can about genetic versus non-genetic determinants of tumor organization is key to our understanding of tumor propagation and to the design of new therapies. Our work suggests that targeting a specific stem cell phenotype, for example with immunotherapies, could be beneficial in patients with oligodendroglioma.""

So, researchers created the perfect decoy: A carefully constructed spherical nanoparticle coated in sialic acid lures the influenza A virus to its doom. When misted into the lungs, the nanoparticle traps influenza A, holding it until the virus self-destructs. In a study on immune-compromised mice, the treatment reduced influenza A mortality from 100 percent to 25 percent over 14 days. The novel approach, which is radically different from existing influenza A vaccines, and treatments based on neuraminidase inhibitors, could be extended to a host of viruses that use a similar approach to infecting humans, such as Zika, HIV, and malaria. Results were published today in the advanced online edition of the journal Nature Nanotechnology.  Instead of blocking the virus, we mimicked its target   it s a completely novel approach,  said Robert Linhardt, a glycoprotein expert and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute professor who led the research.  It is effective with influenza and we have reason to believe it will function with many other viruses. This could be a therapeutic in cases where vaccine is not an option, such as exposure to an unanticipated strain, or with immune-compromised patients.  The project is a collaboration between researchers within the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS) at Rensselaer and several institutions in South Korea including Kyungpook National University. Lead author Seok-Joon Kwon, a CBIS research scientist, coordinated the project across borders, enabling the South Korean institutions to test a drug designed and characterized at Rensselaer.  To access the interior of a cell and replicate itself, influenza A must first bind to the cell surface, and then cut itself free. It binds with the protein hemagglutinin, and severs that tie with the enzyme neuraminidase. Influenza A produces numerous variations each of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, all of which are antigens within the pathogen that provoke an immune system response. Strains of influenza A are characterized according to the variation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase they carry, thus the origin of the familiar H1N1 or H3N2 designations. Medications to counter the virus do exist, but all are vulnerable to the continual antigenic evolution of the virus. A yearly vaccine is effective only if it matches the strain of virus that infects the body. And the virus has shown an ability to develop resistance to a class of therapeutics based on neuraminidase inhibitors, which bind to and block neuraminidase. The new solution targets an aspect of infection that does not change: all hemagglutinin varieties of influenza A must bind to human sialic acid. To trap the virus, the team designed a dendrimer, a spherical nanoparticle with treelike branches emanating from its core. On the outermost branches, they attached molecules, or  ligands,  of sialic acid. The research found that the size of the dendrimer and the spacing between the ligands is integral to the function of the nanoparticle. Hemagglutinin occurs in clusters of three, or  trimers,  on the surface of the virus, and researchers found that a spacing of 3 nanometers between ligands resulted in the strongest binding to the trimers. Once bound to the densely packed dendrimer, viral neuraminidase is unable to sever the link. The coat of the virus contains millions of trimers, but the research revealed that only a few links provokes the virus to discharge its genetic cargo and ultimately self-destruct.   The major accomplishment was in designing an architecture that is optimized to bind so tightly to the hemagglutinin, the neuraminidase can t squeeze in and free the virus,  said Linhardt.

In vitro studies have given us great understanding of how molecules interact with one another. However, little is known of how they interact in vivo because due to the crowding, they can act based in ways that are difficult to model in test tubes. Approximately 70 percent of the cytosol is composed of water, and the remaining 30 percent is made up of macromolecules such as ribosomes, biomolecules such as proteins and DNA, metabolites such as ATP and amino acids, and ions.  For the study, published in eLife, the group modeled the inside of the smallest known bacteria, Mycoplasma genitalium, which has a length of approximately 400 nanometers   one nanometer being 1 billionth of a meter   and dynamically modeled approximately one trillion atoms within the cell, making this one of the largest molecular dynamic simulations performed to date. The simulation was carried out with GENESIS, a massively parallel molecular dynamics program developed at RIKEN. The calculations, which used 65,536 processing cores of the K computer, took several months to complete despite the power of the supercomputer.  The results of the study call into question the prevailing assumption that in the crowded cellular environment, interactions between molecules is primarily governed by a phenomenon known as the  volume exclusion effect,  meaning that the molecules monopolize a certain volume of the solvent   in this case water   in the solution around them, preventing other molecules from occupying that space. In contrast, the simulation found that other interactions such as electrostatic between charged molecules   play a major role.  Isseki Yu of RIKEN iTHES, the first author of the study, says,  This work has shown us that there are major differences between in vitro conditions and the in vivo conditions in the cell. We have found evidence for interactions beyond the  volume exclusion effect , including protein-protein interactions and electrostatic interactions with ions and metabolites. These need to be taken into effect when interpreting in vitro studies.  According to Yuji Sugita, one of the leaders of the research team, who has laboratories in iTHES as well as the RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center and RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science,  This research has brought us one step closer to the dream of simulating a complete cell at the molecular scale. The work will also contribute to drug development, as previous studies usually looked at interactions between proteins and a single candidate compound within water. Now, we will be able to also analyze the interactions between the candidate compound and other molecules within the crowded cellular environment.  Sugita continues,  One limitation of this study is that because of the enormous computing power required, we were only able to conduct short simulations. We believe it is still accurate, but hope to be able to perform this work on even more powerful future computers to reduce the statistical uncertainties and incorporate other interactions into the simulation such as genomic DNA and cytoskeletal elements.  Michael Feig the leader of the project at Michigan State University, who is also affiliated with RIKEN s Quantitative Biology Center, says,  This work is large step forward towards the modeling of an entire cell in atomistic detail which will ultimately allow us to connect what we know at the molecular level with biological function at the cellular level.

However, different analysis software packages often produce different results from the same raw data. An international team of researchers led by Professor Stefan Tenzer from the Mainz University Medical Center has now addressed this problem. In the framework of an international collaboration with leading laboratories worldwide, the team has compared and modified various analysis software packages to ensure that the different software solutions produce consistent results. A wide range of laboratories around the world are benefiting from this work, which enables researchers to analyze or compare the results of quantitative proteomics assays in a standardized way. This is crucial to detect certain organic diseases, such as cancer, at an early stage. The results of Tenzer and his team have now been published in the highly respected academic journal, Nature Biotechnology. When doctors want to find the cause of a particular illness, they have to take samples of cells or bodily fluids. These samples are then analyzed by modern Omics techniques which enable to reproducibly quantify thousands of proteins across large numbers of samples to identify novel biomarkers for diseases. The analysis of these highly complex datasets critically depends on specialized software packages. Unfortunately, different software packages sometimes deliver divergent results from the same raw data, thus complicating the analysis. This is exactly the problem that Professor Stefan Tenzer and his team from the Institute of Immunology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) set out to resolve. ""We wanted to find a way of optimally comparing samples, even when different analysis software sometimes produces deviating results,"" explained Tenzer. For his latest project he used two defined samples with precisely defined ratios of constituents. The bioinformatics specialists in Tenzer's team, Dr. Pedro Navarro and Dr. J rg Kuharev, developed a specialist piece of software, termed LFQbench. This allowed the team to study the differences between the various analysis programs in detail. ""Using LFQbench, we were able to show that the results delivered by the various programs differed significantly,"" explained Navarro. ""This finding alone has significant impact for the scientific community. But we have taken the project a step further: Our close collaboration with the developers of the individual programs enabled them to modify and improve their analysis packages so that they now produce highly convergent results,"" added Tenzer. This broadens the scope of applications of the mass spectrometry technique known as quantitative proteomics. A proteome is the entirety of proteins expressed by a cell. ""This means that in the future, mass spectrometry will be able to provide even more benefits both in basic research and as a potential diagnostic tool,"" Tenzer pointed out. ""This development represents a breakthrough for mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics and makes this method increasingly important as a standard procedure for use in the diagnosis of various disorders, such as cancer or allergies,"" emphasized the Chief Scientific Officer of the Mainz University Medical Center, Professor Ulrich F rstermann. ""I am particularly proud that our researchers are delivering applied research with such significant impact."" The pioneering results were achieved under the aegis of the technology platform ""Mass Spectrometry and Quantitative Proteomics"" based at the Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI) at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU). ""This success demonstrates the necessity of combining different areas of expertise in technology platforms at the University Medical Center. Without central support, it is nowadays almost impossible to accomplish achievements of this kind,"" said Professor Hansj rg Schild, Director of the Institute of Immunology and coordinator of the FZI for many years. Over recent years, Professor Stefan Tenzer and his team in Mainz have developed several improvements to the techniques used for mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics.

This is among the first studies to evaluate diet in association with ALS function and the first to show that healthy nutrients and antioxidants are associated with better ALS functioning. The findings are published online in JAMA Neurology. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig s Disease, is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that causes atrophy, paralysis, and eventually respiratory failure. Median survival for ALS patients ranges from 20 to 48 months, although 10 percent to 20 percent of patients can live longer than 10 years. Jeri W. Nieves, PhD, associate professor of Epidemiology, and co-authors examined the links between nutritional intake and severity of ALS for patients who had ALS symptoms for 18 months or less. The study, which relied on nutrient intake reported using a food questionnaire, followed 302 participants recruited at 16 clinical centers throughout the U.S. The researchers used a validated measure of ALS severity and respiratory function.    It appears that nutrition plays a role both in triggering the disease and why it progresses,  said Dr. Nieves.  For this reason, ALS patients should eat foods high in antioxidants and carotenes, as well as high fiber grains, fish, and poultry.  The researchers also found that milk and lunch meats were associated with lower measures of function, or more severe disease. Two different statistical analyses by Dr. Nieves both indicate that diet may help minimize the severity of ALS and point to the role of oxidative stress in ALS severity.  The foods and nutrients that may help reduce the severity of ALS are very similar to the recommendation to prevent many other chronic diseases,  noted Dr. Nieves.  Our cross-sectional study relied on a food questionnaire and those may not always represent a true daily diet,  cautioned Dr. Nieves.  However, those responsible for nutritional care of the patient with ALS should consider promoting fruits and vegetables since they are high in antioxidants and carotenes. Future studies will look at follow-up-data on both dietary intake and progression of ALS.  Source: Story from Columbia University s Mailman School of Public Health.

Psychology has traditionally defined all these thought patterns as variations of ""mind-wandering."" But a review of brain imaging studies led by researchers at the University of California (UC). Berkeley and the University of British Columbia (UBC) offers a new way of looking at spontaneous versus controlled thinking, challenging the adage that a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. See Also: How the brain pays attention: Identifying regions of the brain dealing with object-based, spatial attention It suggests that increased awareness of how our thoughts move when our brains are at rest could lead to better diagnoses and targeted treatments for such mental illnesses as depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ""It's important to know not only the difference between free-ranging mind-wandering and sticky, obsessive thoughts, but also to understand, within this framework, how these types of thinking work together,"" said review co-author Zachary Irving, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley. Irving and fellow authors of the qualitative review, published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, looked at three different ways in which people think when they're not directly engaged in tasks: spontaneous thought, ruminative thought and goal-directed thought. ""We propose that mind-wandering isn't an odd quirk of the mind,"" said the review's lead author Kalina Christoff, a psychology professor at UBC. ""Rather, it's something that the mind does when it enters into a spontaneous mode. Without this spontaneous mode, we couldn't do things like dream or think creatively."" Irving, who has ADHD, said there are upsides to the most stigmatized mental disorders. Related: Brain network that controls, redirects attention identified ""Everyone's mind has a natural ebb and flow of thought, but our framework reconceptualizes disorders like ADHD, depression and anxiety as extensions of that normal variation in thinking,"" said Irving. ""This framework suggests, in a sense, that we all have someone with anxiety and ADHD in our minds. The anxious mind helps us focus on what's personally important; the ADHD mind allows us to think freely and creatively."" Irving and fellow researchers reviewed nearly 200 neuroscience studies, a large number of which used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan brains during resting activities. They found that interactions between large-scale neural networks offered insights into how the resting mind moves. For example, their review of brain-imaging studies found that when the brain was focused on a task at hand, its prefrontal ""executive"" network, which governs planning and impulse control, among other functions, constrains other brain activity. When stuck in a negative loop, such as anxious rumination, the brain's ""salience"" network, which processes emotions, took control, shutting off most other networks. Not surprisingly, spontaneous thought, such as daydreaming, dreaming during sleep and other forms of free association, were linked to far lower activity in the neural networks responsible for controlled thinking, allowing the imagination to flow freely. Overall, researchers hypothesize that the resting mind naturally transitions between spontaneous and constrained thought. ""Let's say you're walking to the grocery store,"" Irving said. ""At first, your mind wanders to a plethora of ideas: your new shirt, a joke you heard today, an upcoming ski trip to Lake Tahoe. Then your thoughts become automatically constrained when you start to worry about a looming work deadline that needs to be met before the Tahoe trip. Then you realize that your worries are making you miserable, so you deliberately constrain your thoughts, forcing your mind back to grocery shopping."" Read Next: Low attention control in early adolescence is a genetic risk factor for anxiety disordersHistorically, Irving said, the field of psychology has approached mental disorders separately, as though each were in a vacuum rather than being interconnected. ""Clinicians have studied compulsive rumination in isolation, and ADHD in isolation, but now there's a huge interest in how we can make sure that the psychology and neuroscience literature is more closely aligned to what is happening in our heads,"" Irving said.

For years, scientists have sought methods and clues to help identify brain changes associated with Alzheimer's earlier in the disease process, so they can try to stop or even reverse the changes before they severely affect people's lives. See Also: Amyloid probes gain powers in search for Alzheimer's causeNow, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a chemical compound, named Fluselenamyl, that detects amyloid clumps better than current U.S. Food and Drug Administration- (FDA-) approved compounds. If a radioactive atom is incorporated into the compound, its location in a living brain can be monitored using positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The compound, described in a paper published in Scientific Reports, potentially could be used in brain scans to identify the signs of early-stage Alzheimer's disease or to monitor response to treatment. ""Fluselenamyl is both more sensitive and likely more specific than current agents,"" said Vijay Sharma, PhD, a professor of radiology, of neurology and of biomedical engineering, and the study's senior author. ""Using this compound, I think we can reduce false negatives, potentially do a better job of identifying people in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease and assess the effects of treatments."" Amyloid plaques are one of the most telltale findings in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The neurons near such plaques are often dead or damaged, and this loss of brain cells is thought to account for difficulty with thinking, memory loss and confusion experienced by Alzheimer's patients. Amyloid plaques can be either diffuse or compact. The compact kind has long been associated with the disease, but conventional wisdom has held that diffuse plaques are benign, since they can be found in the brains of elderly people without any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the brains of those with Alzheimer's. Sharma believes that diffuse plaques may mark the earliest stages of the disease. Learn More: Insight into cause of Alzheimer's symptoms: Amyloid plaques may be strangling blood flow ""It is a relatively underexplored area in the development of Alzheimer's pathology,"" Sharma said. ""Since current approved agents don't detect diffuse plaques, there is no reliable noninvasive imaging tool to investigate this aspect in animal models or in patients. Our compound could be used to study the role of diffuse plaques."" Using human amyloid beta proteins, Sharma and colleagues showed that Fluselenamyl bound to such proteins two to 10 times better than each of the three FDA-approved imaging agents for detecting amyloid beta. In other words, Fluselenamyl detected much smaller clumps of the protein, indicating that it may be able to detect the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease earlier. To determine whether Fluselenamyl can detect plaques in the brain, the researchers used the compound to stain brain slices from people who had died of Alzheimer's disease and, as controls, people of similar ages who had died of other causes. The brain slices from the Alzheimer's patients, but not the controls, were identified as containing plaques. Related: Study findings challenge a scientific principle about amyloid beta When a radioactive atom was incorporated into the compound, the researchers found very little interaction between Fluselenamyl and the healthy white matter in the human brain slices. ""A huge obstacle with existing state-of-the-art PET agents approved for plaque detection is that they tend to bind indiscriminately to the brain's white matter, which creates false positives on the scans,"" Sharma said. Nonspecific binding to other parts of the brain creates ""noise,"" which makes it difficult to distinguish samples with plaques from those without. A similar experiment comparing mice genetically predisposed to develop amyloid plaques with normal control mice showed the same pattern of high sensitivity for amyloid beta and low binding to healthy white matter. Furthermore, Sharma and colleagues showed that when Fluselenamyl with the radioactive atom is injected intravenously into mice, the compound can cross the blood-brain barrier, bind to any plaques in their brains and be detected by PET scan. In mice without plaques, the compound is quickly flushed from the brain and then excreted from the body. The next step is to move to testing in patients. Sharma already has submitted an application to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a phase 0 trial, to establish whether Fluselenamyl is safe for use in humans and behaves in the human body the same way it behaves in mice. Phase 0 trials involve a low dose given to a small number of people to learn how a molecule is processed in the body and how it affects the body. Don't Miss: New amyloid-reducing compound could be a preventive measure against Alzheimer s ""Ideally, we'd like to look at patients with very mild symptoms who are negative for Alzheimer's by PET scan to see if we can identify them using Fluselenamyl,"" Sharma said. ""One day, we may be able to use Fluselenamyl as part of a screening test to identify segments of the population that are going to be at risk for development of Alzheimer's disease. That's the long-term goal."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source.

The research was published online in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine and includes results from the Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and people with AD. The efficacy and safety of verubecestat is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, EPOCH and APECS, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD and prodromal AD, respectively.  The development of a potential disease modifying therapy for treatment of Alzheimer s disease has long been a focus of biomedical research,  said Dr. Michael Egan, vice president, clinical development neurosciences, Merck Research Laboratories.  We believe this research has the potential to contribute important evidence regarding the amyloid hypothesis, a leading scientific theory for what causes Alzheimer s disease, and we look forward to seeing the data from our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.  BACE1 is an important enzyme in the initiation of the toxic A  peptide production in the brain. Researchers believe that sustained, selective inhibition of BACE1 leading to a significant decrease in the toxic A  peptide production is a promising means for therapeutic intervention. This hypothesis has not yet been demonstrated in clinical studies. Historically the development of selective BACE1 inhibitors with properties allowing oral absorption and the ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier to the site of action in the brain proved technically challenging. Detailed analysis of the BACE1 protein structure and function by Merck scientists over many years was used to design a series of drug-like compounds with an ability to inhibit the protein, both in vitro and in the central nervous system (CNS) of preclinical animal models. This process yielded the lead compound verubecestat. Verubecestat produced significant CNS A  lowering in rodents and non-human primates treated for 6- to 9-months. Verubecestat s preclinical safety and tolerability profile supported its progression into human clinical testing for chronic use. Subsequent evaluation of once-daily doses of verubecestat in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers and in people with AD for a duration of one week demonstrated significant decreases in the levels of A  peptide production, a key marker of BACE1 activity, in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of up to 80 percent. Data from patients with AD were initially presented at the 2013 Alzheimer s Association International Conference (AAIC). Results of the Phase 1 trial of patients with Alzheimer s disease The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile of verubecestat in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer s disease (n=32). Patients were randomized to receive one of three doses (12 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg) of verubecestat or placebo orally once-daily for seven days. Samples of CSF were collected over 36 hours via a lumbar catheter and analyzed for levels of amyloid   40 (A 40), amyloid   42 (A 42) and soluble amyloid precursor protein   (sAPP ) as biomarkers of BACE1 activity. In this study, verubecestat at doses of 12, 40 and 60 mg caused a dose-dependent and sustained reduction in the levels of A 40 from baseline in the CSF, a measure of BACE1 activity, of 57, 79 and 84 percent, respectively. No study discontinuations due to adverse events were recorded. Analysis of vital signs and laboratory assessments, including liver function tests, showed no statistically significant changes related to the administration of verubecestat. Verubecestat was generally well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and individuals with AD. No dose-dependent increase in the incidence of adverse events was observed. Adverse events included headache, nasal congestion and dizziness. Source:Story from Merck.

The new method could improve the understanding of how our genes are regulated and different cell types develop. When information in our genes is used, for example to build a protein, it is first translated to messenger-RNA which functions as a blueprint for the protein. Our cells also contain non-coding, short, RNA sequences that do not contribute to the formation of proteins and whose functions are partly unknown. The best known of these is micro RNA (miRNAs), which can interact with the messenger RNA, and thereby regulate genes and cell function. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have now mapped the presence of short RNA-sequences in an individual cell. Previous research on short RNA molecules is based on analysis of many cells simultaneously, making it difficult to study the precise function.  Our knowledge of the function of short RNA molecules is quite general. We have a picture of the general mechanisms, but it is less clear what specific role these molecules play in different types of cells or diseases,  says Rickard Sandberg, professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, who is also affiliated to the Stockholm branch of Ludwig Cancer Research. Two types of embryonic stem cells The analysis was done using single-cell transcriptomics, a technique which makes it possible to measure the absolute numbers of short RNA molecules in a cell. Two types of embryonic stem cells were used, intended to mimic the early embryo, before and after it has attached to the uterine lining. The researchers could detect large numbers of small RNAs in both cell states, including miRNA as well as shorter RNA fragments (tRNA and snoRNA) whose function is largely unknown. The researchers also found that large numbers of miRNAs are expressed differently in the two cell states.  This is basic research and a demonstration that the method works, giving suggestions for further research. To map the levels of short RNA molecules in a cell is a first step in identifying the specific function of these molecules,  says Omid Faridani, one of the lead authors of the study. In the long run, Rickard Sandberg can imagine clinical applications of the method.  We are, for example, interested in the role short RNA molecules play during embryonic development. We hope that, with more knowledge, this method could be used to identify which embryos have the best chance to develop, which would then be used to improve current IVF treatments,  he says.

The method for screening for S5 R inhibition is key in finding new antagonists. In this study, the label-free S5 R inhibitory assay using LC-MS was developed. S5 R type 1 enzyme was obtained from LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The enzymatic assay was optimized for enzyme-substrate (testosterone) concentration, NADPH-cofactor concentration, solvent tolerance, enzyme activity stability and incubation time. The developed assay was validated by measuring the signal to background ratio (S/B), the signal to noise ratio (S/N), the signal window (SW) and the zeta factor Z  in accordance with published bioassay guidelines. The enzymatic reaction was performed in 96-well plates and DHT formation was determined by LC-MS. S/B, S/N, SW and Z  factor were well above acceptable criteria and the reproducibility was good using Z  factor other 3 days and further validated by dutasteride and finasteride inhibition. The method was successfully applied to quantify S5 R inhibitory activity of some Thai herbal extracts. Two plant extracts, Impatiens balsaminaL. and Curcuma longaL. showed IC50 at 5.4 0.2 and 9.0 1.2  gmL-1 and are therefore promising sources of new S5 R inhibitors.

Associate Professor Michelle Hill from the UQ Diamantina Institute said different amyloid conditions had different protein culprits, and required different treatments.  For instance, in one type of amyloidosis known as AL, chemotherapy is required, but chemo is inappropriate and potentially harmful to patients with other amyloid conditions,  Dr Hill said.  In the trial we used cutting-edge techniques including laser-capture microdissection and tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins in the amyloid deposits.  This technique was recently reported by the Mayo Clinic in the United States as a new diagnostic tool for amyloidosis, but it has not yet been evaluated in other centres.  It is a challenging technique because of the small size of the protein deposits and the technical skills required for the multiple steps of the method.  We were pleased to be able to identify amyloid proteins in 121 out of 131 attempted cases in this study, a success rate of 92 per cent.  The PAH Amyloidosis Centre is the only centre in Australia to provide mass spectrometry analysis for amyloidosis patients. Centre Director Dr Peter Mollee said the assay s accuracy was a significant improvement on traditional laboratory tests.  We tested previous methods on a subset of the samples from this study and the success rate was only 45 per cent,  Dr Mollee said.  Strikingly, during the course of the five-year trial, the mass spectrometry assay results altered the diagnosis in almost a quarter of all cases.  This is a big step forward for amyloid patients because identifying the culprit protein is so important to delivering the right treatment.  The centre now receives referrals from across Australasia for the mass spectrometry test, which is performed at the Translational Research Institute Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core Facility.

These patients face an unprecedented risk of death from bacterial infections and the mechanism for this has remained unclear until now. In the latest edition of Nature Immunology, Sylvia Knapp s Group at the CeMM and the Medical University of Vienna discovered how hemolysis causes infections and found a new means to prevent it, paving the way to new treatment possibilities For decades, iron has been considered the prime suspect responsible for the high rate of bacterial infections in patients with hemolysis (bursting of red blood cells). A research group led by Sylvia Knapp, Director of Medical Affairs at CeMM and Professor of Infection Biology at the Medical University of Vienna, was now able to refute this theory: They revealed that heme-iron was not only failing to act as a willing nutrient to bacteria, heme was instead paralyzing the very innate immune cells sent to protect the host from the bacteria.  Using in vitro and pre-clinical models, we could clearly demonstrate that heme acts on macrophages preventing these cells from eliminating bacteria.  explains Rui Martins, PhD student at CeMM and the Medical University of Vienna, and the first author of the study. The scientists discovered a completely unknown mechanism: The heme molecule interfered with the cytoskeleton of macrophages and thereby immobilized them.  Through chemical proteomics and biochemical experiments, we discovered that heme interacted with DOCK8, which led to the permanent activation of its downstream target Cdc42, with deleterious effects , explains Sylvia Knapp. In the presence of heme, the cytoskeletal resilience is lost, as filaments grow rampant in all directions, resulting in macrophage paralysis in other words, the cells lose their ability to shape-shift and can no longer chase down and  eat  the invading bacteria. The resultant impact is that bacteria can multiply virtually unrestricted. The scientists were not only able to clarify the molecular effect of heme on macrophages, but moreover discovered that quinine, an approved drug, which is clinically used to treat malaria, can restore the functionality of paralyzed macrophages.  This is very promising. We conclusively demonstrate that it is indeed feasible to therapeutically  protect  immune cells and to restore the body s immune defense against bacteria in hemolytic conditions , says Sylvia Knapp. Source: Story from the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

A computational model developed at Rice s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics will help biologists take advantage of the homologous nature of bacterial signaling systems to reveal the minimal mutations that allow a signaling protein to be efficiently reprogrammed to prefer a nonpartner signaling protein. Their open-access paper on the topic published online by the Oxford University Press journal Molecular Biology and Evolution will be featured on the cover of the December issue. The research led by Rice biophysicist and protein-folding pioneer Jos  Onuchic, postdoctoral researcher Ryan Cheng and alumnus Faruck Morcos, now of the University of Texas at Dallas, expands upon previous work to model two-component systems that co-evolve amino acids at their binding surfaces to recognize each other. Those systems consist of proteins in bacterial cells that signal each other to sense and respond to stimuli. The new work extends the team s models to cover how mutating a signaling protein affects its interaction with its partner, as well as its interaction with other signaling systems. The extended model connects the fact that partner proteins are able to find each other in a crowd while also preventing unnecessary crosstalk.  We re showing for the first time that the method has enormous power for designing new stimulus-response mechanisms in organisms,  said Onuchic, who predicted that the research will bring the disciplines of synthetic biology and systems biology closer together. Synthetic biologists engineer organisms like bacteria to produce chemicals or act as components in biological circuits. The Rice team s goal is to simplify their work by allowing them to model many possibilities before taking a project to the lab.  There are three goals in synthetic biology,  Onuchic said.  The first is to force an organism to do something it s not supposed to do, like make insulin. The second is to change a mechanism to respond differently to a particular stimulus. There may be many reasons, and that may affect the phenotype of how an organism behaves. The third is to rewire different parts of an organism to understand what the parts are and what happens if we switch them. That s what our project is about,  he said.  We want to understand sequence selection for two-component systems but we also want to demonstrate that our model can predict mutational phenotypes,  said Cheng, the paper s lead author.  With this method, we re telling people that if they want 20 functional mutants, they can just pick the top 20 produced by our model. We re simply ranking them. Someone who wants to design novel interactions could use our model, select mutations and generate those mutations.  Every cell contains thousands of two-component signaling proteins programmed to find each other and serve as sensors that trigger a cell to act, most often through the activation or repression of genes.  These systems have lots of response-raising kinases (the sensor component) and there s a lot of promiscuity,  Onuchic said.  That s important, because a system doesn t have one copy of each thing; it has multiple copies of everything, and they re interacting with each other all the time.  Proteins are so similar, with minor variations between them, because you want them to see everything in their environments,  he said.  If they were meant to be completely partner-specific, with no promiscuity, they would be very different from each other. The problem when you make these mutations is that you may offset the balance between interacting with its signaling partner versus interacting with other signaling proteins in a deleterious way.   We ve constructed a co-evolutionary landscape that can predict which mutants lead to functional signaling in bacteria,  Cheng said. Co-evolutionary landscapes allow for the prediction of how mutations affect signaling in bacteria and, consequently, an organism s fitness. He said the open-access model will make it faster and easier for researchers to plug in mutations and determine whether and how they will function.  Now we can apply these models to predict how mutations affect phenotypes (an organism s characteristics). The direct connection between sequence-level mutations and how they lead to the emergent properties of an organism is a holy grail of molecular biology,  he said. Source: Story from Rice University.

A growing body of research shows the microbiome   the community of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms living in the body, mostly in the digestive tract   plays a crucial role in human health and disease. Because of its influence on disease states and response to treatments, write Thomas Kuntz, a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry, and Jack Gilbert, PhD, Faculty Director of the Microbiome Center, the microbiome should play a crucial role in the field of personalized medicine, which has been dominated thus far by genetics.   Ultimately, the microbiome must become an integral part of precision medicine as a whole, since so much of human functioning and metabolism is dependent upon it,  the authors write.  If this is to happen in the near future, as it hopefully should, we must better understand the microbiome and its interactions with the human and the environment via a concerted effort and conversation between researchers, clinicians, patients, the government, and most importantly, the broader community.  In his 2015 State of the Union, President Barack Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative, a far-reaching research effort to develop medical treatments tailored for an individual s unique genetic makeup, environment and lifestyle. Instead of relying on one-size-fits-all solutions designed to help the largest number of statistically average people, such treatments could leverage advances in genetic testing, molecular engineering and big data analysis to target diseases that are often unique to each patient. Many early precision medicine projects have focused on genetic differences between individual patients, such as unique genetic mutations in a tumor. Kuntz and Gilbert suggest several key areas where microbiome research could complement and extend genetics-based, precision medicine efforts:   Drug response and interactions The way the body metabolizes drugs plays a key role in their effectiveness and potential for adverse reactions; likewise, the gut microbiome is an important driver of the body s metabolism and digestive process. More than 60 drugs have already been identified to have interactions with the microbiome, and as that number is surely to increase, a greater understanding of these interactions in the context of a patient s unique microbial community could lead to more effective treatments.   Targeted treatments and antibiotics Antibiotics have a direct effect on the microbiome, however, they have widespread effects on the microbial balance in the body, wiping out not only pathogens but helpful bacteria that are essential to health. Development of precision antibiotics and therapies that target specific pathogens and enzymes would improve the effectiveness of such treatments and reduce the spread of resistance by avoiding overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics.   Prebiotics and probiotics Precision deployment of prebiotics, substances like metabolites that serve as food for microbes, could stimulate the growth of specific strains to help restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Likewise, a better understanding of the individual communities of microbes in a patient, how they differ from diseased to healthy states and how to manipulate those communities reliably, could also help researchers develop more effective probiotic products to restore healthy microbiome function in the gut.   Underserved community disparities Several health conditions, including obesity and asthma, which disproportionately affect people living in low socioeconomic status or medically-underserved communities have been linked to disruptions in the microbiome. Such communities could greatly benefit by further research on the specific environmental and lifestyle factors that influence individual microbiomes and possibly contribute to the development of these conditions.  Because the human microbiome is incredibly complex and can rapidly change in an individual, it offers a prime opportunity for developing highly-personalized, precision treatments, the authors write.  The time has come to include the microbiome and microbial responses in our assessments of health and disease,  said Gilbert.  We should build an integrated database of all of these records to allow for appropriate meta-analyses, so that we can all benefit.  Source: Story from The University of Chicago Medicine.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/tracking-alzheimers-progression-212240,Tracking Alzheimer s Progression MRI data reveals structural asymmetries that vary among individuals and are greater among those who develop dementia  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Use of a novel approach to analyzing brain structure that focuses on the shape, rather than the size of particular features, may allow identification of individuals in early presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer s disease. A team of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators using advanced computational tools to analyze data from standard MRI scans report that individuals with Alzheimer s disease, including those diagnosed partway through a multi-year study, had greater levels of asymmetry   differences in shape between the left and right sides of the brain   of key brain structures. Their study has been published online in the journal Brain.   Our results show for the first time that asymmetry of the hippocampus and amygdala increases with disease severity, above and beyond age-associated effects,  says Christian Wachinger, PhD, formerly with the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH, the lead author of the report.  By studying the progression of asymmetry from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, we demonstrated that greater asymmetry in those and a few other structures can predict disease progression and could be a biomarker allowing early detection of dementia.  Wachinger is part of a team led by Martin Reuter, PhD, of the Martinos Center, that developed BrainPrint, a computer-aided system for representing the whole brain based on the shapes rather than the size or volume of structures. Originally described in a 2015 article in NeuroImage, BrainPrint appears to be as accurate as a fingerprint in distinguishing among individuals. In a recent paper in the same journal, Wachinger and Reuter demonstrated the use of BrainPrint for automated diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease.  The current study used BrainPrint to analyze structural asymmetries in a series of MR images of almost 700 participants in the National Institute of Health-sponsored Alzheimer s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participation in that study involves MR brain imaging taken upon enrollment and repeated every 6 to 12 months, along with cognitive and genetic testing; and the MGH study analyzed data from ADNI participants with at least three MRI scans. Participants were divided into four groups: those diagnosed with probable Alzheimer s when entering the study, healthy controls with no sign of dementia, individuals with mild cognitive impairment that remained stable over the two to three years for which scans were available, and those with mild cognitive impairment that progressed to Alzheimer s disease during the study.  BrainPrint analysis of the data revealed that initial, between-hemisphere differences in the shapes of the hippocampus and amygdala   structures known to be sites of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer s disease   were highest in individuals with dementia and lowest in healthy controls. Among those originally classified with mild cognitive impairment, baseline asymmetry was higher in those that progressed to Alzheimer s dementia and became even greater as symptoms developed.  Increased asymmetry was also associated with poorer cognitive test scores and with increased cortical atrophy.  The senior author of the Brain paper, Reuter explains,  Several studies have indicated that Alzheimer s has different effects in different sub-structures of the hippocampus and amygdala. Since the shape descriptors of BrainPrint are more sensitive to subtle changes within a structure than are standard volume-based measures, they are better suited to quantify early disease effects and predict future progression, which opens up new research directions into the mechanisms that cause these asymmetries. For example, in addition to asymmetric distribution of amyloid beta, which has been reported, the differences could reflect disease subtypes that affect hemispheres differently.  Now a professor of Neurobiological Research in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Wachinger adds,  In collaboration with colleagues at the Martinos Center, we are planning further exploration of the relationship between shape asymmetries and established Alzheimer s disease biomarkers to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms. Differentiating between those with stable mild cognitive impairment and those who will progress to Alzheimer s is of great clinical relevance, as it could help select individuals appropriate for clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.

The study will use MDNA's proprietary Mitomic Technology  to isolate mitochondrial biomarkers circulating in blood plasma that have the potential to accurately distinguish between women with and without endometriosis. The endometriosis test aims to provide the medical community with a much-needed tool in the management of endometriosis to close the average 9-year gap between symptom onset and diagnosis, and accelerate the pathway to treatment. Following the successful outcome of this clinical study, launch of the test is planned for 2017. The collaboration with the University of Oxford will be facilitated by Professor Christian Becker, and Professor Krina Zondervan, co-Directors of the Endometriosis Care and Research (CaRe) Centre which aims to find novel diagnostic approaches and identify innovative, more focused therapies for endometriosis. ""This collaborative effort between MDNA Life Sciences and the Endometriosis CaRe Centre is an exciting novel project aiming to identify urgently needed biomarkers in endometriosis focusing on mitochondrial DNA,"" said Professor Becker. Professors Becker and Zondervan have also participated with the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) in the Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonization Project (EPHect), which has produced the current standards in data, sample collection and processing for endometriosis research. ""Using the WERF EPHect data and sample collection protocols will ensure the highest standards of phenotypic data and biological sample quality, which is a prerequisite for high quality and reproducible studies,"" added Professor Zondervan. MDNA's diagnostic tests are developed using its proprietary Mitomic Technology  platform which exploits the unique biological characteristics of mitochondrial DNA making it a highly attractive and effective system for biomarker discovery, early disease detection, monitoring, risk assessment and therapeutic targeting. This innovative platform has led to the discovery of numerous novel and proprietary biomarkers for a multitude of cancers and other diseases. The exceptional biological properties of mitochondrial DNA allow MDNA's proprietary tests to accurately identify early stages of disease progression, using a non-invasive blood sample. ""Particularly for endometriosis, which affects 10% of women of childbearing age and currently relies on an invasive surgical procedure for diagnosis, there is significant value in the development of a non-invasive molecular test.

The study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and is planned for initiation in 1H 2017. Adaptimmune s SPEAR T-cell candidates are novel cancer immunotherapies that have been engineered to target and destroy cancer cells. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has previously been evaluated in multiple myeloma in a single agent Phase I/II trial in which 20 out of 22 patients (91 percent) experienced a response at day 100 post autologous stem cell transplant. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.  KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Blocking this interaction is reported to enable T-cell activation and potentiates antitumor activity.  In initial single-agent studies of our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy in patients with advanced myeloma in the context of stem cell transplantation, we have seen encouraging evidence of antitumor effect, safe administration and prolonged persistence of transduced cells,  said Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune s chief medical officer.  KEYTRUDA has shown preliminary evidence of activity in multiple myeloma, and there is preclinical evidence to support the view that the combination of NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy and anti-PD1 therapy may lead to meaningful anti-tumor activity. We look forward to evaluating our therapy alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA in a randomized trial of patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory or have relapsed with standard therapy.   The agreement is between Adaptimmune and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, through a subsidiary. Under the agreement, the trial will be sponsored by Adaptimmune. The agreement also includes provision for potential expansion to include Phase III registration studies in the same indication. Additional details were not disclosed.","Published: November 2, 2016"

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is perhaps the best known of these compounds. Some evidence suggests that cannabinoids might help to treat certain health conditions. Possible uses include pain, inflammation, epilepsy, nerve cell diseases, and substance use disorders. However, some cannabinoids can cause side effects, such as dizziness, hallucinations, and paranoia. Some synthetic cannabinoids, such as K2 or Spice, can produce severe and even deadly reactions. Cannabinoids exert their primary effects in the brain by binding the human cannabinoid (CB1) receptor. Determining the detailed 3-D structure of this receptor at a fine level is important for potential drug development, as it reveals key details about how the receptor and drugs might interact. An international group of researchers set out to determine the structure of the CB1 receptor. Their work was funded in part by NIH s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  The researchers synthesized a chemical called AM6538 that they designed to inactivate and help crystallize the CB1 receptor. They slightly modified CB1 as well to optimize it for crystallization. They then computed the 3-D structure of the CB1-AM6538 complex using X-ray crystallography, in which the angles and intensities of X-rays that bounce off a crystal structure are used to determine molecular shape. The crystal structure revealed that the CB1 receptor has a complicated binding pocket with multiple subpockets. Based on prior findings, the scientists were able to predict how other cannabinoids would fit into the receptor. The model revealed insights into how long each cannabinoid might bind to the CB1 receptor and how each might cause slightly different structural changes to the receptor. These findings provide clues to the mechanisms by which different cannabinoids can exert somewhat differing effects.  Cannabinoids can produce very different outcomes, depending on how they bind to the CB1 receptor,  says NIDA Director Dr. Nora D. Volkow.  Understanding how these chemicals bind to the CB1 receptor will help guide the design of new medications and provide insight into the therapeutic promise of the body s cannabinoid system.   This complex structure will allow chemists to design diverse compounds that specifically target portions of the receptor to produce desired effects,  says co-author Dr. Alexandros Makriyannis of Northeastern University.","Published: November 2, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/uncovering-elusive-proteins-212866,Uncovering Elusive Proteins Researchers have determined the complete structure of elusive proteins  known as tetraspanins  for the first time  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Stephen Blacklow describes the shape of CD81, the first protein of its kind to have its molecular structure completely revealed. Video: Stephanie Dutchen Half-buried in the oily membranes of our cells lurk elusive proteins called tetraspanins. Although tetraspanins perform a variety of essential jobs and are being linked to an increasing number of diseases, researchers don t understand how they work or break down because they haven t been able to figure out what the proteins look like.  Tetraspanins are incredibly important in biology, and we know bloody little about them,  said Stephen Blacklow, chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School.  If you really want to understand how anything in biology works, you have to see what it looks like at the molecular level,  added Andrew Kruse, HMS assistant professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology. Now, Blacklow, Kruse and colleagues have pierced the veil surrounding tetraspanins by determining the first complete structure of one: tspan28, also known as CD81, a protein that helps B-cells mature for a robust immune system. The researchers describe CD81 s surprising shape, not dissimilar to an ice cream cone that can hold a cholesterol molecule, in the journal Cell on Oct. 27. The finding reveals that the part of CD81 previously hidden within the cell membrane is more important than many scientists assumed. The study also suggests that CD81, whose malfunction can lead to immune deficiencies and whose presence is necessary for hepatitis C infection, might make a useful drug target and provides clues for how to manipulate the protein.  CD81 was predicted to be kind of useless. Instead, we found this binding pocket that no one expected,  said the study s first author, Brandon Zimmerman, a former research fellow in the Blacklow lab who now works at Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston.  Knowing the structure opens the door to, in a fantasy, maybe one day being able to target this and other tetraspanins for clinical applications.  The clinical potential is uncertain but broad, the researchers say, as studies in humans and mice have linked abnormal tetraspanin function to cancer, diabetes, bleeding disorders, kidney and skin diseases, eyesight and hearing loss, sterility and more. Oil and water Like carrots rooted in soil with only their greens sprouting above ground, tetraspanins have an inner, transmembrane portion and an outer, extramembrane portion. In the 25 years following the discovery of tetraspanins, scientists caught a glimpse of the isolated outer segment. The oily transmembrane segment, however, and its relationship to the outer segment, remained shrouded in obscurity because it doesn t cooperate with common structure-deciphering tools, which are water-based. Some researchers tried to pry into the black box and failed. Others shrugged, figuring the transmembrane portion wasn t important but merely served as an anchor for the outer segment.  Structural studies of membrane proteins were very daunting up until about ten years ago,  said Blacklow, senior author of the paper and the Gustavus Adolphus Pfeiffer Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at HMS. The HMS-led team bet on co-author Kruse s expertise in a technique called lipidic cubic phase crystallography. The method allows researchers to crystallize and capture the structures of membrane proteins while they re embedded in an oily matrix that mimics their natural environment. The wager paid off, and the researchers got their first full look at a tetraspanin including some unique and unexpected features.  Brandon s perseverance and biochemical skills and Andrew s determination and deep knowledge of membrane protein structural biology made it possible,  said Blacklow.  Some luck too,  Zimmerman added. Hidden pocket Tetraspanins get their name from crossing the cell membrane four times. The team was surprised to find that CD81 s four main coils weren t all bundled together as expected but instead divided into two pairs that come together on one end to form a cone.  It s different from all prior predictions,  said Blacklow. The second surprise came with the unearthing of CD81 s inner cavity and the discovery that it can hold a cholesterol molecule. That got the team especially excited, because it revealed that researchers can now try to manipulate CD81 using cholesterol or other small molecules.  No one thought the transmembrane portion was important,  said Zimmerman.  Clearly that isn t the case.  Computer simulations run by collaborators at Stanford University revealed that when bound to cholesterol, CD81 sits around with its extramembrane cap closed, but when unbound, its cap occasionally flips open. Additional experiments led the team to propose that abundant cholesterol holds CD81 closed. That makes it harder for CD81 to interact with other proteins, including the tetraspanin CD19, which is needed for B-cells to properly develop and function. Conversely, in a cholesterol-poor environment, such as the endoplasmic reticulum or ER, where CD19 is produced, the researchers suspect that CD81 can open up and ferry CD19 to the cell surface, where it then becomes part of the B-cell receptor a core element of the immune system s response to pathogens. The findings suggest that  you could either give a drug that mimics cholesterol and holds CD81 closed or give a drug that interferes with cholesterol binding and causes it to be open,  said Zimmerman.  Both avenues could have therapeutic importance.  One area of interest, the researchers say, is immune-based cancer treatments called CAR T-cell therapies that target B-cell cancers by homing in on CD19.  Like they say in  Forrest Gump,  life or structural biology is like a box of chocolates,  said Blacklow.  You never quite know what you re going to get.   But it s almost always interesting,  said Kruse. Illuminating dark matter In addition to helping researchers understand and potentially target CD81, the discovery may illuminate other tetraspanins and their disease connections because they likely share CD81 s structure, the researchers say. For example, the work could assist researchers who are taking aim at the tetraspanin CD37 in clinical trials to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Even if clinical applications don t pan out, though, the work excites Blacklow because it represents one of the last remaining opportunities to illuminate  dark matter  in transmembrane protein biology, he said.  A lot of times, we elucidate some new detail or facet of a particular molecule or process,  he said.  There are fewer and fewer completely new things that we get to see.

The results mark the first time that skin-based gene therapy has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in patients. The findings were published Nov. 1 in JAMA. Associate professors of dermatology Peter Marinkovich, MD, and Jean Tang, MD, PhD, share senior authorship of the study. Senior scientist Zurab Siprashvili, PhD, is the lead author. For the study, four adult patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, an excruciatingly painful genetic skin disease, received the skin grafts.  Our phase-1 trial shows the treatment appears safe, and we were fortunate to see some good clinical outcomes,  said Tang.  In some cases, wounds that had not healed for five years were successfully healed with the gene therapy. This is a huge improvement in the quality of life for these people.  People with epidermolysis bullosa lack the ability to properly produce a protein called type-7 collagen that is needed to anchor the upper and lower layers of the skin together. As a result, the layers slide across one another upon the slightest friction, creating blisters and large open wounds. The most severe cases are fatal in infancy. Other patients with recessive dystrophic EB can live into their teens or early adulthood with supportive care. Often these patients die from squamous cell carcinoma that develops due to constant inflammation in response to ongoing wounding. The Stanford researchers showed that it was possible to restore functional type-7 collagen protein expression in patient skin grafts to stop blistering and allow wounds to heal. They also found that the protein continued to be expressed and that wound healing was improved during a year of follow up. Looking to build upon results The researchers seek to build upon these promising early results in a new trial that will include patients ages 13 and older.   Moving into the pediatric population may allow us to intervene before serious chronic wounds and scars appear,  said Marinkovich, who directs the Stanford Blistering Disease Clinic. Repeated rounds of wounding and scarring on the fingers and palms, for example, often lead to fusion of the skin and the formation of what s known as a  mitten hand.  Siprashvili used a virus to deliver a corrected version of the type-7 collagen gene into batches of each patient s skin cells that had been harvested and grown in the laboratory. He coaxed these genetically corrected cells to form sheets of skin about the size of an iPhone 5. The sheets were then surgically grafted onto the patient s chronic or new wounds in six locations. The researchers tracked the status of the grafts at one-, three- and six-month intervals for at least a year, checking to see if they stayed in place and caused wound closure. They also looked for any evidence of an immune reaction to the grafts, and whether the grafts continued to make the corrected type-7 collagen protein. All 24 grafts were well-tolerated, the researchers found. Furthermore, they could detect expression of the type-7 collagen protein in the correct location of the skin in nine out of 10 tissue biopsies at three months. After 12 months, they were able to detect the collagen protein in five out of 12 biopsies. Wound healing Similar results were seen with wound healing. After three months, 21 of the 24 grafts were intact. This number dropped to 12 out of 24 after one year.  Even a small improvement in wound healing is a huge benefit to the overall health of these patients,  said Tang.  For example, it may reduce the likelihood of developing squamous cell carcinoma that often kills these patients in young adulthood.  Coupling grafts with hand surgery to break up scarred, fused tissue could help patients maintain the use of their hands, Marinkovich said. Tang, Marinkovich and their colleagues will continue to monitor the patients in the phase-1 trial throughout their lifetimes to assess any long-term effects of the grafts. The completion of the phase-1 trial and the potential to improve upon these outcomes is due to a concerted, long-term effort at Stanford to find ways to help young patients with this devastating disease. The researchers are now starting a phase-2 clinical trial and are looking for new patients. For more information, send an email to tangy@stanford.edu or mpm@stanford.edu.  This trial represents the culmination of two decades of dedicated clinical and basic science research at Stanford that began with the arrival of the former dean of the School of Medicine, Eugene Bauer, who set up the multidisciplinary EB Center at Stanford,  said Tang.  We have been working for a long time to get to this potential therapy into patients. We had to discover the genes and proteins involved and the responsible mutations.

However, these drugs don t work for all patients: If cells can repair the DNA damage, they may survive treatment. MIT researchers have now developed a way to test cells  ability to perform several different types of DNA repair, and to use that information to predict how tumors will respond to a particular drug. In a paper published in the journal Cancer Research, the researchers successfully predicted how difficult-to-treat brain tumors would respond to the first-line chemotherapy drug used in such cases. They made these predictions by analyzing four different DNA repair pathways in human tumor samples grown in mice.  Improving predictions is important because we want to get the right drug to the right patient. We also don t want to treat people with a drug that s not going to work. There are a lot of side effects and a lot of lost time where you could be using an alternative therapy,  says Zachary Nagel, a former MIT postdoc and the lead author of the study. The paper s senior author is Leona Samson, the Uncas and Helen Whitaker Professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and Biology. Other MIT authors include Doug Lauffenburger, head of the Department of Biological Engineering; Brian Joughin, a research scientist at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research; Isaac Chaim, a former graduate student; and Patrizia Mazzucato, a former technical assistant. Mayo Clinic researchers Jann Sarkaria, Gaspar Kitange, and Shiv Gupta are also authors. Modeling drug sensitivity When cells suffer DNA damage, there are several different pathways that can kick in to help repair it, depending on the type of damage. Cells from different people and different tumors vary greatly in their ability to repair DNA damage, and scientists have been pursuing measurements of this ability as a way to predict how patients will respond to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. In 2014, Samson, Nagel, and colleagues devised a new technique that allows them to rapidly measure four different DNA repair pathways at once. Using this method, they analyzed 24 genetically unique cultures of lymphoblastoid cells, a type of blood cell, taken from healthy people. Their measurements revealed a huge range of variability: In one repair system, some people s cells were 10 times more efficient than others. Next, the researchers wanted to determine if these measurements could help to predict how individual glioblastoma tumors would respond to treatment with temozolomide, which is usually the first drug given to glioblastoma patients, along with radiation treatment. However, temozolomide doesn t work for all patients, and resistance often develops in those for whom it initially works. Part of the reason why the researchers chose this type of cancer is that doctors currently use a test of one type of DNA repair, known as MGMT, to predict response to temozolomide. However, this test is not always accurate, so the MIT team set out to see if analyzing a larger number of repair pathways would generate better predictions. Based on the DNA repair data from the lymphoblastoid cells, plus information on how temozolomide treatment affects the cells  survival, Lauffenburger and Joughin worked with Nagel to devise a mathematical model that correlates cells  DNA repair ability with their sensitivity to the drug. The researchers then measured DNA repair capacity in 12 different glioblastoma tumor samples, including some that had not been previously exposed to temozolomide and some that had been treated and acquired resistance. Plugging this data into their model generated predictions for how each cell type would respond to the drug. The Mayo Clinic researchers, led by Sarkaria, implanted these human tumor cells into mice and then tracked how they responded to temozolomide treatment. The MIT team could then compare the model s predictions with the outcomes in mice. They found a much better correlation between the outcomes and predictions based on all four repair pathways, compared to predictions that used only MGMT data.  Measuring the capacity of these pathways just gives us a much stronger prediction,  Samson says. A generalizable approach Before this strategy could be used to guide patient treatment, more studies must be done in human tumor samples to see if the same correlation exists, the researchers say. The researchers believe that adding more DNA repair pathways into their model could help make their predictions even more accurate. They also plan to apply this approach to other drugs and other types of cancer.  Because DNA repair is a fundamental process in cells, we don t think this should be restricted to glioblastoma,  says Nagel, who is now an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  We think this is generalizable to other tissues and to other agents. ","Published: November 2, 2016"

See Also: Study investigates the significance of the vestibular system for optimization of motor coordination According to the study's lead authors, Prof. Jeff Hausdorff and Dr. Anat Mirelman, both of TAU's Sackler School of Medicine and TASMC's Center for the Study of Movement, Cognition and Mobility, the intervention combines the physical and cognitive aspects of walking, and could be implemented in gyms, rehabilitation centers and nursing homes to improve walking skills and prevent the falls of older adults and those with movement disorders like Parkinson's disease. ""Falls often start a vicious cycle with many negative health consequences,"" said Dr. Mirelman. ""The ability of older people to negotiate obstacles can be impaired because of age-related decline in cognitive abilities like motor planning, divided attention, executive control and judgement. But current interventions typically focus almost exclusively on improving muscle strength, balance and gait. ""Our approach helps improve both physical mobility and cognitive aspects that are important for safe walking,"" Dr. Mirelman continued. ""We found that virtual reality plus treadmill training helped to reduce fall frequency and fall risk for at least six months after training significantly more than treadmill training alone. This suggests that our use of virtual reality successfully targeted the cognitive aspects of safe ambulation to reduce the risk of falls."" Learn More: LocoMouse: Innovative tool sheds light on motor deficitsThe TAU-TASMC team, in collaboration with partners across Europe, collected data from 282 participants at five clinical sites in Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK between 2013 and 2015. The participants, all aged 60-90, were able to walk at least five minutes unassisted, were on stable medications and, critically, had reported at least two falls in the six months prior to the start of the study. Nearly half of all participants (130) had Parkinson's disease, and some (43) had mild cognitive impairment. Participants were assigned to treadmill training with virtual reality (146) or treadmill training alone (136). The virtual reality (VR) component consisted of a camera that captured the movement of participants' feet and projected it onto a screen in front of the treadmill, so that participants could ""see"" their feet walking on the screen in real time. The game-like simulation was designed to reduce the risk of falls in older adults by including real life challenges such as avoiding and stepping over obstacles like puddles or hurdles, and navigating pathways. It also provided motivation to the participants, giving them feedback on their performance and scores on the game. Related: Motor cortex shown to play active role in learning movement patterns While the incident rate of falls was similar in the two groups prior to the intervention, six months after training the rate of falls among those who trained with VR dropped by almost 50%. In contrast, there was no significant reduction in the fall rates among subjects who did not train with the VR. ""Interestingly, when we asked people if they enjoyed the treatment program, participants in the VR group reported higher scores on user satisfaction questionnaires and a greater desire to continue to exercise with the 'game,'"" said Prof. Hausdorff. ""This suggests that the virtual reality not only led to fewer falls, it was also more likely to be used in the long-term. Exercise needs to be fun and effective if it is going to be used continually. ""The biggest improvement was seen in participants with Parkinson's disease,"" Prof. Hausdorff continued. ""It was very exciting to see such improvement in the presence of a neurodegenerative disease. Still, we need to conduct further research to verify the results and better understand why the fall rates were so responsive in the people with Parkinson's disease.""

""It's a very robust phenomenon that you see from humans on Twitter to bacteria, and everything in between."" That's why Bargmann, Torsten N. Wiesel Professor and head of Rockefeller University's Lulu and Anthony Wang Laboratory of Neural Circuits and Behavior, and her coworkers set out to understand how animals are incorporating social information into their behavior. Their most recent study pinpoints genome variations that allow animals to use information about their competitors to modify their innate strategies for searching for food. These findings provide concrete evidence for game theory, which suggests, among other things, that population density changes how individuals act. See Also: NIH-funded study reveals how differences in male and female brains emerge in C. elegans In the study, Bargmann and her collaborators designed a series of experiments using Caenorhabditis elegans, a tiny roundworm with easily detectable habits. The worms interact with one another by secreting and sensing pheromones. ""The advantage to using a simple organism like C. elegans is that you can look at questions in great detail,"" Bargmann says. ""But some principles that emerge may apply to all species, including humans."" In the wild, C. elegans worms in the quest for food alternate between an exploratory behavior called roaming and a less active behavior called dwelling, where the worms essentially ""hunker down and eat,"" Bargmann says. By exploring the differences in the worms' behavior in various settings, the researchers found a new role for pheromones called ascarosides. These signaling molecules control behaviors like male sexual activity. (C. elegans are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, but some do have sex though worms tend to get lucky only once every 100 generations.) But Bargmann found the pheromone also seemed to help the animals modify their behaviors based on how many worms were nearby. With further experimental analysis, the scientists identified two distinct genetic variants that resulted in these sensitivity differences, suggesting that in crowded places, wild C. elegans populations with a specific genetic variation adopt different behaviors than those who don't. The variants that are insensitive make less of a key protein that senses ascarosides in their olfactory system than those that are sensitive. Learn More: Molecule induces lifesaving sleep in worms ""The big take home,"" Bargmann says, ""is that one of the ways behavior evolves is through the appearance of genetic changes that affect sensory capabilities. We have every reason to believe that human behaviors have been shaped in a similar way."" The findings also suggest that natural trait variations are the result of both environmental cues and genetic changes. For example, reptiles don't eat sugar, and have lost their sweet-tasting receptors during the course of evolution. But hummingbirds evolved from reptiles, and they can nevertheless taste sugar--meaning they had to evolve a brand new taste receptor. ""This is an evolutionary change in sensitivity, matched to diet,"" Bargmann says. ""We're seeing something similar in the C. elegans pheromone sensitivity as well."" Read Next: Tracking worm sex drive, neuron by neuronShe says, ""It may be that behavior is shaped in an ongoing way by variations in the genome that affect our sensitivity to the external world. There's so much more to learn about genetic variations that may lead to differences in behavior."" Either way, Bargmann says, ""The recognition that population density is a regulator of behavioral strategies may provoke thought about human behavior's links to its animal origins.""

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have various harmful long-term neurological effects, including problems with vision, coordination, memory, mood, and thinking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.), TBI from a head injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, and close to 5 million Americans soldiers and non-soldiers alike are currently living with a TBI-related disability. Current therapy for these patients involves supportive care and rehabilitation, but no treatments are available that can prevent the development of chronic neurological symptoms. See Also: Brain injury researchers find retrieval practice improves memory in youth with TBI Researchers from the University of Iowa believe they may have identified a potential approach for preventing the development of neurological problems associated with TBI. Their research in mice suggests that protecting axons prevents the long-term neuropsychiatric problems caused by blast-related traumatic brain injury. In a recent study, a University of Iowa (UI) team, led by Andrew Pieper, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry at the UI Carver College of Medicine, investigated whether early damage to axons an event that is strongly associated with many forms of brain injury, including blast-related TBI is simply a consequence of the injury or whether it is a driving cause of the subsequent neurological and psychiatric symptoms. To answer that question, the researchers used mice with a genetic mutation that protects axons from some forms of damage. The mutation works by maintaining normal levels of an important energy metabolite known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in brain cells after injury. Related: Among patients with TBI, maintaining higher hemoglobin concentration or receiving hormone EPO does not improve neurological outcomes When mice with the mutation experienced blast-mediated TBI, their axons were protected from damage, and they did not develop the vision problems or the thinking and movement difficulties that were seen when mice without the mutation experienced blast-related TBI. The findings were published Oct. 11 in the online journal eNeuro. ""Our work strongly suggests that early axonal injury appears to be a critical driver of neurobehavioral complications after blast-TBI,"" says Pieper, who also is a professor of neurology, radiation oncology, and a physician with the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Health Care System. ""Therefore, future therapeutic strategies targeted specifically at protecting or augmenting the health of axons may provide a uniquely beneficial approach for preventing these patients from developing neurologic symptoms after blast exposure."" In confirming the critical relationship between axon degeneration and development of subsequent neurological complication, the new study builds on previous work from Pieper's lab. The researchers also have discovered a series of neuroprotective compounds that appear to help axons survive the kind of early damage seen in TBI. Read Next: Impact of traumatic brain injury on long-term memory explored These compounds activate a molecular pathway that preserves neuronal levels of NAD, the energy metabolite that has been shown to be critical to the health of axons.

The research identifies a potentially serious public health concern. More than a third of the world s population lives in areas where dengue is endemic and cases of co-infection with Zika have already been reported. Conducted at York University s Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics using mathematical modelling, the research was led by Biao Tang, an exchange PhD student from Xi an Jiaotong University, in collaboration with York Professor Jianhong Wu and Tang s supervisor, Professor Yanni Xiao at Xi an Jiaotong University. As dengue and Zika are both part of the Flaviviridae family transmitted through a common mosquito host, the researchers wanted to know how vaccinating for one would affect the incidence of the other.  Vaccinating against one virus could not only affect the control of another virus, it could, in fact, make it easier for the other to spread,  says Wu.  Recent evidence suggests that dengue virus antibodies can enhance the Zika virus infection. For that reason, we developed a new math model to investigate the effect of dengue vaccination on Zika outbreaks.  The paper,  Implication of vaccination against dengue for Zika outbreak,  was published in Scientific Reports. The team s model shows that vaccinations for dengue increase the number of people contracting Zika. It also shows that the more people in a particular population that are vaccinated against dengue, the earlier and larger the Zika outbreak. The research also found that the most effective way to minimize the unintended effect of dengue vaccinations on Zika outbreaks is an integrated strategy that includes mosquito control.  We concluded that vaccination against dengue among humans can significantly boost Zika transmission among the population and hence call for further study on integrated control measures on controlling dengue and Zika outbreak,  says Xiao.","Published: November 1, 2016"

Most plant, animal, and human genomes are diploid - containing two variants from each gene. The strawberry genome contains eight nearly identical copies of each gene, making the accurate phasing of each something that has never been done before   until NRGene s DeNovoMAGICTM 3.0.  The octoploid, heterozygous strawberry genome was assembled using reads produced on Illumina sequencing technology and assembled by NRGene s cloud-based DeNovoMAGICTM 3.0 software package in only two weeks.  It s exciting to see how NRGene s analysis, combined with data from Illumina sequencers, can be used to quickly and affordably assemble complex genomes, like that of the strawberry,  said Ryan Rapp, Associate Director, Agrigenomics for Illumina.  We hope that this technology will make genomics accessible to agricultural researchers worldwide, helping to improve the food supply to make it more sustainable and efficient.  NRGene s DeNovoMAGICTM 3.0 delivers complete, highly accurate genome assemblies in the form of long, phased sequences using Illumina-based reads. As more genomes are generated, NRGene s PanMAGICTM is used to compare the complete genome sequences of multiple individual samples to capture the broad genomic diversity, better pinpointing positive traits across all varieties.  With the data from NRGene, strawberry breeders will be able to accelerate the release of better performing strawberry varieties, creating hardier, more disease-resistant varieties with longer shelf lives,  says Sachiko Isobe, head of the plant genomics and genetics laboratory at Japan s Kazusa DNA Research Institute. NRGene has delivered the first bread wheat, Emmer wheat, and durum wheat genomes; dozens of new maize, soybean, cotton, and canola genomes; and is delivering more accurate versions of previously mapped genomes built on older, more inefficient technologies.

Pollutants don t only harm children s developing lungs   they can actually cross the blood-brain barrier and permanently damage their developing brains   and, thus, their futures. No society can afford to ignore air pollution.  The satellite imagery confirms that around 2 billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution, caused by factors such as vehicle emissions, heavy use of fossil fuels, dust and burning of waste, exceeds minimum air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization. South Asia has the largest number of children living in these areas, at 620 million, with Africa following at 520 million children. The East Asia and Pacific region has 450 million children living in areas that exceed guideline limits. The study also examines the heavy toll of indoor pollution, commonly caused by use of fuels like coal and wood for cooking and heating, which mostly affects children in low-income, rural areas. Together, outdoor and indoor air pollution are directly linked to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases that account for almost one in 10 under-five deaths, making air pollution one of the leading dangers to children's health. Children are more susceptible than adults to both indoor and outdoor air pollution as their lungs, brains and immune systems are still developing and their respiratory tracts are more permeable. Young children also breathe faster than adults, and take in more air relative to their body weight. The most disadvantaged, who already tend to have poorer health and inadequate access to health services, are the most vulnerable to the illnesses caused by polluted air. UNICEF is asking world leaders attending COP 22 to take four urgent steps in their countries to protect children from air pollution.   Reduce pollution: All countries should work to meet WHO global air quality guidelines to enhance the safety and wellbeing of children. To achieve this, governments should adopt such measures as cutting back on fossil fuel combustion and investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.    Increase children s access to healthcare: Investing in children s overall healthcare   including immunisation campaigns and improving knowledge, community management and numbers seeking care for pneumonia (a leading killer of children under five) - will improve their resilience to air pollution and their ability to recover from diseases and conditions linked to it.    Minimize children s exposure: Sources of pollution such as factories should not be located within the vicinity of schools and playgrounds. Better waste management can reduce the amount of waste that is burned within communities. Cleaner cookstoves can help improve air quality within homes. Reducing air pollution overall can help lower children s exposure.    Monitor air pollution: Better monitoring has been proven to help children, youth, families and communities to reduce their exposure to air pollution, become more informed about its causes, and advocate for changes that make the air safer to breathe.   We protect our children when we protect the quality of our air. Both are central to our future,  Lake said. UNICEF is advocating for lower levels of air pollution, while also working on the ground to protect children from its effects. For example, the children s organisation backs the development, distribution and use of cleaner cookstoves in Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and other countries, and works through some of its country programmes to reduce the impact of outdoor air pollution on children s health. It also supports programmes to increase children s access to quality healthcare and to vaccinate them against conditions like pneumonia.","Published: November 1, 2016"

Technology has come a long way since the human genome was first mapped more than 15 years ago, but many cancer patients are still being treated with a one-size-fits-all approach that may not fit the specific molecular composition of their cancer,  said Eric Lefkofsky, co-founder and CEO of Tempus.  At Tempus, we have built an operating system to battle cancer that puts technology and analytics into the hands of physicians so they can create a customized and precise treatment plan for each patient.  The Rush University Cancer Center comprises all cancer-related clinical, research and educational efforts at Rush, crossing 20 departments, divisions and sections; inpatient and outpatient areas; professional clinical activities; and the colleges of Rush University. Rush, which serves both adults and children with cancer, is home to The Coleman Foundation Comprehensive Clinics, which applies a team approach to patient care.  As the cost to gather molecular data has come down over time, it s more important than ever that our physicians are armed with the most relevant and state-of-the art tools that they need to do their job,  said Dr. Ranga Krishnan, Dean of Rush Medical College, and Senior Vice President at Rush.  At Rush, we are committed to innovation and, through our partnership with Tempus, we expect to be able to usher in an unprecedented era of advancement as it relates to doing what is and has always been first and foremost at Rush   caring for our patients.   In personalized cancer care we learn about a person s genetic makeup and how his or her tumor grows, then use this data to try to find prevention, screening, and treatment strategies that may be more effective for each individual,  said Dr. Robert DeCresce, acting director of the Rush Cancer Center.  This approach also enables us to find treatments that cause fewer side effects than the standard options. By performing genetic tests on the cancer cells and on normal cells, we may be able to customize treatment to each patient s needs.  Tempus provides sequencing and analysis for top academic centers, hospital systems, associations, and health care providers. Utilizing machine learning and advanced bioinformatics, Tempus helps physicians analyze these newly amassed data sets in a search for potentially relevant patterns for patients that are unlikely to respond to conventional therapies. The company has recruited a world-class team of accomplished geneticists, computational biologists, data scientists and software engineers who have developed the software and analytic tools that form the foundation of an operating system to battle cancer. Tempus has forged partnerships with leading institutions, including Northwestern s Lurie Cancer Center, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, and the University of Michigan.","Published: November 1, 2016"

Previous research suggested a link between mitochondrial functional defects and ASD, but those studies included small sample sizes and could not verify whether the cause was genetic or environmental. The current study, published online Oct. 28 in the journal PLOS Genetics, analyzed mtDNA in 903 families, where the researchers compared the mtDNA of an affected child and an unaffected sibling and their mother. They found that in instances when the children had both mutant and normal mtDNA in a single cell, called heteroplasmy, all the children showed similar numbers of mutant mtDNA, but the autistic children had more than twice as many harmful mtDNA mutations compared to their non-autistic siblings.  When we compared the inheritance between the mother and the children, we confirmed this particular pattern, which is the child with autism inherited more bad mutations than their siblings during the process of passing mitochondrial DNA from mother to children,  said Zhenglong Gu, associate professor of nutritional sciences and the paper s senior author.  We show not only that mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy is associated with autism, but also, among autistic kids, these pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations are significantly associated with intellectual disability, and other neurological and developmental defects,  said Yiqin Wang, a graduate student in Gu s lab and the paper s first author. The current findings may lead to better diagnosis and treatment of children with a sub-type of autism caused by pathogenic mtDNA mutations. Analyzing mtDNA could help diagnose some forms of autism in the future. Interventions restoring mitochondrial function might also be useful for treatment, Gu said. These findings also have relevance for other childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, which may be caused by disease-causing mtDNA mutations and is a subject for future work, he said. Most human cells carry two copies of nuclear DNA, one copy from each parent, and hundreds of copies of mtDNA, which exist in an organelle called the mitochondrion, where most of a cell s energy is created. Aside from the nuclear genome that resides in the cell s nucleus, the mitochondrion is the only organelle that contains DNA. Compared to nuclear DNA, mtDNA is known to mutate rapidly, which has prompted Gu to look for age-related diseases and pediatric diseases linked to these mutations. During egg production, there is a dramatic reduction in the numbers of copies of mtDNA, as a way of eliminating bad mutations passed from mother to child. But some bad mutations still pass to the next generation, and the number of pathogenic mtDNA in children may be affected by the mother s environment or physiology, Gu said.  Does the mother have inflammation or diabetes, or is she obese?  Gu said.  These things could make the process of cleaning up mutations less efficient. This could give us some insight into why autism is rising,  and will be a subject for future studies, Gu said.","Published: November 1, 2016"

The research helps explain the diversity of dementias linked to tau protein aggregation, which destroys brain cells of patients with Alzheimer s and other neurodegenerative syndromes. The study also has implications for earlier and more accurate diagnoses of various dementias through definition of the unique forms of tau associated with each.  In addition to providing a framework to understand why patients develop different types of neurodegeneration, this work has promise for the development of drugs to treat specific neurodegenerative diseases, and for how to accurately diagnose them. The findings indicate that a one-size-fits-all strategy for therapy may not work, and that we have to approach clinical trials and drug development with an awareness of which forms of tau we are targeting,  said study author Dr. Marc Diamond, founding Director of the Center for Alzheimer s and Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Professor of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics with the O Donnell Brain Institute at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Researchers used special cell systems to replicate distinct tau aggregate conformations. These different forms of pathological tau were then inoculated into the brains of mice. Each form created different pathological patterns, recapitulating the variation that occurs in diseases such as Alzheimer s, frontotemporal dementias, and traumatic encephalopathy. The different forms of tau caused pathology that spread at different rates through the brain, and affected specific brain regions. This experiment demonstrated that the structure of pathological tau aggregates alone is sufficient to account for most if not all the variation seen in human neurodegenerative diseases that are linked to this protein. The finding, published in Neuron, could have a notable impact on widespread efforts at the O Donnell Brain Institute and elsewhere to develop treatments that eliminate tau and other toxic proteins from the brains of dementia patients.  The challenge for us now is to figure out how to rapidly and efficiently determine the forms of tau that are present in individual patients, and simultaneously, to develop specific therapies. This work says that it should be possible to predict patterns of disease in patients and responses to therapy based on knowledge of tau aggregate structure,  said Dr. Diamond, who holds the Distinguished Chair in Basic Brain Injury and Repair. Dr. Diamond s lab, at the forefront of many notable findings relating to tau, had previously determined that tau acts like a prion   an infectious protein that can self-replicate and spread like a virus through the brain. The lab has determined that tau protein in human brain can form many distinct strains, or self-replicating structures, and developed methods to reproduce them in the laboratory. This research led Dr. Diamond s team to the latest study to test whether these strains might account for different forms of dementia. To make this link, 18 distinct tau aggregate strains were replicated in the lab from human neurodegenerative disease brain samples, or were created from mouse models or other artificial sources. Researchers inoculated the strains into different brain regions of mice and found striking differences among them. While some strains had far reaching and rapid effects, others replicated only in limited parts of the brain, or caused widespread disease but did so very slowly. This surprising result answered a fundamental question that has dogged the field of neurodegenerative disease: Why are brain regions vulnerable in certain cases but not others, and why do some diseases progress more rapidly than others? For instance, in Alzheimer s disease, problems begin in brain memory centers before spreading to other areas that control functions such as language. Conversely, due to initial degeneration of frontal and temporal brain regions in frontotemporal dementia, the memory centers are relatively spared, and patients often first show changes in personality and behavior. The new study implies that with knowledge of tau aggregate structure in patients, or possibly even in healthy individuals, it should be possible to predict the brain regions most vulnerable to degeneration and the rate of disease progression.","Published: November 1, 2016"

The gene therapy involved inserting a functional copy of the NPC1 gene into mice with the disease; the treated animals were then found to have less severe NPC1 symptoms. The study, led by researchers at NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, was published Oct. 26, 2016, in the journal Human Molecular Genetics. Niemann-Pick disease is a rare and fatal disorder of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) that has no cure. The disease occurs when a faulty housekeeping gene fails to remove cell waste, like lipids and cholesterol. The accumulation of waste in the spleen, liver and brain causes progressive deterioration in the intellectual and motor functions. It also shortens patient's lives, as people with Niemann-Pick disease typically die in their teens. There are several types of Niemann-Pick disease; this study focused on mice that had been bred with a faulty NPC1 gene to model Niemann-Pick disease, type C1.   The researchers' goal was to correct the faulty NPC1 gene in as many cells and organs as possible, with a strong focus on the brain. To do this, they used a non-disease-causing virus called the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) to transfer functioning NPC1 to the cells. The AAV9 containing a functioning NPC1 gene successfully crossed the blood-brain barrier, reaching cells in the brain and elsewhere. Once inside cells, the normal NPC1 gene was then able to make the functional NPC1 protein to correct the cell defects.  With a single injection, mice showed improvements in motor coordination, weight gain and longevity compared to those without this gene therapy. The effect of gene therapy equaled that of a drug called VTS-270, which has been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies at numerous academic labs. However, to be effective, the VTS-270 compound has to be given for the life of the mouse. The team is now investigating if a combination of the two therapies will improve results. ""We're very encouraged by this preliminary work,"" said William J. Pavan, Ph.D., senior investigator in the NHGRI Genetic Disease Research Branch. ""The gene therapy is treating the root of the problem, the defective gene."" ""Our work in NPC1 mice may help lead to human clinical trials and eventually FDA approval for gene therapy as a treatment for NPC1 disease,"" said Charles P. Venditti, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator in the NHGRI Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch.

Just as a conventional army will be made up of different types of soldiers, each with a particular role, so each of these immune cells has a specific function. Among these cells are cytotoxic T-cells    killer T-cells , whose primary function is to patrol our bodies, programmed to identify and destroy infected or cancerous cells. Scientists are now trying to harness these cells as a way to fight cancer, by growing T-cells programmed to recognise cancer cells in the laboratory in large numbers and then reintroducing them into the body to destroy the tumour   an approach known as adoptive T-cell immunotherapy. However, this approach has been hindered by the fact that killer T-cells are short-lived   most killer T cells are gone within three days of transfer   so the army may have died out before it has managed to rid the body of the tumour. Now, an international team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge has identified a way of increasing the life-span of these T-cells, a discovery that could help scientists overcome one of the key hurdles preventing progress in immunotherapy. In a paper published today in the journal Nature, the researchers have identified a new role for a molecule known as 2-hydroxyglutarate, or 2-HG, which is known to trigger abnormal growth in tumour cells. In fact, the team has shown that a slightly different form of the molecule also plays a normal, but critical, role in T-cell function: it can influence T-cells to reside in a 'memory state .  This is a state where the cells can renew themselves, persist for a very long period, and re-activate to combat infection or cancer. The researchers found that by increasing the levels of 2-HG in the T-cells, the researchers could generate cells that could much more effectively destroy tumours. Rather than expiring shortly after reintroduction, the memory state T-cells were able to persist for much longer, destroying tumour cells more effectively.  In a sense, this means that rather than creating killer T-cells that are active from the start, but burn out very quickly, we are creating an army of  renewable cells  that can stay quiet for a long time, but will go into action when necessary and fight tumour cells,  says Professor Randall Johnson, Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology, Development & Neuroscience, University of Cambridge.  So, with a fairly trivial treatment of T-cells, we re able to change a moderate response to tumour growth to a much stronger response, potentially giving people a more permanent immunity to the tumours they are carrying. This could make immunotherapy for cancer much more effective. ","Published: November 1, 2016"

Its actions help explain how high-fat diets, stress and certain steroid medications cause obesity. The new findings were published Oct. 25 in Science Signaling. Around the body, fat depots contain many mature fat cells and small numbers of stem cells. These stem cells can differentiate into more fat cells, but until now, no one has known how the process was triggered. The new research shows that mature fat cells make a hormone called Adamts1 that toggles the switch controlling whether nearby stem cells differentiate and prepare to store fat. High-fat diets and glucocorticoid medications change Adamts1 production, telling nearby stem cells to begin maturing, the research found.  Intuitively, people understand that when you eat more, you get fatter,  said Brian Feldman, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics and the study s senior author.  You re ingesting food, and some signal has to tell your body to make more fat. We didn t know what was gating or triggering that process in vivo. This new research goes a long way to fill in the in-between steps.  The paper s lead author is postdoctoral scholar Janica Wong, PhD. In recent decades, scientists around the world have debunked the idea that fat cells are passive bags of calories. In addition to their storage function, mature fat cells are now known to send and receive many hormonal signals that help regulate metabolism.  Experiment with fat cells To identify the role of Adamts1 and understand how it works, Feldman s team conducted a series of experiments using fat cells and their precursors in a dish, followed by studies in mice and humans. They started their search by looking for genes that change activity in response to glucocorticoid medications. These medications, which include prednisone and dexamethasone, have the serious, negative side effects of promoting obesity and diabetes. The scientists wanted to understand how. Among their findings:   Experiments using fat tissue from mice showed that mature fat cells normally make and secrete Adamts1. Its levels drop when mice are given glucocorticoids.   Mice that are genetically engineered to make more Adamts1 than normal have smaller-than-normal fat depots, and fewer mature fat cells.   When purified Adamts1 is added to fat stem cells in a dish, it can block glucocorticoid-induced differentiation, suggesting that it normally acts as an extracellular signal.   Once it reaches the fat stem cell, Adamts1 transmits its message through a set of intracellular signals that overlap with the cells  glucocorticoid response pathway. A cell-signaling molecule called pleiotrophin plays an important role in the pathway; blocking the molecule s signal blocks the stem cell s entire response to Adamts1. Finally, after gathering this evidence that Adamts1 is a hormone, and that it plays a big role in controlling whether fat stem cells differentiate, the researchers fed high-fat diets to mice and humans and examined how this affected the Adamts1 signal. As expected, mice became fatter after eating a high-fat diet, with new fat cells maturing mostly in the animals  visceral fat tissue, the fat located around internal organs. The mice had decreased Adamts1 in this type of fat tissue. In subcutaneous fat tissue, the fat under the skin, the opposite response was seen: there was more Adamts1 production and less fat cell maturation. These findings are consistent with earlier research showing that more visceral, but not more subcutaneous, fat cells mature when someone eats a high-fat diet, and suggest that Adamts1 is a major regulator of this difference between the two types of fat. In humans who gained weight while eating a high-fat diet, the research team saw that the Adamts1 responses were consistent with what was seen in mice. The effect of stress hormones The results suggest how both high-fat diets and synthetic and natural stress hormones are tied to greater obesity. Stress hormones send a message via Adamts1 to make more fat cells mature.  We think it is a signal that there may be hard times ahead, a trigger to store as much available energy as you can,  Feldman said. And the same set of signals works when people eat a high-fat diet but are not stressed or taking glucocorticoid medications, he added.  We ve basically seen that the glucocorticoid signal is embedded in the high-fat feeding pathway. Connecting those dots together was really exciting.  The study s results do not exclude the possibility that other, undiscovered hormones also influence fat cells  decision to mature; however, Adamts1 is probably one of the most important, Feldman said.  There may be a group of regulators, but the potency of Adamts1 suggests it s a dominant signal, a major player,  he said. The scientists still have many questions left to answer about Adamts1, including whether it might somehow be used as a target for anti-obesity drugs.  That won t be a simple answer,  Feldman said.  If you block fat formation, extra calories have to go somewhere in the body, and sending them somewhere else outside fat cells could be more detrimental to metabolism. We know from other researchers  work that liver and muscle are both bad places to store fat, for example. We do think there are going to be opportunities for new treatments based on our discoveries, but not by simply blocking fat formation alone.  The results could also help scientists understand how fat formation in childhood influences lifelong obesity risk, Feldman said.  We know that fat is a critical endocrine organ, formed almost exclusively during childhood,  he said.  The rate of fat formation in childhood has lifelong implications, and understanding how that s controlled and regulated is very important. ","Published: November 1, 2016"

Their role in each physiological process   good or bad   is typically determined by binding to one or more other proteins. So, as researchers try to figure out why the enzyme PP2A is implicated in many cancers, a new study provides a potentially significant break in the case. It identifies 98 proteins that are very likely to bind with PP2A, making them potential partners in crime worth investigating. The discovery is the result of a detailed study of PP2A s structure down to the atomic level by a team of four scientists at Brown University and one in Leuven, Belgium. By determining exactly how PP2A physically binds with other proteins, the scientists were able to figure out which other proteins are a strong fit. Most of the proteins on the list are news to the biological community. Moreover, the study data could help scientists to predict how strongly each protein, or  substrate  binds PP2A. It could also offer clues on how to prevent a binding if it turns out to be disease-causing, for instance because it misregulates a process in a cell.  PP2A is a very important enzyme, but identifying its substrates and its regulators has been exceptionally difficult and part of the reason is we didn t understand how they were engaging with this protein,  said corresponding author Rebecca Page, a Professor of molecular biology, cellular biology and biochemistry at Brown University and corresponding author of the paper in the journal Structure. Binding findings Brown graduate student Xinru Wang and postdoctoral researcher Rakhi Bajaj led the effort to find PP2A s closest binding partners. Their main strategy was to bind the regulatory subunit of PP2A, called B56, with three shortened versions of two proteins already known to be associated:  BubR1  and  RepoMan.  They made each of those protein complexes into crystals, which can be analyzed in atomic detail using X-rays. This procedure gave them a close look at which key binding interactions were consistent and which other interactions made each union unique.  The similarities were the common features that we used to identify additional PP2A interactors,  Wang said. And, Page added,  The differences between RepoMan and BubR1 was what allowed us to explain why the binding affinities were different and how different PP2A regulators might be competing in the cell.  One of the key similarities they observed, for example, was that PP2A has two distinct pockets at a key location on its surface where other proteins can dock if they have the right protrusions. A key difference they noticed is that RepoMan s binding is much stronger than that of BubR1 and they could discern structurally why that was   RepoMan builds an extra  salt bridge  to solidify its connection. Making a list The researchers used these observations and others made from studying the three crystallized bindings to guide a search of databases of human proteins. By looking for specific amino acid sequences in proteins the scientists were able to tell how well they might fold up and bind to PP2A. Page said that with conservative criteria   looking only for the best and most likely matches   they found 98 proteins with strong likelihoods. A few of them were already known to associate with PP2A   confirming that the approach makes sense  but many more are novel. Biologists can now study and tinker with the newly identified proteins to see whether any of them conspire with PP2A to throw processes such as cell division out of whack, leading to tumor growth, Page said.  These new proteins provide targets that we can now go investigate in detail in cells to see what consequences changing these sequences have on their activity,  she said. The team has already seen some potential links in their new data to cancer, Bajaj said. For example, a mutation that replaces amino acid Histidine 243 on PP2A-B56 is found in germ cell tumors (called Embryonal carcinoma). The data might help explain why. The team saw that this amino acid makes particularly important contacts in PP2A binding to its partners.","Published: November 1, 2016"

Add a debilitating disease-causing gene mutation.  In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Shinya Yamanaka, MD, PhD, who first created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and his colleagues at the Gladstone Institutes found a way to increase the efficiency of stem cell reprogramming through research on a rare genetic disease. iPSCs stem cells created from skin cells that can be transformed into any type of cell in the body revolutionized biomedical science. They have contributed to breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and drug discovery, surpassing what researchers once thought possible. But like any new technology, there is room for improvement. For example, using existing techniques, fewer than one percent of adult skin cells are reprogrammed into iPSCs.   Inefficiency in creating iPSCs is a major roadblock toward applying this technology to biomedicine,  said Yamanaka, a senior investigator at Gladstone and director of the Center for iPSC Research and Application (CiRA) in Japan.  Our study identified a surprising way to increase the number of iPSCs that we can generate.  The scientists started with a very different goal: to create a cellular model to study fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). This extremely rare genetic disease causes muscle, tendons, and ligaments to turn into bone, earning it the nickname  stone man syndrome.  It is caused by a mutation in the ACVR1 gene, which over-activates a cellular signaling process that is important for embryo development and involves a protein called BMP. Surprisingly, the scientists discovered that they could create more iPSCs from cells taken from FOP patients than those taken from healthy individuals. They believe this is because BMP signaling enhances cell renewal a cell s ability to replicate and keeps them in a pluripotent state, able to turn into any type of cell. These two traits are key characteristics of stem cells. To confirm their hunch, the researchers prevented BMP signaling, which resulted in fewer iPSCs being generated from FOP patients  cells. Conversely, activating the signaling pathway yielded more iPSCs.  Originally, we wanted to establish a disease model for FOP that might help us understand how specific gene mutations affect bone formation,  said first author Yohei Hayashi, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar with Yamanaka's laboratory.  We were surprised to learn that cells from patients with FOP reprogrammed much more efficiently than cells from healthy patients. We think this may be because the same pathway that causes bone cells to proliferate also helps stem cells to regenerate.   This is the first reported case showing that a naturally occurring genetic mutation improves the efficiency of iPSC generation,  added co-author Bruce Conklin, MD, a senior investigator at Gladstone.  Creating iPSCs from patient cells carrying genetic mutations is not only useful for disease modeling, but can also offer new insights into the reprogramming process. ","Published: November 1, 2016"

Already they have been demonstrated to influence the differentiation of stem cells, incite immune attacks on cancer cells, and weaken tumors  resistance to chemotherapy, but as of yet, hydrogels have mostly been useful for controlling groups of cells at large rather than individual cells. For example, alginate capsules filled with hundreds of pancreatic islet cells can be implanted in diabetic patients. However, these capsules are millimeters in size and eventually become surrounded by thick scar tissue that blocks the biological signals of islet cells and renders the implant ineffective. Now, thanks to the joint efforts of a team from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), a new and highly effective microfluidic method for encapsulating single cells in microscale hydrogels sets the stage for a dramatic increase in the specificity of control that can be exerted upon cells and their ability to survive implantation. The research was reported October 31 in the scientific journal Nature Materials.   There s been a tremendous amount of work to try and understand how biomaterials can determine cell function and fate, but the majority of that work has been done in populations of cells,  said David Mooney, Ph.D., a Wyss Core Faculty member and the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS, who is the corresponding author on the new study.  With this work, we take everything we have learned and take it down to the single cell level, enabling us to influence cell behavior on a whole different scale.  Mooney teamed with fellow Wyss Core Faculty member David Weitz, Ph.D., who is the Mallingkrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Sciences at Harvard University and SEAS and who is co-author on the study, to achieve the novel microfluidic-based method for encapsulating single cells within microgel capsules. The co-first authors on the study are Angelo Mao, a graduate researcher at Wyss and SEAS, and Jae-Won Shin, Ph.D., who was formerly a Wyss Institute Postdoctoral Fellow and is currently Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Bioengineering at University of Illinois at Chicago.  This is an exciting and important extension of cell-based biomaterials to the level of single cells, which can then serve both as a precise building block for larger cell structures and as a means of investigating the behavior at the level of single cells, providing unprecedented insight into cell function and properties,  said Weitz.","Published: November 1, 2016"

The company s breath analysis technology will be deployed in an ongoing study led by Imperial College to evaluate underlying causes of exacerbations in severe asthma patients.   An estimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, with 250,000 annual deaths attributed to the disease. The fundamental causes of asthma are not completely understood, however the strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to allergens and irritants including respiratory infections. Predicting and characterising patients who are likely to have an exacerbation despite optimal therapy is a critical step towards guiding patient management and improving outcomes for severe asthma sufferers. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath have been shown to correlate to inflammatory subtypes in asthma, and can also discriminate between viral and bacterial infection, which are extremely relevant in treatment optimization. Owlstone Medical uses the Respiration Collector for In Vitro Analysis (ReCIVA), in combination with the Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer (FAIMS) sensor platform, to accurately and selectively detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath. Commenting on the study, Fan Chung, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at Imperial College Faculty of Medicine said:  The causes of the exacerbations that occur in those suffering from severe asthma remain a mystery; elucidating these will represent a major advance that could lead to preventive measures and better targeted treatments.   VOCs analysis of exacerbations will enable a more rapid translation towards point of care analysis and correct treatment of patients,  added Ian Adcock, Professor of Respiratory Cell & Molecular Biology at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College Billy Boyle, co-founder and CEO at Owlstone Medical, said:  Characterising asthma exacerbations and predicting how patients will respond in certain situations will lead to improved treatment regimes, reduced hospital admissions and emergency treatments, and improved quality of life for asthma patients. Owlstone Medical was created specifically to advance our disease breathalyzer and we will be providing both clinical and academic researchers and pharma companies with access to our technology as part of our services offering, to enable the development of more effective treatments and ultimately better patient outcomes.

This is one of the first demonstrations of engineering electronic systems into plants, an approach that the researchers call  plant nanobionics.   The goal of plant nanobionics is to introduce nanoparticles into the plant to give it non-native functions,  says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and the leader of the research team. In this case, the plants were designed to detect chemical compounds known as nitroaromatics, which are often used in landmines and other explosives. When one of these chemicals is present in the groundwater sampled naturally by the plant, carbon nanotubes embedded in the plant leaves emit a fluorescent signal that can be read with an infrared camera. The camera can be attached to a small computer similar to a smartphone, which then sends an email to the user.  This is a novel demonstration of how we have overcome the plant/human communication barrier,  says Strano, who believes plant power could also be harnessed to warn of pollutants and environmental conditions such as drought. Strano is the senior author of a paper describing the nanobionic plants in the Oct. 31 issue of Nature Materials. The paper s lead authors are Min Hao Wong, an MIT graduate student who has started a company called Plantea to further develop this technology, and Juan Pablo Giraldo, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of California at Riverside. Environmental monitoring Two years ago, in the first demonstration of plant nanobionics, Strano and former MIT postdoc Juan Pablo Giraldo used nanoparticles to enhance plants  photosynthesis ability and to turn them into sensors for nitric oxide, a pollutant produced by combustion. Plants are ideally suited for monitoring the environment because they already take in a lot of information from their surroundings, Strano says.  Plants are very good analytical chemists,  he says.  They have an extensive root network in the soil, are constantly sampling groundwater, and have a way to self-power the transport of that water up into the leaves.  Strano s lab has previously developed carbon nanotubes that can be used as sensors to detect a wide range of molecules, including hydrogen peroxide, the explosive TNT, and the nerve gas sarin. When the target molecule binds to a polymer wrapped around the nanotube, it alters the tube s fluorescence. In the new study, the researchers embedded sensors for nitroaromatic compounds into the leaves of spinach plants. Using a technique called vascular infusion, which involves applying a solution of nanoparticles to the underside of the leaf, they placed the sensors into a leaf layer known as the mesophyll, which is where most photosynthesis takes place. They also embedded carbon nanotubes that emit a constant fluorescent signal that serves as a reference. This allows the researchers to compare the two fluorescent signals, making it easier to determine if the explosive sensor has detected anything. If there are any explosive molecules in the groundwater, it takes about 10 minutes for the plant to draw them up into the leaves, where they encounter the detector. To read the signal, the researchers shine a laser onto the leaf, prompting the nanotubes in the leaf to emit near-infrared fluorescent light. This can be detected with a small infrared camera connected to a Raspberry Pi, a $35 credit-card-sized computer similar to the computer inside a smartphone. The signal could also be detected with a smartphone by removing the infrared filter that most camera phones have, the researchers say.  This setup could be replaced by a cell phone and the right kind of camera,  Strano says.  It s just the infrared filter that would stop you from using your cell phone.  Using this setup, the researchers can pick up a signal from about 1 meter away from the plant, and they are now working on increasing that distance. Michael McAlpine, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota, says this approach holds great potential for engineering not only sensors but many other kinds of bionic plants that might receive radio signals or change color.  When you have manmade materials infiltrated into a living organism, you can have plants do things that plants don t ordinarily do,  says McAlpine, who was not involved in the research.  Once you start to think of living organisms like plants as biomaterials that can be combined with electronic materials, this is all possible.   A wealth of information  In the 2014 plant nanobionics study, Strano s lab worked with a common laboratory plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the researchers wanted to use common spinach plants for the latest study, to demonstrate the versatility of this technique.  You can apply these techniques with any living plant,  Strano says. So far, the researchers have also engineered spinach plants that can detect dopamine, which influences plant root growth, and they are now working on additional sensors, including some that track the chemicals plants use to convey information within their own tissues.  Plants are very environmentally responsive,  Strano says.  They know that there is going to be a drought long before we do. They can detect small changes in the properties of soil and water potential. If we tap into those chemical signaling pathways, there is a wealth of information to access.  These sensors could also help botanists learn more about the inner workings of plants, monitor plant health, and maximize the yield of rare compounds synthesized by plants such as the Madagascar periwinkle, which produces drugs used to treat cancer.  These sensors give real-time information from the plant. It is almost like having the plant talk to us about the environment they are in,  Wong says.  In the case of precision agriculture, having such information can directly affect yield and margins. ","Published: November 1, 2016"

But most skin grafts for severe burns require a donor, and for large or complicated injury sites, a full thickness skin graft is hard to come by. Split thickness skin grafts that use tissue from the patient may be a solution but not by themselves. By combining the graft technique with a specially engineered sheet of stem cells, researchers from Michigan Tech and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China demonstrate an improved skin graft process. Their work, published this week in Theranostics, focuses on creating engineered tissue that maximizes a body's natural healing power. Vascularized Tissue Veins, arteries and capillaries move oxygen and nutrients to tissue and the lymphatic system removes waste vascularized tissue is crosscut with many of these tiny tubes. Healing burn wounds then is not only about regrowing skin, but also about making sure these vascular systems are hooked up. The more vasculature, the more healing can happen. Feng Zhao, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Michigan Tech, works on creating engineered tissues that are pre-vascularized. In other words, the tissue gets a head start on the healing process. This is key when coupling the technology with split thickness skin grafts, or STSG for short.   ""STSG can be used under unfavorable conditions, such as a recipient's wound having moderate infection or less vasculature, where full thickness skin grafts would fail,"" Zhao says. ""However, STSG are more fragile than full thickness skin grafts and can contract significantly during the healing process."" To help prevent graft contraction and encourage early vascularization to improve wound repair, Zhao and her team turned to the most basic of cells.  Engineering Stem Cell Sheets Stem cells are unique because of their potential. Unlike neurons in a brain or beta cells in a liver, stem cells lack a defining cellular purpose. In terms of healing, this means they can adapt to their surroundings; when modified to increase vascularization, they can do wonders.  The team's transplantation in a rat model showed promising results. Not only did the implantations show less contracted and puckered skin, but also less cellular inflammation and a thinner outer skin (epidermal) thickness along with more robust blood micro-circulation in the skin tissue. The combined STSG and stem cell sheet grafts also preserved features like hair follicles and sebaceous glands that secrete a lubricating oil for skin and hair. The team attributes the success to the vascularized stem cell sheet's elevated levels of growth factors and proteins called cytokines used in healing tissue. ""The engineered stem cell sheet will overcome the limitation of current treatments for extensive and severe wounds, such as for acute burn injuries,"" Zhao says, ""and significantly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from burns."" Next Steps The greatest challenge is that both STSG and the stem cell sheets are fragile and difficult to harvest. Zhao says it will be crucial to improve the mechanical properties of the cell sheets and develop technology to more easily harvest them. ""We have seen excellent therapeutic effects of the vascularized stem cell sheet in healing full skin wounds.  However, the underlying mechanism needs to be further elucidated,"" she says.  ""We also need to conduct large animal experiments, such as in pigs, which are closer to human physiology."" Zhao plans to build off these early promising results to do just that. The work is more than skin deep vascularized tissue is about connection.","Published: November 1, 2016"

Technology has come a long way since the human genome was first mapped more than 15 years ago, but many cancer patients are still being treated with a one-size-fits-all approach that may not fit the specific molecular composition of their cancer,  said Eric Lefkofsky, co-founder and CEO of Tempus.  At Tempus, we have built an operating system to battle cancer that puts technology and analytics into the hands of physicians so they can create a customized and precise treatment plan for each patient.  The Rush University Cancer Center comprises all cancer-related clinical, research and educational efforts at Rush, crossing 20 departments, divisions and sections; inpatient and outpatient areas; professional clinical activities; and the colleges of Rush University. Rush, which serves both adults and children with cancer, is home to The Coleman Foundation Comprehensive Clinics, which applies a team approach to patient care.  As the cost to gather molecular data has come down over time, it s more important than ever that our physicians are armed with the most relevant and state-of-the art tools that they need to do their job,  said Dr. Ranga Krishnan, Dean of Rush Medical College, and Senior Vice President at Rush.  At Rush, we are committed to innovation and, through our partnership with Tempus, we expect to be able to usher in an unprecedented era of advancement as it relates to doing what is and has always been first and foremost at Rush   caring for our patients.   In personalized cancer care we learn about a person s genetic makeup and how his or her tumor grows, then use this data to try to find prevention, screening, and treatment strategies that may be more effective for each individual,  said Dr. Robert DeCresce, acting director of the Rush Cancer Center.  This approach also enables us to find treatments that cause fewer side effects than the standard options. By performing genetic tests on the cancer cells and on normal cells, we may be able to customize treatment to each patient s needs.  Tempus provides sequencing and analysis for top academic centers, hospital systems, associations, and health care providers. Utilizing machine learning and advanced bioinformatics, Tempus helps physicians analyze these newly amassed data sets in a search for potentially relevant patterns for patients that are unlikely to respond to conventional therapies. The company has recruited a world-class team of accomplished geneticists, computational biologists, data scientists and software engineers who have developed the software and analytic tools that form the foundation of an operating system to battle cancer.

Laboratories and clinicians will now have the ability to use a single test to detect microorganisms responsible for Bacterial Vaginosis (BV), Trichomoniasis (TV) and Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), also known as a yeast infection, which are the most common infectious causes of vaginitis.1,2,3 The new in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay is the first multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay authorized by FDA for the diagnosis of both vaginitis and vaginosis in women that exhibit symptoms of vaginal infections. BV diagnosis is challenging, as it is caused by bacterial imbalances in the vagina. To address this challenge, the BD MAX Vaginal Panel has a unique algorithm that determines the ratio of healthy versus unhealthy bacteria, improving BV diagnosis. ""Vaginitis is highly prevalent, with large gaps in clinical management that improved diagnostics could help address,  said Dr. Mark Martens, MD, FACOG, Chair, Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology Jersey Shore University Medical Center, part of the Hackensack Meridian Health.  Traditional methods used to detect vaginitis can be challenging due to the presence of many interfering substances in specimens, the large number of mixed infections, and the subjectivity of these methods. A multiplex microbiome-based real-time PCR assay has the potential to help clinicians improve patient management and help laboratories increase workflow efficiency.  Vaginal infections result in more than 10 million office visits each year in the US, with up to 75 percent of women experiencing at least one case of Vaginitis (VVC, TV) or Vaginosis (BV) in their lifetime.1,2,7 As many as half the women who suffer from vaginal infections incorrectly assume it is a simple case of a yeast infection and attempt to self-treat with over-the-counter options before consulting a clinician.5 Additionally, inaccurate and inconsistent diagnosis of these conditions can leave up to 30 percent of women seeking treatment with the wrong diagnosis. This can lead to continued symptoms, repeat visits, inappropriate or missed treatment and unnecessary associated health care system costs.2 In addition to irritating symptoms that disrupt quality of life, these infections can have serious risks, including pre-term or low birth-weight babies, late term miscarriage, and increased risk of STI transmission or acquisition such as HIV and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).3,4,6,7  With the FDA market authorization of the BD MAX Vaginal and CT/GC/TV Panels, BD is now able to offer clinical laboratories automated PCR tests to aid in the detection and diagnosis of important reproductive and sexually transmitted infections,   said Doug White, vice president and general manager of Molecular Diagnostics and Women s Health for BD.  The US launch of the BD Max Vaginal Panel signifies BD s continued commitment to elevating the standard of care for women's health and sexually transmitted infections.  FDA market authorization was granted under a de novo petition, which is a regulatory pathway for novel products that are first-of-a-kind. This represents the second addition to the BD Reproductive and Sexually Transmitted Infections portfolio within the last quarter. In September, BD obtained FDA clearance for the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay, which provides laboratories the ability to detect Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Trichomoniasis from a single specimen with one test. The BD MAX System offers an efficient path to results by combining and automating real-time PCR extraction, amplification and detection into a single platform capable of running both FDA-cleared and open-system assays.","Published: November 1, 2016"

In the past 20 years, ""balanced network theory"" has emerged to explain this apparent randomness through a balance of excitation and inhibition in recurrently coupled networks of neurons. A team of scientists has extended the balanced model to provide deep and testable predictions linking brain circuits to brain activity. See Also: 3D reconstruction of neuronal networks provides unprecedented insight into organizational principles of sensory cortex Lead investigators at the University of Pittsburgh say the new model accurately explains experimental findings about the highly variable responses of neurons in the brains of living animals. The new model provides a much richer understanding of how activity is coordinated between neurons in neural circuits. The model could be used in the future to discover neural ""signatures"" that predict brain activity associated with learning or disease, say the investigators. ""Normally, brain activity appears highly random and variable most of the time, which looks like a weird way to compute,"" said Brent Doiron, associate professor of mathematics at Pitt, senior author on the paper, and a member of the University of Pittsburgh Brain Institute (UPBI). ""To understand the mechanics of neural computation, you need to know how the dynamics of a neuronal network depends on the network's architecture, and this latest research brings us significantly closer to achieving this goal."" Learn More: A 'GPS' to navigate the brain s neuronal networks Earlier versions of the balanced network theory captured how the timing and frequency of inputs excitatory and inhibitory shaped the emergence of variability in neural behavior, but these models used shortcuts that were biologically unrealistic, according to Doiron. ""The original balanced model ignored the spatial dependence of wiring in the brain, but it has long been known that neuron pairs that are near one another have a higher likelihood of connecting than pairs that are separated by larger distances. Earlier models produced unrealistic behavior either completely random activity that was unlike the brain or completely synchronized neural behavior, such as you would see in a deep seizure. You could produce nothing in between."" In the context of this balance, neurons are in a constant state of tension. According to co-author Matthew Smith, assistant professor of ophthalmology at Pitt and a member of UPBI, ""It's like balancing on one foot on your toes. If there are small overcorrections, the result is big fluctuations in neural firing, or communication."" The new model accounts for temporal and spatial characteristics of neural networks and the correlations in the activity between neurons whether firing in one neuron is correlated with firing in another. The model is such a substantial improvement that the scientists could use it to predict the behavior of living neurons examined in the area of the brain that processes the visual world. After developing the model, the scientists examined data from the living visual cortex and found that their model accurately predicted the behavior of neurons based on how far apart they were. The activity of nearby neuron pairs was strongly correlated. At an intermediate distance, pairs of neurons were anticorrelated (when one responded more, the other responded less), and at greater distances still they were independent. ""This model will help us to better understand how the brain computes information because it's a big step forward in describing how network structure determines network variability,"" said Doiron. ""Any serious theory of brain computation must take into account the noise in the code. A shift in neuronal variability accompanies important cognitive functions, such as attention and learning, as well as being a signature of devastating pathologies like Parkinson's disease and epilepsy."" While the scientists examined the visual cortex, they believe their model could be used to predict activity in other parts of the brain, such as areas that process auditory or olfactory cues, for example. And they believe that the model generalizes to the brains of all mammals. In fact, the team found that a neural signature predicted by their model appeared in the visual cortex of living mice studied by another team of investigators. Don't Miss: LSD changes consciousness by reorganizing human brain networks ""A hallmark of the computational approach that Doiron and Smith are taking is that its goal is to infer general principles of brain function that can be broadly applied to many scenarios. Remarkably, we still don't have things like the laws of gravity for understanding the brain, but this is an important step for providing good theories in neuroscience that will allow us to make sense of the explosion of new experimental data that can now be collected,"" said Nathan Urban, associate director of UPBI.

Mild cognitive impairments, particularly memory and concentration problems, are common among cancer survivors.

In addition, participants' quality of life was improved at six months following program completion. Objective neuropsychological function test results were not different between the two groups. While this is the largest cognitive intervention study in patients with cancer, longer follow-up is needed to determine if the effects of the training are long-lasting.

Terranova, has discovered that serotonin (5-HT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) act in opposite ways in males and females to influence aggression and dominance. Because dominance and aggressiveness have been linked to stress resistance, these findings may influence the development of more effective gender-specific treatment strategies for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. See Also: Sex differences in brain may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders more common in males ""These results begin to provide a neurochemical basis for understanding how the social brain works quite differently in males and females,"" said Albers. Prominent sex differences occur in the incidence, development and clinical course of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Women, for example, have higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while men more frequently suffer from autism and attention deficit disorder. Despite profound sex differences in the expression of social behavior and the incidence of these psychiatric disorders, little is known about how the brain mechanisms underlying these phenomena differ in females and males. Further, limited knowledge exists regarding sex differences in the efficacy of treatments for these disorders. As a result, current treatment strategies are largely the same for both sexes. In this study conducted in hamsters, the researchers investigated the hypothesis that 5-HT promotes and AVP inhibits aggression and dominance in females and that 5-HT inhibits and AVP promotes aggression and dominance in males. Their data show strong support for this hypothesis with the discovery that 5-HT and AVP act in opposite ways within the hypothalamus to regulate dominance and aggression in females and males. Read Next: Neural fundamentals: Sex differences in the nervous system This study also found that administration of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for psychiatric disorders, increased aggression in females and inhibited aggression in males. These studies raise the possibility that stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as PTSD may be more effectively treated with 5-HT-targeted drugs in women and with AVP-targeted drugs in men. The research team involved in this discovery included Dr. Zhimin Song, Tony E. Larkin, Nathan Hardcastle Alisa Norvelle and Ansa Riaz from Georgia State's Neuroscience Institute. The next step will be to investigate whether there are sex differences in the efficacy of 5-HT- and AVP-active drugs in reducing social stress.

When we are on a train, the landscape slides by us. However, we know that we are the ones moving, while the world remains in place. How does the brain avoid being fooled by apparent motion? See Also: Brain navigation can occur without external cues A team of neuroscientists from the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal, discovered in the fruit fly's brain a neural circuit that creates a faithful internal representation of the direction and velocity of the insect's locomotion, allowing it to  know where it is going at any given time. Their results, which could also be valid for other animals, including humans, have been published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. In fact, we take this capacity being able to perceive that our movements are really our own so much for granted that we end up underestimating the complexity and the fragility of the underlying biological mechanisms. But when we lose this ability, as can be the case in certain mental disorders and due to brain injury, we are no longer able to interact with the world, says Argentinian neuroscientist Eugenia Chiappe. ""The precise sense of self-movement is an important part of our sense of self. No sensory experience is possible without movement"". Eugenia Chiappe, who led the new study, wants to understand how, when we go from one place to another, our brain manages to differentiate the apparent motion of the objects around us, generated by our own movements, from an actual physical motion of those objects (as would happen in an earthquake, to give an extreme example). The team studied a specific type of neurons in the fruit-fly: horizontal system cells, or HS cells, located in a region of the fly's brain called the lobula plate. ""We know that HS cells are part of a monitoring system that tells the fly's brain that it was the fly that moved"", says Eugenia Chiappe. Learn More: The brain's super-sensitivity to curbsThis type of cells, generically called ""optic-flow processing"" cells, also exist in the primate brain. And these neurons receive not only visual information, but also non-visual information related to eye and head movements of the animal. So it would be expected that they also receive non-visual information related to walking movements. ""Until now, this had not been demonstrated"", says Eugenia Chiappe, ""because it has been very difficult to artificially create the illusion of walking in a monkey."" But with the fruit fly, it is much easier to do locomotion experiments: just place the fly on a suspended ball that rolls when the fly walks, and while it is walking you can directly record the activity of HS cells. To prove the contribution of non-visual signals to the HS cells' activity, the scientists simply turned off the lights. ""What we now showed in the fruit fly is that, even in the dark, HS cells continue monitoring body movements through non-visual signals"", says Eugenia Chiappe. The authors also showed that these neurons integrate visual and non-visual signals when the lights are back on that is, when both kinds of signals coexist. But does this enhance the fly's perception of its own movements? The answer is yes. ""We showed that when the fly can sense self-generated visual feedback, the two kinds of signals, the visual and non-visual, cooperate"", says Eugenia Chiappe. More specifically, this cooperation leads to an increase of the activity of HS cells when the visual feedback is expected from the direction of walking. In other words, thanks to the integration of visual and non-visual signals, HS cells can monitor and control the fly's course more faithfully. Don't Miss: New research explains how we use the GPS inside our brain to navigate To confirm the existence of this visual/non-visual signal cooperation, the team performed a third experiment, where the outside world ""reacted"" in a totally unnatural way to the fly's walking motion: when the fly turned in a certain direction, the visual field now turned in the same direction! Under this condition, the HS cells completely lost their sense of orientation, so to speak. ""The directional selectivity of the HS cells decreased and they became unable to distinguish one direction from another, failing to tell the fly's brain in which direction the fly was turning"", says Eugenia Chiappe. According to her, a reevaluation of the classical vision of HS cell function is now needed. Up to know, it was thought that in the fruit fly, these cells specifically controlled the flight course. But one thing remained poorly understood: to a fly which is in the air, the motion of far-away objects appears slower than that of closer objects. In these conditions, how can the fly have an accurate notion of its flight speed, something which is crucial to correctly calculate the distance to its target and land smoothly on it? Here, another finding the scientists made during the experiments in the dark becomes relevant: the fact that the activity of the HS cells was strongly correlated with the velocity of the fly's body, both when it walks in a straight line and when it turns. This means, according to Eugenia Chiappe, that ""based on the activity of its HS cells, the fly's brain computes its actual physical velocity, both linear and angular"". In other words, ""it is the combination of visual and non-visual signals that enables the calibration of the visual information, and thus a more faithful representation the fly's locomotive movements"", she adds. In light of these results, HS cells become excellent candidates for the role of self-movement detectors that allow the fly's brain to know, at every moment, where it is headed and to control its course. ""The next step of this research will be to determine what the non-visual signals involved are"", says Eugenia Chiappe. These may include our so-called ""sixth-sense"", proprioception, which enables us to know, at any given instant, the position in space of the different parts of our body. ""Moreover, we also want to understand how these signals combine among themselves in order to supply the relevant information to the brain"", says Eugenia Chiappe.

Related: A tool to better screen and treat aneurysm patients Using genetic analysis, the team of researchers found rare variations of one gene, RNF213, that appeared more frequently in IA patients than in the control group. Both patients and the control group came from French-Canadian families. Their study is published in the American Journal of Human Genetics. Scientists already knew that IA is inheritable, and a 1996 study found that 29.8 per cent of French-Canadian IA patients had a family member who also had IA, a higher percentage than the general population. This suggests the genetic link to IA in French-Canadians is stronger than average. The gene or genes responsible for this increased inheritability, however, remained a mystery. Research team. Credit: Shawn Hayward  The team of researchers, including 13 from the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, used exome sequencing to identify RNF213 as suspicious in a patient group of 26 people from six families who experienced IA. They then re-sequenced RNF213 in a larger control group of 189 people, and found 14 variants of the gene, unique to the French-Canadian patient group, at least two of which have functions that could increase risk of IA. Intracranial aneurysm is a dilation or ballooning of a blood vessel in the brain caused by a weakness in the arterial wall. The RNF213 variants may play a role in the development of weak arterial walls by affecting the delivery of energy in these cells. Learn More: One third of all brain aneurysms rupture: the size is not a significant risk factor Ten per cent of the patient group had at least one of the rare and potentially damaging RNF213 variations, a higher percentage than the control group by a statistically significant margin. This suggests that while RNF213 is not the only factor playing a role in IA, it does increase the risk. Interestingly, RNF213 has also been found to be associated with moya moya disease (MMD), a condition where blood vessels in the brain are constricted, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels to compensate for the blockage. MMD is almost exclusively found in the East Asian population. This study and the prior association of RNF213 to MMD supports the theory that the gene plays a role in blood vessel development, but links to different cerebrovascular diseases in different populations. The worldwide prevalence of IA is one-to-three percent, and this condition entails severe consequences, particularly when the aneurysm bursts, which is known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. When this occurs, 30 to 45 per cent of patients die within 30 days. While other health factors like smoking and hypertension are known to increase risk, researchers continue to search for genes that predispose people to IA.

Previous research suggested a link between mitochondrial functional defects and ASD, but those studies included small sample sizes and could not verify whether the cause was genetic or environmental. See Also: Impaired recycling of mitochondria in autism? The current study, published in the journal PLOS Genetics, analyzed mtDNA in 903 families, where the researchers compared the mtDNA of an affected child and an unaffected sibling and their mother. They found that in instances when the children had both mutant and normal mtDNA in a single cell, called heteroplasmy, all the children showed similar numbers of mutant mtDNA, but the autistic children had more than twice as many harmful mtDNA mutations compared to their non-autistic siblings. ""When we compared the inheritance between the mother and the children, we confirmed this particular pattern, which is the child with autism inherited more bad mutations than their siblings during the process of passing mitochondrial DNA from mother to children,"" said Zhenglong Gu, associate professor of nutritional sciences and the paper's senior author. ""We show not only that mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy is associated with autism, but also, among autistic kids, these pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations are significantly associated with intellectual disability, and other neurological and developmental defects,"" said Yiqin Wang, a graduate student in Gu's lab and the paper's first author. Learn More: Sugar rush shrinks brain cell powerhouse The current findings may lead to better diagnosis and treatment of children with a sub-type of autism caused by pathogenic mtDNA mutations. Analyzing mtDNA could help diagnose some forms of autism in the future. Interventions restoring mitochondrial function might also be useful for treatment, Gu said. These findings also have relevance for other childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, which may be caused by disease-causing mtDNA mutations and is a subject for future work, he said. Most human cells carry two copies of nuclear DNA, one copy from each parent, and hundreds of copies of mtDNA, which exist in an organelle called the mitochondrion, where most of a cell's energy is created. Aside from the nuclear genome that resides in the cell's nucleus, the mitochondrion is the only organelle that contains DNA. Compared to nuclear DNA, mtDNA is known to mutate rapidly, which has prompted Gu to look for age-related diseases and pediatric diseases linked to these mutations. During egg production, there is a dramatic reduction in the numbers of copies of mtDNA, as a way of eliminating bad mutations passed from mother to child. But some bad mutations still pass to the next generation, and the number of pathogenic mtDNA in children may be affected by the mother's environment or physiology, Gu said. ""Does the mother have inflammation or diabetes, or is she obese?"" Gu said. ""These things could make the process of cleaning up mutations less efficient. This could give us some insight into why autism is rising,"" and will be a subject for future studies, Gu said.

Yet researchers at the University of California, Davis, Genome Center and Department of Computer Science are attempting just that, building a computer model that predicts the behavior of a single cell of the bacterium Escherichia coli. The results of their work were published Oct. 7 in the journal Nature Communications. The new simulation is the largest of its kind yet, said Ilias Tagkopoulos, professor of computer science, who led the team.  The number of layers, and the amount of data involved are unprecedented,  he said. The dataset on which the model is based includes, for example, over 4,389 profiles of the expression of different genes and proteins across 649 different conditions. Both the dataset, named  Ecomics  and the integrated model, MOMA (Multi-Omics Model and Analytics) are available to other researchers to use and test. The model could be useful to researchers as a fast and inexpensive way to predict how an organism might behave in a specific experiment, Tagkopoulos said. Although no prediction can be as accurate as actually performing the experiment, this would help scientists design their hypotheses and experiments. Applications range from finding the best growth conditions in biotechnology to identifying key pathways for antibiotic and stress resistance. A week to download, 2 years to build Collecting and downloading the data took a week, but processing the data into a single dataset took two years of the three-year project, Tagkopoulos said. The team built models for four layers, starting with gene expression and working up to the activity at the whole-cell level. Then they integrated the layers together. They used techniques in machine learning to train the models to predict the behavior of each layer, and ultimately of the cell itself, under different conditions. The model was built on computer clusters at UC Davis, and on supercomputers available through a national network. The researchers received a National Science Foundation grant of computing time on  Blue Waters,  one of the world s most powerful supercomputers, at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications. Although E. coli is a well-known organism, we are far from knowing everything about its biochemistry and metabolism, Tagkopoulos said.  We are exploring a vast space here,  he said.  Our aim is to create a crystal ball for the bacteria, which can help us decide what is the next experiment we should do to explore this space better.  With collaborators at Mars Inc., Tagkopoulos hopes to begin building similar databases and models for bacteria involved in foodborne illness, such as Salmonella enterica and Bacillus subtilis. He expects other researchers to draw on the Ecomics database, and hopes to make the MOMA model interface more accessible for biologists to use.  We re living in an amazing era at the intersection of computer science, engineering and biology,  he said.  It s a very interesting time. ","Published: October 31, 2016"

In an article in Cell Systems, a multidisciplinary team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering describes an instrument they engineered that can  breathe  in and out, actively smoke regular and electronic cigarettes much like a human, and then deliver the smoke to microfluidic organs-on-chips lined by human lung small airway cells isolated from non-smokers or COPD patients. The integrated smoking system enables a better understanding of smoke-related pathological changes in individual smokers, and could facilitate the discovery of more accurate biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. Progress in figuring out how exactly cigarette smoke worsens COPD, a so far irreversible inflammatory disease of the small airways of the lung, has been glacial because researchers lack faithful models. Classical culture systems with human small airway cells are unable to reproduce the breathing motions of the lung and commonly used laboratory animals cannot reflect human smoking because they breathe through their noses, and their inflammatory responses differ from those in humans. In addition, human clinical studies have revealed great variability in the physiological and biochemical responses between patients, and they usually do not allow direct comparisons of smoke-exposure versus no-exposure in the same individual. Leveraging their previously developed human lung small airway-on-a-chip model for inflammatory disorders including COPD and asthma, the Wyss Institute s team led by Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., designed a smoking instrument that integrates with the airway chips and faithfully recapitulates smoking behavior with cells derived from healthy people and patients with COPD.  The device enables us for the first time to compare responses of human small airway tissues, from both normal individuals and COPD patients, before and after they are exposed to cigarette smoke delivered through physiological breathing outside the human body. We can now begin to decipher which cell types, cellular functions and genes contribute to smoke-induced injury in normal lung, as well as during COPD exacerbations in individual patients, and thereby, identify common as well as patient-specific disease factors,  said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In the microfluidic small airway-on-a-chip, one hollow microchannel is lined by living human bronchiolar epithelium, obtained from COPD patients or healthy people, which is exposed to air delivered under normal breathing motions by the smoking instrument. Cell culture medium is continually flowed through a parallel running channel separated from the first by a porous membrane to support the epithelium for up to four weeks, and to create a so-called air-liquid interface similar to that present in actual lung airway.  In order to translate observed breathing patterns and smoking behavior into biological effects, we combined the small airway-on-a-chip with a smoking machine that burns cigarettes and a microrespirator that inhales and exhales small volumes of cigarette smoke and fresh air in and out of the epithelium-lined channel in programmable intervals mimicking true smoking behavior,  said Richard Novak, Ph.D., a co-author of the study and a Senior Staff Engineer at the Wyss Institute who helped to design the smoking instrument. The integrated smoking system recapitulates the complex oxidant-induced biological responses of normal lung cells to toxic molecules present in cigarette smoke as well as COPD-specific inflammatory responses.  We identified a COPD-specific signature by comparing gene expression changes in COPD-derived chips exposed or not exposed to smoke and subtracting the changes that we see in chips made from healthy lung chips. This type of analysis could lead to future biomarkers, drug targets and possibly more personalized approaches to COPD in the future,  said first author Kambez H. Benam, Ph.D., a Wyss Institute Technology Development Fellow.  The team also demonstrated that they can use this approach to investigate potential toxicity profiles of emerging tobacco-related products including e-cigarettes. Benam was also able to analyze the behavior of mucus-transporting cilia protruding from the small airway cells into the smoke-exposed microfluidic channel in an automated high-throughput fashion working with Janna Nawroth, Ph.D., a past Wyss Technology Development Fellow with co-author Kevin Kit Parker, Ph.D., a Wyss Core Faculty member and the Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at Harvard s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).  We found that cilia beating becomes more heterogeneous and reaches lower frequencies in chips exposed to whole cigarette smoke,  said Benam who recently also received a Baxter Young Investigator award for his work at the Wyss Institute. Ingber believes that  The power of the technology is that it allows us to directly analyze the effect of a stimulus, in this case smoke exposure, on lung in what might be thought of as an in vitro human  pre-clinical  study.  This is hard to do in a standard human clinical study where one compares patients with a history of smoking versus those who do not smoke because all of the patients have different histories, backgrounds and patterns of exposure to the stimulus .","Published: October 31, 2016"

In a surprising turn of events, scientists at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina and Washington University in St. Louis have just learned that plant light sensors also respond to temperature. Plants contain specialized light-sensitive proteins that change shape when they absorb light, much as do the photopigments in the human eye. All plants have three main red-light photoreceptors, called phytochrome A, B and C. As part of an effort to create plants that can tolerate different growth conditions, Richard Vierstra, the George and Charmaine Mallinckrodt Professor in Arts & Sciences at Washington University has been developing a library of phytochrome B mutants, including ones that are much more or less sensitive to light than the wild type plant. To better understand their mutant plants, the Vierstra lab shared them with Jorge J. Casal lab in Argentina, where doctoral student Martina Legris grew them under a wide variety of carefully controlled conditions.  We got  weird  results that couldn t be explained unless the phytochrome we were working with was sensitive to temperature as well as light,  Vierstra said. As the temperature rose, some plants exposed to constant sunlight generate less of the biologically active form of phytochrome B   not more, as you d expect. At summer temperatures, these plants behave as though they re in dim light even though they re in bright sun. The findings were published in the Oct. 27 issue of Science, together with a companion paper also on plant temperature sensors by a lab at the University of Cambridge in England. A switch with the jitters  Vierstra explains that phytochrome proteins work by switching between two forms, called Pr and Pfr. The Pr form is best at absorbing red light, which is plentiful in full sun. When it absorbs red light, phytochrome converts to the Pfr state, which is better at absorbing far-red light that dominates in shade. When the Pfr absorbs far-red light, it switches back to the Pr form. This little system can detect many different qualities of light, including the light intensity (encoded in the speed at which the molecule bounces from one form to another), and the color of the light (encoded by the ratio of the Pfr form to the Pr form). Intensity tells a seed when to emerge from the soil and color tells the seeding when to grow tall to avoid shade.  The beauty of this is you can purify the phytochromes, put them in a test tube and watch them switch forms simply by shining red or far-red light on the solutions,  Vierstra said.  So they re not figments of our imagination.  An hour glass that runs too fast But this description leaves out one conversion. Pfr can convert to Pr by absorbing far-red light but also by a process called thermal reversion, which occurs without light. People thought thermal reversion worked like an hour glass, Vierstra said. As soon as the sun set, the hour glass started running, and Pfr started trickling back to the Pr form. The amount of Pfr at the end of the night then told the plant how long the night was. This is important because the length of night varies with the season, especially away from the Equator.  So, changes in day (and night) length helps plants to tell where they are in the seasonal cycle, which in turn helps them to flower in the right season. Nobody had been able to test the idea that thermal reversion was an hourglass, or timer, however. But as they were tinkering with phytochrome B, the Vierstra lab made phytochrome mutants that were fast reverters and ones that were slow reverters. And these mutants were among those that traveled to Argentina. When they grew the plants, the Casals lab got strange results they could understand only if thermal reversion is much faster than anyone realized; and only if the rate of reversion is very sensitive to temperature. In other words, the only possible interpretationwas that phytochrome B in the wild type (unmodified) plant is a temperature as well as light sensor.  The plant is looking for Pfr, which tells it the light is on,  Vierstra said.  In sunlight a plant slowly makes more and more Pfr until the reaction that converts Pr to Pfr saturates. But as the temperature rises, the thermal reversion starts running so fast, the plants accumulate relatively little Pfr.  You would expect that at higher temperatures the Pr to Pfr reaction would go faster,  Vierstra said,  and it probably does, but thermal reversion goes even faster. It erases the light signal because the reversion reaction is more sensitive to temperature than the one creating the light signal.  You can predict what this will do as temperature rises,  Vierstra said.  Plants that make lots of Pfr are short, intensely green and happy. But thermal reversion will draw down the Pfr at higher temperatures, so that plants will respond as if they are in the dark (even though they are in the light) and grow tall and leggy.   We don t yet know right now whether it s just phytochrome B that s a temperature sensor,  Vierstra said. So right now, members of his team, including research scientist Sethe Burgie, are trying to get accurate measurement on the other phytochromes.  Once we have this figured out, we could make mutants that are less or more sensitive to temperature by modifying thermal reversion,  Vierstra said.","Published: October 31, 2016"

The simulations identify new ""pockets"" to reactivate p53 which would be a tremendous boost for future anti-cancer drug discovery. Amaro is a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. She has been studying this important molecule for years trying to understand how it works. Amaro is motivated by the fact that the p53 protein somehow helps prevent the formation of cancerous cells. ""P53 is a major tumor suppressor that is mutated and inactivated in approximately 50 percent of all human cancers. Thus, reactivation of mutant p53 using small molecules has been a long-sought-after anticancer therapeutic strategy,"" Amaro said. Amaro calls p53 the 'guardian of the genome.' P53 is at the core of the tumor suppression mechanism and an important protein for regulating cell life, according to a paper she co-authored in the September 2016 edition of the journal Oncogene. Study scientists found that when there is damage to a normally functioning cell, p53 senses the damage and engages the elements in other molecules that control things like cell death or cell cycle arrest. This stops the damage where it is in the cell cycle. Most of the cancer mutations studied change single amino acids in p53. The altered guardian protein cannot bind to DNA, preventing it from effectively regulating cell growth and division. Thus, DNA damage accumulates in cells, which can allow them to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a cancerous tumor. ""If you have a damaged cell, you don't want it to replicate,"" Amaro said. Amaro and her colleagues' new work is based on the full length p53, which is challenging because of its complex architecture and multiple highly flexible regions. ""We went from studying a relatively small protein of 50,000 atoms in a water box to the full length p53, which included the single binding domain, additional domains, in tetramer form, and in complex with different segments of DNA,"" Amaro said. ""In doing so, there was a huge increase in terms of the complexity of the system and the number of atoms simulated."" ""That's why Stampede was so terrific,"" Amaro explained. ""Stampede has many processors and amazing scalability   we were able to run this 1.5 million atom system for nearly a microsecond and actually begin to say things about the dynamics at a completely different scale than what was known previously. Amaro said that she and her colleagues use these methods like a  computational microscope.' ""The science challenge represents a level of complexity that's very difficult if not impossible to experimentally test,"" she said. In response, the researchers built atomic-level models 'in silico,' and interrogated the system in unique ways. For the first time, for example, the researchers built a large complex of the p53 molecule with three different sequences of DNA: two were recognition sequences (P21 and Puma) and the third strand was a negative control. ""We could see how when we the full-length p53 was bound to a DNA sequence that was a recognition sequence, the tetramer clamps down and grips onto the DNA   which was unexpected,"" Amaro said. In contrast, with the negative control DNA p53 stays more open. ""It actually relaxes,"" she said. ""It suggested a mechanism by which this molecule could actually change its dynamics depending on the exact sequence of DNA."" The supercomputer simulations of the full length p53 system showed some  firsts':   First time to see the direct interactions between one region of the p53 molecule, which is called the c-terminal domain, with DNA. The researchers saw this region of p53 actually come down to interact with the DNA.   First time to suggest an atomic level mechanism by which p53 changes its grip on the DNA depending on the actual DNA sequence.   First time researchers are getting insight into how the full-length p53 interacts with the DNA. These firsts were accomplished using atomic level simulations. ""We have all of the atoms and the proteins,"" Amaro said. ""We try to replicate the environment of the cell, so we have water molecules and ions, and then we had an actual segment of DNA so we could explore the response of  full length p53' in terms of its dynamics, depending on what sequence of the DNA was there."" The researchers set up three different systems and ran three different copies of each system to test variability in the data for a total of nine different simulations for nearly a microsecond of aggregated dynamics. ""The simulations were very computationally intensive. And then to be able to do something new about the biology that wasn't known before   that's the really exciting part and that's what we showed,"" Amaro said. ""As the systems get bigger, much more computational time is required. Previously the simulations were run for a few nanoseconds. Now we have microseconds of dynamical data, which is 1,000x more. In this case, we were looking at over a dozen domains and in complex with the DNA. It gives us a much more complete picture of what is actually happening. It's a few steps closer to reality than anything we've been able to accomplish yet,"" she explained. Said Amaro: ""Computing is getting to the point now where it can have an impact on developing new therapies. It gives us a better understanding of cancer mechanisms and ways to develop possible novel therapeutic avenues. When most people think about cancer research they probably don't think about computers, but these models are getting to the point where they have a great impact on the science."" Amaro is hoping these discoveries will translate into new cancer therapies. ""The ideal situation is that cancers of the breast and prostate could possibly be rescued or eliminated if we were able to develop a compound that reactivated p53. You don't have to wait until the cancer is advanced. The sensing of mutation and then shuttling the cell to die is something that happens through the early stages of cancer. It could be detected and fixed before the cancer develops,"" Amaro concluded.","Published: October 31, 2016"

The study results address Gaucher s disease, which is caused by a genetic glitch in lysosomes. Found mostly in Jews of Eastern and Central European origin, the condition may come with joint pain, blood disorders, enlarged spleens and livers, memory loss, and lung damage. At a cellular level, Gaucher s disease is associated with abnormally low production of the protein progranulin, as well as with the misplaced buildup of the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase, or GBA, outside lysosomes, instead of inside where it is needed. Led by researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center, the study found that a manufactured version of progranulin reversed most effects of Gaucher s disease in mouse and human cell studies, including GBA accumulation.  Our results suggest a new way to treat Gaucher s disease that corrects abnormal enzyme delivery by progranulin to lysosomes, as opposed to current treatment strategies that temporarily replenish lysosomal GBA stores, which are then steadily consumed,  says senior study investigator Chuanju Liu, PhD, a professor in the departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Cell Biology at NYU Langone. The research team and NYU Langone hold a patent on related, potential therapies. Among the study s other key findings was that progranulin must bind to other molecules to transport the enzyme to lysosomes, specifically the protective  heat shock  protein 70. If unshielded, cellular GBA molecules fold up and stick together outside lysosomes. Researchers also found that adding synthetic progranulin, or Pcgin, to blood cells obtained from patients with Gaucher s, led to a 40 percent reduction in GBA clumping within a week. Pcgin was used because it is chemically more stable than progranulin and poses no risk of uncontrolled tumor-like cell growth in test animals, say the authors.  Our new experiments are the first to explain why reduced progranulin is a key characteristic of Gaucher s, and why the mice engineered to lack the protein serve as such a good model to test new therapies,  says lead study investigator Jian Jinlong, MD, PhD, an associate research scientist at NYU Langone. According to Liu, further research is needed to determine the precise mechanism by which progranulin reduces cell swelling, a process that would likely yield even more drug targets for Gaucher s disease.","Published: October 31, 2016"

Salmonella has a unique characteristic that allows the bacteria to penetrate through cell barriers and replicate inside its host. Now, scientists at the Cancer Research Center and the University of Missouri have developed a non-toxic strain of Salmonella to penetrate and target cancer cells. Results from this study could lead to promising new treatments that actively target and control the spread of cancer.  Salmonella strains have a natural preference for infiltrating and replicating within the cancer cells of a tumor, making the bacteria an ideal candidate for bacteriotherapy,  said Robert Kazmierczak, a senior investigator at the Cancer Research Center and a post-doctoral fellow in the Division of Biological Sciences in the MU College of Arts and Science.  Bacteriotherapy is the use of live bacteria as therapy to treat a medical condition, like cancer.  Kazmierczak and the team at the Cancer Research Center (CRC) developed CRC2631, a Salmonella strain that has been genetically modified to render the bacteria nontoxic and enhance its natural ability to target and kill cancer cells without harming normal, healthy cells. The Salmonella strain was administered directly into the circulatory system of mice with prostate cancer.  We found that the mice tolerated the treatment well and when examined, their prostate tumors decreased by about 20 percent compared to the control group,  Kazmierczak said.  One of the most remarkable aspects of Salmonella is its ability to target, spread and persist inside the tumor. We are taking advantage of this ability by using Salmonella to carry or generate effective chemotherapeutic drugs, concentrating them at and throughout the tumor. The goal of this treatment is to develop a bacterial vector that can destroy the tumor from the inside out and reduce the amount of side effects endured by patients with cancer.  CRC2631 is derived from a Salmonella sample that was stored in a test tube at room temperature for more than 50 years. The sample originates from the Demerec collection, a collection of mutant strains of Salmonella collected by geneticist Milisav Demerec and curated by Abraham Eisenstark, scientific director at the CRC and professor emeritus of biological sciences at MU. The collection contains over 20,000 different samples of Salmonella, with half of the samples housed at the Cancer Research Center where researchers affiliated with MU focus on three areas of cancer research: early detection, targeted treatment and new, effective chemotherapy.  The uniqueness of CRC2631 differentiates our Salmonella strains from other universities trying to achieve the same goal; it is one of a kind,  Eisenstark said.  The strain of Salmonella we are using is essential to the success of our study. ","Published: October 31, 2016"

In a paper posted online by the journal Science, researchers at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center report that, in mice with chronic viral infection, exhausted T cells are controlled by a fundamentally different set of molecular circuits than T cells effectively battling infections or cancer. This finding suggests a way to increase the staying power of CAR T cells, a promising form of immunotherapy for cancer. An accompanying study, led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and co-authored by Dana-Farber scientists, reports that these differences in circuitry remain largely unchanged by a type of cancer immunotherapy known as checkpoint inhibition, potentially closing off one avenue of improving this technique. The studies bring renewed focus to the epigenetics of T cells   the multilayered system of molecular switches, accelerators, and throttles that controls the activity of genes. Scientists have known for years that the pattern of genes is different in exhausted T cells than in functional T cells that are fully engaged in fighting disease, but the actual extent of these differences has been uncertain. One difference that is clear is that exhausted T cells express the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), which commands them not to attack normal, healthy cells, but can also prevent them from striking at cancerous or chronically infected cells. Blocking PD-1 with checkpoint-inhibiting drugs   and thereby restoring the cancer-killing zeal of T cells   has become one of the most successful new approaches to cancer treatment in nearly a decade. However, it has shown effectiveness in only about a quarter of cases.  Exhausted T cells display a variety of functional defects,  said Nicholas Haining of Dana-Farber/Boston Children s, the senior author of the new paper.  They are paralyzed and don t have the firepower to destroy cancer or virally infected cells. For us, the question in this study was, do exhausted cells represent a distinct type of T cell or are they merely a  groggy  version of functional T cells?  With chronically infected mice as their model, the researchers used a new technology called ATAC-seq to map the regulatory regions of the genome   the sections of DNA involved in switching genes on and off   in the animals  exhausted and functional CD8+ T cells. (CD8+ T cells are programmed to identify and eliminate cancerous and infected cells.)  We found the landscape of regulatory regions to be fundamentally different in exhausted and functional T cells,  Haining said.  There were thousands of instances where a regulatory region appeared in exhausted T cells but not in their functional counterparts, and vice versa. This tells us that the two types of cells use very different wiring diagrams to control their gene activity.  The researchers then tested whether removing a regulatory stretch of DNA that spurs the production of PD-1 would drive down expression of the protein. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, they snipped out that region and indeed, PD-1 expression dropped. The success of this experiment may offer the key to improving CAR T cell therapy. CAR T cells are T cells that are removed from a patient, genetically engineered to grow a protein  sensor  that targets them to tumor cells, and then reinjected into the patient. Although the retrofitted T cells have demonstrated effectiveness at tracking down cancer cells, particularly in leukemia, one of the shortcomings of CAR T cells is that they tend to become exhausted. The work described in the new study suggests that while T cells are being engineered to produce the sensor, they could also be retooled to delete the genetic wiring that causes them to express excessive levels of PD-1 or other exhaustion genes. The resulting CAR T cells not only would be better at stalking cancer, but also more aggressive about attacking it. In the companion paper, researchers explored whether blocking the PD-1 checkpoint rewired exhausted T cells to make them, from an epigenetic standpoint, more like functional T cells. Using chronically infected mouse models, as in the first study, the investigators found that while such gain of function does occur briefly, the epigenetic switches from its previous, exhausted state remain largely unchanged.  This suggests that the benefits achieved by checkpoint blockade result from a transient revving up of exhausted T cells, not a permanent reshaping of their state,  Haining said. The findings of the two studies point to the need for a comprehensive atlas of the regulatory regions that are active in exhausted and functional T cells, he continued. Such a guide would provide targets for rewiring T cells with genetic engineering or epigenetic drugs to make them more effective cancer killers.","Published: October 31, 2016"

Microbiologist Jillian Petersen and colleagues from the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology have discovered that chemosynthetic bacteria in marine animals can fix nitrogen as well as carbon. This is the first such symbiont known to be capable of nitrogen fixation. Chemosynthetic symbionts are bacteria living inside or on the surface of animals, supplying their host with food that would otherwise be unavailable. It has long been known that these bacteria fix carbon and convert it into organic forms. Microbiologist Jillian Petersen and colleagues from the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology now reveal that the same is possible for nitrogen. Chemosynthetic bacteria transform inert nitrogen gas into bioavailable forms. As nitrogen is often the limiting nutrient in the ocean, these bacteria could be fertilizing growth in marine ecosystems.  The ability to fix nitrogen has now been discovered in chemosynthetic symbionts of marine lucinid clams and nematode worms. The symbiotic clams and worms investigated in this study are found in coastal marine waters worldwide. In some regions, the clams are even considered a delicacy. ""Chemosynthetic"" means the bacteria have the special ability to do primary production in the complete absence of sunlight, using only the energy stored in chemical bonds. This symbiotic primary production is effective enough to provide a food source for both the bacteria and their animal hosts.  Using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing technologies, Petersen and her colleagues discovered all the genes necessary for nitrogen fixation in the symbionts of these worms and clams. No marine chemosynthetic symbiont was previously known to be capable of nitrogen fixation. ""Our finding is especially surprising because these bacteria are probably able to take up nitrogen from their surroundings, and also to recycle nitrogen waste compounds from their hosts"", says Petersen. ""It seems like they wouldn t need to fix the stuff."" The team therefore also used transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on the clams, and indeed detected expression of the genes for nitrogen fixation. ""That indicates that these symbionts are actively fixing nitrogen inside their hosts"", Petersen continues. The nitrogen isotope composition of the clams showed typical signatures for biologically fixed nitrogen, further suggesting active nitrogen fixation by the symbionts.  Assistant Professor Jillian Petersen, who researches these symbioses at the University of Vienna, and previously at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Germany, led the team of researchers that made this discovery. The team in Vienna joined forces with institutes around the world including the Max Planck Institute, the University of Montpellier in France, the University of Calgary in Canada, and the Hydra Institute in Italy. ""Most of our field work was done at the HYDRA Institute on Elba"" according to Ulisse Cardini, a postdoctoral researcher in Petersen s team and an experienced diver who collected many of the samples by scuba diving. ""In addition, our colleagues Nicolas Higgs from the Plymouth University Marine Institute and John Taylor at the Natural History Museum in London generously shared their sample collections with us, so we were able to search for these nitrogen fixation genes in marine clam species from around the world   and we found them. The ability to fix nitrogen is probably widespread in these animal-associated bacteria"", says Cardini. ""Nitrogen fixation by chemosynthetic symbionts was overlooked for a long time"", says Petersen. ""Since their discovery in the deep sea in the late 1970s, we have spent almost four decades researching the symbionts  role in providing a source of carbon such as sugars for their hosts."" However, even marine clams cannot live from sugar alone. This new research raises the possibility that these symbionts may provide the unexpected benefit of a natural source of nitrogen to augment their host s diet. They could even be fertilizing the surrounding habitat by releasing available nitrogen to the surrounding water. ""Our future research aims to answer this question: Do these marine symbiotic bacteria help to 'fertilize' the oceans, too?""","Published: October 31, 2016"

The new 'HF10' technique offers lasting reductions in back and leg pain after other treatments have failed, according to the report by Dr. Leonardo Kapural of the Center for Clinical Research and Carolinas Pain Institute, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and colleagues. They believe that HF10 therapy could have a major impact on the treatment of chronic back and leg pain, and possibly other conditions as well. Related: Spinal cord stimulation is a safe, effective drug-free treatment for chronic painThe study included 171 patients with moderate to severe back and leg pain that persisted despite other treatments. Treated at 11 US comprehensive pain centers, the patients had chronic pain that had been present for an average of 14 years. Nearly 90 percent had had previous back surgery; a similar proportion were taking opioid pain medications. After a trial period, patients were randomly assigned to one of two SCS techniques, with mild electrical stimulation applied to targeted spinal nerves. One group was treated using HF10, with high-frequency stimulation (10 kilohertz) applied for very short periods. The other group received traditional SCS, with lower-frequency stimulation applied for relatively longer periods. As previously reported, HF10 provided superior pain relief. At three months, scores for back and leg pain decreased by at least half in more than 80 percent of patients receiving HF10. By comparison, conventional SCS achieved similar responses in back pain for 44 percent of patients and in leg pain for 55 percent. At two years' follow-up, the HF10 group still had higher response rates: 76 versus 49 percent for back pain and 73 versus 49 percent for leg pain. On a 0-to-10 rating scale, average back pain score decreased by 5 points with HF10 versus about 3 points for traditional SCS. About 60 percent of patients receiving HF10 were ""very satisfied"" with their treatment, compared to 40 percent with conventional SCS. Although SCS is not a new treatment, it provides more consistent results for leg pain than back pain, and relies on producing overlapping areas of numbness (paresthesia) to mask pain. By comparison, HF10 seems to provide greater relief of back pain without inducing areas of numbness. The new study is among the few to directly compare different approaches to SCS in patients with back and leg pain. Within its limitations, the pragmatic clinical trial supports the superiority of HF10 over conventional SCS for patients with chronic, severe back and leg pain. Extending follow-up to two years ""provides physicians, patients, and payers with rigorous evidence demonstrating the durability of SCS in treating chronic pain,"" Dr. Kapural and coauthors write. They note that the results are ""particularly impressive"" given the patients' long history of pain and lack of response to other treatments, including back surgery. Read Next: New technologies can help short circuit chronic pain Further research will determine whether HF-10 is useful for other chronic pain problems as well, such as arm and neck pain. Dr. Kapural and colleagues conclude: ""The superior and durable results demonstrated in this study are anticipated to lead to improved long-term cost effectiveness and payer acceptance, making this therapy broadly available to patients suffering from chronic pain.""

Pediatric researchers report that children with ASD may mistakenly be diagnosed with ADHD because they have autism-related social impairments rather than problems with attention. This is important for understanding what are the right services and treatments for a child. See Also: Inside the adult ADHD brainThe study team, including one of the psychologists who developed the ADHD screening tool, concludes that the tool needs to be refined to better identify the correct disorder, and that clinicians should supplement the screening tool with careful clinical interviews. ""One of our best current screening measures for ADHD may be over-diagnosing ADHD in children with autism,"" said study leader Benjamin E. Yerys, PhD, a researcher in the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). ""This is important because medications that work for ADHD may be less effective for a child on the autism spectrum."" Scale scores are used in recommending school-based services as well as treatment options. The study, from researchers at CHOP, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Baylor University, appears in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. One complicating factor is comorbidity an estimated 30 percent or more of children with ASD also have ADHD. The researchers suggest that the tool they analyzed, the ADHD Rating Scale Fourth Edition (ADHD-RS-IV), while well-validated in assessing ADHD in a general population of children, may overestimate ADHD in children with ASD. The scale asks parents and teachers to provide numerical ratings in reply to 18 items about a child's behavior: nine items on inattention and nine on hyperactivity and impulsivity. Related: A global surge in ADHD diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine Study co-author Thomas J. Power, PhD, director of CHOP's Center for Management of ADHD, developed ADHD-RS-IV in the 1990s (An updated version, the fifth edition, was published earlier this year, but not used in the current study). ""I'm excited to be involved in this study, and in efforts to refine our screening tools,"" he said, ""especially since few researchers have previously investigated using this scale in children with ASD. Our research raises questions not only about this rating tool, but all such measures that rely on parent and teacher ratings to assess ADHD in children with ASD."" The current study analyzed ratings of 386 children, aged 7 to 17, who had ASD without intellectual disability. To test whether the ADHD rating scale was valid in children on the autism spectrum, the research team used a procedure called factor analysis. They found that some questions on the ADHD rating scale were high for children with ASD instead of being high just for the subset of children who had significant ADHD symptoms. ""One underlying problem,"" said Yerys, ""may be in how we ask these questions."" For example, he explained, parents and teachers are asked ""Does the child respond when spoken to directly?"" However, supplying a yes or no answer to this question doesn't distinguish between actual inattention (a symptom of ADHD) and a child's lack of understanding about how to behave in a social situation in responding to another person a social impairment often found in ASD. Similarly, other questions focus on how well a child stays on task with play activity. ADHD may cause a child to be easily distracted from an activity, but another child may instead stop playing because of ASD-related difficulties with social play. The study team recommends modifying the rating scale to better minimize the influence of ASD on ratings of target ADHD behaviors. Moreover, until a more nuanced rating scale is available, clinicians need to combine the ratings with a follow-up interview with parents to better understand whether a child's behaviors stem from ADHD symptoms or social impairments. Ideally, said Yerys, a clinician should be experienced in evaluating both ADHD and ASD. Large pediatric facilities such as CHOP are particularly well positioned to provide such evaluations, having premier clinical and research centers in both conditions. Yerys added that, as precision medicine efforts expand, differentiating ADHD from ASD will be essential in providing safer and more effective treatments based on a child's specific condition. Read Next: The higher the elevation, the lower the rate of ADHD: Utah study links rates of ADHD to altitude ""Until we're able to develop and validate a new rating scale that takes symptoms of autism into account, parents who are concerned should seek out clinicians who are conducting evaluations for ADHD and are also taking into account the possibility of autism,"" added Yerys. Going forward, concluded Power, it will be important to strengthen local resources by improving training for community-based providers such as pediatricians and school psychologists in recognizing key distinctions in diagnosing and treating both ADHD and ASD.

The research helps explain the diversity of dementias linked to tau protein aggregation, which destroys brain cells of patients with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative syndromes. The study also has implications for earlier and more accurate diagnoses of various dementias through definition of the unique forms of tau associated with each. See Also: PET imaging for tau visualization in the brain ""In addition to providing a framework to understand why patients develop different types of neurodegeneration, this work has promise for the development of drugs to treat specific neurodegenerative diseases, and for how to accurately diagnose them. The findings indicate that a one-size-fits-all strategy for therapy may not work, and that we have to approach clinical trials and drug development with an awareness of which forms of tau we are targeting,"" said study author Dr. Marc Diamond, founding Director of the Center for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Professor of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics with the O'Donnell Brain Institute at University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center. Researchers used special cell systems to replicate distinct tau aggregate conformations. These different forms of pathological tau were then inoculated into the brains of mice. Each form created different pathological patterns, recapitulating the variation that occurs in diseases such as Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementias, and traumatic encephalopathy. The different forms of tau caused pathology that spread at different rates through the brain, and affected specific brain regions. This experiment demonstrated that the structure of pathological tau aggregates alone is sufficient to account for most if not all the variation seen in human neurodegenerative diseases that are linked to this protein. The finding, published in Neuron, could have a notable impact on widespread efforts at the O'Donnell Brain Institute and elsewhere to develop treatments that eliminate tau and other toxic proteins from the brains of dementia patients. ""The challenge for us now is to figure out how to rapidly and efficiently determine the forms of tau that are present in individual patients, and simultaneously, to develop specific therapies. This work says that it should be possible to predict patterns of disease in patients and responses to therapy based on knowledge of tau aggregate structure,"" said Dr. Diamond, who holds the Distinguished Chair in Basic Brain Injury and Repair. Related: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein Dr. Diamond's lab, at the forefront of many notable findings relating to tau, had previously determined that tau acts like a prion - an infectious protein that can self-replicate and spread like a virus through the brain. The lab has determined that tau protein in human brain can form many distinct strains, or self-replicating structures, and developed methods to reproduce them in the laboratory. This research led Dr. Diamond's team to the latest study to test whether these strains might account for different forms of dementia. To make this link, 18 distinct tau aggregate strains were replicated in the lab from human neurodegenerative disease brain samples, or were created from mouse models or other artificial sources. Researchers inoculated the strains into different brain regions of mice and found striking differences among them. While some strains had far reaching and rapid effects, others replicated only in limited parts of the brain, or caused widespread disease but did so very slowly. This surprising result answered a fundamental question that has dogged the field of neurodegenerative disease: Why are brain regions vulnerable in certain cases but not others, and why do some diseases progress more rapidly than others? For instance, in Alzheimer's disease, problems begin in brain memory centers before spreading to other areas that control functions such as language. Conversely, due to initial degeneration of frontal and temporal brain regions in frontotemporal dementia, the memory centers are relatively spared, and patients often first show changes in personality and behavior. Read Next: PET points to tau protein as leading culprit in Alzheimer'sThe new study implies that with knowledge of tau aggregate structure in patients, or possibly even in healthy individuals, it should be possible to predict the brain regions most vulnerable to degeneration and the rate of disease progression.

Interestingly, the protein known as neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is also known to be disrupted in an inherited disorder called neurofibromatosis type 1 (also called von Recklinghausen's disease), in which patients suffer from the growth of benign tumors beneath the skin, chronic pain, mild learning disabilities and an elevated risk of developing cancers. See Also: Novel compound halts cocaine addiction and relapse behaviors ""We were searching for proteins that influence the long-term effects of opioids,"" said TSRI Professor Kirill Martemyanov. ""In the short-term, opioids kill pain, but we were curious about mechanisms that lead to long-term adaptations that ultimately result in addiction. We screened for proteins that might possibly be involved in this process and what emerged was NF1."" The study, recently published in Current Biology, describes how NF1 influences opioid response through its impact on a signaling protein known as Ras in a part of the brain called the striatum, which is involved in decision making and reward. When the researchers deleted NF1 in striatal neurons of animal models, opioids failed to engage Ras and its downstream signaling reactions, dramatically diminishing the addictive effects of morphine. ""One of the peculiar symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 is that patients often suffer from chronic, unexplained pain,"" said Martemyanov.

Investigators have been looking for a biomarker in bladder cancer, and one emerging candidate is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Previous studies have linked an elevated NLR with worse overall survival after radical cystectomy, a surgery in which the entire bladder and nearby lymph nodes are removed. Other studies suggest NLR correlates with the amount of cancer found during surgery, meaning the blood test might predict which patients will benefit from pre-surgery chemotherapy to shrink their tumors. But new research led by Eric Ojerholm, MD, a resident physician in the department of Radiation Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, raises doubts about NLR as a biomarker. In contrast to previous studies, Dr. Ojerholm s team found NLR is not effective at predicting the overall survival of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Further, they found NLR was not helpful in determining which patients would benefit from chemotherapy before surgery. Ojerholm said the discrepancy between the findings of this study and previous work comes in the methodology.  Dozens of earlier studies reported NLR as a biomarker for bladder cancer, and we hoped that this would be true,  Ojerholm said.  Yet extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And all prior studies relied on observational datasets. Many also used statistical methods that can lead to false positive results. So we decided to rigorously put NLR to the test.  Ojerholm s team analyzed data that was collected in real-time during a prospective clinical trial, making this the first study of NLR in bladder cancer not to rely on observational data. The study analyzed SWOG 8710, which was a randomized Phase III trial of 317 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. All patients were treated with radical cystectomies. Half had pre-surgery chemotherapy, while the other half did not.  The trial we used has a few big advantages to study NLR,  Ojerholm said.  First, baseline blood samples were collected as part of the trial protocol. Second, the study s long-term follow-up gave us adequate  statistical power,  meaning that if NLR really was a biomarker, then we should be able to detect it. Third, the trial randomly assigned some patients to receive pre-surgery chemotherapy. This allowed us to test NLR both as a prognostic and predictive biomarker.  Of the 317 total patients, Ojerholm and his team identified 230 for a prognostic analysis to see if NLR could serve as a predictor of how long patients would live after curative treatment. They identified 263 others for a predictive analysis to see if NLR could tell which patients would respond to chemotherapy. There was a median follow-up of 18.6 years. For the prognostic analysis, NLR was not a significant factor in overall survival. The important factors were age and whether the patient received pre-surgery chemotherapy. For the predictive analysis, NLR did not predict which patients benefitted from chemotherapy. On the question of why most previous publications supported NLR as a biomarker, Ojerholm pointed to several factors beyond methodology and statistical design. ""There s also the problem of publication bias,  Ojerholm explained.  Sometimes authors won t submit negative results, and sometimes journals won t accept them. That could be a real issue as NLR research continues.  Ojerholm stressed that no single study is definitive, and doctors must weigh results from the entire literature.  Yet this study does raise questions about NLR for bladder cancer,  Ojerholm added,  and we need more evidence before using this biomarker in clinical practice.

Salmonella has a unique characteristic that allows the bacteria to penetrate through cell barriers and replicate inside its host. Now, scientists at the Cancer Research Center and the University of Missouri have developed a non-toxic strain of Salmonella to penetrate and target cancer cells. Results from this study could lead to promising new treatments that actively target and control the spread of cancer.  Salmonella strains have a natural preference for infiltrating and replicating within the cancer cells of a tumor, making the bacteria an ideal candidate for bacteriotherapy,  said Robert Kazmierczak, a senior investigator at the Cancer Research Center and a post-doctoral fellow in the Division of Biological Sciences in the MU College of Arts and Science.  Bacteriotherapy is the use of live bacteria as therapy to treat a medical condition, like cancer.  Kazmierczak and the team at the Cancer Research Center (CRC) developed CRC2631, a Salmonella strain that has been genetically modified to render the bacteria nontoxic and enhance its natural ability to target and kill cancer cells without harming normal, healthy cells. The Salmonella strain was administered directly into the circulatory system of mice with prostate cancer.  We found that the mice tolerated the treatment well and when examined, their prostate tumors decreased by about 20 percent compared to the control group,  Kazmierczak said.  One of the most remarkable aspects of Salmonella is its ability to target, spread and persist inside the tumor. We are taking advantage of this ability by using Salmonella to carry or generate effective chemotherapeutic drugs, concentrating them at and throughout the tumor. The goal of this treatment is to develop a bacterial vector that can destroy the tumor from the inside out and reduce the amount of side effects endured by patients with cancer.  CRC2631 is derived from a Salmonella sample that was stored in a test tube at room temperature for more than 50 years. The sample originates from the Demerec collection, a collection of mutant strains of Salmonella collected by geneticist Milisav Demerec and curated by Abraham Eisenstark, scientific director at the CRC and professor emeritus of biological sciences at MU. The collection contains over 20,000 different samples of Salmonella, with half of the samples housed at the Cancer Research Center where researchers affiliated with MU focus on three areas of cancer research: early detection, targeted treatment and new, effective chemotherapy.  The uniqueness of CRC2631 differentiates our Salmonella strains from other universities trying to achieve the same goal; it is one of a kind,  Eisenstark said.  The strain of Salmonella we are using is essential to the success of our study.  The study,  Salmonella Bacterial Monotherapy Reduces Autochthonous Prostate Tumor Burden in the TRAMP Mouse Model,  was recently published in PLOS ONE and was funded by the Cancer Research Center.

The study found that topical treatment of an Hsp60-containing gel dramatically accelerates wound closure in a diabetic mouse model. The study also describes the mechanism by which this works, finding that Hsp60 protein is released at the site of injury, signaling wound healing to initiate. The findings, reported by researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Eye Institute (NEI), and their colleagues, may help in the development of effective therapeutics for accelerating wound closure in diabetic patients, as well as for normal wound healing and scar reduction.  This study proposes an unusual role for a well-known gene,  said Shawn Burgess, Ph.D., head of NHGRI s Developmental Genomics Section and senior author on the study, which was published online in the journal npj Regenerative Medicine.  This gene is found in every organism from bacteria to man. We have shown that in vertebrates, it has a surprising role in immunity that is essential for wound healing.  Protein products of the Hsp60 gene are known primarily for their role in ensuring that other proteins are folded correctly. The Hsp60 protein has also been reported to serve as a signaling molecule that induces an inflammatory response to bacterial infection from a cut.  A major problem is that diabetes inhibits wound healing,  said Dr. Burgess.  The patients frequently get foot ulcers that never heal.  In fact, approximately 15 percent of diabetic patients will develop a foot ulcer, commonly located on the bottom of the foot. The ulcers form from multiple factors, such as reduced sensation in the feet, poor circulation and skin irritation. Foot ulcers can be serious and may lead to hospitalization or even amputation. Diabetes is the leading causes of non-traumatic lower limb amputation in the U.S. The researchers hope that greater insight into the genetics underlying wound healing can someday lead to better treatments for this condition and result in a better understanding of how tissues regenerate in general. Based on previous findings that the Hsp60 protein was necessary for an inflammatory response, the researchers hypothesized that the molecule might also be involved in an organisms  ability to regenerate. Using zebrafish   an ideal model for this work because fish can regenerate many tissues, including fins   the researchers used targeted mutagenesis, making specific and intentional changes to the DNA sequence of a gene, to  knock out  Hsp60 from the genome. The mutant fish appeared to develop normally, but when the researchers wounded them by injuring the cells involved in hearing or amputating a caudal fin, the fish were unable to regenerate their cells and fins, respectively. Using fluorescently tagged leukocytes (immune cells that flock to the site of injury as part of the inflammatory response under normal conditions), the researchers demonstrated that without the Hsp60 gene, there were significantly reduced numbers of leukocytes at the injury site. This suggested that the Hsp60 protein was somehow acting as an attractant that promoted inflammation, a necessary component of wound healing.  When we injected Hsp60 directly to the site of injury, the tissue surrounding the wound started to regenerate faster,  said Dr. Burgess.  That s when we got really excited.  However, the most striking finding from the study was that actually applying a topical treatment of the Hsp60 protein to a puncture wound in diabetic mice stimulated complete healing after only 21 days. Mice without the treatment did not show improvement over the same time frame. Although promising, this finding has only been shown in mice and is yet to be tested in humans.  We hope that topical treatment with Hsp60 will act the same way in humans,  said Dr. Burgess.  And we believe it will, but more work is needed. We also want to know if it will help any wound heal, not just wounds encountered by people with diabetes. Will it reduce scarring and increase the speed of healing?  This work opens many avenues for future research. Dr. Burgess  group is now working to test a number of other heat shock proteins to see if they are also involved in wound healing. This study reveals a potential for therapeutic development, but also highlights the value of basic science research. The fundamentals of cell signaling in wound healing and tissue regeneration are still poorly understood, with basic science research helping to clarify many important aspects of this complicated process.  When we understand the biology better, we can more easily apply it to human treatments,  Dr. Burgess said.

However, a new advance from MIT may bring this strategy, known as cancer immunotherapy, closer to becoming reality. In the new study, the researchers used a combination of four different therapies to activate both of the immune system s two branches, producing a coordinated attack that led to the complete disappearance of large, aggressive tumors in mice.  We have shown that with the right combination of signals, the endogenous immune system can routinely overcome large immunosuppressive tumors, which was an unanswered question,  says Darrell Irvine, a professor of biological engineering and of materials science and engineering, and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. This approach, which could be used to target many different types of cancer, also allows the immune system to  remember  the target and destroy new cancer cells that appear after the original treatment. Irvine and Dane Wittrup, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering and a member of the Koch Institute, are the senior authors of the study, which appears in the online edition of Nature Medicine. The paper s lead authors are MIT graduate student Kelly Moynihan and recent MIT PhD recipient Cary Opel. Multipronged attack Tumor cells often secrete chemicals that suppress the immune system, making it difficult for the body to attack tumors on its own. To overcome that, scientists have been trying to find ways to provoke the immune system into action, with most focusing their efforts on one or the other of the two arms of immunity   the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate system consists of nonspecific defenses such as antimicrobial peptides, inflammation-inducing molecules, and cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells. Scientists have tried to get this system to attack tumors by delivering antibodies that latch onto tumor cells and recruit the other cells and chemicals needed for a successful attack. Last year, Wittrup showed that delivering antibodies and IL-2, a signaling molecule that helps to boost immune responses, could halt the growth of aggressive melanoma tumors in mice for as long as the treatment was given. However, this treatment worked much better when the researchers also delivered T cells along with their antibody-IL2 therapy. T cells   immune cells that are targeted to find and destroy a particular antigen   are key to the immune system s second arm, the adaptive system. Around the same time, Irvine s lab developed a new type of T cell vaccine that hitches a ride to the lymph nodes by latching on to the protein albumin, found in the bloodstream. Once in the lymph nodes, these vaccines can stimulate production of huge numbers of T cells against the vaccine target. After both of those studies came out, Irvine and Wittrup decided to see if combining their therapies might produce an even better response.  We had this really good lymph-node-targeting vaccine that will drive very strong adaptive immunity, and they had this combination that was recruiting innate immunity very efficiently,  Irvine says.  We wondered if we could bring these two together and try to generate a more integrated immune response that would bring together all arms of the immune system against the tumor.  The resulting treatment consists of four parts: an antibody targeted to the tumor; a vaccine targeted to the tumor; IL-2; and a molecule that blocks PD1, a receptor found on T cells. Each of these molecules plays a critical role in enhancing the overall immune response to the tumor. Antibodies stimulate the recruitment of additional immune cells that help to activate T cells; the vaccine stimulates proliferation of T cells that can attack the tumor; IL-2 helps the T cell population to expand quickly; and the anti-PD1 molecule helps T cells stay active longer. Tumor elimination The researchers tested this combination treatment in mice that were implanted with three different types of tumors   melanoma, lymphoma, and breast cancer. These types of engineered tumors are much more difficult to treat than human tumors implanted in mice, because they suppress the immune response against them. The researchers found that in all of these strains of mice, about 75 percent of the tumors were completely eliminated. Furthermore, six months later, the researchers injected tumor cells into the same mice and found that their immune systems were able to completely clear the tumor cells.  To our knowledge, nobody has been able to take tumors that big and cure them with a therapy consisting entirely of injecting biomolecular drugs instead of transplanting T cells,  Wittrup says.  Exploiting the existing, endogenous, normal T cell repertoire of the tumor-bearing mouse (or human) overcomes the need for T cell transfer, making the therapy more readily applicable in the clinic,  says Willem Overwijk, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research.  Overall, this is a highly sophisticated, cleverly engineered combination therapy with many unique properties that result in very powerful anti-tumor activity,  Overwijk says.  After celebrating this exciting achievement, much work remains to be done to translate the learned lessons and observed principles into a therapeutic for patients with cancer.  Using this approach as a template, researchers could substitute other types of antibodies and vaccines to target different tumors. Another possibility that Irvine s lab is working on is developing treatments that could be used against tumors even when scientists don t know of a specific vaccine target for that type of tumor. The research was funded by the Koch Institute support core grant from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health, the Bridge Project partnership between the Koch Institute and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, the V Foundation, and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard.","Published: October 28, 2016"

It is important that forensic investigators have a reliable and nondestructive method of identifying these traces. Of equal importance is establishing the limitations of any method in use, including its detection limit. We have previously reported on the use of Raman microspectroscopy and multivariate data analysis to identify and differentiate body fluids. While many studies use serial dilutions to establish limits of detection, we utilized a different approach and demonstrated that a single red blood cell is sufficient to be correctly identified as blood. The experimental Raman spectra of individual red blood cells were loaded into the previously reported models for body fluid identification, and all were correctly classified as peripheral blood. These results demonstrate that our model can be used to identify peripheral blood, even if there is only a single red blood cell present. Furthermore, a single red blood cell is 5000  smaller than the amount of peripheral blood required to perform DNA analysis in a modern crime laboratory. This means that if a bloodstain is large enough for DNA analysis, Raman microspectroscopy should be able to make a positive identification. Considering that the sample analysis reported here was carried out with a different instrument, not the one used for the previously reported method development, these results also represent a form of method validation. The model s ability to correctly classify spectra acquired on a different instrumental platform is crucial in preparing it for practical application.

""The year has 16 months: November, December, January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, November, November, November,"" writes the Danish poet Henrik Nordbrandt in a disheartening comment on the month we are about to enter. See Also: Depression's physical source discovered; potential for new treatmentsAnd Nordbrandt is not the only one suffering in November. A recently published study documents that the number of people who are diagnosed with depression at psychiatric hospitals in Denmark increases immediately after the transition from daylight saving time to standard time. More specifically, the number of depression diagnoses during the month after the transition from daylight saving time is approximately eight per cent higher than expected based on the development in the number of diagnoses up to the transition. The study is based on analysis of 185,419 depression diagnoses registered in The Central Psychiatric Research Register between 1995 and 2012. According to Associate Professor S ren  stergaard from Aarhus University Hospital in Risskov, which is part of The Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus University, the increase in depression rates is too pronounced to be coincidental. S ren D.  stergaard is one of the five researchers behind the study, which is the result of a collaboration between departments of psychiatry and political science at the universities of Aarhus, Copenhagen and Stanford. ""We are relatively certain that it is the transition from daylight saving time to standard time that causes the increase in the number of depression diagnoses and not, for example, the change in the length of the day or bad weather. In fact, we take these phenomena into account in our analyses,"" says  stergaard. Learn More: Link found between depression and abnormal brain response to visceral pain in patients with IBS He also points out that even though the study is based on analysis of relatively severe depressions diagnosed at psychiatric hospitals, there is no reason to believe that the time transition only affects the propensity to develop more severe forms of depression. ""We expect that the entire spectrum of severity is affected by the transition from daylight saving time to standard time, and since depression is a highly prevalent illness, an increase of eight per cent corresponds to many cases"", says  stergaard. The study does not identify the underlying mechanism triggering the marked increase, but the researchers point to some possible causes. In Denmark, the transition from daylight saving time to standard time 'moves' one hour of daylight from the afternoon between 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm to the morning between 7:00 am - 8:00 am. ""We probably benefit less from the daylight in the morning between seven and eight, because many of us are either in the shower, eating breakfast or sitting in a car or bus on the way to work or school. When we get home and have spare time in the afternoon, it is already dark,"" explains  stergaard. ""Furthermore, the transition to standard time is likely to be associated with a negative psychological effect as it very clearly marks the coming of a period of long, dark and cold days,"" says  stergaard. Read Next: Patients with recurrent depression have smaller hippocampi Why are the results of the study important? The researcher from Aarhus University is not in doubt: ""Our results should give rise to increased awareness of depression in the weeks following the transition to standard time.

Furthermore the healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat depression should also take our results into consideration,"" says  stergaard.

No matter: you've still regained the weight you lost, even though you ate well and you exercised regularly. This may be due to a particular enzyme in the brain: the alpha/beta hydrolase domain-6 enzyme, better known as ABHD6. A study published in Cell Reports demonstrates that when this enzyme is blocked in certain neurons of the mouse hypothalamus, it becomes impossible for them to lose weight, even if they adhere to an ideal regimen... ideal for mice that is. See Also: Obesity is associated with brain s neurotransmitters A research team at the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM) has generated genetically engineered mice, deprived of the ABHD6 enzyme in a localized area of the brain, namely in a specific population of hypothalamic neurons. Alexandre Fisette, postdoctoral researcher at CRCHUM and first author of the study, explains that, ""under normal conditions of housing and food, these mice are identical to normal mice. However, when challenged, they are unable to adapt. They no longer consume food after a fast, they cannot maintain their body temperature during exposure to cold, and they are more susceptible to become obese when fed a high-fat diet. What's more, once they are obese and we try to make them lose weight by feeding them a normal diet, they do not lose weight."" The researchers have discovered that this enzyme acts as a sort of switch for the body's adjustment to extremes. ""It is a mechanism we had not suspected. Strikingly, the absence of one single enzyme within a precise region of the brain completely disrupts the normal metabolism and prevents the mice from losing weight,"" comments Thierry Alquier, CRCHUM researcher and professor at the University of Montreal. Is there an identical process taking place in humans? Thierry Alquier thinks that clinical studies will be required to find out. However, according to Alquier, ""ABHD6 has a key role in the rebound effect that is often observed after a dietary regimen. People who experience difficulty losing weight might have a deficiency of this enzyme."" Read Next: Mulling the marijuana munchies: How the brain flips the hunger switch Weight is controlled by several signals. Scientists have known for a long time that endocannabinoids (molecules secreted by the brain) are involved in the ingestion of nutrients and the expenditure of energy. The endocannabinoids stimulate appetite. Thus, this is an interesting area of exploration in the search for an appetite-suppressant drug. But all the products developed until now have been associated with serious side effects. The pursuit of the ABHD6 enzyme appears to be promising. In 2014, the team of Marc Prentki, another CRCHUM researcher, discovered that this enzyme breaks down endocannabinoids. Blocking ABHD6 in peripheral organs and adipose tissues protects against obesity and against type 2 diabetes. ""We know today that ABHD6 plays a completely different role in certain neurons of the hypothalamus. Blocking the enzyme in this location promotes obesity, whereas blocking it elsewhere in the body has beneficial effects,"" emphasizes Stephanie Fulton, CRCHUM researcher and study co-author. Multiple signals and neuronal networks are involved in regulating the balance of energy so as to maintain a stable body weight. ""We have shown the critical part played by the ABHD6 enzyme in preserving homeostasis in specific neurons of the hypothalamus. But we don't know what happens when we block the enzyme in the entire brain. This is what we are currently investigating in an ongoing study,"" the researcher explains.

The study results suggest that while training doesn't change neurological repair in chronic stroke patients, it can indeed help such patients learn new motor skills and achieve more independence in their daily lives. A report on the work is published in the journal Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair. ""What we found is that physical rehab is not going to change the weakness caused by damaged brain cells in chronic patients, but it is going to change how well they can perform certain tasks, which can have a huge impact on a patient's daily life,"" says Pablo Celnik, MD, director of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Johns Hopkins. Brain damage from strokes occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked (ischemic stroke) or a blood vessel feeding brain tissue ruptures (hemorrhagic stroke). Depending on the extent of the stroke, the damage can cause partial or total paralysis, affecting motor function, balance, speech, sensation and other physical activities. Chronic stroke patients are those whose physical impairments persist more than six months after the stroke. Rehabilitation specialists measure the damage using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), which measures the neurological damage wrought by a stroke on a scale from zero to 66. For the new study, the investigators recruited 10 chronic stroke patients with FMA scores of >50 out of 66 and categorized them as having ""mild to moderate"" functional deficits for the purposes of the study, and 10 other patients with FMA scores of <50 out of 66 and categorized them as having ""moderate to severe"" impairment. A third group of 10 able-bodied participants served as a control group. All of the study participants were trained to control a simple video game using a using a robotic piece of equipment that held their dominant arm at 90 degrees from their bodies. This eliminated gravity as a burden for those whose arms were weakened by their strokes. The subjects were then taught to use the muscles around their elbow to move a cursor across a screen into small target windows. Participants' performance in the game was measured during training sessions and skill assessment trials. A pre-training skill assessment was conducted to get a baseline from which to measure improvement. Participants were asked to move the cursor through the windows in time with a metronome and completed nine blocks of 10 trials at various speeds 24, 30, 38, 45, 60, 80, 100, 110 and 120 beats per minute. The metronome prevented participants from slowing down to improve their accuracy, so the only way to show improvement was by becoming more skilled at the task. The next phase of the experiment had participants attend 30-minute training sessions for four consecutive days. They were asked to complete five blocks of 30 trials, all at their own pace, and were encouraged to improve their speed and accuracy in each consecutive block. Following the training sessions, participants' skill levels were tested again in another skill assessment. Results showed that while each group's skill level improved by the end of the training, those with greater motor impairment still demonstrated less skill in both the pre- and post-training assessments. All participants reached a plateau in their improvement around experimental days three and four. However, the study showed that there was considerable overlap between the post-training performance of the stroke patients and the pre-training performance of groups with less impairment. ""When you look at the data, the post-training mild-to-moderate group is indistinguishable from the pre-training control group. And the same was true for post-training scores of those in the moderate-to-severe group and the mild-to-moderate group,"" says Robert Hardwick, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""This is good news for patients because it means that even when there is little likelihood of further neurological recovery, it means I can still teach them new tasks through training,"" says Celnik. ""What is important is to not create false expectations of neurological recovery, while at the same time being hopeful that patients can learn within the boundaries of their neurological deficit to improve their lives."" According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke each year. An estimated 5 million die, and another 5 million are left with lasting motor impairment. Celnik cautions that this study only included chronic stroke patients and that their future research plans include conducting similar studies in acute stroke patients those within three months of the stroke which could yield different results. ""Maybe there is a different impact of training in the earlier stages of stroke damage,"" says Celnik. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The researchers, led by a group from Osaka University in Japan in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, used a brain-machine interface to train a group of ten individuals to control a robotic arm with their brains. They found that if a patient tried to control the prosthetic by associating the movement with their missing arm, it increased their pain, but training them to associate the movement of the prosthetic with the unaffected hand decreased their pain. See Also: New prosthetic arm controlled by neural messagesTheir results, reported in the journal Nature Communications, demonstrate that in patients with chronic pain associated with amputation or nerve injury, there are 'crossed wires' in the part of the brain associated with sensation and movement, and that by mending that disruption, the pain can be treated. The findings could also be applied to those with other forms of chronic pain, including pain due to arthritis. Approximately 5,000 amputations are carried out in the UK every year, and those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at particular risk of needing an amputation. In most cases, individuals who have had a hand or arm amputated, or who have had severe nerve injuries which result in a loss of sensation in their hand, continue to feel the existence of the affected hand as if it were still there. Between 50 and 80 percent of these patients suffer with chronic pain in the 'phantom' hand, known as phantom limb pain. ""Even though the hand is gone, people with phantom limb pain still feel like there's a hand there - it basically feels painful, like a burning or hypersensitive type of pain, and conventional painkillers are ineffective in treating it,"" said study co-author Dr. Ben Seymour, a neuroscientist based in Cambridge's Department of Engineering. ""We wanted to see if we could come up with an engineering-based treatment as opposed to a drug-based treatment."" A popular theory of the cause of phantom limb pain is faulty 'wiring' of the sensorimotor cortex, the part of the brain that is responsible for processing sensory inputs and executing movements. In other words, there is a mismatch between a movement and the perception of that movement. Learn More: Engineer applies robot control theory to improve prosthetic legs In the study, Seymour and his colleagues, led by Takufumi Yanagisawa from Osaka University, used a brain-machine interface to decode the neural activity of the mental action needed for a patient to move their 'phantom' hand, and then converted the decoded phantom hand movement into that of a robotic neuroprosthetic using artificial intelligence techniques. ""We found that the better their affected side of the brain got at using the robotic arm, the worse their pain got,"" said Yanagisawa. ""The movement part of the brain is working fine, but they are not getting sensory feedback - there's a discrepancy there."" The researchers then altered their technique to train the 'wrong' side of the brain: for example, a patient who was missing their left arm was trained to move the prosthetic arm by decoding movements associated with their right arm, or vice versa. When they were trained in this counter-intuitive technique, the patients found that their pain significantly decreased. As they learned to control the arm in this way, it takes advantage of the plasticity - the ability of the brain to restructure and learn new things - of the sensorimotor cortex, showing a clear link between plasticity and pain. Read Next: Engineer applies robot control theory to improve prosthetic legs Although the results are promising, Seymour warns that the effects are temporary, and require a large, expensive piece of medical equipment to be effective. However, he believes that a treatment based on their technique could be available within five to ten years. ""Ideally, we'd like to see something that people could have at home, or that they could incorporate with physio treatments,"" he said. ""But the results demonstrate that combining AI techniques with new technologies is a promising avenue for treating pain, and an important area for future UK-Japan research collaboration.""

The commonly affected genes sets, identified with RNA sequencing methods, engage in making proteins, controlling brain cell communications and mounting an immune system response, the researchers say. ""There are subtle differences in individual genes, and these differences are enriched in sets of genes involved in specific cell processes in the brain tissue of people with a variety of severe mental disorders,"" says Sarven Sabunciyan, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics and researcher in the Stanley Division of Developmental Neurovirology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""It was striking to us that we could identify the broad functional overlaps, knowing there is a lot of variability among individuals with mental disorders."" See Also: Genetics in depression: What's known, what's next""It is important to show what these seemingly disparate diseases have in common, not only to learn more about them, but because common deficits could suggest similar treatment strategies,"" says Miranda Darby, PhD, a research fellow in Sabunciyan's laboratory and the first author on the study. A report on the work is published in Translational Psychiatry. For the study, the researchers took 100 tissue samples from donor brains gathered by the Stanley Medical Research Institute's (SMRI) Array Collection. All samples were from the hippocampus the seahorse-shaped part of the brain important for memory and spatial navigation. Thirty-five brains were from people with schizophrenia, 33 were from people with bipolar disorder and 32 were controls without a mental disorder. The research team also used 57 samples from a region of the brain's outer cortex near the eye, the orbitofrontal cortex, all gathered by SMRI's Neuropathy Consortium to verify that the findings in one part of the brain replicated in another part. Thirteen of those brain samples were from people with schizophrenia, 14 with bipolar disorder, 15 with major depression and 15 from controls. Of the total brain samples from both the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex, 57 were from women and 100 were from men. All but seven samples were from Caucasians, and the donors' ages ranged from 19 to 68 at the time of death. The researchers extracted and sequenced the mRNA genetic material that function as the blueprints created from DNA and used as guides by cells to build proteins from the tissue. The investigators report that each sample from the hippocampus produced on average 154 million sequenced bits of RNA and 140 million sequences for each brain sample from the orbitofrontal cortex. They then aligned the sequences from each sample with a fully sequenced human genome (version 19) and counted the number of times a sequence matched up to each individual gene. In all, 21,861 genes were represented in the hippocampus tissues, and 20,711 were represented in the orbitofrontal cortex region tissues. Related: Tapping crowd-sourced data unearths a trove of depression genes The researchers identified genes that make either more or less mRNA in individuals with mental disorders than in individuals without a mental disorder. They then compared the list of genes affected in each disorder to lists of genes grouped by their function in the cell, and identified which groups contained a disproportionate number of genes with either increased or decreased mRNA in individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The team reports that out of a total of 1,070 gene sets, 13 of these groups changed in common ways among all three mental disorders. Of these, nine groups containing a total of 338 genes included ribosomal genes, genes responsible for making proteins. A subset of 80 of those protein-making genes was in each of the nine sets, and most of these, the team says, were turned on, or activated, at higher levels compared to controls. For example, in samples from brains of people with bipolar disorder, 78 of these genes were turned on higher in the hippocampus, and 79 were turned on higher in the orbitofrontal cortex than controls. In both regions of the brain, samples from people with major depression had 78 of the genes turned up higher than controls. In people with schizophrenia, 56 genes were turned up in the hippocampus, and 52 were turned up in the orbitofrontal cortex higher than the controls. ""Although there isn't a clear reason why the brains of people with these mental disorders would have more of the protein production machinery, we think our findings suggest that it's a fruitful line of investigation to pursue,"" says Sabunciyan. The remaining four gene groups in common among the brain tissue from all three sets of those with mental illness were ""turned down"" compared to the controls, the team reported. Two of the gene sets have clear roles in how the brain's neurons send and receive messages to neighboring cells, with one set making up general neuron genes and the other specific to GABA, a neurotransmitter used as the actual messenger between neurons. Another gene group is believed to help operate the ways in which the immune system mounts a response to foreign and potentially threatening antigens, biological molecules presented by a virus, bacterium or parasite. The researchers say that disruption of the immune system is a hallmark feature long observed in some people with mental illness, particularly in schizophrenia and, to a lesser extent, in bipolar disorder. Read Next: Scientists find genetic overlap between happiness and depression The fourth gene set included genetic components involved in endocytosis -- the process used to engulf biological molecules outside the cell and bring them inside. When neurons suck up neurotransmitters for recycling after they have been sent or received as a message, they use endocytosis. Endocytosis also plays a role in the immune system's process of engulfing and disposing of germs. Sabunciyan says the research team plans to study these changes in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients, which also show an increase in ribosomal gene expression. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 1 percent of adults develop schizophrenia, about 2.5 percent have bipolar disorder and almost 7 percent of people develop major depression over their lifetimes.

The research was presented at the annual Grand Challenges Meeting of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in London on Oct. 26, 2016. The Gates Foundation provided funding for the Atreca antibody research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) provided funding for the studies led by Emory. Carl Davis, MD, PhD, a research fellow in the laboratory of Emory Vaccine Director Rafi Ahmed, and Guy Cavet, PhD, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Atreca, presented the research. Emory University Hospital treated four patients with Ebola virus disease in Fall of 2014 and, with the patients  permission, collected samples of their blood for further research. Using Atreca s Immune Repertoire Capture  (IRC ) technology and methods previously described in the Ahmed lab, the research team was able to isolate antibodies from the blood of the survivors. These antibodies were evaluated by a DARPA-funded consortium that included teams at the Aaron Diamond Aids Research Center, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Scripps Research Institute, Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). ""This collaborative research has allowed us to broaden our understanding of the Ebola virus, as well as related viruses such as Marburg virus,"" says Ahmed. ""We have learned a great deal about how the human immune system can develop effective antibodies against the Ebola virus and which parts of the virus may be most vulnerable to the immune response. The identification of neutralizing antibodies that can protect against a viral challenge from so few patients so quickly is also a very exciting outcome, offering the potential for further research that we hope can lead to both therapeutic agents and vaccines against a rapidly evolving Ebola virus.""","Published: October 27, 2016"

Researchers led by Professor Dr. Magdalena G tz, Chair of Physiological Genomics at LMU and Director of the Institute for Stem Cell Research at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, have shown in collaboration with Professor Dr. Gunnar Schotta, Biomedical Center LMU, that epigenetic mechanisms which are brought into play at an early stage of neurogenesis, have an important impact on the subsequent fate of neurons. These new findings appear in Genes and Development, a leading journal in the field of developmental biology.In order to elucidate the significance of early epigenetic modifications on the development of neural cells during embryogenesis in the mouse, G tz and her colleagues specifically inactivated the gene Uhrf1. This gene is known to control a number of epigenetic functions, including DNA methylation, and is active from very early stages of neurogenesis. The methylation of specific nucleotide bases in DNA often serves to switch genes off. Conditional knockout of Uhrf1, in a region of the forebrain, led to the activation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERV) in the genome, which are otherwise silenced by methylation. Further investigation revealed that members of the Tet family of enzymes are largely mediating the demethylation of the ERVs, thus appearing be functionally activated in the absence of Uhrf1. Moreover, these ERVs remained active not only in later stages of embryogenesis but also into postnatal stages, suggesting that their activation is non-reversible. The aberrant and ongoing activation of ERVs caused an accumulation of retroviral proteins in the affected cells and deregulation of genes and pathways. This in turn led to the progressive disruption of vital cellular processes and ultimately precipitated a massive wave of cell death.  Our results reveal that certain key factors   such as the gene Uhrf1   that are transiently activated only in early neurogenesis can have a crucial impact on cell fate, which may only manifest weeks later,  says G tz.  Our model system provides us with fascinating insights into these mechanisms, which are also of great interest in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. ","Published: October 27, 2016"

This discovery reverses food allergies in mice, and we have many people with allergies volunteering their own cells for us to use in lab testing to move this research forward,  said professor John Gordon, lead scientist behind the discovery just published in the current issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The findings open the door to test this new allergy treatment in  humanized mice mice with non-existent immune systems implanted with cells from a human immune system, for example, from a peanut-allergic person. With Health Canada approval, the first human trial could begin in about one year, Gordon said.   If we can reliably  cure  food allergies, or related conditions such as asthma or autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis with this new therapy, it would be life-changing for affected individuals.  Roughly 2.5 million Canadians self-report having at least one food allergy.  Anaphylaxis, defined as a severe rapid-onset allergic reaction, can be life-threatening and treatment options are limited. The discovery involves generating a type of naturally occurring immune cell that sends a signal to reverse the hyper-immune response present in allergic reactions.  That signal triggers another  off switch  that turns off reactive cells further along the allergic pathway.   We predict the treatment could be on the market within the next five to 10 years,  said Gordon, who is also a research leader in the Allergy, Genes and Environment (AllerGen) Network. AllerGen part of the federally funded Networks of Centres of Excellence program aims to help Canadians address the challenges of living with asthma, allergies, anaphylaxis and related immune diseases. Gordon s team will collaborate with other AllerGen investigators located at the U of S, McGill University, Queen s University, McMaster University, and University of Alberta to pilot the new technique.  This discovery portends a major breakthrough towards a therapeutic reversal of food allergen sensitivity,  said Dr. Judah Denburg, scientific director and CEO of AllerGen.  The treatment prevents anaphylactic responses in what were previously fully sensitive mice, opening the door for translating this therapy into the clinic.  There is compelling evidence this technique could be effective in humans.  In 2010, Gordon s team demonstrated they could reverse an asthmatic response in human cells in a test tube. Using three applications of a similar therapy in a 2012 study, the researchers effectively eliminated asthma in afflicted mice, within only eight weeks.  Even if we only cure 25 per cent of subjects, we will dramatically improve the health of those individuals, and also reduce healthcare system expenses,  said Gordon, who worked with Wojciech Dawicki, a research associate and the primary author and lead researcher in this study. Master s student Chunyan Li and lab technicians Xiaobei Zhang and Jennifer Town also worked on the project.","Published: October 27, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/geneediting-cures-genetic-blood-disorder-in-mice-195440,Gene Editing Cures Genetic Blood Disorder in Mice New technology may offer minimally invasive treatment for genetic disorders of the blood  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.A next-generation gene-editing system developed by Carnegie Mellon University and Yale University scientists has cured a genetic blood disorder in living mice using a simple IV treatment. Unlike the popular CRISPR gene-editing technique, the new technology can be administered to living animals and significantly decreases unwanted, off-target gene mutations. The findings, reported in Nature Communications, offer a new therapeutic approach to treat genetic diseases of the blood like beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease by targeting faulty genes in hematopoietic stem cells. The novel system relies on state-of-the-art peptide nucleic acid (PNA) molecules, a synthetic nucleotide technology that has been pioneered at Carnegie Mellon s Center for Nucleic Acids Science and Technology (CNAST).  We have developed a system that uses FDA-approved nanoparticles to deliver our PNA molecule along with a donor DNA to repair a malfunctioning gene in living mice. This has not been achieved with CRISPR,  said Danith Ly, professor of chemistry in Carnegie Mellon s Mellon College of Science and an expert in PNA chemistry. Gene-editing technologies like CRISPR rely on DNA-cutting enzymes to slice open DNA at a target site to edit a specific gene. The problem with this is twofold. First, the enzymes are large and therefore difficult to administer directly to living animals, so scientists typically remove the cells, treat them in the lab and then put them back into the body. Second, once inside a cell, the enzymes could indiscriminately cut DNA at sites other than the original gene target. The new Carnegie Mellon/Yale system avoids both issues. The new system consists of biocompatible nanoparticles containing PNAs, small nano-sized synthetic molecules in which a protein-like backbone is combined with the nucleobases found in DNA and RNA. PNA is designed to open up double-stranded DNA and bind near the target site in a highly specific manner without cutting cell s own DNA repair pathways to correct the malfunctioning HBB gene. In addition to testing the system on both mouse and human bone marrow stem cells in the lab, the research team also administered the fully-loaded nanoparticles intravenously to mice models of beta anything. And the PNAs easily fit inside the nanoparticle delivery system, which is FDA-approved and has already been used to treat neurodegenerative diseases in humans. In the latest research, Ly and a former graduate student Raman Bahal designed a PNA to target the malfunctioning gene in beta thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Less hemoglobin leads to a lack of oxygen throughout the body, which can cause a host of problems including pale skin, weakness, fatigue and more serious complications. Together with Peter Glazer s team at Yale, the researchers loaded up the nanoparticles with the PNAs, a donor strand of DNA encoding the sequence for a functional hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene and a stem cell factor that enhances gene editing. When the PNA binds to the target site in the DNA, it forms a PNA-DNA-PNA triplex, leaving a displaced DNA strand. Formation of such a complex enables the donor DNA to bind to the faulty DNA site within the vicinity. Taken together, this altered helix engages the thalassemia. The results showed up to 7 percent successful gene editing in hematopoietic stem cells and an elevated level of hemoglobin for several months after treatment. This represented a striking increase over typical gene editing methods that produce only a 0.1 percent success rate.  The effect may only be 7 percent, but that s curative,  Ly said.  In the case of this particular disease model, you don t need a lot of correction. You don t need 100 percent to see the phenotype return to normal.  According to the researchers, this work yields two key advances for gene editing. The first is the PNA itself. Ly used next-generation PNA chemistry to design a PNA molecule called a gamma-PNA with a polyethylene glycol group on the side chain. This innovation makes the PNA water-soluble and biocompatible, which means that it doesn t bind to proteins and other biomolecules in a non-specific manner. Additionally, the specific stereochemistry of the polyethylene glycol group pre-organizes the PNA into a right-handed helical motif, making it bind to DNA more readily. The second advance is the finding that the addition of the stem cell factor promotes increased gene editing.","Published: October 27, 2016"

The soap molecules also worked better than some conventional soaps in challenging conditions such as cold water and hard water. The technology has been patented by the University of Minnesota and is licensed to the new Minnesota-based startup company Sironix Renewables. The new study is now online and will be published in the next issue of the American Chemical Society s ACS Central Science, a leading journal in the chemical sciences. Authors of the study include researchers from the University of Minnesota, University of Delaware, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Sironix Renewables, and the U.S. Department of Energy s Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation and Argonne National Laboratory.  Our team created a soap molecule made from natural products, like soybeans, coconut and corn, that works better than regular soaps and is better for the environment,  said Paul Dauenhauer, a University of Minnesota associate professor of chemical engineering and materials science and a co-author of the study.  This research could have a major impact on the multibillion-dollar cleaning products industry.  Conventional soaps and detergents are viewed as environmentally unfriendly because they are made from fossil fuels. When formulated into shampoos, hand soaps, or dishwashing detergents, these soaps are mixed with many additional difficult-to-pronounce and harmful chemicals that are washed down the drain. Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, researchers from the Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation developed a new chemical process to combine fatty acids from soybeans or coconut and sugar-derived rings from corn to make a renewable soap molecule called Oleo-Furan-Surfactant (OFS). They found that OFS worked well in cold water where conventional soaps become cloudy and gooey rendering them unusable. Additionally, OFS soaps were shown to form soap particles (called micelles) necessary for cleaning applications at low concentrations, which significantly reduces the environmental impact on rivers and lakes. The new renewable OFS soap was also engineered to work in extremely hard water conditions. For many locations around the world, minerals in the water bind with conventional soaps and turn them into solid goo.   I think everybody has had the problem of trying to get shampoo out of their hair in hard water it just doesn t come out,  said Dauenhauer. To combat this problem, most existing soaps and detergents add an array of additional chemicals, called chelants, to grab these minerals and prevent them from interfering with soap molecules. This problem has led to a long list of extra chemical ingredients in most conventional cleaning products, many of which are harmful to the environment. The new OFS soap eliminates the hard water problem by using a naturally derived source that does not bind strongly to minerals in water. The researchers found that OFS molecules were shown to form soap particles (micelles) even at 100 times the conventional hard water conditions. Thus, a cleaning product s ingredient list could be significantly simplified.  The impact of OFS soaps will be greater than their detergent performance,  said University of Minnesota chemical engineering and materials science graduate student Kristeen Joseph.  OFS is made from straight carbon chains derived from soybeans or coconut which can readily biodegrade. These are really the perfect soap molecules. ","Published: October 27, 2016"

The Solana molecular platform leverages the Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) technology that is resident in Quidel's AmpliVue  molecular product line to generate a fast and accurate test result. Solana can process up to 12 patient samples in each 25-minute run, thereby providing time-saving workflow advantages to healthcare professionals in moderately complex settings. ""We are very pleased to receive FDA clearance for a definitive, comprehensive diagnostic for Streptococcal infections, and along with our recently-cleared Solana Influenza A+B Assay, comes just in time for the upcoming respiratory disease season,"" said Douglas Bryant, president and chief executive officer of Quidel Corporation. ""With the Solana system, we've given moderately complex labs what they want: a platform that provides definitive test results quickly, and in a scalable connected format with a low total cost of ownership. We believe that Solana's utility and value will continue to increase with the launch of each additional assay."" Solana  Strep Complete is Quidel's fourth molecular diagnostic test to receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA in the scalable and versatile Solana format. Solana  Influenza A+B received 510(k) clearance in September, Solana  Trichomonas assay received 510(k) clearance in August, and Solana  Group A Strep assay was cleared in June 2015. With the Solana franchise, Quidel has grown its number of molecular platforms that are FDA cleared and available commercially: non-instrumented AmpliVue  for lower-volume moderately complex labs; and Lyra  reagents for higher throughput, highly complex laboratories with existing PCR infrastructure. 1. http://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-hcp/strep-throat.html2. http://www.cdc.gov/Features/strepthroat/3.

I m particularly pleased that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is supporting this exciting endeavour. When the Government established the ISIF, we wanted to encourage new investment and job creation across Ireland in groundbreaking new sectors such as next generation healthcare solutions. With the combination of world-class talent backed by global investors, I ve no doubt that the scientific platform developed by Genomics Medicine Ireland will be leading the way on new prevention strategies and treatments for diseases and rare conditions.  This investment will enable GMI to undertake comprehensive population-scale genome studies. These will improve understanding of the genetic and lifestyle factors involved in disease, contributing to better diagnostics, more targeted therapies, and more effective prevention and wellness. GMI expects to announce its first collaboration with an Irish hospital in the coming weeks and is actively engaged in talks with a number of clinical collaborators island wide. Daniel Crowley, acting CEO of GMI said,  We look forward to working closely with the Irish healthcare system to develop better diagnostics and new means to optimise health and patient outcomes. The size and characteristics of the Irish population can powerfully advance scientific discovery as researchers are able to pinpoint variations in DNA relevant to disease and useful for improving medicine.  Genomics Medicine Ireland is creating a scientific platform to examine the human genome in order to better understand the role of genetics in disease and rare conditions, and to lead to new prevention strategies and treatments. The company was founded in Ireland last year by a group of leading life science entrepreneurs, investors and researchers, and now includes, among its founders, Amgen. The GMI platform is based on the pioneering work of Amgen s subsidiary, deCODE genetics, in Iceland, widely recognised as the birthplace of population genomics. deCODE s approach, led by its founder and CEO Dr. K ri Stef nsson, has proven that population genome studies offer an effective system for elucidating the underlying biology of major diseases and identifying new drug targets. The application in Ireland of the approach pioneered at deCODE will further broaden the power of this model to make and validate such discoveries and apply them to benefit patients. The collection, management and analysis of genomic data will help drive development of novel therapeutic drugs and diagnostics in collaboration with leading academic and corporate partners. Ireland has a large and thriving pharmaceuticals sector, and GMI aims to apply and build on this expertise to open new avenues of innovation and value creation. GMI s research has already been met with great enthusiasm by potential pharmaceutical partners.

The discovery, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, will open up new avenues not only to novel and more precise therapies, but also to a successful prediction and prevention of chronic rhinitis and asthma caused or aggravated by allergy to house dust mites.The study team was led by Professor Paolo Maria Matricardi, head of the Molecular Allergology Group at the Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Immunology of the Charit  and included researchers from the Medical University of Vienna, led by Prof. Rudolf Valenta, and statisticians from Rome, Italy. The team examined the data and blood samples prospectively collected over 20 years from a cohort of 722 German children born in 1990 and monitored since their birth in the framework of the Multicenter Allergy Study (MAS). Purified or engineered molecules of the mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus were used with nanotechnology procedures to characterize the origins and evolution of the antibody response during the children s first decades of life The scientists found that IgE-antibodies against three dust mite molecules (Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 23) appeared very early in the children s blood, often before the onset of their disease. In some (but not all) children, this first step was followed by a  cascade  of events involving other mite molecules, through a phenomenon defined as  molecular spreading . Children producing IgE to many molecules ( polymolecular sensitization ) had a higher risk of developing allergic rhinitis and asthma. Earlier onset of allergic sensitization, high exposure to house dust mite allergens, and having one or both parents affected by hay fever increased the risk of polymolecular sensitization. Interestingly, healthy pre-school children showing IgE antibodies to Der p 1 or Der p 23 developed more frequently asthma at school age. These and other molecules may be used for disease prevention in early life and to precisely tailor allergen immunotherapy in pediatric and adult patients.   Mite allergy develops in childhood like an avalanche. It starts early with only one or a very few molecules and then grows to many , says Dr Daniela Posa, first Author of the publication. ""The greater the spreading of molecular sensitization, the highest the risk of developing Asthma."" PD. Dr. Matricardi adds:  Our findings open new perspectives to the use of mite allergen molecules for prediction, prevention and therapy of allergic rhinitis and asthma caused or triggered by House Dust Mites.

(Illustration by Christina Corbaci and Leopold Kong.) Researchers have been trying for decades to develop a vaccine against the globally endemic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Now scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have discovered one reason why success has so far been elusive. Using a sophisticated array of techniques for mapping tiny molecular structures, the TSRI scientists analyzed a lab-made version of a key viral protein, which has been employed in some candidate HCV vaccines to induce the body s antibody response to the virus. The researchers found that the part of this protein meant as the prime target of the vaccine is surprisingly flexible. Presenting a wide variety of shapes to the immune system, it thus likely elicits a wide variety of antibodies, most of which cannot block viral infection.  Because of that flexibility, using this particular protein in HCV vaccines may not be the best way to go,  said co-senior author TSRI Associate Professor Mansun Law.  We may want to engineer a version that is less flexible to get a better neutralizing response to the key target site and not so many off-target responses,  said co-senior author Ian A. Wilson, TSRI s Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and a member of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI. The report, published online ahead of print by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of October 24, 2016, is likely to lead to new and better HCV vaccine designs. A Great Need A working vaccine against this liver-infecting virus is needed desperately. HCV infection continues to be a global pandemic, affecting an estimated 130 to 150 million people worldwide and causing about 700,000 deaths annually from liver diseases including cancer. Although powerful antiviral drugs have been developed recently against HCV, their extremely high costs are far beyond the reach of the vast majority of people living with HCV infection. Moreover, antiviral treatment usually comes too late to prevent liver damage; HCV infection is notorious for its ability to smoulder silently within, producing no obvious symptoms until decades have passed. The Law and Wilson laboratories have been working together in recent years to study HCV s structure for clues to successful vaccine design. In 2013, for example, the team successfully mapped the atomic structure of the viral envelope protein E2, including the site where it binds to surface receptors on liver cells. Because this receptor-binding site on E2 is crucial to HCV s ability to infect its hosts, it has an amino-acid sequence that is relatively invariant from strain to strain. The receptor-binding site is also relatively accessible to antibodies, and indeed many of the antibodies that have been found to neutralize a broad set of HCV strains do so by targeting this site. For all these reasons, HCV s receptor-binding site has been considered an excellent target for a vaccine. But although candidate HCV vaccines mimicking the E2 protein have elicited high levels of antibodies against the receptor-binding site, these antibody responses in both animal models and human clinical trials have not been very effective at preventing HCV infection of liver cells in laboratory assays. Enormous Flexibility To understand why, the Law and Wilson laboratories teamed up with TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward and used electron microscopy and several other advanced structural analysis tools to take a closer look at HCV s E2 protein, in particular the dynamics of its receptor binding site. Their investigations focused on the  recombinant  form of the E2 protein, produced in the lab and therefore isolated from the rest of the virus. Recombinant E2 is a prime candidate for HCV vaccine design and is much easier to purify and study than E2 from whole virus particles. One finding was that recombinant E2, probably due to its many strong disulfide bonds, has great structural stability, with an unusually high melting point of 85 C. However, the TSRI scientists also found evidence that, within this highly buttressed construction, the receptor binding site portion is extraordinarily loose and flexible in the recombinant protein.  It adopts a very wide range of conformations,  said study first author Leopold Kong, of TSRI at the time of the study, now at the National Institutes of Health. Prior studies have shown that HCV s receptor binding site adopts a narrow range of conformations (shapes) when bound by virus-neutralizing antibodies. A vaccine that elicited high levels of antibodies against only these key conformations would in principle provide effective protection. But this study suggests that the E2 protein used in candidate vaccines displays far too many other binding-site conformations and thus elicits antibodies that mostly do nothing to stop the actual virus. Law and Wilson and their colleagues plan to follow up by studying E2 and its receptor binding site as they are presented on the surface of the actual virus. They also plan to design a new version of E2 or even an entirely different scaffold protein, on which the receptor binding site is stabilized in conformations that will elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies.","Published: October 27, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/startup-seeks-more-precise-prostate-cancer-screening-210064,Startup Seeks More Precise Prostate Cancer Screening  Gregor Diagnostics aims to bring a non invasive prostate cancer screening test to the market  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. While discussing inventions awaiting commercialization at the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, Tobias Zutz stumbled across one with an uncanny match to his resume. Zutz was an early employee at Exact Sciences, a Madison firm that has developed a screening test for colon cancer based on colon cells excreted in the stool. The discovery in question described a new way to identify cancerous prostate cells. The inventor, David Jarrard, a professor of urology at the UW Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, had found eight tell-tale molecular structures on genes during a decades-long quest to detect prostate cancer in men while it was still treatable. The prostate-specific antigen screening test for prostate cancer, which was introduced with great fanfare in 1994, identified many slow-growing cancers that were unlikely to cause harm. The result   unnecessary surgeries   led to a reduction in its use for screening; about 30 percent of men aged 50 to 69 now get the PSA for screening. The PSA is also used to track the effects of prostate cancer treatment. Zutz, a Manitowoc, Wisconsin, native with a bachelor s degree in genetics and biochemistry and a master s in biotechnology, both from UW Madison, says he helped develop Exact s Cologuard product  from an idea through FDA approval.  The experience sharpened his interest in Jarrard s biomarker discovery. In discussions with Jarrard, they concluded that it would be logical to look for the suspicious genes in seminal fluid   30 percent of which is made by the prostate.  I saw a big need for a new screening test for prostate cancer, and I had this experience using a sample source that had been neglected but gave a real biological advantage in its excellent access to the organ that concerns you.  In February 2016, Zutz formed Gregor Diagnostics to bring a prostate cancer screening test to market. The company obtained an option to license some of Jarrard s patent-pending biomarkers from WARF for detecting cancer in seminal fluid. Success will take years, but if the non-invasive screening test works, it could aid in early detection of a cancer that kills about 26,000 American men every year. That makes it the second deadliest cancer for men. Jarrard and his collaborators identified the genes in question through a quest for a reliable marker to distinguish healthy cells from cancerous ones.  The search focused on markers attached to genes that change their structure and perhaps affect their activity, Jarrard says.  These markers amount to a  fingerprint  for prostate cancer, and are present in prostate tissue, and are even found in normal looking tissue distant from the cancer. If, as we expect, they are present in seminal fluid, the same advantage of improved sensitivity should apply.  The once-promising PSA test is the backdrop for interest in a better prostate cancer screening technique, Jarrard says.  I coined the term  post-PSA era  to focus attention on this question: Can we come up with a better approach to screening?  Zutz has just finished the gBETA accelerator program in Madison.  We concentrated on early stage development, working to define the product more clearly and put out a roadmap for development and financing,  he says. The priority now is to raise money to fund research to prove if Jarrard s biomarkers are present in semen only in men who have current or developing prostate cancer. However, demonstrating that biomarkers herald prostate cancer is only half the battle. To supplant the PSA, and reduce the over-diagnosis problem, the incipient test must distinguish inactive cancers from aggressive ones. The potential is there, Zutz says, noting that Jarrard s experiments have shown an association between certain markers and aggressive cancers. Another hurdle concerns sample collection.  Males in general don t like going to the doctor, and it would be awkward to go into a doctor s office and collect the sample,  Jarrard says.  In the privacy of your own home, it s perhaps easier.  The test that Gregor Diagnostics envisions  could be a way for a man to take control of his health care. The physician could order the test and the patient would get the results at home, and only return to the doctor if necessary,  Jarrard says.  Ideally, the results could help reassure him that he has a very low risk of prostate cancer.  Due to over-diagnosis and unnecessary surgeries, prostate cancer screening with the PSA has been declining for almost a decade, Zutz says.  But cancer is not going away just because we are not looking for it. Let s not abandon cancer screening, let s develop a better screening test.  Hurdles remain, and obtaining FDA approval is never simple or cheap, Zutz says.  My background in research and development shows that a lot of experiments fail. You get used to that, but you overcome the little setbacks and keep working until you cross the finish line. ","Published: October 27, 2016"

The treatment, called epicutaneous immunotherapy or EPIT, was safe and well-tolerated, and nearly all participants used the skin patch daily as directed. The ongoing trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR), which is led by Hugh Sampson, M.D., of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Stacie Jones, M.D., of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children s Hospital, chairs the study. One-year outcomes are published online on October 26 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.  To avoid potentially life-threatening allergic reactions, people with peanut allergy must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter, which can be very stressful,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  One goal of experimental approaches such as epicutaneous immunotherapy is to reduce this burden by training the immune system to tolerate enough peanut to protect against accidental ingestion or exposure.  CoFAR researchers at five study sites randomly assigned 74 peanut-allergic volunteers aged 4 to 25 years to treatment with either a high-dose (250 micrograms peanut protein), low-dose (100 micrograms peanut protein), or placebo patch. The investigators assessed peanut allergy at the beginning of the study with a supervised, oral food challenge with peanut-containing food. The patches were developed and provided by the biopharmaceutical company DBV Technologies under the trade name Viaskin. Each day, study participants applied a new patch to their arm or between their shoulder blades. After one year, researchers assessed each participant s ability to consume at least 10 times more peanut protein than he or she was able to consume before starting EPIT. The low-dose and high-dose regimens offered similar benefits, with 46 percent of the low-dose group and 48 percent of the high-dose group achieving treatment success, compared with 12 percent of the placebo group. In addition, the peanut patches induced immune responses similar to those seen with other investigational forms of immunotherapy for food allergy. Investigators observed greater treatment effects among children aged 4 to 11 years, with significantly less effect in participants aged 12 years and older.  The clinical benefit seen in younger children highlights the promise of this innovative approach to treating peanut allergy,  said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT).  Epicutaneous immunotherapy aims to engage the immune system in the skin to train the body to tolerate small amounts of allergen, whereas other recent advances have relied on an oral route that appears difficult for approximately 10 to 15 percent of children and adults to tolerate.  Nearly all the study participants followed the EPIT regimen as directed. None reported serious reactions to the patch, although most experienced mild skin reactions, such as itching or rash, at the site of patch application.  The high adherence to the daily peanut patch regimen suggests that the patch is easy-to-use, convenient and safe,  said Marshall Plaut, chief of DAIT s Food Allergy, Atopic Dermatitis and Allergic Mechanisms Section.  The results of this study support further investigation of epicutaneous immunotherapy as a novel approach for peanut allergy treatment. ","Published: October 27, 2016"

To help address that need in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone   the countries most affected by the epidemic   the National Institutes of Health has established a new program to strengthen the research capacity to study Ebola, Lassa fever, yellow fever and other emerging viral diseases. In the initiative s first funding round, NIH s Fogarty International Center is awarding grants to four U.S. institutions that will partner with West African academic centers to design training programs for their scientists and health researchers. The collaborations aim to develop research training proposals that would strengthen the skills required to evaluate vaccines, develop new diagnostic tests and treatments, and identify the most effective intervention strategies for disease outbreaks. These planning grants, totaling $200,000, are intended to help institutions prepare to compete for larger, longer-term Fogarty grants to implement research training programs.  We hope these awards will catalyze efforts to identify existing resources and plan to address development of sustainable research capacity in the countries that suffered so horribly from Ebola,  said Fogarty Director Roger I. Glass, M.D., Ph.D.  By training local researchers in epidemiology and lab skills, and helping them form networks with U.S. scientists, we believe future disease outbreaks can be better contained.  This new Fogarty training initiative was developed in response to a World Health Organization (WHO) assessment that noted weak health systems, poor disease surveillance and inadequate research and development resources were among the factors contributing to the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. The program targets the neighboring countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where more than 28,000 Ebola cases and 11,000 deaths were reported, according to the WHO.  The three countries are recovering from conflicts and have fragile health systems. In the first funding round, awards are supporting one partnership in Liberia and three collaborations in Sierra Leone. Yale University in Connecticut is partnering with the University of Liberia to design a research training program focused on epidemiology and predictive transmission modeling. Based in the capital city of Monrovia, the university is Liberia s flagship institution for higher education and has a medical school with roughly 200 students. The lead investigators from both countries collaborated on research during the Ebola crisis. Scientists from Duke University in North Carolina are building on existing relationships with colleagues at the University of Sierra Leone s College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS), located in the capital city of Freetown. Their joint training plan intends to focus on clinical research for local scientists so they can quickly implement trials for vaccines and therapeutics during a disease outbreak. COMAHS, founded in 1988, is the country s first medical school and has 1,500 students. Nearby Connaught Hospital, a 120-bed facility, is a partner on the project. COMAHS is also the collaborating institution on an award to Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee. This project aims to plan a research capacity building program in implementation science and clinical trial management to address Ebola, Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. The primary training site will be the Kenema Government Hospital, located in a region with the world s highest incidence of Lassa fever. The hospital, which contains the country s only Lassa fever laboratory, has a previously established research relationship with Tulane University in Louisiana. A Tulane scientist will also collaborate on the training project. Another investigator at Tulane University is receiving funding to assess the research training needs of Sierra Leone s Njala University, which graduates a substantial number of allied health workers. Its main campus is in Njala, about 125 miles east of the capital, and includes a 50-bed hospital and laboratories that serve the city and surrounding communities. A second campus, about 35 miles away in Bo, has two health centers. The project aims to develop a strategic plan for research training, which may include distance learning opportunities since Njala has already invested in computer labs and high-speed internet.","Published: October 27, 2016"

That could accelerate the gathering of information used to map the functions of brain cells and ultimately provide a better understanding what s going on between our ears. The technique would be used in a recording method known as patch-clamping, in which a tiny liquid-filled glass pipette is connected to individual neurons. Since patch-clamping was invented three decades ago, the technique has required changing pipettes between recordings   a manual process that slows research. Now, a robotic cleaning technique developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology allows the pipettes to be reused for as many as 11 recordings   and potentially more   allowing the recording to be more automated.  This is a step toward revolutionizing the robotic techniques in neuroscience,  said Craig Forest, associate professor in Georgia Tech s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering.  We want to be able to put samples into our machine and walk away while it records 50 or even 100 neurons. This could enable for neuroscience the kind of research automation we ve seen in other fields such as molecular biology, dramatically expanding our ability to listen in on brain signals.  Supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the research was reported October 11 in the journal Scientific Reports. Based on their cleaning technique and earlier innovations that automated the process of connecting the pipettes to cells, the Georgia Tech researchers have demonstrated what s believed to be the first robot to perform sequential patch-clamp recording in cell culture, brain slices, and in the living brain   without a human operator. To share what it s doing, the patch-clamping robot   known as  patcherBot    has its own Twitter account to automatically report on every cell it records.  This is the first social neuroscience robot,  said Forest. Patch-clamping is the gold standard for stimulating and recording signals from neurons and other cells. It involves touching a glass pipette with a tip just one micron in diameter to the cell membrane, creating a tight seal that provides a direct electrical connection to the insides of the cell. The work is extremely meticulous and time-consuming, though a recent robotic technology termed the Autopatcher, also out of Forest s lab, has automated parts of the process. Because cellular debris could prevent the tight connection to cells, researchers have had to replace the pipettes with new ones for each recording. But while conducting patch-clamping, graduate research assistant Ilya Kolb began to question the conventional wisdom that the pipettes could not be used more than once. He knew about detergents used to clean laboratory glassware, and set to work assessing whether these agents to be used in a robotic cleaning process.  If you could clean the pipette automatically after each recording, you could just tell the Autopatcher to go back to cells again and again,  Forest explained.  You wouldn t even have to be in the room anymore. You could set this up before you leave the lab for the day, and when you returned the next morning, you d have recorded 50 or 100 cells.  Kolb tested eight cleaning solutions and found one   Alconox   which successfully removed the debris. He reprogrammed the software operating the Autopatcher to add cleaning and rinsing steps between each recording. The new robot dips the pipette into a detergent solution located in a well next to the sample, creates a flow of fluid into and back out of the pipette, then moves the pipette to a rinse in a separate well. The entire cleaning process takes about a minute, which is as fast or even faster than a trained human operator.  The researchers compared the quality of the recordings made by the cleaned pipettes to those made with new ones.  When we patch with a fresh pipette and when we patch with a pipette that has been used and cleaned 11 times, the results are basically indistinguishable,  said Kolb.  We do see some degradation after 14 or more attempts, but we re hopeful that with improvements in the technique, we could reuse pipettes as many as 50 or 100 times.  Working with researchers at Emory University, the technique was tested to determine whether any remaining detergent residue could affect living cells. Results of the testing, supplemented with mass spectroscopy studies of the pipette fluid, found no adverse implications. Georgia Tech has filed for patent protection on the new robotic technique, which allows technicians to simply choose the cells to be recorded using a microscope view   then let the machine work. The researchers hope the technique can be commercialized for use not only by the thousands of labs currently using patch-clamping, but also used to expand automated applications more broadly for pharmaceutical testing and other research.

The results are valuable for teaching reading to adults and children. A group of experts from the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), in San Sebasti n, has shown that different networks are activated in the brains of bilingual people when they read opaque languages those in which words are written one way and pronounced another, like English and transparent languages those pronounced as they are written, such as Basque or Spanish. See Also: First language wires brain for later language-learningNeuroscience has successfully identified two neural networks that are activated during reading. One is the dorsal stream, involved in phonology (responsible for the sounds of letters), and the other is the ventral stream, which has an orthographic-semantic function (to decipher letters and their meaning). Until now it was thought that these networks were activated differently in monolinguals, depending on the demand on phonological or orthographic-semantic processes. The novelty of the study, published in Cerebral Cortex, is that it demonstrates the importance of a language's orthography (opaque or transparent) in the activation of these neural networks in bilinguals. These results can have an impact on teaching and learning how to read for adults and children. As Myriam Oliver, Manuel Carreiras and Kepa Paz-Alonso, the three authors from the BCBL say: ""No study had ever so specifically demonstrated this effect in such a clear way."" For this purpose, the researchers analysed 36 perfectly bilingual people, either speaking Spanish and Basque, or Spanish and English. They were pure bilinguals, who did not speak any third languages or had only very basic knowledge of them, and learnt the second language later than the first, from the age of 6. Learn More: Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism Using magnetic resonance, they observed the behavior of their brains when reading in one language and the other. ""When reading in their first language (Spanish), their brain networks behave similarly. However, when reading in the second (English or Basque), we notice that different networks are activated according to the orthography of the language,"" the scientists explain. While in Basque-speaking bilinguals the dorsal stream, related to phonology, is activated more, in English-speaking bilinguals the ventral stream, responsible for meaning, works harder. ""We know very little about the brain processes involved in bilinguals' reading,"" say the authors, who uphold that the results are down to the quality of both languages. ""Studying this field more in depth is important because it has general, basic implications for learning processes."" Basque, a language that is read as it is written, enables readers to make a clear connection between grapheme and phoneme. English, on the other hand, requires a more complex process in which the reader has to take into account certain rules of pronunciation. Related: Bilingual brains better equipped to process information In a more and more bilingual world, the researchers stress the importance of analysing the best means to learn a language depending on whether it is opaque or transparent. ""Knowing this, school curricula can be designed which, depending on the language, emphasise some aspects or others in order to help children to learn to read,"" they conclude.

The generation of neurons from stem and progenitor cells is a complex, tightly regulated process known as neurogenesis. Researchers led by Professor Dr. Magdalena G tz, Chair of Physiological Genomics at LMU and Director of the Institute for Stem Cell Research at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, have shown in collaboration with Professor Dr. Gunnar Schotta, Biomedical Center LMU, that epigenetic mechanisms which are brought into play at an early stage of neurogenesis, have an important impact on the subsequent fate of neurons. These new findings appear in Genes and Development. See Also: Epigenetic driver of glioblastoma provides new therapeutic target In order to elucidate the significance of early epigenetic modifications on the development of neural cells during embryogenesis in the mouse, G tz and her colleagues specifically inactivated the gene Uhrf1. This gene is known to control a number of epigenetic functions, including DNA methylation, and is active from very early stages of neurogenesis. The methylation of specific nucleotide bases in DNA often serves to switch genes off. Conditional knockout of Uhrf1, in a region of the forebrain, led to the activation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERV) in the genome, which are otherwise silenced by methylation. Further investigation revealed that members of the Tet family of enzymes are largely mediating the demethylation of the ERVs, thus appearing be functionally activated in the absence of Uhrf1. Moreover, these ERVs remained active not only in later stages of embryogenesis but also into postnatal stages, suggesting that their activation is non-reversible. The aberrant and ongoing activation of ERVs caused an accumulation of retroviral proteins in the affected cells and deregulation of genes and pathways. This in turn led to the progressive disruption of vital cellular processes and ultimately precipitated a massive wave of cell death.

This finding represents one of the first examples of a genome-wide significant genetic factor to be identified for binge eating in model organisms or humans. In addition, the researchers discovered a network of downregulated genes involved in myelination (the process of forming a sheath around a nerve fiber to allow nerve impulses to move quickly) that also was associated with binge eating. See Also: Eating disorder gene alters feeding and behavior in female miceThese findings, which appear online in the journal Biological Psychiatry, could potentially lead to treatments targeted to normalize eating behaviors. Eating disorders are among the most lethal of neuropsychiatric disorders. Compulsive binge eating affects millions of people suffering from eating disorders and obesity in the United States. It is characterized by episodes of eating large quantities of food, often very quickly and to the point of discomfort. Binge eaters often experience a loss of control during the binge as well as shame, distress or guilt afterwards. Genome-wide association studies of eating disorders in humans have been limited in their power to detect significant associations between genotype and disease or disease traits such as binge eating. Using gene mapping and gene validation, researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) were able to identify cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) as a major genetic risk factor for binge eating. In addition, they observed that decreased myelination could be a neuropathological consequence of binge eating. ""Because we found changes in the brain as a consequence of binge eating that were predictive of decreased myelination, therapeutically promoting remyelination may represent a novel treatment avenue for promoting recovery from negative feeding behaviors in eating disorders,"" explained corresponding author Camron Bryant, PhD, assistant professor of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics & Psychiatry at BUSM.

Tourette's syndrome is defined by tics involuntary, repetitive movements and vocalizations. Scientists estimate that the condition affects roughly one to 10 kids out of every 1,000 children. ""In this study, we found changes primarily in brain regions connected to sensation and sensory processing,""said co-principal investigator Kevin Black, MD, a professor of psychiatry. See Also: How do Tourette s patients react to visual stimulation with their own self-image? Differences in those brain regions make sense, Black said, because many people with Tourette's explain that their tics occur mainly as a response to unusual sensations. The feeling that a part of the body doesn't seem right, for example, prompts an involuntary sigh, vocalization, cough or twitch. ""Just as you or I might cough or sneeze due to a cold, a person with Tourette's frequently will have a feeling that something is wrong, and the tic makes it feel better,"" Black said. ""A young man who frequently clears his throat may report that doing so is a reaction to a tickle or some other unusual sensation in his throat. Or a young woman will move her shoulder when it feels strange, and the movement, which is a tic, will make the shoulder feel better."" In the largest study of its kind, the researchers conducted MRI scans at four US sites to study the brains of 103 children with Tourette's and compared them with scans of another 103 kids of the same age and sex but without the disorder. The scans of the children with Tourette's revealed significantly more gray matter in the thalamus, the hypothalamus and the midbrain than in those without the disorder. The gray matter is where the brain processes information. It's made up mainly of cells such as neurons, glial cells and dendrites, as well as axons that extend from neurons to carry signals. Learn More: Brain chemical potential new hope in controlling Tourette Syndrome tics In kids with Tourette's, the researchers also found less white matter around the orbital prefrontal cortex, just above the eyes, and in the medial prefrontal cortex, also near the front, than in kids without the condition. White matter acts like the brain's wiring. It consists of axons that unlike the axons in gray matter are coated with myelin and transmit signals to the gray matter. Less white matter could mean less efficient transmission of sensations, whereas extra gray matter could mean nerve cells are sending extra signals. Black said it's not possible to know yet whether the extra gray matter is transmitting information that somehow contributes to tics or whether reduced amounts of white matter elsewhere in the brains of kids with Tourette's may somehow influence the movements and vocalizations that characterize the disorder. But he said that discovering these changes in the brain could give scientists new targets to better understand and treat Tourette's. ""This doesn't tell us what happened to make the brain look this way,"" Black explained. ""Are there missing cells in certain places, or are the cells just smaller? And are these regions changing as the brain tries to resist tics? Or are the differences we observed contributing to problems with tics? We simply don't know the answers yet.""

But grasping a cup or brushing hair or cooking a meal requires other feedback that has been lost in amputees and individuals with paralysis a sense of touch. The brain needs information from a fingertip or limb or external device to understand how firmly a person is gripping or how much pressure is needed to perform everyday tasks. Learn More: Researchers build brain-machine interface to control prosthetic hand Now, University of Washington (UW) researchers at the National Science Foundation Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (CSNE) have used direct stimulation of the human brain surface to provide basic sensory feedback through artificial electrical signals, enabling a patient to control movement while performing a simple task: opening and closing his hand. It's a first step towards developing ""closed loop,"" bi-directional brain-computer interfaces (BBCIs) that enable two-way communication between parts of the nervous system. They would also allow the brain to directly control external prosthetics or other devices that can enhance movement or even reanimate a paralyzed limb while getting sensory feedback. The UW study is based on the concept of closed-loop 'bi-directional brain-computer interfaces' (BBCIs) being developed at the CSNE that can both record from and stimulate the nervous system. They would also allow the brain to directly control prosthetics or other external devices to enhance movement or reanimate paralyzed limbs. Credit: Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering  The results of this research are published in IEEE Transactions on Haptics. ""We were able to provide a baseline degree of sensory feedback by direct cortical stimulation of the brain,"" said lead author and UW bioengineering doctoral student Jeneva Cronin. ""To our knowledge this is the first time it's been done in a human patient who was awake and performing a motor task that depended on that feedback."" Learn More: Brain-machine interface triggers recovery for paraplegic patientsThe team of bioengineers, computer scientists and medical researchers from the CSNE and UW's GRIDLab used electrical signals of different current intensities, dictated by the position of the patient's hand measured by a glove he wore, to stimulate the patient's brain that had been implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes. The patient then used those artificial signals delivered to the brain to ""sense"" how the researchers wanted him to move his hand. ""The question is: Can humans use novel electrical sensations that they've never felt before, perceive them at different levels and use this to do a task? And the answer seems to be yes,"" said co-author and UW bioengineering doctoral student James Wu. ""Whether this type of sensation can be as diverse as the textures and feelings that we can sense tactilely is an open question."" It's difficult for a person to mimic natural movements whether using a prosthetic device or a limb that has become disconnected from the brain by neurological injury without sensation. Though there are devices to assist patients with paralysis or who have undergone amputations with basic function, being able to feel again ranks highly on their priorities, researchers said. Restoring this sensory feedback requires developing an ""artificial"" language of electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sensation and incorporate as useful feedback when performing a task. Related: Research grasps how the brain plans gripping motion The UW CSNE team frequently works with patients about to undergo epilepsy surgery who have recently had an ECoG electrode grid implanted on the surface of their brain. For several days or weeks, doctors constantly monitor their brain activity to pinpoint the origin of their seizures before operating. By consenting to participate in research studies during this period when their brain is ""wired,"" these patients enable researchers to answer basic neurological questions. They can test which parts of the brain are activated during different behaviors, what happens when a certain region of the brain's cortex is stimulated and even how to induce brain plasticity to promote rehabilitation and healing across damaged areas. The potential to use ECoG electrodes implanted on the surface of the brain in future prosthetic or rehabilitative applications offers several advantages the signals are stronger and more accurate than sensors placed on the scalp, but less invasive than ones that penetrate the brain, as in a recent study by University of Pittsburgh researchers.

Credit: Mark Stone/ University of Washington  In the UW study, three patients wore a glove embedded with sensors that provided data about where their fingers and joints were positioned. They were asked to stay within a target position somewhere between having their hands open and closed without being able to see what that target position was. The only feedback they received about the target hand position was artificial electrical data delivered by the research team. When their hands opened too far, they received no electrical stimulus to the brain. When their hand was too closed similar to squeezing something too hard the electrical stimuli was provided at a higher intensity. One patient was able to achieve accuracies in reaching the target position well above chance when receiving the electrical feedback. Performance dropped when the patient received random signals regardless of hand position, suggesting that the subject had been using the artificial sensory feedback to control hand movement. Providing that artificial sensory feedback in a way that the brain can understand is key to developing prosthetics, implants or other neural devices that could restore a sense of position, touch or feeling in patients where that connection has been severed.

The first-line designation means that some patients will have access to the drug without first having to receive other treatments such as chemotherapy.  The FDA also expanded the approval of pembrolizumab to treat the majority of people with NSCLC who had received prior chemotherapy, greatly increasing the patient population that can benefit from the treatment.   It is exciting to have an expanded group of patients who are now eligible for this drug,  said Garon, whose clinical studies helped lead to today s FDA approval.  What is particularly encouraging is that we are now able to select, based on features in the tumor, approximately a quarter of advanced lung cancer patients who can receive immunotherapy as their initial treatment. This will allow them to live longer while delaying, and in some cases potentially avoiding, the side effects of traditional chemotherapy.  Garon is a member of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer and an associate clinical professor of hematology and oncology.  Pembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by turning off the immune system s brakes, allowing its T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. It originally received accelerated approval by the FDA in 2015 as a treatment for NSCLC. Until today s approval, however, the drug was only given to patients after prior chemotherapy who expressed a biomarker known as PD-L1 on at least half of their cancer cells. Now, patients with PD-L1 expression on at least half of their cancer cells can receive pembrolizumab prior to standard chemotherapy.  The idea to specifically study this group of patients was based on groundbreaking research Garon published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year, which found that among patients who received pembrolizumab, those with PD-L1 expression on at least 50 percent of their cancer cells showed the longest survival and disease control. Garon s work laid the foundation for additional research, also recently published by the New England Journal of Medicine, that led the way for today s approval.   Issued concurrently by the FDA today is a new label update for pembrolizumab, which can now be prescribed to patients who express PD-L1 on as few as one percent of their cancer cells if they have received prior chemotherapy. This recommendation is based on a separate study published in The Lancet, for which Garon was the senior author, showing longer survival than chemotherapy among patients with any positive staining for PD-L1.  Researchers are currently testing pembrolizumab to determine if it has the same result in other cancers, as well as trying to combine pembrolizumab with other therapies.","Published: October 26, 2016"

Researchers described the genetic diversity of the Aedes aegypti mosquito   which also transmits yellow fever and chikungunya   in 30 countries and across six continents. In different locales, the mosquito species has different genetic signatures, the researchers report in the journal Molecular Ecology.  This is important to know because these mosquitoes differ in their ability to transmit diseases,  said Andrea Gloria-Soria, associate research scientist in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and lead author of the study.  Information on the mosquitoes  origin can help officials to assess threat levels if the species shows up for the first time in a new location. For instance, if Aedes aegypti arrives in a southern U.S. state from areas of Brazil where levels of Zika infection are high, public health officials can launch aggressive prevention measures in those newly exposed areas.  And mosquito migration can be unpredictable, notes Jeffrey Powell, professor in EEB and senior author of the paper. For instance, when Aedes showed up in California in 2013, it was assumed that the mosquitoes had been imported from Mexico. Genetic testing showed that the insects had hitchhiked on planes, trains, or trucks from the New Orleans/Houston areas. In another case, Dutch officials were stunned to find subtropical mosquitoes in the Netherlands in 2010. Testing showed that the mosquitoes had arrived with cargoes of used tires shipped from Miami for disposal at centers in that country.","Published: October 26, 2016"

Their gene editing technique provided corrections to the mutations and alleviated the disease in mice, the researchers said. The finding could lead to studies of a similar gene therapy to treat people with inherited blood disorders. The study was published Oct. 26 by Nature Communications. Gene editing techniques have the potential to treat blood disorders that run-in families, such as thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, but their application has been largely limited to cells in a laboratory and not living animals. To achieve gene editing in mice with thalassemia, professor of therapeutic radiology and of genetics Dr. Peter M. Glazer and his co-authors developed an alternative approach using a novel combination of nanoparticles, synthetic pieces of DNA, and a simple IV injection. The cross-disciplinary research team identified a protein derived from bone marrow that can activate stem cells   the cells that are the most responsive to gene editing. They combined the protein with synthetic molecules, known as PNAs, that mimic DNA and bind to the target gene to form a triple helix. This triggers the cell s own repair processes to fix the disease-causing mutation. The team then utilized nanoparticles, developed in the lab of Mark Saltzman, professor of biomedical engineering, to transport the PNAs to the target mutation in mice. The final step was to use an IV injection to deliver the gene-editing package. The researchers found that the technique corrected the mutation to such a degree that the mice no longer had symptoms of thalassemia. After 140 days, they tested hemoglobin levels in the animals and found them to be normal.  The fundamental result here is that with nanoparticles containing PNAs, along with template DNA, and simple IV infusion of molecules, we achieved enough gene editing to effectively cure the anemia in mice that had thalassemia,  Glazer said. In addition, because the research team used tiny pieces of DNA that were produced chemically, this technique avoided the type of unintended outcomes that other techniques, like CRISPR, can cause when they alter the genome.  We demonstrated we have extremely low off-target effects,  Glazer noted. If the strategy proves effective in clinical studies, it could lead to the development of gene therapy for people with thalassemia, and potentially sickle cell disease and other inherited blood disorders, he said.  We might get enough cells corrected that individuals are not anemic anymore. We could achieve a symptomatic cure. ","Published: October 26, 2016"

An international team of scientists led by Kaan Boztug from CeMM Research Institute for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases and the Medical University at Vienna gained fundamentally new insights into the human immune system by studying this newly discovered mutation. Moreover, their research revealed a potential personalized therapy for this rare disease. The study, published in Nature Immunology, clearly highlights the importance and opportunities of research in the field of rare diseases.  A twelve-year old patient was the starting point of the study: Since his birth, the child suffered from severe, life-threatening infections. Immunological analyses showed a disturbed ratio of white blood cells, the so-called lymphocytes, hampering his immune system to fight efficiently against invading pathogens. Three of his six siblings died within the first two years of life, presumably due to similar complications. Although the origin of their condition was unknown, the researchers assumed a genetic trait in four severely diseased children of the same family.  To investigate rare patients like these, the new Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases (LBI-RUD) was founded in Vienna. In collaboration with CeMM, the Medical University Vienna and the St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, LBI-RUD was established by the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft in April 2016.  The accumulated expertise of our institute is unique  states Kaan Boztug, Director of the LBI-RUD and head of the study.  We are the ideal place to find the molecular cause of rare   and most often genetic   diseases, and to develop this knowledge into targeted therapies .   Our analyses of the patient s and his parents  genomes indeed confirmed that the boy s disorder had a genetic cause , explains Elisabeth Salzer, postdoctoral fellow at CeMM and first author of the study. Using next generation sequencing   a modern and hi ghly efficient genetic method to detect disease- causing mutations   the researchers found an error in the gene encoding RASPGR1, a key protein for the development of lymphocytes. The healthy parents, as well as the three healthy siblings, only had one copy of the mutation in their genome, while the diseased boy had inherited both faulty copies from his parents.  Until this time, the function of RASGPR1 in the immune system was only partially studied in rodent models. Its role in humans was unknown, and a mutation that inhibited the protein had never been reported. The case of the 12-year old patient not only showed that the lack of RASGPR1 impairs T lymphocytes, but also that the protein plays a so far unknown role for maintaining the cellular scaffold (cytoskeleton) in natural killer (NK-) cells. Through a series of further experiments, the researchers were able to analyze the faulty molecular circuits in greater detail. Eventually, the scientist even found an approved drug, lenalidomide, that has the potential to reverse some effects of the newly discovered RASGRP1 deficiency. Therefore, this study is a prime example for the importance and opportunities of studying rare diseases   as it is done at the LBI-RUD:  The whole process from the discovery of a gene defect as cause for a rare disease to the exploration of the disease-causing mechanism to the development of a personalized therapy does much more than helping the affected patients , explains Kaan Boztug,  Virtually every case   such as the immunodeficiency of this young patient   provides profound new insights into the human organism and paves the way towards a future precision medicine.

This genetic recipe is thought to contain all the information that a new organism needs to build and operate its body. But recent research has shown that, in some species, parents  life experiences can alter their offspring. Being underfed, exposed to toxins or stricken by disease can cause changes in a parent s gene expression patterns, and in some cases, these changes can be passed down to the next generation. However, the mechanisms that cause this effect known as non-genetic inheritance are a mystery. New research from the University of Maryland provides a surprising possible explanation. For the first time, developmental biologists have observed molecules of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) a close cousin of DNA that can silence genes within cells being passed directly from parent to offspring in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Importantly, the gene silencing effect created by dsRNA molecules in parents also persisted in their offspring. The work, published October 17, 2016 in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the mechanisms for non-genetic inheritance might be simpler than anyone had suspected.  This is the first time we ve seen a dsRNA molecule passing from one generation to the next,  said Antony Jose, an assistant professor in the UMD Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics and senior author on the study.  The assumption has been that dsRNA changes the parent s genetic material and this altered genetic material is transmitted to the next generation. But our observations suggest that RNA is cutting out the middle man.  Jose and his team, including graduate student and lead author Julia Marr  and former research technician Edward Traver, introduced dsRNA marked with a fluorescent label into the circulatory system of C. elegans worms. They then watched as these fluorescent RNA molecules physically moved from the parent s circulatory system into an egg cell waiting to be fertilized. In a surprising turn of events, some of the dsRNA molecules could not silence genes in the parent because the dsRNA sequence did not match any of the parent s genes. But the dsRNA molecules did silence genes in the offspring, when the new worm gained a copy of the matching gene from its other parent. This suggests that, in some cases, gene silencing by dsRNA might be able to skip an entire generation.  It s shocking that we can see dsRNA cross generational boundaries. Our results provide a concrete mechanism for how the environment in one generation could affect the next generation,  Jose said.  But it s doubly surprising to see that a parent can transmit the information to silence a gene it doesn t have.  Jose and his colleagues did not expect dsRNA to play such a direct role in the transmission of information across generations. Because dsRNA factors into the life cycle of many viruses, Jose explained, it is reasonable to assume that a living cell s natural defenses would prevent dsRNA from invading the next generation.  It s very surprising. One would think the next generation would be protected, but we are seeing all of these dsRNA molecules being dumped into the next generation,  Jose added.  Egg cells use the same mechanism to absorb nutrients as they prepare for fertilization. The next generation is not only getting nutrition; it s also getting information.  Jose and his colleagues hope to learn more about the precise mechanisms by which dsRNA silences genes across multiple generations.  There are hints that similar things could be happening in humans. We know that RNA exists in the human bloodstream. But, we don t know where the RNA molecules are coming from, where they re going or exactly what they re doing,  Jose said.  Our work reveals an exciting possibility they could be messages from parents to their offspring. ","Published: October 26, 2016"

Under the terms of the agreement, Caris is eligible to receive several million dollars in clinical development milestones and undisclosed downstream royalty payments. Through Caris  proprietary ADAPT Biotargeting System, Threshold may gain access to a diagnostic tool that will enable physicians to determine which patients would be most likely to benefit from treatment with evofosfamide.  We are pleased to work with Threshold Pharmaceuticals to support the development of their novel potential therapy, which has shown promising results in this difficult-to-treat disease,  said Bart Howe, Executive Vice President of Business Development and Corporate Strategy at Caris.  Our innovative and revolutionary ADAPT Biotargeting System is uniquely positioned to support the pharmaceutical clinical development process by identifying complex molecular signatures that can predict a patient s likelihood of response to a particular therapy.   Since it is well understood that patients exposed to the same chemotherapy often respond differently, we look forward to working with Caris and their innovative ADAPT Biotargeting System to help physicians identify those patients most likely to benefit from evofosfamide,  said Barry Selick, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Threshold.  We remain optimistic about the potential role of evofosfamide for the treatment of cancer, and we continue to pursue discussions with Japanese regulatory authorities regarding potential registration pathways for evofosfamide and other development opportunities with evofosfamide.  Caris and Threshold will work together, leveraging tumor samples and outcomes data from the previously completed Phase 3 MAESTRO study in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, to develop a novel, multiplexed diagnostic assay designed to classify a patient s likely clinical outcome from the use of evofosfamide. Evofosfamide (previously known as TH-302) is an investigational hypoxia-activated prodrug of a DNA cross-linking agent that is preferentially activated under hypoxic tumor conditions, a feature of many solid tumors. In December 2015, Threshold announced that a Phase 3 study (MAESTRO) of evofosfamide had not met its primary endpoint. However, data from the MAESTRO study demonstrated meaningful improvement in overall survival in a subgroup of 116 patients from Japan, in which the risk of death was reduced by 48 percent for patients receiving evofosfamide compared to patients in the control arm. Caris  ADAPT Biotargeting System is a proprietary platform that uses libraries of synthetically manufactured molecules trained to bind to biological targets of interest in order to characterize complex biological systems. Currently being utilized in discovery research, advanced diagnostics and drug development programs across multiple diseases, the ADAPT Biotargeting System also has potential utility in drug delivery, disease monitoring and direct therapeutic applications.","Published: October 26, 2016"

The complex human intestine contains more than 1,000 microbial species, and metagenomics concerns the study of this microbiome, which plays an important role in protection against disease, modulating immunity and regulating metabolic processes possibly related to obesity and diabetes. Argonne in 2008 created an open portal for metagenomics data processing called MG-RAST, a pipeline of hardware and software providing access to a treasure trove of genetic information on microbes that could have implications for personalized medicine tailored to individual patients; bio-enzymes for cleaning up contamination from oil spills; and the sustainability of operations such as mineral mining. ""In metagenomics, for example, you take a culture of the gut, you bring it into the lab and do the genetic analysis, and it gives you a profile of the bacteria and other microbes that are present,"" said Ananth Grama, a Purdue professor of computer science. ""Then you can compare that profile with MG-RAST data to diagnose the patient."" The portal, however, is straining to keep up with a steady increase in demand due in large part to a dramatic advancement in commercially available gene-sequencing instruments. The research team will work to solve this problem in a project funded with a $3.8 million five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health. The project involves Grama and co-principal investigators Saurabh Bagchi, a professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Computer Science, and Somali Chaterji, a visiting faculty member in the Department of Computer Science. The Purdue researchers will collaborate with an Argonne team led by Folker Meyer, a computational biologist at Argonne and a senior fellow at the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. ""The analysis of metagenomic data has tremendous potential in both clinical and ecological applications,"" Bagchi said. ""However, since its original design, MG-RAST has witnessed the frenetic development of next-generation sequencing technologies, a drastically altered computing landscape and other challenges."" Meyer, who is deputy director of the Biosciences division and a part of the Mathematics and Computer Science division at Argonne, said, ""This grant will bring significant upgrades to the MG-RAST software infrastructure and harnesses the expertise of the Purdue team in distributed infrastructures and robust software development."" One goal is to develop a ""federated infrastructure"" that allows MG-RAST to seamlessly farm jobs out to various computer clusters around the country and harness the large distributed computing power that exists through federal investments by the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy and NIH.  ""To do that you need federation software to figure out how to do all this data transfer back and forth and make sure all the credentials line up so the user doesn't have to log in separately to all these different machines,"" Bagchi said. ""When a new job comes in, they want to be able to figure out which machines to assign it to. The correct choice may mean the difference between taking 10 hours to run or one hour to run."" The team will collaborate with researchers in the University of Chicago's School of Medicine to test a pilot-scale system. ""Overall, we aim to improve the pipeline's functionality and data reproducibility, improve MG-RAST's software quality and performance through automated generation of testing suites and move toward a federated infrastructure to cater to a diverse and ever-growing user base,"" Chaterji said.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/driving-mosquito-evolution-to-fight-malaria-192827,Driving Mosquito Evolution to Fight Malaria Researchers propose insect repellent in conjunction with insecticides to extend current insecticide lifetime  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. One of the frustrations of fighting malaria is that mosquitoes evolve resistance to the insecticides used to kill them.  Now researchers from Exeter University in the United Kingdom and the University of California, Berkeley, propose using insect repellents along with insecticides to extend the lifetime of the insecticides we have today and, paradoxically, evolve mosquitoes with greater aversion to the repellent. The technique is described in an article appearing Oct. 25 in the open-access journal eLife. Because insecticides don t kill 100 percent of mosquitoes, those with some resistance survive and come to dominate the population, rendering the insecticide ineffective. Repellents, which can be as simple as a scent that insects avoid, can help protect humans by keeping homes free of malarial mosquitoes. Many of the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite have evolved to bite humans indoors at night. Currently, however, there are no available repellents that are cheap, safe and easy to use, and able to protect an entire building or property. Existing options are ineffective or too expensive for use in developing countries. Scientists are now trying to develop suitable repellents, in part because studies have shown that the insecticide DDT, once the scourge of malarial mosquitoes, may have been effective because it repelled as well as killed mosquitoes. Even with a highly effective repellent, however, mosquitoes could evolve to become less repelled, since those forced to feed outdoors are at greater risk.  If you combine these two, you should get better repellents and you should get a slower resistance to the insecticide, so it will last longer or forever,  said population biologist Michael Boots, a UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology. First author Penny Lynch, a postdoctoral fellow with joint appointments at the two universities, says that the proposed technique doesn t require an initially very effective repellent to work. A mediocre repellent will drive mosquitoes to evolve so that the repellent becomes more effective.  That is the premise,  she said.  Evolution should be selecting for the ones that are repelled, because they don t get killed by the insecticide.  As fewer mosquitoes encounter the insecticide, there is less pressure for the mosquitoes to develop resistance to it.  The idea is, if you combine a spatial repellent that is not particularly good initially, with an effective insecticide in the house, then a certain proportion of the mosquitoes will be repelled and some proportion will go inside the house and get killed,  Boots said.  So populations that aren t going into the house are under selection for increased repellence or deflection, and as that happens you get less selection for insecticide resistance.  Insecticide-impregnated bed nets Thanks to work over the past 15 years, much of it funded by the Gates Foundation, residents of many countries in Africa and Asia now have access to bed nets impregnated with insecticides such as pyrethroid compounds. This has helped drive malaria cases down almost to levels achieved decades ago with DDT, Boots said. Now that DDT has been phased out almost everywhere, however, there are fewer fallback options when current insecticides become ineffective because of resistance. Lynch noted that switching to new and often more expensive insecticides means that fewer homes are protected and more people die. The idea that a repellent/insecticide combination could drive mosquito evolution to yield a sustainable malaria control strategy came to Lynch as she was working on her Ph.D. thesis on insecticides that kill older mosquitoes, the ones that spread malaria. A financial modeler by training, she began thinking about the genetic fitness of mosquitoes, and how to manipulate that. She teamed up with Boots to use mathematical models of evolutionary competition between vectors and hosts   the malaria parasite and the mosquito, for example   to test whether the strategy would work.  We are interested in this whole question of how we can use models to look at clever ways of implementing control mechanisms,  Boots said. One advantage of the proposed strategy is that it can be implemented without interrupting current mosquito control programs, such as spraying insecticides around homes and using bed nets. A repellent could easily be applied in a home at the same time as insecticides are sprayed. Boots and Lynch plan to team up with scientists in Africa or Asia to test the hypothesis that mosquitoes can evolve to be more repelled by mediocre repellents, and determine what levels of effectiveness are necessary for both repellent and insecticide. The strategy may differ depending on the type of mosquito in a region and its feeding habits, such as whether it feeds on animals also, or exclusively on humans.  We know quite a bit about mosquitoes and insecticide resistance, but we don t know much about the way deflection will evolve,  Boots added.  The purpose of the modelling was to determine if the strategy is credible, and whether we should try it in the field. We hope to do that.  DDT s effectiveness against mosquitoes may be proof that the hypothesis works.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress these viruses to very low levels in the blood. Yet the virus still lurks in the genetic material of infected immune cells, known as viral reservoirs. If ART is discontinued, virus levels rebound within weeks. Thus, treatment for HIV today involves taking ART every day for life. Although ART dramatically improves health overall and prolongs life, the regimen can be challenging and may have toxic side effects over time. The gut is one of the first body areas damaged by HIV and SIV. During early infection, the viruses target immune cells in gastrointestinal tissues called CD4 cells. CD4 cells move into the gut using a surface protein called alpha-4/beta-7 integrin, which interacts with the protein MAdCAM-1 on the cells of the blood vessels that line gastrointestinal tissues. A team led by Dr. Aftab A. Ansari at Emory University and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), investigated whether preventing CD4 cells from accessing gut tissues could avert the damage and its effects on the immune system. The researchers developed an antibody against alpha-4/beta-7 integrin to block it from interacting with MAdCAM-1. Their study appeared on October 14, 2016, in Science. The scientists infected 18 rhesus macaques with SIV. Five weeks later, the animals began a 90-day course of daily ART. Nine weeks after infection, the animals started receiving an antibody infusion every 3 weeks. Eleven were given the investigational antibody; the other 7 received placebo antibody. Three of the 11 monkeys developed an immune response against the investigational antibody and were excluded from further study. All treatment ceased 32 weeks after infection for the 15 remaining animals. By their third week on ART, all the monkeys fully suppressed SIV. Within 2 weeks after ART ceased, SIV rebounded to high levels in all 7 control animals. SIV returned temporarily but was then subdued in 6 of the 8 monkeys who received the investigational antibody. The virus never rebounded in the other 2. These 8 monkeys have continued to have undetectable levels of SIV in their blood and gut tissues for as long as 23 months. How the antibody treatment is working remains unclear. Treated monkeys had replenished CD4 levels. They had other notable immune changes. For example, some treated animals developed antibodies against an important region of gp120, a protein that HIV and SIV need to grip and gain entry to CD4 cells.  The experimental treatment regimen appears to have given the immune systems of the monkeys the necessary boost to put the virus into sustained remission,  Fauci says.  The precise mechanisms of this effect are unclear and will be actively pursued, since they could have important implications for the control of HIV infection in humans.

The results of the study, reported in the journal Cell Reports, suggest that the molecular mechanism that triggers the rare disease Ewing's sarcoma could act as a potential new direction for the treatment of more than half of patients with prostate cancer. A form of bone and soft tissue cancer that affects about one in 1 million children and young adults age 10 to 19, Ewing's sarcoma is terminal in 44 percent of teens age 15 to 19 and 30 percent of children. Over 100,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the U.S, with more than 99 percent of cases occurring after age 50. ""This research shows that the molecular mechanism involved in the development of most prostate cancers is very similar to the molecular mechanism known to cause Ewing's sarcoma,"" said Peter Hollenhorst, an associate professor in the Medical Sciences Program at IU Bloomington, a part of the IU School of Medicine. ""It also suggests that this mechanism might be used to explore a common treatment for both diseases, one of which is not often pursued by drug companies due to its rarity."" Hollenhorst is also a member of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center in Indianapolis. Other authors on the paper include Vivekananda Kedage, a graduate student in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, and Travis J. Jerde, an associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the IU School of Medicine in Indianapolis. Kedage is the first author on the study. There are 28 genes in the human body known as ETS genes, four of which are known to produce proteins that cause prostate cancer. These four cancer-causing genes, or ""oncogenes,"" are called ETV1, ETV4, ETV5 and ERG, the last of which has been implicated in over 50 percent of all prostate cancers. The other three combined play a role in about 7 percent of prostate cancers. Ewing's sarcoma results from errors in the chromosome repair process that causes the merger of two separate gene segments into a mutant hybrid gene, also known as a chimeric or fusion gene. One of these genes is called EWS, the other is a gene that produces ETS proteins. Hollenhorst's study is the first to show that the proteins produced by the EWS gene interact with all four ETS proteins known to trigger prostate cancer. Moreover, the EWS protein only interacts with proteins from these four harmful ETS genes, not the other 24 ETS genes not found to play a role in prostate cancer. ""A molecular mechanism that sets these four genes apart from the ones that don t trigger cancer has never been identified until now,"" Hollenhorst said. ""This is significant because it suggests that any compound that disrupts EWS-ETS interaction would specifically inhibit the function of the four oncogenes and not the others, which play important roles in the healthy function of the body."" The team also found the ETS genes implicated in prostate cancer interact with the un-mutated form of the EWS gene. In Ewing's sarcoma, the small blue tumors that characterize the disease do not occur unless mutation occurs. IU scientists used a combination of laboratory experiments and mouse models to observe the interaction of EWS and ETS proteins in prostate cells. The majority of the experiments involved observing the behavior of ETS oncogenes in prostate cancer cell cultures to reveal interaction with EWS proteins. In experiments at the IU School of Medicine, they also introduced the ERG gene into normal human prostate cells in mice, which triggered the formation of tumors. The scientists then introduced an artificial mutation in the ERG gene to disrupt interaction with the proteins produced by the EWS gene. In these mice, the tumors failed to form. ""Together, the results indicated that the interaction between ERG and EWS is important for tumor formation,"" Hollenhorst said. ""We chose to focus our greatest efforts on the ERG protein since it is responsible for over 50 percent of all prostate cancers, and therefore the potential to benefit the greatest number of people."" Based upon the strength of the work reported in the study, Hollenhorst and colleagues at IU Bloomington and the IU School of Medicine have received a grant from the IU Simon Cancer Center to search for molecules that could potentially disrupt ETS-EWS interaction. Their work will be conducted in collaboration with a facility at Purdue University that specializes in screening for these molecules.

The condition is caused by a defect in the gene for beta-globin, a component of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. The flawed form of beta-globin makes normally round red blood cells become stiff, sticky, and sickle-shaped. These deformed cells can block blood flow, causing severe pain, organ damage, and stroke. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow from blood stem cells. Some people with sickle cell disease have been successfully treated with blood stem cell transplants. This treatment, however, requires a matched donor and has many risks. A research team led by Drs. Jacob E. Corn at the University of California, Berkeley, Dana Carroll at the University of Utah, and David I. K. Martin at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital Oakland set out to use gene-editing techniques to correct the genetic defect responsible for sickle cell disease. The research was supported in part by NIH s National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). Results were published on October 12, 2016, in Science Translational Medicine. The scientists optimized a procedure using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool to repair the defective beta-globin gene in blood stem cells from people with sickle cell disease. When the corrected stem cells matured into red blood cells in the laboratory, they had increased levels of normal adult haemoglobin and decreased levels of the sickle form. The researchers next wanted to determine if gene-edited bone marrow cells could remain in a living organism long enough to have therapeutic benefit. Due to the difficulty of obtaining blood stem cells with the beta-globin defect, they injected normal blood stem cells that were gene-edited into mice with suppressed immune systems. They found that an average of 2% of the edited stem cells remained in the bone marrow after 4 months. One mouse maintained more than 6% of the edited stem cells. These levels could potentially be of clinical benefit. While the methods outlined in the study still need to be improved and scaled up, they demonstrate a potential pathway for developing a gene-editing treatment for sickle cell disease.  We re very excited about the promise of this technology,  Corn says.  There is still a lot of work to be done before this approach might be used in the clinic, but we re hopeful that it will pave the way for new kinds of treatment for patients with sickle cell disease.   It s very gratifying to see gene-editing technology being brought to practical applications,  Carroll says. This gene-editing approach could also be used to explore ways to treat other blood disorders that are caused by a single mutation.","Published: October 26, 2016"

Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. Nanomedicine is the application of nanotechnology to the prevention and treatment of disease in the human body. This evolving discipline has the potential to dramatically change medical science and is already having an impact in a number of clinically used therapies and diagnostics worldwide. Leading research Currently, the treatment of HIV requires daily oral dosing of HIV drugs, and chronic oral dosing has significant complications that arise from the high pill burden experienced by many patients across populations with varying conditions leading to non-adherence to therapies. Recent evaluation of HIV patient groups has shown a willingness to switch to nanomedicine alternatives if benefits can be shown. Research efforts by the Liverpool team have focused on the development of new oral therapies, using Solid Drug Nanoparticle (SDN) technology which can improve drug absorption into the body, reducing both the dose and the cost per dose and enabling existing healthcare budgets to treat more patients. Poorly available Presently, no clinically available oral nanotherapies exist for HIV populations and conventional paediatric HIV medicines are poorly available. The programme examined one current paediatric formulation that utilizes high ethanol concentrations to solubilize lopinavir, a poorly soluble antiretroviral. Using rapid small-scale nanomedicine screening approach developed at Liverpool, the researchers were able to generate a novel water dispersible nanotherapy, hence removing the need to use alcohol in the paediatric medicine. The research, funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is in ongoing human trials, and the preclinical development has been published in  Nature Communications  today (Friday, 21 October 2016). The title of the paper is  Accelerated oral nanomedicine discovery from miniaturized screening to clinical production exemplified by paediatric HIV nanotherapies . Wide applicability Professor Owen said  The fruits of our interdisciplinary research are beginning to be realised. Our approach has the potential to overcome challenges with current antiretroviral therapy, which include administration of high doses needed to achieve efficacious concentrations in the body, and the urgent need for better formulations for children living with HIV.  Professor Rannard added  The wide applicability of our strategy has implications for multiple therapy development programmes and we are actively engaged in the creation of nanomedicine options to impact a range of clinical needs.

The team built a high-throughput cell-editing platform using a variant of CRISPR/Cas9 technology that allowed them to test how well scores of different genetic tweaks defended immune cells against HIV. The new system allows researchers to quickly modify the genetic code of freshly donated human immune cells and will hopefully accelerate the quest to finally cure HIV+ patients, the researchers said.  This is an ability HIV researchers have wanted for a long time,  said postdoctoral researcher Judd F. Hultquist, PhD, one of the new paper s co-lead authors.  I hope this will take what seemed like an insurmountable task a year ago and make it something everyone can do.  The research, which was published online Oct. 25, 2016, in Cell Reports, was conducted by the laboratories of co-senior authors Nevan J. Krogan, PhD, a professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at UCSF, director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) in UCSF s School of Pharmacy, and a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes, and Alexander Marson, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology in the UCSF School of Medicine. The research was spearheaded by Hultquist, who is in Krogan s lab, and Kathrin Schumann, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Marson s lab. Gene Editing Offers Possibility of HIV Cure Despite great progress made since the 1980s in the ability to treat and control HIV with antiretroviral drugs, there is still no cure for the virus, and millions of people are newly infected every year. Once the virus infiltrates a patient s immune system, it can hide indefinitely within cells  own DNA, impossible to detect or destroy with current technology. As a result, patients must continue on antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives. However, not everyone is susceptible to the virus. Scientists have taken inspiration from a group of individuals whose immune cells appear to be naturally resistant to HIV infection, and hope to one day edit HIV patients  immune systems to mimic the biology of these HIV-resistant individuals.  There have been lots of efforts to sequence the genomes of resistant people to discover the mutations that make them immune to the virus,  Hultquist said.  But there are many different genes that could be involved: some control the virus s ability to enter immune cells, others control how the virus tricks cells into expressing its genes. Until now, there was no way to test which of these mutations actually confer resistance in primary human T-cells.  CRISPR-Based Platform Aims to Accelerate Search for Cures Despite being the immune system s lead fighters, T cells are delicate   only able to survive outside the body for a couple weeks. They are also resistant to the viruses researchers use in other cell types to deliver DNA instructions about how to build the machinery needed for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Last year, Marson and Schumann successfully used CRISPR to perform precise DNA sequence replacements in primary human T cells for the first time by prefabricating the CRISPR machinery in test tubes, then adding it to the freshly donated immune cells.  It s incredibly fast,  Schumann said.  The desired editing occurs rapidly, and then the cell degrades the CRISPR machinery so it can t go on making changes. That s really important: otherwise it s like doing surgery and leaving in the scalpel.  In the new paper, Schumann and Hultquist improved the technique by devising an automated system for high-throughput, parallel editing of T cells. The new approach enables the researchers to mutate different candidate genes in hundreds of thousands of T cells from healthy volunteers, expose these mutant cells to the HIV virus, then screen through the cells to find which mutations were able to prevent infection. A key feature of this system is its speed, as donated T cells can only survive outside of the body for two to three weeks.  If we want to start editing T cells and putting them back into people as a therapy,  Krogan said,  I think this will be the gold standard for how to do that quickly, safely, and efficiently.  The researchers used the new technique to mutate the genes CXCR4 and CCR5, which encode receptor molecules that different strains of the HIV virus use to sneak in and infect immune cells and which have been targeted in previous cell therapy trials. Inactivating either of these genes successfully blocked HIV infection of the human T cells by the relevant HIV strain. Additional experiments showed the feasibility of creating a two-layer security system for T cells by simultaneously blocking a gene the HIV virus needs to gain entry into cells and a gene the virus needs to survive and reproduce within the cell, resulting in doubly secure resistance. To demonstrate the efficiency and power of the new high-throughput technology, the researchers also developed 146 different CRISPR-based edits, each designed to deactivate one of 45 genes linked to HIV s ability to integrate into host cells. They identified several genes whose absence conferred HIV resistance, some of which had been predicted by previous studies and others that had never been directly tied to HIV infection before.  Tip of the Iceberg  for Infectious Disease Research The researchers plan to use the new platform to identify additional weaknesses in the HIV virus s life cycle that could be exploited either by cell therapy or targeted drugs. They also want to be able to insert more subtle mutations, such as those reported in HIV-resistant individuals, which could alter cell function just enough to confer resistance but without fully deactivating the gene and impeding cell function. However, their greater hope is that the system will have much broader applications than just HIV and eventually be used in labs around the world to study the virus of their choice.  This toolkit has been a huge missing piece in infectious disease research,  Marson said.  Now we have the ability to make modifications in human immune cells and right away see the effects. The potential is immense   this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Additional authors on the new paper include Jonathan M. Woo, MS, of UCSF; Michael J.

The researchers found that detection of poorly differentiated basal tumor cells in early stage cancers; overexpression in those cells of a gene known as cell division cycle 25C, which plays a key role in the regulation of cell division; or the ability of tumor fragments to grow when transplanted into a mouse, all predicted an increased risk of death.  If confirmed in larger studies, our findings could help physicians get a better handle on how a patient s bladder cancer is likely to progress and allow them to personalize treatment based on that knowledge,  said study author Ralph Weichselbaum, MD, the Daniel K. Ludwig Distinguished Service Professor of Radiation and Cellular Oncology and Chair of the Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology at the University. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. More than 75,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year and more than 16,000 people will die from this disease. Weichselbaum and colleagues obtained tumor samples from 71 bladder cancer patients treated at the University and used flow cytometry to isolate and count specific subtypes of tumor cells in each sample. They showed that an excess of one relatively rare subtype in early-stage cancers   the basal tumor cell (BTC)   was associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of death. Analyzing the global expression of genes in BTCs, the researchers also identified a potentially prognostic biomarker for bladder cancer: cell division cycle 25C (CDC25C), a protein that drives cell division. An expanded analysis, including 400 bladder cancer patients, found that the expression of this protein is associated with an increased risk of death even after the removal of the cancerous bladder. This association disappeared in patients who had previously received chemotherapy. A test for CDC25C could, the authors suggest, help determine whether a bladder cancer patient is likely to benefit from drug treatment. In more invasive tumors, the presence and number of BTCs had less prognostic value. When the researchers injected bladder-cancer tissue fragments from 69 patients with more advanced cancers into the flanks of immune-deficient mice, however, about 60 percent of these tumor fragments were able to take hold and grow in this setting. This was associated with a 6-fold increase in risk of death, compared to tumor fragments that did not survive and grow after transplantation.  Prognostic knowledge can change a lot about how you choose to treat a cancer,  said Weichselbaum.  We may be able to avoid aggressive measures if we find a tumor has relatively few basal cells,  he said.  We could treat an early-stage bladder cancer with less aggressive therapy, avoiding debilitating interventions like radical cystectomy. But if a bladder tumor has a lot of basal cells, we may need to take the entire bladder out and follow that with chemotherapy. Before this can happen, he added, the accuracy of his team s new prognostic model and biomarker  will need to be confirmed in larger studies. ","Published: October 26, 2016"

The research presents a new way to efficiently kill these cancerous cells and holds promise for the treatment of blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma, as well as solid cancers such as melanoma and cancers of the lung and breast. It is published online in the journal Nature. The Servier compound - S63845 - targets a protein of the BCL2 family, called MCL1, which is essential for the sustained survival of these cancer cells. Institute scientist Associate Professor Guillaume Lessene, who led the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute s research team in Melbourne, Australia, said the work provided the first clear preclinical evidence that inhibiting MCL1 was effective in targeting several cancer types.  MCL1 is important for many cancers because it is a pro-survival protein that allows the cancerous cells to evade the process of programmed cell death that normally removes cancer cells from the body,  Associate Professor Lessene said.  Extensive studies performed in a variety of cancer models have shown that S63845 potently targets cancer cells dependent on MCL1 for their survival.  The institute team of Associate Professor Lessene worked with haematologist Associate Professor Andrew Wei and Dr Donia Moujalled from The Alfred Hospital and Servier scientists, to demonstrate that not only was S63845 effective against several cancer types, but that it could also be delivered at doses that were well tolerated by normal cells. Dr Olivier Geneste, Director of Oncology Research at Servier, said this preclinical research represented major findings regarding the druggability of MCL1, a valuable and highly challenging target.  S63845 was discovered through collaboration with the fragment and structure based discovery expertise at Vernalis,  he said.  As part of the ongoing Servier / Novartis collaboration on this target class, clinical development of a MCL1 inhibitor should be launched in the near future.  Associate Professor Lessene said the research provided further evidence of the usefulness of a new class of anti-cancer drugs called BH3 mimetics.  BH3 mimetics inhibit a group of proteins known as the  pro-survival BCL-2 proteins ,  he said.  MCL1 is a member of this protein family, and inhibiting it activates the process of programmed cell death. Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researchers revealed the role of BCL-2 in cancer more than 28 years ago and the essential role of MCL1 for the survival of malignant cells four years ago.  The research was supported through a research collaboration with Servier and through funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (US), Cancer Council Victoria, the Kay Kendall Leukemia Fund, Victorian Cancer Agency, Australian Cancer Research Foundation, the Victorian Government Operational Infrastructure Scheme and the estate of Anthony Redstone.

University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers studied several ALS cases with a mutation in a RNA-binding protein known as hnRNP A2/B1. In the study, published by Neuron, they describe how damage to this protein contributes to ALS by scrambling crucial cellular messaging systems.  Our findings are a significant step forward in validating RNA-based therapy as a treatment for ALS,  said senior author Gene Yeo, PhD, professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a devastating neurological condition affecting more than 20,000 Americans. The disease greatly diminishes patients  quality of life and is terminal. ALS affects a special kind of nerve cell called a motor neuron. These motor neurons enable us to move our bodies. Currently, there are no effective treatments for ALS, largely due to poor understanding of how the disease initiates and progresses at the molecular level. Yeo s team studies RNA-binding proteins and their ability to control how, when and if cells make certain proteins. To unravel the role RNA-binding proteins play in ALS, Yeo s team gathered skin cells from four patients with the disease   three with mutations in the hnRNP A2/B1 gene, one with a mutation in a different gene   and two healthy volunteers as controls. The researchers coaxed these skin cells into becoming a special kind of stem cell called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and ultimately turned these patient-specific stem cells into motor neurons. This technique provided them with personalized models of each patient s disease, in a laboratory dish, where it s easy to do experiments. To determine the effects of the mutant hnRNP A2/B1 proteins in these samples, the researchers then measured the activity of thousands of genes in each of the ALS and healthy motor neuron samples. In the ALS patient samples, Yeo and team found that the hnRNP A2/B1 mutation these patients had didn t merely disable the protein. Instead, the mutation gave the protein new toxic properties that scrambled RNA processing, and ultimately led to the death of motor neurons. Yeo said these findings may have important implications for their collaborators and others who are developing therapeutics that aim to treat disease by targeting RNA.  These RNA-targeting therapies can eliminate toxic proteins and treat disease,  said first author Fernando Martinez, a graduate student in Yeo s laboratory.  But this strategy is only viable if the proteins have gained new toxic functions through mutation, as we found here for hnRNP A2/B1 in these ALS cases.  Environmental factors are thought to contribute to ALS, increasing the chances a person with a genetic predisposition will get the disease. To mimic this scenario, Martinez compared how motor neurons from ALS patients and healthy individuals respond to stress. In the patient-specific ALS motor neurons under stress, they found more hnRNP A2/B1 proteins clumped in a part of the cells called stress granules, as compared to healthy cells.  Drugs that lower the exaggerated reaction to stressors that we saw in motor neurons from ALS patients may also prove a powerful therapeutic strategy,  Yeo said.  It is likely that multiple, multi-directional shots at goal will be needed to treat this debilitating disease.  Study co-authors also include: Gabriel A. Pratt, Eric L.

Astronauts on long missions in space have atrophy of the muscles supporting the spine which don't return to normal even several weeks after their return to Earth, reports a study published in Spine. The results provide new insights into the elevated rates of back pain and spinal disc disease associated with prolonged spaceflight, report Dr. Douglas G. Chang of University of California, San Diego, and colleagues. ""This could provide helpful physiological information to support a manned mission to Mars,"" the researchers write. The data were obtained as part of a NASA-funded research study, led by Drs. Alan R. Hargens and Jeffrey C. Lotz. See Also: Spinal surgery: Right on target Six NASA crewmembers were studied before and after spending four to seven months in ""microgravity"" conditions on the International Space Station. Each astronaut underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the spine before their mission, immediately after their return to Earth, and again one to two months later. The goal was to understand factors affecting lumbar spine strength and low back pain during long-duration spaceflight, as well as the spine's response after returning to Earth gravity. Back pain is common during prolonged missions, with more than half of crew members reporting spinal pain. Astronauts are also at increased risk of spinal disc herniation in the months after returning from spaceflight about four times higher than in matched controls. These changes are accompanied by an increase in body height (about two inches), thought to result from spinal ""unloading"" and other changes related to the lack of gravity. The researchers used an image ""thresh-holding"" technique to estimate lean muscle separated from non-lean muscle components. The MRI scans indicated significant atrophy of the paraspinal lean muscle mass which plays a critical role in spinal support and movement during the astronauts' time in space. The lean muscle, or ""functional,"" cross-sectional area of the lumbar paraspinal muscles decreased by an average of 19 percent from preflight to immediate postflight scans. A month or two later, only about two-thirds of the reduction had recovered. Learn More: Survey shows spine surgeons need to screen more patients for anxiety and depression There was an even more dramatic reduction in the functional cross-sectional area of the paraspinal muscles relative to total paraspinal cross-sectional area. The ratio of lean muscle decreased from 86 percent preflight to 72 percent immediately postflight. At follow-up, the ratio recovered to 81 percent, but was still less than the preflight value. In contrast, there was no consistent change in the height of the spinal intervertebral discs. Dr. Chang and coauthors write, ""These measurements run counter to previous hypotheses about the effects of microgravity on disc swelling."" Further studies will be needed to clarify the effects on disc height, and whether they contribute to the increase in body height during space missions, and to the increased risk of herniated disc disease. Meanwhile, the finding of paraspinal muscle atrophy suggests possible preventive steps to reduce the spinal effects of spaceflight. For instance, core-strengthening exercises, like those recommended for patients with back pain on Earth, might be a useful addition to the astronaut exercise training program. Yoga might be another promising approach, especially for addressing spinal stiffness and reduced mobility. Dr. Chang and his colleagues conclude: ""Whether new exercise countermeasures can prevent in-flight paraspinal muscle atrophy, improve spinal pain and function, shorten recovery time, and how such exercise might be performed in a microgravity environment with available exercise equipment need further study.""

That could accelerate the gathering of information used to map the functions of brain cells and ultimately provide a better understanding what's going on between our ears. See Also: New viral tools to safely trace brain circuits developed The technique would be used in a recording method known as patch-clamping, in which a tiny liquid-filled glass pipette is connected to individual neurons. Since patch-clamping was invented three decades ago, the technique has required changing pipettes between recordings a manual process that slows research. Now, a robotic cleaning technique developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology allows the pipettes to be reused for as many as 11 recordings and potentially more allowing the recording to be more automated. Georgia Tech associate professor Craig Forest (left) and graduate research assistant Ilya Kolb with the robotic patch-clamping equipment that can automate the process of recording without stopping to replace pipettes. Credit: John Toon, Georgia Tech  ""This is a step toward revolutionizing the robotic techniques in neuroscience,"" said Craig Forest, associate professor in Georgia Tech's George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. ""We want to be able to put samples into our machine and walk away while it records 50 or even 100 neurons. This could enable for neuroscience the kind of research automation we've seen in other fields such as molecular biology, dramatically expanding our ability to listen in on brain signals."" Supported by the National Institutes of Health (U.S.) and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the research is reported in the journal Scientific Reports. Learn More: New tools help neuroscientists analyze big dataBased on their cleaning technique and earlier innovations that automated the process of connecting the pipettes to cells, the Georgia Tech researchers have demonstrated what's believed to be the first robot to perform sequential patch-clamp recording in cell culture, brain slices, and in the living brain - without a human operator. To share what it's doing, the patch-clamping robot known as ""patcherBot"" has its own Twitter account to automatically report on every cell it records. ""This is the first social neuroscience robot,"" said Forest. Patch-clamping is the gold standard for stimulating and recording signals from neurons and other cells. It involves touching a glass pipette with a tip just one micron in diameter to the cell membrane, creating a tight seal that provides a direct electrical connection to the insides of the cell. The work is extremely meticulous and time-consuming, though a recent robotic technology termed the Autopatcher, also out of Forest's lab, has automated parts of the process.

Credit: John Toon, Georgia Tech  Because cellular debris could prevent the tight connection to cells, researchers have had to replace the pipettes with new ones for each recording. But while conducting patch-clamping, graduate research assistant Ilya Kolb began to question the conventional wisdom that the pipettes could not be used more than once. He knew about detergents used to clean laboratory glassware, and set to work assessing whether or not these agents to be used in a robotic cleaning process. ""If you could clean the pipette automatically after each recording, you could just tell the Autopatcher to go back to cells again and again,"" Forest explained. ""You wouldn't even have to be in the room anymore. You could set this up before you leave the lab for the day, and when you returned the next morning, you'd have recorded 50 or 100 cells."" Read Next: Micro-map of hippocampus lends big hand to brain research Kolb tested eight cleaning solutions and found one - Alconox - which successfully removed the debris. He reprogrammed the software operating the Autopatcher to add cleaning and rinsing steps between each recording. The new robot dips the pipette into a detergent solution located in a well next to the sample, creates a flow of fluid into and back out of the pipette, then moves the pipette to a rinse in a separate well. The entire cleaning process takes about a minute, which is as fast or even faster than a trained human operator. The researchers compared the quality of the recordings made by the cleaned pipettes to those made with new ones. ""When we patch with a fresh pipette and when we patch with a pipette that has been used and cleaned 11 times, the results are basically indistinguishable,"" said Kolb. ""We do see some degradation after 14 or more attempts, but we're hopeful that with improvements in the technique, we could reuse pipettes as many as 50 or 100 times."" Working with researchers at Emory University, the technique was tested to determine whether any remaining detergent residue could affect living cells. Results of the testing, supplemented with mass spectroscopy studies of the pipette fluid, found no adverse implications. Georgia Tech has filed for patent protection on the new robotic technique, which allows technicians to simply choose the cells to be recorded using a microscope view then let the machine work. The researchers hope the technique can be commercialized for use not only by the thousands of labs currently using patch-clamping, but also used to expand automated applications more broadly for pharmaceutical testing and other research. Don't Miss: Biological tools create nerve-like polymer network""If we can put this technology into a piece of equipment and have all the smarts provided by software, it could really democratize this area of research,"" said Forest.

A team of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators using advanced computational tools to analyze data from standard MRI scans report that individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including those diagnosed partway through a multi-year study, had greater levels of asymmetry differences in shape between the left and right sides of the brain of key brain structures. Their study has been published in the journal Brain. See Also: Exercise keeps hippocampus healthy in people at risk for Alzheimer's ""Our results show for the first time that asymmetry of the hippocampus and amygdala increases with disease severity, above and beyond age-associated effects,"" says Christian Wachinger, PhD, formerly with the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH, the lead author of the report. ""By studying the progression of asymmetry from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, we demonstrated that greater asymmetry in those and a few other structures can predict disease progression and could be a biomarker allowing early detection of dementia."" Wachinger is part of a team led by Martin Reuter, PhD, of the Martinos Center, that developed BrainPrint, a computer-aided system for representing the whole brain based on the shapes rather than the size or volume of structures. Originally described in a 2015 article in NeuroImage, BrainPrint appears to be as accurate as a fingerprint in distinguishing among individuals. In a recent paper in the same journal, Wachinger and Reuter demonstrated the use of BrainPrint for automated diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The current study used BrainPrint to analyze structural asymmetries in a series of MR images of almost 700 participants in the (U.S.) National Institute of Health-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participation in that study involves MR brain imaging taken upon enrollment and repeated every 6 to 12 months, along with cognitive and genetic testing; and the MGH study analyzed data from ADNI participants with at least three MRI scans. Participants were divided into four groups: those diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's when entering the study, healthy controls with no sign of dementia, individuals with mild cognitive impairment that remained stable over the two to three years for which scans were available, and those with mild cognitive impairment that progressed to Alzheimer's disease during the study. Don't Miss: Medical diagnosis: Will brain palpation soon be possible? BrainPrint analysis of the data revealed that initial, between-hemisphere differences in the shapes of the hippocampus and amygdala - structures known to be sites of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease - were highest in individuals with dementia and lowest in healthy controls. Among those originally classified with mild cognitive impairment, baseline asymmetry was higher in those that progressed to Alzheimer's dementia and became even greater as symptoms developed. Increased asymmetry was also associated with poorer cognitive test scores and with increased cortical atrophy. The senior author of the Brain paper, Reuter explains, ""Several studies have indicated that Alzheimer's has different effects in different sub-structures of the hippocampus and amygdala. Since the shape descriptors of BrainPrint are more sensitive to subtle changes within a structure than are standard volume-based measures, they are better suited to quantify early disease effects and predict future progression, which opens up new research directions into the mechanisms that cause these asymmetries. For example, in addition to asymmetric distribution of amyloid beta, which has been reported, the differences could reflect disease subtypes that affect hemispheres differently."" Read Next: A new atlas of the brain opens up alternative means for studying brain disorders Now a professor of Neurobiological Research in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Wachinger adds, ""In collaboration with colleagues at the Martinos Center, we are planning further exploration of the relationship between shape asymmetries and established Alzheimer's disease biomarkers to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms. Differentiating between those with stable mild cognitive impairment and those who will progress to Alzheimer's is of great clinical relevance, as it could help select individuals appropriate for clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.""

The findings could help in the development of treatments for the disorder, researchers said. PTSD is a mental health problem that occurs in the wake of one or more traumatic experiences. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of PTSD, as the multiple neurochemical and hormonal effects associated with childhood trauma can lead to lasting changes in brain structure and function. Brain imaging with MRI is a promising tool for identifying vulnerable patients and allowing interventions to begin sooner, potentially preventing any adverse brain changes. Learn More: Trauma experiences change the brain even in those without PTSD Researchers from China recently used MRI to compare brain structure in 24 pediatric PTSD patients and a control group of 23 trauma-exposed children without PTSD. The children had experienced the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a massive disaster in south central China that killed almost 70,000 people and injured more than 370,000. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MRI technique that measures the integrity of the brain's white matter, was used to look at the brain's connectome, or the map of the neural connections in the brain. The human connectome includes a series of nodes, or brain regions, linked by connections known as edges. Nodes with a relatively high number of edges are referred to as hubs. Graphs show differences in topologic properties of the brain structural connectome between pediatric patients with PTSD and trauma-exposed control subjects without PTSD (nonparametric permutation test, P < 0.05). Credit: RSNA  ""Generally speaking, the structural connectome and the functional connectome are based on different types of raw images, which may be used to investigate the brain's abnormalities through different views,"" said study lead author Qiyong Gong, MD, PhD, from West China Hospital of Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. Using DTI results and graph theory, a relatively simple and widely used way of modeling the human brain connectome, the researchers were able find significant structural differences between the PTSD and non-PTSD groups. The PTSD group had changes suggestive of decreased local and global network efficiency due to damage or disconnection between linked regions. See Also: Imaging shows impact of PTSD in earthquake survivors The researchers also identified a concerning trend in the structural connectome of PTSD patients. Normally, the brain operates partly as a small-world network, or a type of mathematical model in which most nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of steps. A small-world network aids in the high-efficiency parallel information transfer between networks that is necessary for brain function. However, in the PTSD patients, the structural connectome showed a trend toward regularization a phenomenon in which the neural network moves from a small-world to a more regular network. A regular network is more localized, so it takes many more steps to reach distant nodes. ""In a previous functional and current structural connectome study of the same patient group, we found a shift toward regularization in the brain networks of the PTSD patients relative to controls,"" Dr. Gong said. ""Thus, we speculate that this regularization process may be a general pattern of pediatric PTSD."" Differences were also observed in the salience network, a collection of brain regions that select which stimuli are deserving of attention. The finding could point to a potential target for future treatment plans in pediatric PTSD.

The results, published in Nature Neuroscience, paint a picture of spatial information-gathering, processing and decision-making that is more complex than once thought. The HMS study challenges the traditional, decades-old model, which proposes that making a simple spatial decision is the result of an outright competition between two or more distinct neural pathways, with one signal prevailing to suppress the others. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making ""This winner-take-all view is elegant but perhaps somewhat oversimplified,"" said study author Chris Harvey, assistant professor of neurobiology at HMS. ""Our findings suggest that groups of neurons keep track of all recently encountered visual cues and use this information to inform decisions. There needn't be an actual competition between two or more pathways, at least not in the areas of the brain thought to be involved in decision-making."" In that sense, the researchers added, mouse decision-making resembles the human act of accumulating and weighing all the evidence before making a choice. The researchers say their findings are an early step on a quest to untangle the mechanisms of human memory formation a fundamental neurologic process that remains poorly understood. Unraveling what happens in nerve cells during memory formation can help illuminate critical glitches that occur in short-term memory and lead to impaired decision-making in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. ""Once we unravel the different working patterns and circuits in the brain during memory formation and decision-making, we can begin to look for differences in connectivity patterns that underlie abnormalities,"" Harvey said. ""This can give us a handle on how these processes may be flawed in neurodegenerative conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders."" For the experiments, mice were trained to count up to six dots on either side of a virtual T-shaped maze projected on a screen in front of them. Mice had to choose the direction displaying the greater number of dots and make a turn in that direction. Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisionsThe task exquisitely complex by rodent standards is akin to how humans use street signs and landmarks to maneuver in space in order to reach a destination. To prepare for the simulated maze challenge, mice were trained over the course of a month or so, learning to count up to six dots and to make a choice to go left or right depending on the number of dots projected on the screen. When an animal made the correct turn, it was rewarded with a few gulps of sweetened water. For their experiments, the scientists focused on neurons in the posterior parietal cortex the part of the brain where visual sensory input and motor action converge. To visualize neuronal activity in real time, researchers injected mice with a virus that induced their brain cells to glow, or fluoresce, anytime an electrical impulse was triggered by something the mouse saw. The approach allowed scientists to map out an ""electrical grid"" showing the moment-by-moment changes across thousands of neurons as animals encountered cues, retrieved short-term memories and made a decision. The electrical patterns showed that in order to make the correct choice, the mouse had to rely on short-term memory recalling how many dots it saw on one side a few seconds prior and then convert this memory into motor action, or the action of turning left or right. Surprisingly, multiple nerve signals converged at once before the mouse made a turn, suggesting that the animals weighed all available cues before making a decision. The results also showed that brain cells did not pause and reset each time a decision was made. Instead, neurons kept a ""ticker tape"" record of things that happened in the past an-ever expanding catalogue as new experiences were acquired. Read Next: ""Memory region"" of the brain also involved in conflict resolution The findings suggest that even the simplest of choices, such as turning left or right, are the result of multiple neural signals triggered by recently encountered cues, which then propagate in a complex yet well-organized manner and converge in a single decision. That process, the researchers said, is an elegant illustration of how observing a cue forms a short-term memory, which, in turn, leads to a decision.

There she specialised in human pathogens, including HIV and bacterial infection, exploiting cryo-EM to study large protein complexes and macromolecular assemblies. With a truly holistic approach to research, Peijun is interested in combining structural information from cryo-EM with biochemical and physiological analysis and computational modelling to create a broader understanding of the molecular machinery behind protein complexes. With extensive experience in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), Professor Zhang s considerable expertise in structural biology makes her well-placed to support the different groups that come from all over the world to use the eBIC facility. eBIC currently contains two high-end Krios cryo-electron microscopes, providing scientists with state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise. Two further microscopes are planned for installation within the next 6 months. Professor Dave Stuart, Director of Life Sciences at Diamond Light Source, said:  Most individual departments don t have access to instruments like those available at eBIC, so it s a really important tool for the UK science community. What s more, the centralisation of these instruments near the UK synchrotron generates a real synergy between the different techniques on offer at Diamond.  Ultimately, eBIC represents a unique combination of scientific infrastructure on the world stage: synchrotron science and electron microscopy in one place. That s something very special.  Along with state-of-the-art facilities, the centre will provide training courses for structural and cell biologists, and remain cutting edge though strong, in-house research. eBIC was located at Diamond following the award of a  15.6 million grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), and is due to be officially launch in Spring 2017.","Published: October 25, 2016"

The so-called  gene therapy in a box,  developed by scientists at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, delivered modified blood stem cells that were as good as   or better   than those manufactured in highly regulated clean rooms and required less than half the staff, according to a study published in Nature Communications. The adapted cells also successful repopulated the blood system when tested in two different animal models, the study noted. It hasn t yet been tested in humans. The portable device suggests a solution to one of the most vexing challenges of gene therapy: how to make these emerging, high-tech treatments accessible and affordable, beyond a handful of specialized research centers to clinics worldwide.  This was the first proof that  gene therapy in a box  could work. Gene therapies or cell therapies that involve genetically modified cells are not restricted to a very small number of highly sophisticated facilities anymore.  said Fred Hutch researcher Dr. Jennifer Adair, the study s lead author. The semi-automated  point of care  delivery system developed by Adair s team reduces the space required to produce the modified cells from 500 square feet to less than 5 square feet and the staffing from five or 10 people to one or two, according to oncologist Dr. Hans-Peter Kiem, a Fred Hutch and University of Washington cell and gene therapy researcher and the paper s senior author. It does the job in less than half the time.  This is truly transformative,  Kiem said.  It will change the way we manufacture and deliver cell and gene therapy products and will have a major impact on making stem cell gene therapy and transplantation and likely also immunotherapy available to patients with genetic diseases, HIV and cancer worldwide.

The research team, led by Lei Li, assistant professor in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, recently published the work in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics At a time when patients and medical professionals expect always faster results, researchers are trying to translate biodetection technologies used in laboratories to the field and clinic, so patients can get nearly instant diagnoses in a physician s office, an ambulance or the emergency room. The research team created an eight-channel smartphone spectrometer that can detect human interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known biomarker for lung, prostate, liver, breast and epithelial cancers. A spectrometer analyzes the amount and type of chemicals in a sample by measuring the light spectrum. Although smartphone spectrometers exist, they only monitor or measure a single sample at a time, making them inefficient for real world applications. Li s multichannel spectrometer can measure up to eight different samples at once using a common test called ELISA, or colorimetric test enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, that identifies antibodies and color change as disease markers. Although Li s group has only used the smartphone spectrometer with standard lab-controlled samples, their device has been up to 99 percent accurate. The researchers are now applying their portable spectrometer in real world situations.  With our eight channel spectrometer, we can put eight different samples to do the same test, or one sample in eight different wells to do eight different tests. This increases our device s efficiency,  said Li, who has filed a provisional patent for the work.  The spectrometer would be especially useful in clinics and hospitals that have a large number of samples without on-site labs, or for doctors who practice abroad or in remote areas,  he said.  They can t carry a whole lab with them. They need a portable and efficient device.  Li s design works with an iPhone 5. He is creating an adjustable design that will be compatible with any smartphone.","Published: October 25, 2016"

The resulting DNA-protein complexes are referred to as chromatin. The first level of packaging involves wrapping of DNA around spools made up of four so-called histone proteins. Such wrapped up DNA is referred to as nucleosomes, and their positioning on the DNA plays an important role in the regulation of gene activity -- and therefore has a major impact on all cellular processes. Researchers led by PD Dr. Philipp Korber at LMU s Biomedical Center (BMC) have now succeeded in reproducing, in the test-tube, the physiological placement of nucleosomes on the genomic DNA of baker s yeast, starting from purified components. This breakthrough provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms that determine the organization of the DNA in the cell nucleus. The new findings appear in the journal Cell. To their surprise, Korber and his colleagues discovered that a relatively restricted set of components suffices to ensure proper packaging. In addition to purified yeast DNA and the histone proteins that form the nucleosomes themselves, the only other components essential for the chromatin reconstitution in the test-tube are so-called barrier and remodeler proteins. Barrier proteins serve as alignment points for the nucleosomes, as the LMU team has now directly demonstrated. The experiments have also shed light on the far-reaching importance of the remodeling proteins for the packaging of DNA.  It was already known that remodeling proteins are necessary for nucleosome positioning, but it was unclear whether or not they have a direct and specific role in the process,  says Korber. He uses an analogy to explain how these proteins work. Packing goods into a ship s container requires two things   a plan and the people who carry it out.  It was widely thought that remodeler proteins simply carry out orders, doing only what other factors tell them to do. But it turns out that much of the packing plan is built into the remodelers. They bring and follow their own plan during the packing process,  says Korber.  In fact, one particular type of remodeler protein acts entirely autonomously, without any input from other factors. That was completely unexpected.  The successful reconstitution of in vivo-like nucleosome positioning on yeast DNA demonstrates that the degree of self-organized DNA packaging is greater than hitherto suspected. Packaging of DNA by remodeler proteins is a dynamic and autonomous process that gives rise to a structure as basis for other essential processes, such as transcription and replication.  This insight into one of the fundamental principles of genome organization is a milestone, and was made possible by the use of carefully controlled conditions for the reconstitution -- in the test tube -- of the yeast genome as a model system,  Korber concludes.  This approach will also facilitate investigations of the role of DNA packaging mechanisms in cancer cells, for chromatin perturbations are known to be directly involved in tumorigenesis.

One of the crucial factors in these processes is the question of how biomolecules react to the minuscule forces that operate at the molecular level. LMU physicists led by Professor Tim Liedl, in collaboration with researchers at the Technical University in Braunschweig and at Regensburg University, have come up with a method that allows them to exert a constant force on a single macromolecule with dimensions of a few nanometers, and to observe the molecule s response. The researchers can this way test whether a protein or a gene is capable of functioning normally when its structure is deformed by forces of the magnitude expected in the interior of cells. This new method of force spectroscopy uses self-assembled nanoscopic power gauges, requires no macroscopic tools and can analyze large numbers of molecules in parallel, which speeds up the process of data acquisition enormously. With their new approach, the researchers have overcome two fundamental limitations of the most commonly used force spectroscopy instruments. In the case of force microscopy and methodologies based on optical or magnetic tweezers, the molecules under investigation are always directly connected to a macroscopic transducer. They require precise control of the position of an object   a sphere or a sharp metal tip on the order of a micrometer in size   that exerts a force on molecules that are anchored to that object. This strategy is technically extremely demanding and the data obtained is often noisy. Furthermore, these procedures can only be used to probe molecules one at a time. The new method dispenses with all these restrictions.  The structures we use operate completely autonomously , explains Philipp Nickels, a member of Tim Liedl s research group.  And we can use them to study countless numbers of molecules simultaneously.  A feather-light touch The members of the Munich group, which is affiliated with the Cluster of Excellence NIM (Nanosystems Initiative Munich), are acknowledged masters of  DNA origami . This methodology exploits the base-pairing properties of DNA for the construction of nanostructures from strands that fold up and pair locally in a manner determined by their nucleotide sequences. In the present case, the DNA sequences are programmed to interact with each other in such a way that the final structure is a molecular clamp that can be programmed to exert a defined force on a test molecule. To this end, a single-stranded DNA that contains a specific sequence capable of recruiting the molecule of interest spans from one arm of the clamp to the other. The applied force can then be tuned by changing the length of the single strand base by base.  That is equivalent to stretching a spring ever so-o-o slightly,  says Nickels. Indeed, by this means it is possible to apply extremely tiny forces between 1 and 15 pN (1 pN = one billionth of a Newton)   comparable in magnitude to those that act on proteins and genes in cells.  In principle, we can capture any type of biomolecule with these clamps and investigate its physical properties,  says Tim Liedl. The effect of the applied force is read out by taking advantage of the phenomenon of F rster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET).  FRET involves the transfer of energy between two fluorescent dyes and is strongly dependent on the distance between them.  explains Professor Philip Tinnefeld from TU Braunschweig. When the force applied to the test molecule is sufficient to deform it, the distance between the fluorescent markers changes and the magnitude of energy transfer serves as an exquisitely precise measure of the distortion of the test molecule on the nanometer scale. Together with Dina Grohmann from Universit t Regensburg, the team has used the new technique to investigate the properties of the so-called TATA Binding Protein, an important gene regulator which binds to a specific upstream nucleotide sequence in genes and helps to trigger their expression. They found that the TATA protein can no longer perform its normal function if its target sequence is subjected to a force of more than 6 pN.   The new technology has just made its debut. But since the clamps are minuscule and operate autonomously, it may well be possible in the future to use them to study molecular processes in living cells in real time.","Published: October 25, 2016"

Researchers looked at a test available to help assess the risk of breast cancer recurrence and whether chemotherapy is likely to help lower that risk in women with early stage disease. The test looks at 21 genes known to increase risk of cancer recurrence. The idea is to avoid chemotherapy in those women at such low risk that they aren t likely to benefit from it and to ensure chemotherapy is recommended for women with higher risk.  The idea of precision medicine is to give patients the treatments that are the most likely to help and avoid needless side effects,  says study author Christopher Friese, Ph.D., R.N., a professor at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. Researchers surveyed 1,527 women with early stage breast cancer, assessing whether they received the 21-gene recurrence score assay test and whether they received chemotherapy. Currently, cancer care guidelines recommend the test for women with specific tumor features whose cancer has not spread to surrounding lymph nodes. The study, published in Cancer, showed that most doctors were recommending the test in line with these guidelines, although 13 percent of women with cancer in their lymph nodes received the test. Current guidelines typically recommend that these women should always receive chemotherapy, and therefore do not need the test. An ongoing clinical trial is looking at the value of the test for this group. Among those patients who had the test, the results aligned with the decision for or against chemotherapy: 87 percent of patients with a high score had chemotherapy. For patients with the most favorable prognosis and the lowest test scores, only 3 percent received chemotherapy, compared to 13 percent of women who did not have the gene assay test but had a favorable prognosis.  Chemotherapy has substantial side effects. Improving chemotherapy recommendations to those who truly stand to benefit would reduce complications and improve quality of life for many women,  Friese says. Most patients accurately recalled receiving the test   the researchers used registry and laboratory data to confirm that. Nearly two-thirds thought the test was helpful, saying that their results helped shift their opinion for or against chemotherapy. Patients reported high satisfaction with their treatment choice. Based on the diverse sample of patients, the researchers found that race or ethnicity did not play a role in use of the recurrence score assay and recommendation for or against chemotherapy. While most examples of precision medicine involve clinical trials, the recurrence gene assay shows how precision medicine can be used in everyday clinical care. Overall, the study shows use of the test, treatment recommendations and satisfaction all align. But the researchers note one opportunity.  Only 60 percent of patients accurately recalled their test result,  Friese says.  This suggests that while precision medicine for breast cancer has left the station, we have left a few women behind. There s opportunity in the oncology community to improve how we explain to women the purpose of these tests, how to interpret the results, and what the results mean for their breast cancer treatment.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) will supplement Watson s corpus of scientific data with OncoKB, a precision oncology knowledge base to help inform precision treatment options for cancer patients. The launch marks the first time that Watson for Genomics has been made widely available to patients and physicians across the country. Quest Diagnostics, a leader in genomic sequencing and oncology diagnostics that serves half the nation s physicians and hospitals, extends these advanced capabilities to thousands of the country s community oncologists, who provide an estimated 70 percent of cancer care in the United States. The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will provide additional genome sequencing capabilities as part of the collaboration. The new service involves laboratory sequencing and analysis of a tumor s genomic makeup to help reveal mutations that can be associated with targeted therapies and clinical trials. Watson then compares those mutations against relevant medical literature, clinical studies, pharmacopeia and carefully annotated rules created by leading oncologists, including those from MSK. Watson for Genomics ingests approximately 10,000 scientific articles and 100 new clinical trials every month.  The beauty of Watson is that it can be used to dramatically scale access to knowledge and scientific insight, whether a patient is being treated in an urban academic medical center or a rural community clinic,  said John Kelly III, PhD, senior vice president, IBM Research and Cognitive Solutions.  Through this collaboration with the cancer community s leading clinical and pathology experts, thousands of more patients can potentially benefit from the world s growing body of knowledge about this disease.  Bolstering the corpus of data Watson uses, MSK will provide OncoKB, a database of clinical evidence that will help Watson uncover treatment options that could target the specific genetic abnormalities that are causing the growth of the cancer. Comparison of literature that may take medical experts weeks to prepare can now be completed in significantly less time.  Precision medicine is changing the way we treat cancer and giving new hope to people living with the disease,  said Jay G. Wohlgemuth, M.D., chief medical officer and senior vice president of research, development and medical, Quest Diagnostics.  However, access to genomic sequencing and tumor analysis required to determine appropriate precision medicine treatments for a patient can be a challenge. This service combines Quest s state-of-the-art tumor analysis and national access with the cognitive computing of IBM s Watson and the deep cancer treatment expertise of MSK. This is a powerful combination that we believe it will leap frog conventional genomic services as a better approach for identifying targeted oncology treatments.  The efficacy of cancer therapy often depends on the type of gene mutations occurring in the cancer tumor. Many of the latest therapies are designed to work by targeting tumors with a specific genetic makeup. A therapy that is effective for one type of cancer may in fact be efficacious for many others that share similar mutations. But these mutations vary for each individual and can even change during treatment. Correlating them to the appropriate treatments requires genomic sequencing expertise as well as information from knowledge bases, which must be routinely updated to account for rapidly evolving scientific discoveries, available drug therapies and, for patients for whom no therapy is indicated, and appropriate clinical trials. The new service helps close these gaps: To access Watson s evidence-based report, the treating oncologist or other physician will send a patient s solid tumor biopsy tissue to Quest Diagnostics, where pathologists will prepare the tissue sample for genomic sequencing. Scientists at Quest will then sequence the treatment-associated genes using advanced next-generation sequencing technologies and feed the genetic file into Watson. Watson will then use the sequenced genetic data and compare those data against massive bodies of clinical, scientific and pharmacological databases to help uncover potential therapeutic options that match the patient s tumor mutations. A Quest pathologist will review and validate the results and prepare a report to send back to the treating physician.  We now know that genetic alterations are responsible for many cancers, but it remains challenging for most clinicians to deliver on the promise of precision medicine since it requires specialized expertise and a time-consuming interpretation of massive amounts of data,  said Paul Sabbatini, MD, Deputy Physician-in-Chief for Clinical Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  Through this collaboration, oncologists will have access to MSK s expertly curated information about the effects and treatment implications of specific cancer gene alterations. This has the power to scale expertise and help improve patient care. ","Published: October 25, 2016"

Built by a fully automated, digital manufacturing procedure, the 3D-printed heart-on-a-chip can be quickly fabricated and customized, allowing researchers to easily collect reliable data for short-term and long-term studies. This new approach to manufacturing may one day allow researchers to rapidly design organs-on-chips, also known as microphysiological systems, that match the properties of a specific disease or even an individual patient s cells.  The research is published in Nature Materials.  This new programmable approach to building organs-on-chips not only allows us to easily change and customize the design of the system by integrating sensing but also drastically simplifies data acquisition,  said Johan Ulrik Lind, first author of the paper and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).  Lind is also a researcher at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.  Our microfabrication approach opens new avenues for in vitro tissue engineering, toxicology and drug screening research,  said Kit Parker, Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at SEAS, who coauthored the study. Parker is also a Core Faculty Member of the Wyss Institute. Organs-on-chips mimic the structure and function of native tissue and have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional animal testing. Harvard researchers have developed microphysiological systems that mimic the microarchitecture and functions of lungs, hearts, tongues and intestines. However, the fabrication and data collection process for organs-on-chips is expensive and laborious. Currently, these devices are built in clean rooms using a complex, multi-step lithographic process and collecting data requires microscopy or high-speed cameras.  Our approach was to address these two challenges simultaneously via digital manufacturing,  said Travis Busbee, coauthor of the paper and graduate student in the Lewis Lab.  By developing new printable inks for multi-material 3D printing, we were able to automate the fabrication process while increasing the complexity of the devices.  The researchers developed six different inks that integrated soft strain sensors within the micro-architecture of the tissue. In a single, continuous procedure, the team 3D printed those materials into a cardiac microphysiological device   a heart on a chip   with integrated sensors.   We are pushing the boundaries of three-dimensional printing by developing and integrating multiple functional materials within printed devices,  said Jennifer Lewis, Hansjorg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering, and coauthor of the study.  This study is a powerful demonstration of how our platform can be used to create fully functional, instrumented chips for drug screening and disease modeling.  The chip contains multiple wells, each with separate tissues and integrated sensors, allowing researchers to study many engineered cardiac tissues at once. To demonstrate the efficacy of the device, the team performed drug studies and longer-term studies of gradual changes in the contractile stress of engineered cardiac tissues, which can occur over the course of several weeks.  Researchers are often left working in the dark when it comes to gradual changes that occur during cardiac tissue development and maturation because there has been a lack of easy, non-invasive ways to measure the tissue functional performance,  said Lind.  These integrated sensors allow researchers to continuously collect data while tissues mature and improve their contractility. Similarly, they will enable studies of gradual effects of chronic exposure to toxins.   Translating microphysiological devices into truly valuable platforms for studying human health and disease requires that we address both data acquisition and manufacturing of our devices,  said Parker.  This work offers new potential solutions to both of these central challenges. ","Published: October 25, 2016"

The findings are particularly noteworthy because drugs that act on the newly discovered target, a protein known as PIM1, are already in clinical trials for leukemia and multiple myeloma. Triple-negative cancers are so called because they do not express receptors for the hormones estrogen and progesterone, nor for HER2 (human epidermal growth factor 2), and hence patients with these cancers are not candidates for treatment with modern hormonal therapies or the highly effective HER2-targeted drug Herceptin (trastuzumab).  I m a breast oncologist, and I ve seen too many patients die from triple-negative disease,  said senior author Andrei Goga, MD, PhD, professor of cell and tissue biology and of medicine at UCSF, and a member of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.  The only treatment we have to offer these patients is chemotherapy, and we desperately need new options.  The new study, published Oct. 24, 2016, in Nature Medicine, focused on triple-negative breast cancer also characterized by high levels of a cancer-driving protein called MYC (pronounced  mick ). This strategy grew out of previous work in the Goga s laboratory showing that MYC expression is disproportionately higher in triple-negative tumors than in tumors expressing hormone receptors and/or HER2. Targeting MYC Expression Just as triple-negative cancers present a therapeutic challenge, MYC expression in tumors is also a conundrum. MYC s role in cancer was discovered more than 30 years ago in the laboratory of UCSF Nobel laureate and Chancellor Emeritus J. Michael Bishop, MD, and it has since been implicated in many aggressive cancers. But, because of its physical characteristics and its fundamental role in normal cellular function, MYC has long been considered an  undruggable  protein. To get around this problem, the research team employed an approach to undruggable proteins known as  synthetic lethality,  which involves discovering the other proteins upon which these pharmacologically intractable proteins crucially depend to drive cancer growth. Led by former UCSF postdoctoral fellow Dai Horiuchi, PhD, now assistant professor of pharmacology at Northwestern University s Feinberg School of Medicine, the group searched for synthetic lethal partners of MYC using a clever experimental system developed in collaboration with Paul Yaswen, PhD, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). At Berkeley Lab, Yaswen engineered normal breast cells, donated by patients who had undergone breast-reduction surgery, to carry a molecular construct that caused the cells to express MYC only when a particular chemical compound was applied. For experiments aimed at identifying MYC s synthetic lethal partners, such cells may have advantages over the  immortalized  cells commonly used in cancer research, which contain many genetic alterations that make MYC-specific results difficult to discern. Then, in Goga s UCSF laboratory, thousands of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), bits of genetic material that precisely shut down the activity of specific proteins, were sequentially introduced to the engineered cells   in this case, shRNAs targeting proteins called kinases, a common target of cancer drugs, were used. Synthetic Lethal Relationship The experiments revealed that MYC depends on a number of kinases to drive cell growth, but especially on one called PIM1. When shRNAs deactivating PIM1 were introduced to cells expressing MYC, those cells died, demonstrating a synthetic lethal relationship between MYC and PIM1. Zeroing in on this kinase was encouraging, Goga said, because other researchers have shown that genetic-knockout mice that lack the entire family of PIM kinases are slightly smaller than normal mice, but  basically fine,  indicating that a drug targeting just PIM1 may have manageable levels of toxicity in breast cancer patients. To further assess whether PIM1 expression plays a relevant role in these patients, Horiuchi and Goga partnered with UCSF biostatistician Christina Yau, PhD, assistant adjunct professor of medicine, and UCSF physician-scientist Hope S. Rugo, MD, professor of medicine, to determine whether PIM1 was highly expressed in tissue samples from MYC-positive, triple-negative breast cancer patients.  We found that PIM1 is indeed highly upregulated in these more aggressive breast cancers that have high MYC expression,  Goga said,  and that patients with high PIM1 tend to do more poorly.  The team next tested two preclinical PIM1 inhibitor drugs against MYC-positive cancer. In experiments with cancer cell lines, the PIM1 inhibitors killed cells in a MYC-dependent manner, and in two different mouse models -- one in which mice were implanted with patient tumors and the other in which a genetic alteration of MYC predisposes the mice to tumor development   the administration of PIM1 inhibitors resulted in significant tumor regression. Further bolstering these results, a complementary paper in the same issue of Nature Medicine by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London, led by Professor Andrew Tutt, also fingered PIM1 as a target in triple-negative breast cancer, and the ICR team arrived at this conclusion using completely different methods than those used by Goga and colleagues.  The next step is to figure out how to bring this finding into early-phase clinical trials with patients, and we re partnering with pharmaceutical companies to explore this,  Goga said.  Since blocking PIM1 makes MYC-driven cancer cells more vulnerable, we re also exploring whether, for triple-negative cancer, PIM1 inhibitors could be combined with chemotherapy, with other targeted drugs, or even with immunotherapy,  he said.  It s incredibly encouraging to find possible new options for patients with an aggressive cancer like triple negative breast cancer, and that studies conducted by separate teams at leading institutions agree on the implications of the findings,  said Alan Ashworth, PhD, FRS, president of UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and former CEO of the ICR.  With the UCSF team, thanks to funding by public and private organizations, we re able to harness the team science model for collaborations like this that yield findings with the potential to change things for patients who ve had very few options for far too long.

She and her team had previously analyzed blood samples of children in a biobank established by Professor Anette-Gabriele Ziegler, director of the IDF, within the framework of large-scale cohort studies.  According to the authors, these special immune cells are so-called insulin-specific T follicular helper cells (TFH). They appear in the lymph nodes, among other organs, and initiate attacks of the immune system by promoting the production of antibodies by B cells. Now the scientists have found increased frequencies of these cells in samples of children with recent onset of islet cell autoimmunity   an early stage of type 1 diabetes.  In the search for the causes of the increase in TFH cells during autoimmune activation in children, the scientists discovered a previously unknown signaling pathway.  Our analyses showed that a molecule called miRNA92a triggers a chain of molecular events, which ultimately leads to the increase in these immune cells,  said IDF doctoral student Isabelle Serr, explaining the complex mechanism.  In particular, during this process, miRNA92a interferes with the formation of important signaling proteins such as KLF2 and PTEN.  Use in therapy and diagnostics  To check whether this newly discovered mechanism is suitable for therapeutic intervention, the scientists investigated the effect of a so-called antagomir, which specifically binds to miRNA92a molecules and blocks their effect. In an experimental model of type 1 diabetes and in the humanized model, this treatment resulted in a significantly lower autoimmune response.   The targeted inhibition of miRNA92a or the downstream signaling pathway could open up new possibilities for the prevention of type 1 diabetes,  said Professor Ziegler. ""Furthermore, the insulin-specific TFH cells could serve as biomarkers to determine the treatment success of the insulin vaccinations we perform.""  ","Published: October 25, 2016"

A nanoparticle-based drug called Abraxane is being used in clinics worldwide to treat breast cancer patients,  says chemical engineering Asst. Prof. Prakash Rai.  However, the disease continues to be a major health concern.  Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 nearly 231,000 women were diagnosed with the disease, and close to 41,000 died from it.  There is a dire need for better, more effective treatments with lower side effects,  says Rai.  Common side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, weakened immune system and loss of weight, appetite and hair. Some side effects can be life-threatening, such as hypersensitivity reactions and decreasing white blood cell count.  Rai was awarded a grant by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NCI/NIH) totaling more than $725,000 to study a combined, nanotechnology-based diagnostic/therapeutic strategy for the targeted treatment of two subtypes of breast cancer: the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).   HER2-positive and TNBC are among the most difficult types of breast cancer to treat, with resistance to primary treatments a major issue in patients with recurring disease,  notes Rai.  The Emerging Field of Theranostics Theranostics, a combination of therapeutics and diagnostics, is a relatively new field in medicine that helps doctors decide the best therapy to prescribe for each patient. Instead of a broad, generic approach to treatment, this personalized medicine ensures the patient will receive only the drug he or she actually needs, thereby maximizing the therapeutic benefits while minimizing unwanted adverse side effects.  Rai and his research team combined several therapeutic agents that have shown potential in cancer treatment into a single nanometer-sized targeted drug-delivery platform   called a  theranostic nanoconstruct,  or TNC   and tested the nanoplatform s treatment effectiveness in lab mice.   The combination of these therapeutic agents with an imaging agent into one TNC helps reduce the dose required in a patient to achieve efficacy, thus reducing the toxic side effects,  explains Rai.  He says the imaging agent helps the team locate the TNCs and track them after they have been injected into the body, leading researchers to the cancerous tissues.   Targeting the TNCs specifically to cancer cells helps reduce collateral damage to healthy, normal cells,  notes Rai.  If successful, these image-guided, targeted therapies should make a significant impact on the clinical care of breast cancer patients by improving survival and overall quality of life.

The FDA also announced on Oct. 24 that KEYTRUDA is now approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more) or for previously treated metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS of 1 percent or more).  This updated approval of PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx means that the assay can be used to identify previously untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC expressing high levels of PD-L1 for treatment with KEYTRUDA. Prior to this, chemotherapy was the standard first-line treatment for most NSCLC patients. The labeling update also means that more patients in the second-line or later treatment setting   including patients with levels of PD-L1 expression of 1 percent or more   can also be identified for treatment with KEYTRUDA.   This expanded intended use for our FDA-approved PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay is a step towards providing first-line metastatic NSCLC patients with immunotherapy as an option. PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx allows pathologists to confidently determine, and report PD-L1 expression status for a patient s tumor. This critical diagnostic information informs oncologists  treatment decisions around KEYTRUDA,  said Jacob Thaysen, president of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group.  Pathologists recognize the need for approved and validated tests, and our companion diagnostic gives them a highly accurate tool to inform oncologists on PD-L1 expression.   PD-L1 is an important biomarker for use in identifying those patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who are most likely to benefit from treatment with KEYTRUDA,  said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories.  With the approval of both the medicine and companion diagnostic to include first-line evaluation and treatment, and the broadening of the Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx label in the second-line and later treatment setting, we now have the opportunity to help many more patients with this devastating disease.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NSCLC accounts for 80 percent of all lung cancers. PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx was developed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada), maker of the anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.","Published: October 25, 2016"

However, a new advance from MIT may bring this strategy, known as cancer immunotherapy, closer to becoming reality. In the new study, the researchers used a combination of four different therapies to activate both of the immune system s two branches, producing a coordinated attack that led to the complete disappearance of large, aggressive tumors in mice.  We have shown that with the right combination of signals, the endogenous immune system can routinely overcome large immunosuppressive tumors, which was an unanswered question,  says Darrell Irvine, a professor of biological engineering and of materials science and engineering, and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. This approach, which could be used to target many different types of cancer, also allows the immune system to  remember  the target and destroy new cancer cells that appear after the original treatment. Irvine and Dane Wittrup, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering and a member of the Koch Institute, are the senior authors of the study, which appears in the Oct. 24 online edition of Nature Medicine. The paper s lead authors are MIT graduate student Kelly Moynihan and recent MIT PhD recipient Cary Opel. Multipronged attack Tumor cells often secrete chemicals that suppress the immune system, making it difficult for the body to attack tumors on its own. To overcome that, scientists have been trying to find ways to provoke the immune system into action, with most focusing their efforts on one or the other of the two arms of immunity   the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate system consists of nonspecific defenses such as antimicrobial peptides, inflammation-inducing molecules, and cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells. Scientists have tried to get this system to attack tumors by delivering antibodies that latch onto tumor cells and recruit the other cells and chemicals needed for a successful attack. Last year, Wittrup showed that delivering antibodies and IL-2, a signaling molecule that helps to boost immune responses, could halt the growth of aggressive melanoma tumors in mice for as long as the treatment was given. However, this treatment worked much better when the researchers also delivered T cells along with their antibody-IL2 therapy. T cells   immune cells that are targeted to find and destroy a particular antigen   are key to the immune system s second arm, the adaptive system. Around the same time, Irvine s lab developed a new type of T cell vaccine that hitches a ride to the lymph nodes by latching on to the protein albumin, found in the bloodstream. Once in the lymph nodes, these vaccines can stimulate production of huge numbers of T cells against the vaccine target. After both of those studies came out, Irvine and Wittrup decided to see if combining their therapies might produce an even better response.  We had this really good lymph-node-targeting vaccine that will drive very strong adaptive immunity, and they had this combination that was recruiting innate immunity very efficiently,  Irvine says.  We wondered if we could bring these two together and try to generate a more integrated immune response that would bring together all arms of the immune system against the tumor.  The resulting treatment consists of four parts: an antibody targeted to the tumor; a vaccine targeted to the tumor; IL-2; and a molecule that blocks PD1, a receptor found on T cells. Each of these molecules plays a critical role in enhancing the overall immune response to the tumor. Antibodies stimulate the recruitment of additional immune cells that help to activate T cells; the vaccine stimulates proliferation of T cells that can attack the tumor; IL-2 helps the T cell population to expand quickly; and the anti-PD1 molecule helps T cells stay active longer. Tumor elimination The researchers tested this combination treatment in mice that were implanted with three different types of tumors   melanoma, lymphoma, and breast cancer. These types of engineered tumors are much more difficult to treat than human tumors implanted in mice, because they suppress the immune response against them. The researchers found that in these strains of mice, about 75 percent of the tumors were eliminated. Furthermore, six months later, the researchers injected tumor cells into the same mice and found that their immune systems could completely clear the tumor cells.  To our knowledge, nobody has been able to take tumors that big and cure them with a therapy consisting entirely of injecting biomolecular drugs instead of transplanting T cells,  Wittrup says.  Exploiting the existing, endogenous, normal T cell repertoire of the tumor-bearing mouse (or human) overcomes the need for T cell transfer, making the therapy more readily applicable in the clinic,  says Willem Overwijk, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research.  Overall, this is a highly sophisticated, cleverly engineered combination therapy with many unique properties that result in very powerful anti-tumor activity,  Overwijk says.  After celebrating this exciting achievement, much work remains to be done to translate the learned lessons and observed principles into a therapeutic for patients with cancer.

The findings, from scientists at Imperial College London, suggest potential new ways of tackling the bacteria, such as interfering with the decoys. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is responsible for thousands of deaths around the world each year. However, because the bacteria are resistant to many different antibiotics, treatment options are limited, and often ineffective. One of the few antibiotics that can be used against MRSA is a drug of last resort known as daptomycin. However nearly a third of MRSA infections are not cured by this drug, leaving patients with a poor prognosis. But until now scientists didn t know how MRSA managed to survive daptomycin treatment. In the latest findings, published in the journal Nature Microbiology, a team from Imperial discovered that MRSA releases decoy molecules that allow them to escape being killed by the antibiotic. The decoys are made of the same type of fat that make up the outer layer of MRSA cells. The antibiotic usually latches onto this fat layer, before drilling a hole through the outer shell and killing the bacteria. However, when MRSA releases these fatty decoy molecules the antibiotic latches onto these instead, and is deactivated. Dr Andrew Edwards, lead author from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, explained:  These fat molecules act in a similar way to the decoy flares released by fighter planes to avoid a missile. The antibiotic mistakenly targets the decoys, allowing the bacteria to evade destruction. This is the first time this decoy system has been seen in MRSA.  Using bacterial cells in the laboratory and mouse experiments, the scientists discovered that only some MRSA bacteria can use this decoy system. The team believe this is why around 30 per cent of infections are not cured by the antibiotic daptomycin. In these resistant infections, the MRSA bacteria turn off a communication system they normally use to  talk  to each other. This communication system allows the bacteria to release toxins that damage human cells. However, this system also seems to interfere with decoy production. Dr Edwards, who is based at the Medical Research Council s Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection at Imperial, explained:  These MRSA bacteria  go dark  and stop all communication. It is the switching off of this communication system that allows the decoys to work so effectively.  He added:  Our focus now is on understanding more about how these decoys are made and how they can be shut off completely to help daptomycin work better in patients.  Dr Edwards said that a similar decoy mechanism has been seen in E. coli bacteria.  Our findings suggest we may have underappreciated the importance of this decoy system, and that it probably exists in many other bacteria.  Further experiments revealed the release of decoys can be partially prevented using a second antibiotic, similar to penicillin, called oxacillin. Although MRSA is resistant to oxacillin, using it alongside daptomycin may allow the latter antibiotic to kill the bug more effectively. Previous research has suggested penicillin-type antibiotics help daptomycin to kill MRSA   although scientists didn t know why. A clinical trial using the two antibiotics, led by an Australian team, is currently now underway. Furthermore, tests revealed that a next generation antibiotic, currently in clinical trials, seems to stop production of the fatty decoys.  This suggests this new antibiotic may also help daptomycin kill MRSA   which could provide another treatment option for patients  added Dr Edwards. Dr Jonathan Pearce, head of infections and immunity at the Medical Research Council, which supported the work, said:  In the fight against antimicrobial resistance, we are desperately searching for new ways to treat bacterial infections like MRSA as they dangerously start to become resistant to even last resort antibiotics. This study has uncovered a rather cunning tactic that these and possibly other bacteria use to evade current treatment, and armed with this new knowledge, we can begin to develop new and improved treatments to help tackle what is one of the biggest threats to global health.  Professor Melanie Welham, Chief Executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, added:  This demonstrates the value of research that explores the frontiers of chemical biology in bacteria. Finding the biological mechanisms behind why antibiotics do and don t work is crucial in the fight against anti-microbial resistance.  The work was supported by the Medical Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Wellcome Trust.","Published: October 25, 2016"

As they got stronger, the amount of weight they lifted on each machine was increased to maintain the intensity at 80 per cent of their peak strength. The primary outcomes of a paper published in 2014 found these participants' global cognition improved significantly after the resistance training, as measured by tests including the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive scale. The cognitive training and placebo activities did not have this benefit. The benefits persisted even 12 months after the supervised exercise sessions ended. ""The more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting, the more likely we are to have a healthier aging population,"" said Dr. Mavros.

Richard van Rijn, an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology, looked at the effects of highly caffeinated energy drinks and highly caffeinated alcohol in adolescent mice. These alcohol studies cannot be performed in adolescent humans, but changes seen in mouse brains with drugs of abuse have been shown to correlate to those in humans in many drug studies. See Also: Rat study: Alcohol exposure during adolescence leads to chronic stress vulnerabilityThese energy drinks can contain as much as 10 times the caffeine as soda and are often marketed to adolescents. But little is known about the health effects of the drinks, especially when consumed with alcohol during adolescence. Van Rijn and graduate student Meridith Robins published results in the journal Alcohol that showed adolescent mice given high-caffeine energy drinks were not more likely than a control group to drink more alcohol as adults. But when those high levels of caffeine were mixed with alcohol and given to adolescent mice, they showed physical and neurochemical signs similar to mice given cocaine. ""It seems the two substances together push them over a limit that causes changes in their behavior and changes the neurochemistry in their brains,"" van Rijn said. ""We're clearly seeing effects of the combined drinks that we would not see if drinking one or the other."" With repeated exposure to the caffeinated alcohol, those adolescent mice became increasingly more active, much like mice given cocaine. The researchers also detected increased levels of the protein  FosB, which is marker of long-term changes in neurochemistry, elevated in those abusing drugs such as cocaine or morphine. Related: Your adolescent brain on alcohol: Changes last into adulthood""That's one reason why it's so difficult for drug users to quit because of these lasting changes in the brain,"" van Rijn said. Those same mice, as adults, showed a different preference or valuation of cocaine. Robins found that mice exposed to caffeinated alcohol during adolescence were less sensitive to the pleasurable effects of cocaine. While this sounds positive, it could mean that such a mouse would use more cocaine to get the same feeling as a control mouse. ""Mice that had been exposed to alcohol and caffeine were somewhat numb to the rewarding effects of cocaine as adults,"" van Rijn said. ""Mice that were exposed to highly caffeinated alcoholic drinks later found cocaine wasn't as pleasurable. They may then use more cocaine to get the same effect."" To test that theory, Robins investigated if mice exposed to caffeinated alcohol during adolescence would consume higher amounts of a similarly pleasurable substance - saccharine, an artificial sweetener. They predicted that if the mice exhibited a numbed sense of reward, they would consume more saccharine. They found that the caffeine/alcohol-exposed mice drank significantly more saccharine than mice exposed to water during adolescence, confirming that the caffeine/alcohol-exposed mice must have had a chemical change in the brain. ""Their brains have been changed in such a way that they are more likely to abuse natural or pleasurable substances as adults,"" van Rijn said.

See Also: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? Linking the change in brain folding to the tension on the cerebral cortex the outer layer of neural tissue in our brains the team found that as we age, the tension on the cortex appears to decrease. This effect was more pronounced in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Publishing their findings today in the academic journal PNAS, the team say this new research sheds light on the underlying mechanisms which affect brain folding and could be used in the future to help diagnose brain diseases. Lead author Dr. Yujiang Wang, of Newcastle University, explains: ""One of the key features of a mammalian brain is the grooves and folds all over the surface a bit like a walnut but until now no-one has been able to measure this folding in a consistent way. ""By mapping the brain folding of over 1,000 people, we have shown that our brains fold according to a simple universal law. We also show that a parameter of the law, which is interpreted as the tension on the inside of the cortex, decreases with age. Learn More: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice ""In Alzheimer's disease, this effect is observed at an earlier age and is more pronounced. The next step will be to see if there is a way to use the changes in folding as an early indicator of disease."" The expansion of the cerebral cortex is the most obvious feature of mammalian brain evolution and is generally accompanied by increasing degrees of folding of the cortical surface. In the average adult brain, for example, if the cortex of one hemisphere was unfolded and flattened out it would have a surface area of about 100,000 mm2, roughly one and a half times the size of a piece of A4 paper. Previous research has shown that folding of the cortex across mammalian species follows a universal law - that is, regardless of size and shape, they all fold in the same way. However, until now there has been no systematic study demonstrating that the same law holds within a species. ""Our study has shown that we can use this same law to study changes in the human brain,"" explains Dr. Wang, based in Newcastle University's School of Computing Science. Don't Miss: Substance with the potential to postpone aging""From this, we identified a parameter that decreases with age, which we interpret as changing the tension on the cortical surface. It would be similar to the skin. As we age, the tension drops and the skin starts to slacken. ""It has long been known that the size and thickness of the cortex changes with age but the existence of a general law for folding shows us how to combine these quantities into a single measure of folding that can then be compared between genders, age groups and disease states."" The team also found that male and female brains differ in size, surface area, and the degree of folding. Indeed, female brains tend to be slightly less folded than male brains of the same age. Despite this, male and female brains are shown to follow exactly the same law. ""This indicates that for the first time, we have a consistent way of quantifying cortical folding in humans,"" says Dr Wang. Read Next: Brain training using sounds can help aging brain ignore distractions Throughout the lifespan of healthy individuals, cortical folding changes in the same way in both men and women but in those with Alzheimer's disease the change in the brain folding was significantly different.

One woman could once again identify the tulips and daffodils in her garden. And a man restored his ability to issue commands to his border collie to herd the sheep on his farm and order his favorite meal from the drive-through restaurant. See Also: Why do people with Alzheimer's stop recognizing their loved ones? People with Alzheimer's dementia or primary progressive aphasia often have language problems, struggling to retrieve the name of a grandchild or find the words to order dinner in a restaurant. But their aphasia often goes untreated because most speech-language pathologists are trained to help children or individuals with stroke, not those with dementia. Northwestern scientists are closing that gap by developing a new program called the Communication Bridge in which specially trained speech-language pathologists offer personalized therapy over the web to those with dementia-related language impairment, also known as aphasia. A new pilot study shows the participants made significant improvement in recalling the words they had found troublesome after two months of therapy, and maintained that improvement after six months. One Colorado woman, after eight weeks of therapy and practice with virtual flashcards, could once again name the flowers in her garden and identify her golf swings. A woman from Alabama was able to retrieve the names of her grandchildren. ""These improvements are especially exciting because in neurodegenerative diseases we would expect declines, but these dementia patients are holding onto these gains,"" said lead author Emily Rogalski, associate professor at the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Learn More: Enriched blood cells preserve cognition in mice with features of Alzheimer's disease The new study showing the feasibility and early results of the program is published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions. ""There's a misconception that speech-language pathologists can't help people with dementia, but, in fact, they have many tools that can be helpful,"" Rogalski said. Individuals with dementia-related aphasia are able to learn, she noted. ""This is not a cure, but we may be able to delay some of the progression and maximize that person's remaining abilities so they can compensate as long as possible,"" Rogalski said. The program starts with an evaluation to determine a person's challenges and strengths. Then it includes eight therapy sessions with a specialized speech pathologist via a secure video-chat platform, videos to reinforce what was taught during the sessions and home assignments like virtual flashcards and a communication notebook to support language memory. Don't Miss: New front in battle with Alzheimer's, other protein-linked brain diseases ""It doesn't matter where the patient lives or where the speech-language pathologist lives. You can get the same quality of care anywhere in the world,"" Rogalski said, noting the program just enrolled a person from Singapore. The study participants included 31 individuals with early-to-mid-stage dementia from 21 states and Canada, and their care-partner. A care-partner usually a spouse or family member and the patient participate in the sessions together. Whether it's a couple who has been married for years or a parent and child, these pairs can learn effective communication strategies post-dementia diagnosis, Rogalski said. Feedback from participants, caregivers and therapists about the Communication Bridge program was overwhelmingly positive, the authors report. ""A lot of people said they went from feeling like they had no control over their disease to feeling like were really fighting back and empowered,"" said speech-language pathologist Becky Khayum, a consultant who worked on the study. ""They felt like they could more fully participate in life in spite of their disease."" ""If you are an avid golfer and you want to talk to your golfing friends, it's frustrating to be an expert but not able to retrieve those related words as easily anymore because of the disease,"" Rogalski said. ""The flashcards and strategies in this program are designed to help people retrieve those words again and maximize their daily lives. The goal is to help individuals engage in meaningful conversations and activities."" Some individuals might make a communication notebook with pictures and labels or write down a script and rehearse it. ""Maybe it's difficult for you to think of words, so you've avoided answering the phone or don't feel comfortable making doctor's appointments,"" Rogalski said. ""We can create scripts that people practice over time so that they become more comfortable and confident in their conversations."" Read Next: Bilingual brains better equipped to process information The program also helped participants read novels again, a pleasure some of them had lost to their disease, by simultaneously listening to the book on audio and reading it. The Communication Bridge grew out of conversations with dementia patients and their families who traveled from around the country to the Northwestern clinic for evaluation and treatment. When they returned home, they were frustrated that they didn't have access to a specialized speech-language therapist. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

For the study, researchers conducted imaging tests of the brains of pedophiles with and without a history of hand-on sexual offences against children, as well as healthy non-offending controls, during an assessment of what's called a response-inhibition task. Activation patterns in certain regions of the brain distinguished between offending and non-offending pedophiles.

A new study focusing on a different type of brain cell, the glial cells known as astrocytes, indicates they also are impaired by the genetic defect and are involved in the symptoms of the disease. Scientists are eager for new insights into fragile X syndrome since the failure in 2014 of two large clinical trials of drugs designed to treat the disease. Both drugs are inhibitors of a neurotransmitter pathway thought to be overactive in the brains of people with fragile X syndrome. The new findings, reported in a paper accepted for publication in Biological Psychiatry, may not explain the failure of those drugs to alleviate symptoms of the disease, but they do suggest that researchers need to look beyond neuronal effects to fully understand it. ""The clinical trials were a big disappointment because the drugs had been effective in animal models of fragile X syndrome. But if you compare humans to mice, we have a much higher ratio of astrocytes to neurons in our brains, so the effects on astrocytes may be more important in humans,"" said Yi Zuo, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of the new study. Glial cells were originally thought of as simply the ""glue"" that holds the neurons together in the brain, but they are now known to have a wide variety of important functions. Astrocytes, the most numerous glial cells, greatly outnumber neurons in the human brain and play crucial roles in neuronal functions and in the formation and stability of synapses (the connections between neurons). Synapse formation Synapse formation is significantly affected by fragile X syndrome, with both human and animal studies showing abnormal development of ""dendritic spines,"" the neuronal structures that form synapses. The syndrome is caused by a genetic defect on the X chromosome that knocks out production of a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a negative regulator of protein synthesis that affects the expression of many different proteins. Zuo, whose research focuses on synapse formation during learning, looked at the influence of FMRP on this process using a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. FMRP is normally expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Zuo's lab developed mice in which FMRP was either selectively deleted or exclusively expressed in astrocytes, then tracked the development of dendritic spines on neurons in the brains of these mice and tested their ability to learn new skills. The results showed that eliminating FMRP only in astrocytes led to abnormal development of dendritic spines as well as impaired learning of motor skills. But if FMRP was expressed only in astrocytes and not in neurons, spine development and learning ability were still abnormal. ""You need FMRP in both neurons and astrocytes for normal development of synapses,"" Zuo explained. The study also showed that loss of the FMRP protein causes an increase in spine formation during adolescence and less ""pruning"" of synapses during later development. As a result, adult mice lacking FMRP have an overabundance of dendritic spines, which is also seen in humans with fragile X syndrome. ""In future studies, we want to look at the molecular mechanisms involved in these observations,"" Zuo said. ""We are just beginning to recognize the importance of glial cells in neural development and neurological diseases. Astrocytes are very difficult to manipulate and study, so there is still a lot we do not understand.""

A team led by professor Massimiliano Mazzone has demonstrated that the metabolism of macrophages, a white blood cell, can be attuned to prevent the spread of cancer. The key is in making these macrophages more prone to  steal  sugar from the cells forming the tumor s blood vessels. Thus, these blood vessels will be structured more tightly, which can prevent cancer cells from spreading to other organs. These conclusions are published in the leading scientific journal Cell Metabolism. Macrophages are types of white blood cells that attack foreign micro-organisms and remove harmful substances within the body. Thus, they are an essential part of our immune system. On top of their positive effect on pathogens, macrophages can also play a negative role in cancer biology. Indeed, tumors contain a lot of specific macrophages that play a decisive role in the formation of blood vessels. In tumors, these vessels traditionally have a chaotic and dysfunctional buildup. As a result, cancer cells are more likely to escape through the vessels, enter the bloodstream and invade other organs. Out-of-control vessel creation While properties of macrophages have already been studied extensively, it remained unknown whether changing their metabolism would impact their functions. The team of prof. Mazzone and Dr. Mathias Wenes investigated this by blocking a specific gene called REDD1 in the macrophages. This stimulated the cells  glycolysis, the process by which they convert sugar into energy. Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven):  The supply of glucose to a tumor has a negative effect, comparable to giving too much sugar to a child: it causes hyper-activation of many cellular compartments. More specifically, the cells that are forming the blood vessels are getting out of control by this glucose overload. They quickly give shape to a chaotic, irregular vessel network typical to cancer.  By changing the macrophages  metabolism, we actually set up a  glucose competition  between the macrophages and the tumor s blood vessels. As a result, the macrophages can eat the glucose instead of the blood vessel cells. Because the latter are not overstimulated anymore, they are able to create vessels in a gentler way. This forms a structured and strong vessel barrier around the tumor, preventing cancer cells to escape to the bloodstream and invade distant organs.  Impact on future therapies Because of research s many aspects, prof. Mazzone joined forces with the lab of prof. Peter Carmeliet (VIB-KU Leuven), specialized in the formation of blood vessels, and with Bart Ghesqui re (VIB-KU Leuven), a leading metabolism expert. Together, they also investigated the consequences of mTOR inhibitors, existing cancer drugs aimed at reducing the growth of tumors. Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven):  These mTOR inhibitors are only partially effective in patients. In mice, we found that these drugs can sometimes increase the spread of cancer because they hinder glycolysis in macrophages. That is why we are currently examining whether we could use our findings to predict people s resistance to mTOR inhibitors. ","Published: October 24, 2016"

""Our microfabrication approach opens new avenues for in vitro tissue engineering, toxicology and drug screening research,"" said Kit Parker, Ph.D., senior coauthor of the study, who is a Wyss Core Faculty member and Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at SEAS. Organs-on-chips mimic the structure and function of native tissue and have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional animal testing. Wyss Institute research teams led by Parker and Wyss Founding Director and Core Faculty member Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., have developed microphysiological systems that mimic the microarchitecture and functions of lungs, hearts, tongues and intestines. However, the fabrication and data collection process for organs-on-chips is expensive and laborious. Currently, these devices are built in clean rooms using a complex, multi-step lithographic process and collecting data requires microscopy or high-speed cameras. ""Our approach was to address these two challenges simultaneously via digital manufacturing,"" said Travis Busbee, coauthor of the paper and graduate student at Wyss and SEAS.  ""By developing new printable inks for multi-material 3D printing, we were able to automate the fabrication process while increasing the complexity of the devices."" The researchers developed six different inks that integrated soft strain sensors within the microarchitecture of the tissue. In a single, continuous procedure, the team 3D printed those materials into a cardiac microphysiological device - a heart on a chip - with integrated sensors.   ""We are pushing the boundaries of three-dimensional printing by developing and integrating multiple functional materials within printed devices,"" said Jennifer Lewis, Sc.D., who is a Wyss Core Faculty member and the Hansjorg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at SEAS, and senior coauthor of the study. ""This study is a powerful demonstration of how our platform can be used to create fully functional, instrumented chips for drug screening and disease modeling."" The chip contains multiple wells, each with separate tissues and integrated sensors, allowing researchers to study many engineered cardiac tissues at once. To demonstrate the efficacy of the device, the team performed drug studies and longer-term studies of gradual changes in the contractile stress of engineered cardiac tissues, which can occur over the course of several weeks. ""Researchers are often left working in the dark when it comes to gradual changes that occur during cardiac tissue development and maturation because there has been a lack of easy, non-invasive ways to measure the tissue functional performance,"" said Lind. ""These integrated sensors allow researchers to continuously collect data while tissues mature and improve their contractility. Similarly, they will enable studies of gradual effects of chronic exposure to toxins.""

They showed how a diseased vertebrate brain can naturally react to Alzheimer s pathology by forming more neurons. Two proteins (Interleukin-4 and STAT6) have been identified to be relevant for this process. This is a big step towards the understanding, prevention or even healing of Alzheimer s disease   a disease with about 170,000 new cases diagnosed every year in Germany. The results have been published in the scientific journal Cell Reports this week.  Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Affected people are troubled with symptoms like memory loss, disorientation or changes in behavior. Patients are affected in their day-to-day life and are dependent on the help of others. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 per cent of dementia cases worldwide, mainly affecting people above the age of 65. Alzheimer's disease has no current cure, which together with the high number of new cases each year emphasizes the high relevance of research in this field.  The study of the laboratory of Dr. Caghan Kizil used the animal model zebrafish, which can regenerate their brain. Zebrafish have an extensive ability to replenish the lost neurons after various types of damage, and the team led by Dr. Kizil showed that it can also do so after Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration. This is an ability humans do not have. Evolutionarily, the zebrafish and human beings are very similar: the cell types in the zebrafish brain and their physiological roles are very like humans, and more than 80 percent of the genes humans have, are identical in the zebrafish. Therefore, zebrafish are an ideal model for studying complex diseases of humans in a very simplistic way.  We believe that understanding how zebrafish can cope with neurodegeneration would help us to design clinical therapy options for humans, such as for Alzheimer's disease. Within this study, we observed Alzheimer-like conditions in the fish brain. We found that zebrafish can impressively increase the neural stem cell proliferation and formation of new neurons even after Alzheimer's-like pathology. This is amazing because to treat Alzheimer's we need to generate more neurons. And this all starts with neural stem cell proliferation, which fails in our diseased brains , Caghan Kizil explains.  This study has shown that Alzheimer's disease symptoms can be recapitulated in the zebrafish brain using a short section of human APP protein that is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (Amyloid-  42). This protein part causes the death of neurons, inflammation, loss of neuronal connections and deficits in memory formation in zebrafish. Caghan Kizil s research group including the lead author involved in the study, Prabesh Bhattarai, found that the immune-related molecule Interleukin-4 (which is also present in the human brain) is produced by the immune cells and dying neurons in the fish brain. This molecule alerts the neural stem cells that there is danger around. Stem cells then start to proliferate through a cell-intrinsic mechanism involving another protein of central function called STAT6. The importance of this study lies in the notion that the diseased brain and the inflammatory milieu there can be modulated to kick- start neural stem cell proliferation, and this is exactly what successfully regenerating vertebrates do.  The next steps towards an understanding of Alzheimer s disease are clearly defined:  We will go on identifying more factors required for a successful  regeneration  response in fish brain after an Alzheimer's disease-like situation. By doing so, we can get a more complete picture of the molecular programs beneficial for tackling this atrocious disease. Zebrafish will tell us the candidate genes we should focus on in our brains for possible regenerative therapies. I believe that we can come up with meaningful therapies only by combining an increase in the proliferation of stem cells with the existing methods of prevention (existing drugs, rehabilitation approaches, preventive precautions etc.) , Caghan Kizil says.

The PreciseType HEA test is the only FDA-approved molecular assay designed to provide clinicians and blood banks with the detailed genetic matching information they need to reduce the risk of alloimmunization and serious hemolytic reactions, which is especially problematic for patients receiving frequent blood transfusions. The added utility of screening donors for Sickle Cell Trait addresses the desire to avoid transfusing red blood cells from SCT donors to sickle cell disease patients or neonates. SCT screening has traditionally been performed by solubility testing of Sickle Hemoglobin (Hbs) in buffer, but blood centers have been looking for an alternative due to limitations in this method. A molecular approach using PreciseType HEA can overcome throughput limitations and reduce false positive rates, both of which act to limit the potential donor pool. ""We ve successfully demonstrated the clinical benefits of our PreciseType HEA Test, and this is evident in the FDA broadening its approved use,"" said Immucor Vice President of Medical Affairs Dr. Michael Spigarelli. ""The use of PreciseType HEA to screen donor units for patients with sickle cell disease, neonates or any individual that may require SCT negative blood provides a great improvement over previously used methods, and offers the first FDA approved molecular method specifically for screening units."" ""We had already validated the PreciseType HEA test for this purpose in our lab,"" said the New York Blood Center's Executive Scientific Director of Immunohematology, Genomics, and Rare Blood Connie Westhoff, SBB, Ph.D. ""Our previous screening method required manual testing and interpretation of the results and had high false positive rates. About 1 in 12 minority donors possess the sickle trait, so accurate results are important to us to avoid unnecessary notifications to donors and deferred blood units. We are now able to identify SCT in our donors utilizing the same PreciseType HEA test we are already running on many of our donors without running additional tests."" Dr. Westhoff is an expert in transfusion therapy for patients with sickle cell disease and in the application of molecular diagnostics to transfusion medicine. She oversaw a clinical trial of the PreciseType HEA at the New York Blood Center, and she is also an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and is associate editor of the journal Transfusion blood group genomics and hematology section. ""Patients with sickle cell disease can require frequent transfusions, and clinicians desire to maximize the efficacy of these transfusions. This molecular method provides a readily accessible way to make this desire a reality. Now, when SCT negative units are requested by a physician for a sickle cell patient, laboratory directors have access to an FDA approved method to rapidly perform this testing to fulfill that request and allow the patient to receive the blood that was ordered,  Spigarelli added. Blood from SCT donors can also present a problem when performing the required filtration of white cells from the blood donation. The use of a molecular test will allow these units to be identified prior to filtration. Early and accurate identification allows blood center staff an opportunity to decide how best to utilize the various components of a valuable whole blood donation to provide the best blood products to patients who need them.","Published: October 24, 2016"

Kunal Mankodiya, director of URI s Wearable Biosensing Laboratory, says he s researching how to transform gloves, socks, clothing and even shoes into high-tech items that will make people healthier and improve their lives. Mankodiya s research focuses on smart textiles wearable items embedded with sensors, electronics and software that can collect data from patients, even though they are at home, and deliver it to doctors. The benefit is that doctors will be able to make more informed decisions remotely, and patients will be more involved with their care. The professor and his team of students have been working on  smart wearables  for years as part of their research on the  Internet of Things,  a framework to automate human interactions with Cloud computing. One creation that made headlines last year was a wristband that monitors the tremors of Parkinson s patients and sends that information to doctors over an Internet connection. The team is turning its attention to textiles, designing items for patients with neurological illnesses. The gloves are the latest project. They are embedded with sensors on the fingers and thumb that measure tremors and rigidity   common symptoms of Parkinson s. The gloves, in turn, are connected to cell phones, which process the data and deliver it to neurologists in their offices. This way, doctors can manage the treatment plan of the patient day-to-day, ensuring that medication is working properly and eliminating the need for patients to make stressful clinical visits.  Patients with Parkinson s face many mobility issues   driving and even walking long distances,  Mankodiya says.  The glove will give patients the option of receiving health care while remaining at home, and it also reduces the risk of falls and other accidents.  Mankodiya is also working on high-tech socks for people who have suffered strokes. Again, sensors and software woven into the fabric relay information about a patient s gait to doctors and physical therapists so they can tailor rehabilitation therapy to each patient.  The socks examine the walking stride,  Mankodiya says.  They can quantify movements of the knee and ankle joints to find subtle irregularities that require therapy. The socks also monitor a patient s progress.  Other projects focus on developing tools to image, sense and record brain function to treat Parkinson s, as well as other neurological diseases, like epilepsy. The projects were made possible through National Science Foundation grants, one of which involves collaboration with Walter Besio, URI professor of biomedical engineering. In addition, Mankodiya is partnering with Lifespan Hospitals to create smartwatch technologies for patients with psychiatric illnesses and autism. Although research is still in the early stages, the watches are expected to measure the patients  daily behavior and activities. Nick Peltier, a senior majoring in computer science, is creating a smartwatch app that will help people with autism. He says the project is the most satisfying one he s tackled at URI.  I hope the watch will help these patients learn about themselves and make it easier for the parents and caregivers to know what s going on,  says Peltier, of Coventry.  Let s say a response is triggered every Tuesday, at the same time, on the patient s smartwatch. The next step would be to determine what s happening during that time on that day so the person can make adjustments.  Matt Constant, a junior computer engineering major, is also working on the smartwatch app, as well as the glove.  It s very fulfilling,  says Constant of West Warwick.  I get to apply what I m learning in classes and also help people. I m experiencing things at URI that I would never learn otherwise.

Their current focus is on visualization, interaction and communication   which is why smartLAB 2017 is taglined  communicating science interactively.  The smartLAB 2017 showcase will feature several devices that are new to laboratory integration. These include an interactive dispenser, a QR code scanner, an SLS (selective laser sintering) 3D printer and an induction charging station for mobile devices. The interactive dimension will be supplied by a robotic arm that has been tested and licensed for human-machine interaction in the lab, an app that visitors can use to directly view the SmartLAB display s laboratory information management system (LIMS), and a remote presence robot. Of course, the key benefit of the smartLAB lies not in the unique or special nature of its individual components, but in how those components interact with one another.  We have a truly holistic view of laboratory value chains and are developing smart solutions accordingly,  smartLab Group spokesperson Simon Bungers explained.  We are using the smartLAB initiative to explore options for radically simplifying lab processes and documentation while enhancing quality and efficiency,  he added. Occupying an area of more than 400 square meters (4,300 sq. ft.), the smartLAB showcase will comprise a showroom housing the actual smartLAB plus an exhibition area where the participating enterprises and institutions can run their own displays and explore various aspects of tomorrow s intelligent laboratories in presentations and panel discussions. Among the highlights of the showcase will be a series of daily use-case demonstrations that will paint a very concrete picture of tomorrow s intelligent laboratories. Three use cases will be demonstrated live on each day of LABVOLUTION. They will be from the fields of biotechnology, environmental technology and food technology. Specifically, they relate to an application for inoculating bioreactors and initiating bioprocess monitoring; an application for determining the phosphate content of soil samples, and an application for testing food samples for the presence of genetically modified components. The smartLAB project has also spawned the smartLAB Innovation Network   a Germany-wide cluster of companies and research institutions dedicated to the development and standardization of innovative laboratory technologies. The network is part of Germany s government-sponsored Central Innovation Program (ZIM).","Published: October 24, 2016"

Using this strategy, it was possible to induce long lasting serotype specific neutralizing antibody responses by increasing the bio-availability of the antigen.  Abstract: Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The virus is endemic in over 120 countries, causing over 350 million infections per year. Dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce simultaneous protection against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes and evidence that, under some conditions, vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus. While several live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccines display partial efficacy, it has been challenging to induce balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. Instead of using whole-virus formulations, we are exploring the potentials for a particulate subunit vaccine, based on DENV E-protein displayed on nanoparticles that have been precisely molded using PRINT technology. Here we describe immunization studies with a DENV2-nanoparticle vaccine candidate. The ectodomain of DENV2-E protein was expressed as a secreted recombinant protein (sRecE), purified and adsorbed to poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles of different sizes and shape. We show that PRINT nanoparticle adsorbed sRecE without any adjuvant induces higher IgG titers and a more potent DENV2-specific neutralizing antibody response compared to the soluble sRecE protein alone. Antigen trafficking indicate that PRINT nanoparticle display of sRecE prolongs the bio-availability of the antigen in the draining lymph nodes by creating an antigen depot. Our results demonstrate that PRINT nanoparticles are a promising platform for delivering subunit vaccines against flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika. The article Precisely Molded Nanoparticle Displaying DENV-E Proteins Induces Robust Serotype-Specific Neutralizing Antibody Responses is published online in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and is available free of charge.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mapping-serotonin-in-the-living-brain-200213,Mapping Serotonin in the Living Brain Imaging technique that creates a  D video of serotonin transport could aid antidepressant development  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that s partly responsible for feelings of happiness and for mood regulation in humans. This makes it a common target for antidepressants, which block serotonin from being reabsorbed by neurons after it has dispatched its signal, so more of it stays floating around the brain. Now MIT researchers have developed an imaging technique that, for the first time, enables three-dimensional mapping of serotonin as it s reabsorbed into neurons, across multiple regions of the living brain. This technique, the researchers say, gives an unprecedented view of serotonin dynamics, and could be a powerful tool for the research and development of antidepressants.  Until now, it was not possible to look at how neurotransmitters are transported into cells across large regions of the brain,  says Aviad Hai, a postdoc in the Department of Biological Engineering and first author of a paper describing the technique in Neuron.  It s the first time you can see the inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, like antidepressants, working in different parts of the brain, and you can use this information to analyze all sorts of antidepressant drugs, discover new ones, and see how those drugs affect the serotonin system across the brain.  The paper s other authors are Alan Jasanoff, a professor of biological engineering; and three other researchers in Jasanoff s lab: Lili X. Cai, Taekwan Lee, and Victor S. Lelyveld. Measuring reuptake Many antidepressants that target serotonin work by blocking serotonin transporters that reabsorb the neurotransmitter into a neuron, so it can be reused after it has sent a chemical signal. Aptly called  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs), these drugs increase levels of serotonin in the brain, alleviating feelings of anxiety and depression caused by low levels of the neurotransmitter. Researchers most commonly study the effect of antidepressants using a technique known as microdialysis, in which they insert a probe into the brain to take tiny chemical samples from the tissue. But this method is time-consuming and limited in scope, as it allows them to study only a single location at a time. For the new imaging technique, the researchers engineered a protein to act as a sensor that latches onto serotonin and detaches at the moment of reuptake. The sensor is injected, along with serotonin, and emits a signal that can be read by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The trick is that the sensor remains off   emitting a low signal   when bound to serotonin, and turns on   creating a much brighter signal   when serotonin is removed. In the new system, a mathematical model uses the fMRI signal data to construct a 3-D map that consists of more than 1,000 voxels (pixels in three dimensions), with each voxel representing a single point of measurement of serotonin reuptake. Based on the signal strength at each point, the model calculates the amount of serotonin that gets absorbed, in the presence and absence of SSRIs.  Basically, what we ve seen in this work is a method for measuring how much of a neurotransmitter is being [absorbed], and how that amount, or rate, is affected by different drugs   in a highly parallel fashion across much of the brain,  Jasanoff says. That information could be very valuable for testing drug efficacy, he says. Mapping antidepressant dynamics To validate the sensor, the researchers successfully measured the expected effect of the SSRI fluoxetine, commonly called Prozac, on serotonin transporters in six subregions of a brain area known as the basal ganglia. These subregions are thought to play a role in motivation, reward, cognition, learning, emotion, and other functions and behaviors. In doing so, the researchers simultaneously recorded a stronger decrease of serotonin reuptake in response to Prozac among three of the subregions, while noting a very weak response in one other region. These results were anticipated, Jasanoff says.  But now we re able to map that effect in three dimensions, across brain regions,  he says, which could lead to advances in studying the effects of drugs on specific parts of the brain. But the researchers did uncover a surprising finding. While mapping the effects of a dopamine transport reuptake inhibitor   made to target only dopamine   they found the drug reduced serotonin reuptake, to an extent comparable to that of SSRIs, in three subregions, one of which is known for high dopamine transporter expression. Previous studies had indicated that dopamine transporter proteins can aid in low levels of serotonin reuptake, but the new findings show the effect is widespread in the living brain, Jasanoff says. This experiment provides further proof of a strong interplay between the serotonin and dopamine systems, and indicates that antidepressants may be less effective when targeting just one of the two neurotransmitters, Hai says.  It may not be sufficient to just block serotonin reuptake, because there s another system   dopamine   that plays a role in serotonin transport as well,  he says.  It s almost proof that when you use antidepressants that   target both systems, it could be more effective.  Next steps for the researchers are to explore different regions of the brain with this sensor, including the dorsal raphe, which produces most of the brain s serotonin. They re also making another nanoparticle-based sensor that is more sensitive than one used for this study.  The ability to simultaneously measure serotonin clearance across a broad cross-section of brain regions is an important, and complimentary, addition to the existing tool belt of approaches used to measure serotonin release and clearance kinetics in vivo,  says Lynette Daws, a professor of physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center.  The application of fMRI to measure these processes affords temporal and spatial resolution not previously possible, and opens new vistas for analyzing drug action on serotonin neurochemistry in living animals.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mris-for-fetal-health-201669,MRIs for Fetal Health Algorithm could help analyze fetal scans to determine whether interventions are warranted   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers from MIT, Boston Children's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital have joined forces in an ambitious new project to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the health of fetuses. Typically, fetal development is monitored with ultrasound imaging, which is cheap and portable and can gauge blood flow through the placenta, the organ in the uterus that delivers nutrients to the fetus. But MRI could potentially measure the concentration of different chemicals in the placenta and in fetal organs, which may have more diagnostic value. Earlier this year, in a project led by Ellen Grant s group in the Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center at Boston Children s Hospital (BCH), members of the research team presented a paper showing that MRI measurements of oxygen absorption rates in the placenta can indicate placental disorders that might endanger the fetus. Grant is a professor of pediatrics and radiology at the Harvard Medical School (HMS). And at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention this week, a team led by Polina Golland s group at MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory presented a paper demonstrating a new algorithm for tracking organs through sequences of MRI scans, which will make MRI monitoring much more useful. Much of Golland s prior work has dealt with algorithmic analysis of MRI scans of the brain.  The question is, why can t you just use everything that we ve done in the last 25 years in the brain to apply in this case?  says Golland, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science.  And the answer is that for the brain, when the person is performing a particular task in the scanner, they re lying still. And then after the fact, you can use algorithmic approaches to correct for very small motions. Inside the uterus, well, you can t tell the mother not to breathe. And you can t tell the baby not to kick.  Frame by frame  When you re trying to understand whether it s a healthy intrauterine environment, you look at fetal growth by doing measurements with ultrasound, and you look at the velocities of waveforms in the umbilical arteries,  says Grant.  But neither of those are direct measures of placental function. They re downstream effects. Our goal is to come up with methods for assessing the spatiotemporal function of the placenta directly. If you really want to intervene, you want to intervene before the placenta fails.  Grant leads the clinical arm of the project together with Lawrence Wald, a physicist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of radiology at HMS. Elfar Adalsteinsson, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science, is collaborating with colleagues at BCH to develop new MRI technologies for fetal imaging, and Golland s group oversees developing software for interpreting the images. An MRI image might consist of hundreds of two-dimensional cross sections of an anatomical region, stitched into a three-dimensional whole. Measuring chemical changes over time requires analyzing sequences of such three-dimensional representations   about 300, in the case of the new paper. The researchers refer to each MRI image in a series as a  frame,  analogous to frames of video. The first step in localizing chemical changes to organs, of course, is identifying the organs. That s where the researchers  new algorithm comes in. With MRI images of brain activity, it s comparatively easy to determine which anatomical features in one frame correspond to which features in the next. The subject s head is immobilized, and brain regions don t change shape or location over the course of a scan. Algorithmically, the standard method for coordinating frames is to identify a region in the first frame and then map it separately onto each of the frames that follow. With fetal MRIs, that won t work, because the fetus may have moved dramatically between, say, frame one and frame 200. So Golland and her co-authors   including first author Ruizhi Liao, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science; Grant; and Adalsteinsson   took a different approach. On a roll Their algorithm begins by finding a mathematical function that maps the pixels of the first frame onto those of the second; then it maps the mathematically transformed version of the first frame onto the third, and so on. The result is a series of mathematical operations that describes the evolution of the scan.  The way to think about how this algorithm works is, it takes the baseline frame   for example, the first one   and it rolls it down the sequence,  Golland says. Next, a human expert draws very precise boundaries around the elements of interest in the first frame   in this case, not just the placenta but the brain and liver as well. Those elements  movements or deformations from frame to frame can then be calculated using the previously determined mathematical operations. Hand-drawing organ boundaries   or  segmenting  an MRI scan   is a time-consuming process. But performing it only once is much less onerous than performing it 300 times. To evaluate the accuracy of their algorithm, the researchers hand-segmented an additional five frames.  Two members of the team sat there for about a week and drew outlines,  Golland says.  It s a very painful validation process, but you have to do it to believe the results.  The algorithm s segmentations accorded very well with those performed by hand.  One of the big problems in high-speed acquisition and MR [magnetic resonance] acquisition is definitely the incorporation of motion and trying to deal with motion issues,  says Sarang Joshi, a professor of bioengineering at the University of Utah.  Modeling and incorporating the deformation estimation in MR acquisition is a big challenge, and we have been working on it as well, and many other people have been working on it. So, this is a really great step forward. ","Published: October 24, 2016"

These modifications   chemical tags known as methyl groups   influence viral replication and the human immune response. The study is published October 20 by Cell Host & Microbe.  I m excited about this study because it teaches us something new about the human immune system,  said senior author Tariq Rana, PhD, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  But these findings are also something researchers should keep in mind as they are designing new Zika virus vaccines and treatments that target the viral genome   some approaches won t work unless they take methylation into account.  In human cells, RNA is the genetic material that carries instructions from the DNA in a cell s nucleus out to the cytoplasm, where molecular machinery uses those instructions to build proteins. Cells can chemically modify RNA to influence protein production. One of these modifications is the addition of methyl groups to adenosine, one of the building blocks that make up RNA. Known as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), this modification is common in humans and other organisms.  In contrast to humans, the entire genomes of some viruses, including Zika and HIV, are made up of RNA instead of DNA. These viruses hijack the host s cellular machinery to translate its RNA to proteins. Rana and his team previously discovered that m6A plays an important role in HIV infection.  After that, we decided to investigate m6A RNA in Zika virus as well, since we didn t want to miss out on this important information the way we missed it for 30 years of HIV research,  Rana said. When Zika virus infects a human cell, Rana s team found, the cell modifies viral RNA with m6A as a means to get rid of the infection. RNA tagged with m6A is a beacon for human enzymes that come along and destabilize it. In addition, they found that this host response to Zika viral infection also induced specific m6A modifications on human RNA. These human RNA changes were not present in the absence of Zika virus.  To unravel the role of m6A in Zika virus infection of human cells growing in the laboratory, the researchers removed the human enzymes responsible for adding methyl groups to viral RNA. Without m6A, the viral RNA was more stable and viral replication increased, as compared to human cells with normal methylation enzymes. In contrast, silencing the human enzymes that remove methyl groups   increasing m6A methylation, in other words   decreased Zika virus production. Next, Rana and team will investigate the role of RNA modifications in the viral life cycle, and how the human immune response is altered by various Zika virus strains. They are also developing small molecules to target specific RNA structures as a means to treat Zika virus infections. ","Published: October 24, 2016"

University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers studied several ALS cases with a mutation in a RNA-binding protein known as hnRNP A2/B1. In the study, published October 20 by Neuron, they describe how damage to this protein contributes to ALS by scrambling crucial cellular messaging systems.  Our findings are a significant step forward in validating RNA-based therapy as a treatment for ALS,  said senior author Gene Yeo, PhD, professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a devastating neurological condition affecting more than 20,000 Americans. The disease greatly diminishes patients  quality of life and is terminal. ALS affects a special kind of nerve cell called a motor neuron. These motor neurons enable us to move our bodies. Currently, there are no effective treatments for ALS, largely due to poor understanding of how the disease initiates and progresses at the molecular level.   Yeo s team studies RNA-binding proteins and their ability to control how, when and if cells make certain proteins. To unravel the role RNA-binding proteins play in ALS, Yeo s team gathered skin cells from four patients with the disease   three with mutations in the hnRNP A2/B1 gene, one with a mutation in a different gene   and two healthy volunteers as controls. The researchers coaxed these skin cells into becoming a special kind of stem cell called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and ultimately turned these patient-specific stem cells into motor neurons. This technique provided them with personalized models of each patient s disease, in a laboratory dish, where it s easy to do experiments.  To determine the effects of the mutant hnRNP A2/B1 proteins in these samples, the researchers then measured the activity of thousands of genes in each of the ALS and healthy motor neuron samples. In the ALS patient samples, Yeo and team found that the hnRNP A2/B1 mutation these patients had didn t merely disable the protein. Instead, the mutation gave the protein new toxic properties that scrambled RNA processing, and ultimately led to the death of motor neurons.  Yeo said these findings may have important implications for their collaborators and others who are developing therapeutics that aim to treat disease by targeting RNA.   These RNA-targeting therapies can eliminate toxic proteins and treat disease,  said first author Fernando Martinez, a graduate student in Yeo s laboratory.  But this strategy is only viable if the proteins have gained new toxic functions through mutation, as we found here for hnRNP A2/B1 in these ALS cases.  Environmental factors are thought to contribute to ALS; increasing the chances a person with a genetic predisposition will get the disease. To mimic this scenario, Martinez compared how motor neurons from ALS patients and healthy individuals respond to stress. In the patient-specific ALS motor neurons under stress, they found more hnRNP A2/B1 proteins clumped in a part of the cells called stress granules, as compared to healthy cells.   Drugs that lower the exaggerated reaction to stressors that we saw in motor neurons from ALS patients may also prove a powerful therapeutic strategy,  Yeo said.  It is likely that multiple, multi-directional shots at goal will be needed to treat this debilitating disease. ","Published: October 24, 2016"

It is the most common movement disorder, yet most people don't even know its name. Essential tremor affects nearly one per cent of the world's population, increasing to four per cent of those over 40. The involuntary shaking of hands is the most common symptom, but symptoms can also include shaking of the head and legs. Often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor has less severe health impacts, but does get worse over time and can have debilitating consequences. Essential tremor has a large genetic component; it is common to have large families with several members affected. Until recently, however, the genetic mechanism behind the disease remained unknown. See Also: Study uncovers genetic variation that predicted type and rate of physical decline in patients with Parkinson's disease Researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital of McGill University and Kiel University in Germany have led a large international collaborative study that sheds new light on the genetics behind essential tremor, in a paper published in the journal Brain. It is the largest study on essential tremor to date. Studying a group of 2,809 patients, the researchers found a strong correlation between essential tremor and a gene known as STK32B. They also found two other genes correlated to a lesser extent with the disease. Now they plan to test even more patients to understand how these genes may contribute to the development of the disease and find other predisposing genes. ""We have the first clue now, but we want to expand on that because we still have much to learn"" says Simon Girard, now a professor at the Universit  du Quebec   Chicoutimi and the paper's lead author. Ideally to follow up this study the team needs to recruit 10,000 additional essential tremor sufferers. These new subjects would be studied to identify new genes that predispose individuals to essential tremor. Once there is a more complete understanding of the genetic basis of essential tremor, scientists will be in a position to better understand the roles these genes play in the disease, and devise better diagnostic tools and treatments. Girard says recruiting the large number of patients needed will be a challenge, in part because many sufferers do not seek medical care. ""Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder, but many sufferers don't seek medical help,"" he says. ""People suffer from the tremor, but they tend to make do as best they can. Some people have had a tremor for 10-20 years or more. They know they have a tremor and they live with it.""

The study appears in the journal PLoS Genetics. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults, and the presence of certain genetic variants increases an individual's risk for developing this disease. See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression Baylor researchers Dr. Shinya Yamamoto, assistant professor of molecular and human genetics; Dr. Joshua M. Shulman, assistant professor of neurology, neuroscience, and molecular and human genetics, and Dr. Hugo J. Bellen, professor and director of the program in developmental biology and also an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, were part of an international team that analyzed samples from 1,393 subjects with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and compared the results with those of 8,141 neurologically healthy individuals. The consortium found a variant in TM2D3, a gene that has never been studied in human or other vertebrate species. Interestingly, while the probability of this variant was very rare among people of European ancestry, it was significantly enriched among Icelanders (but still less than 1 percent frequency). The researchers estimated that carriers of this variant would have an approximately six-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. To further understand the impact of the discovered mutation and its potential link to processes that lead to Alzheimer's disease, the Baylor researchers studied the function of TM2D3 in the fruit fly model system. They found that loss-of-function of theTM2D3 gene causes abnormal development of the fly's nervous system. They next showed that human normal TM2D3 could functionally substitute for its fly counterpart and rescue the neurodevelopmental defect, whereas introduction of the Alzheimer's disease-associated variant was unable to restore the normal function.

University of California (UC) San Diego School of Medicine researchers studied several ALS cases with a mutation in a RNA-binding protein known as hnRNP A2/B1. In the study, published in Neuron, they describe how damage to this protein contributes to ALS by scrambling crucial cellular messaging systems. See Also: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs ""Our findings are a significant step forward in validating RNA-based therapy as a treatment for ALS,"" said senior author Gene Yeo, PhD, professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a devastating neurological condition affecting more than 20,000 Americans. The disease greatly diminishes patients' quality of life and is terminal. ALS affects a special kind of nerve cell called a motor neuron. These motor neurons enable us to move our bodies. Currently, there are no effective treatments for ALS, largely due to poor understanding of how the disease initiates and progresses at the molecular level. Yeo's team studies RNA-binding proteins and their ability to control how, when and if cells make certain proteins. To unravel the role RNA-binding proteins play in ALS, Yeo's team gathered skin cells from four patients with the disease three with mutations in the hnRNP A2/B1 gene, one with a mutation in a different gene and two healthy volunteers as controls. The researchers coaxed these skin cells into becoming a special kind of stem cell called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and ultimately turned these patient-specific stem cells into motor neurons. This technique provided them with personalized models of each patient's disease, in a laboratory dish, where it's easy to do experiments. Learn More: New gene variants present in 3 percent of all ALS patientsTo determine the effects of the mutant hnRNP A2/B1 proteins in these samples, the researchers then measured the activity of thousands of genes in each of the ALS and healthy motor neuron samples. In the ALS patient samples, Yeo and team found that the hnRNP A2/B1 mutation these patients had didn't merely disable the protein. Instead, the mutation gave the protein new toxic properties that scrambled RNA processing, and ultimately led to the death of motor neurons. Yeo said these findings may have important implications for their collaborators and others who are developing therapeutics that aim to treat disease by targeting RNA. ""These RNA-targeting therapies can eliminate toxic proteins and treat disease,"" said first author Fernando Martinez, a graduate student in Yeo's laboratory. ""But this strategy is only viable if the proteins have gained new toxic functions through mutation, as we found here for hnRNP A2/B1 in these ALS cases."" Environmental factors are thought to contribute to ALS, increasing the chances a person with a genetic predisposition will get the disease. To mimic this scenario, Martinez compared how motor neurons from ALS patients and healthy individuals respond to stress. In the patient-specific ALS motor neurons under stress, they found more hnRNP A2/B1 proteins clumped in a part of the cells called stress granules, as compared to healthy cells. Don't Miss: ALS: Renewing brain's aging support cells may help neurons survive ""Drugs that lower the exaggerated reaction to stressors that we saw in motor neurons from ALS patients may also prove a powerful therapeutic strategy,"" Yeo said. ""It is likely that multiple, multi-directional shots at goal will be needed to treat this debilitating disease."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Results of their proof-of-concept experiments in monkeys, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, show a tenfold better delivery of the drug to the brain compared with the rest of animals' bodies. See Also: New knowledge about the BBB, the brain's effective bouncer The scientists began with an experimental anti-cancer drug cultivated from bacteria found in Peruvian soil more than 70 years ago. Called 6 diazo-5-oxo L norleucine, or DON, the drug blocks the cellular use of the protein building block glutamine. On its own, DON has shrunk tumors in clinical trials of people with a variety of advanced cancers, but its damage to the gastrointestinal system, a glutton for glutamine, ultimately proved too toxic for humans, say the scientists. ""We wondered whether we could make a safer and more tolerable form of DON by enhancing its brain penetration and limiting its exposure to the rest of the body and, thus, toxicity,"" says Barbara Slusher, PhD, professor of neurology, medicine, psychiatry, neuroscience and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of Johns Hopkins Drug Discovery. Slusher teamed up with Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center immunologist Jonathan Powell, MD, PhD, who has studied how cancer cells use different metabolic pathways to evade destruction by immune cells. ""A tumor uses aggressive metabolism to grow, sucking up all the surrounding nutrients, which leads to a very oxygen-poor, acidic environment that is not conducive to cancer-killing immune cells,"" says Powell, who is an associate director of the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Learn More: Delivery strategies of chemotherapy to the central nervous systemPowell suspects that using glutamine-blocking drugs to target tumor metabolism could make the environment around a tumor less harsh, slow down its growth and give the immune system a chance to attack the cancer cells. ""The hope is to enhance certain immunotherapy drugs by adding such glutamine antagonists,"" says Powell. To alter DON, Slusher and her drug discovery team designed and synthesized various derivatives, focused on making the drug more lipid soluble, or lipophillic, a trait known to aid passage through the blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain, the new derivatives are designed to rapidly metabolize back to DON. They gave DON and an altered derivative, dubbed 5c, intravenously to two monkeys and, thirty minutes later, measured the amount of the drugs in the monkeys' cerebrospinal fluid and circulating plasma, which is the liquid portion of blood that remains after blood cells, platelets and other cellular components are removed. The monkey that received DON had about seven times less concentration of the drug in its blood than the monkey that received 5c. In the monkey that received 5c, which converts to DON in the brain, the scientists found ten times more DON in the cerebrospinal fluid than the monkey treated with unaltered DON. Learn More: A new approach to visualize drug delivery to the central nervous system""We showed that we can modify these drugs to have further specificity to target the brain and limit toxicity to the rest of the body,"" says Slusher.

Now, a study published in Cell Metabolism has found that variations in surrounding oxygen levels can reset circadian clocks of mice. If confirmed in humans, the research could help inform how airlines moderate cabin air pressure. Presently, light, food, and temperature are the best known cues that can influence circadian rhythms. But lead author Gad Asher, a senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and his colleagues, including postdoctoral fellows Yaarit Adamovich and Benjamin Ladeuix, wondered if oxygen might also cue circadian rhythms since oxygen absorption in animals varies alongside meals and changing temperatures. See Also: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions In the paper, the researchers show that changing the concentration of oxygen in cells by just 3 percent, twice a day, will synchronize mouse cells to a circadian rhythm. They suspected HIF1  was the link between oxygen and the circadian clock because HIF1  plays both a role in oxygen homeostasis in cells. They found that cells with low HIF1  levels won't synchronize in response to oxygen variations. ""It was extremely exciting to see that even small changes in oxygen levels were sufficient to efficiently reset the circadian clock,"" says Asher. ""The study actually raises a lot of important questions; although we show that clock reset by oxygen is dependent on HIF1 , we did not yet fully identify how HIF1  integrates within the core clock circuitry."" Don't Miss: Human brain clocks exposed: Effects of circadian clocks and sleep loss vary across brain regions, study finds The researchers further explored oxygen's effect on circadian rhythms with jetlag experiments. Just like humans, mice are prone to jetlag after a sudden shift in daylight hours. Mice were first left to eat, sleep and run on their wheels in air-controlled environments. Altering oxygen levels alone did not change their circadian rhythms but once mice experienced a 6-hour jump ahead in daylight hours, varying oxygen levels could help them adapt their eating, sleeping and running habits to the new time faster. They also saw that a small drop in oxygen levels 12 hours before the 6-hour daylight shift, or 2 hours afterwards, put the mice back on their circadian schedules faster and this too was dependent on HIF1  levels. Presently, commercial airliners pressurize cabins to the same air density of a city 6,000-8,000 feet above sea level. This low-pressure saves wear and tear on the airplane, but enough passengers suffer from airsickness in response to this drop in oxygen levels that some airlines are considering ways to increase the pressure on flights. In fact, Boeing designed its new 787 Dreamliner so that it can be pressurized to the equivalent of lower altitudes for this reason. But in light of these findings, the researchers noted passengers may feel better with higher pressurized cabins during flights, but may also lose a potential advantage of recovering from jetlag. And in light of the effects of lower oxygen levels, the researchers now want to see what higher oxygen levels may do to the circadian clock. ""We are very looking forward to seeing the outcome of these experiments - it will be interesting both from basic science and also from a practical standpoint,"" said Asher. ""I believe passengers might be more enthusiastic to inhale oxygen-enriched air to alleviate jetlag in contrast to low oxygen."" Learn More: Scientists discover protein that controls the strength of body's circadian rhythms Understanding how oxygen influences the circadian clock goes beyond jetlag. Cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), shift work sleep disorder, and other common health problems can result in tissues with low oxygen levels. ""We show that oxygen works in mammals, specifically rodents, but it will be interesting to test whether oxygen can reset the clock of bacteria, plants, flies and additional organisms,"" says Asher.

The researchers behind the finding say it is the biological equivalent of discovering a new continent. Our cells regularly break down proteins from our own bodies and from foreign bodies, such as viruses and bacteria. Small fragments of these proteins, called epitopes, are displayed on the surface of the cells like little flags so that the immune system can scan them. If they are recognised as foreign, the immune system will destroy the cell to prevent the spread of infection. In a new study, researchers have discovered that around one third of all the epitopes displayed for scanning by the immune system are a type known as  spliced  epitopes. These spliced epitopes were thought to be rare, but the scientists have now identified thousands of them by developing a new method that allowed them to map the surface of cells and identify a myriad of previously unknown epitopes. The findings should help scientists to better understand the immune system, including autoimmune diseases, as well as provide potential new targets for immunotherapy and vaccine design. The research was led by Dr Juliane Liepe from Imperial College London and Dr Michele Mishto from Charit  - Universit tsmedizin Berlin in Germany in collaboration with the LaJolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology and Utrecht University, and it is published in Science. Co-author of the study Professor Michael Stumpf from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial said:  It s as if a geographer would tell you they had discovered a new continent, or an astronomer would say they had found a new planet in the solar system.  And just as with those discoveries, we have a lot of exploring to do. This could lead to not only a deeper understanding of how the immune system operates, but also suggests new avenues for therapies and drug and vaccine development.  Prior to the new study, scientists thought that the machinery in a cell created signalling peptides by cutting fragments out of proteins in sequence, and displaying these in order on the surface of the cell. However, this cell machinery can also create  spliced  peptides by cutting two fragments from different positions in the protein and then sticking them together out of order, creating a new sequence. Scientists knew about the existence of the spliced epitopes, but they were thought to be rare. The new study suggests that spliced epitopes actually make up a large proportion of signalling epitopes: they make up around a quarter of the overall number of epitopes, and account for 30-40 per cent of the diversity - the number of different kinds of epitopes. These extra epitopes give the immune system more to scan, and more possibilities of detecting disease. However, as the spliced epitopes are mixed sequences, they also have the potential to overlap with the sequences of healthy signallers and be misidentified as harmful. This could help scientists understand autoimmune diseases, where the immune system turns against normal body tissues, such as in Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The study s lead author, Dr Juliane Liepe from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said:  The discovery of the importance of spliced peptides could present pros and cons when researching the immune system.  For example, the discovery could influence new immunotherapies and vaccines by providing new target epitopes for boosting the immune system, but it also means we need to screen for many more epitopes when designing personalised medicine approaches.

These findings provide key insights into how natural and synthetic cannabinoids including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) a primary chemical in marijuana bind at the CB1 receptor to produce their effects. The research was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health. There is considerable interest in the possible therapeutic uses of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoid compounds. Molecules that target CB1 receptors may have promise in treating a variety of conditions such as pain, inflammation, obesity, nerve cell diseases, and substance use disorders. However, some synthetic cannabinoids such as K2 or Spice can produce severe and even deadly reactions, whereas other cannabinoids produce less serious side effects.  Cannabinoids can produce very different outcomes, depending on how they bind to the CB1 receptor,  said NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, M.D.  Understanding how these chemicals bind to the CB1 receptor will help guide the design of new medications and provide insight into the therapeutic promise of the body s cannabinoid system.  Researchers used a specific chemical, AM6538, to inactivate and crystallize the CB1 receptor. They then computed the three-dimensional structure of the CB1-AM6538 complex through crystallography, which determines molecular shape by measuring the angles and intensities of x-rays that are bounced off a crystal structure. Based upon prior evidence showing how specific cannabinoids attach to different chemical configurations, researchers were able to predict how these cannabinoids would fit into the three-dimensional CB1 model. The model was also used to calculate how long each cannabinoid bound to the CB1 receptor, thereby providing clues into mechanisms whereby some chemicals produce longer-lasting effects.  We found that the CB1 receptor consists of multiple sub-pockets and channels,  said Alexandros Makriyannis, Ph.D., director of the Center for Drug Discovery, Northeastern University in Boston, and a co-author on the paper.  This complex structure will allow chemists to design diverse compounds that specifically target portions of the receptor to produce desired effects.  This study was funded in part by NIDA under grants DA009158 and DA023142.","Published: October 21, 2016"

But for male mice carrying a genetic mutation known to affect human speech, it is difficult to get this syntax of sounds right, according to a new study. Humans with the same mutation have problems with correctly sequencing phonemes into words. See Also: Patients improve speech by watching 3-D tongue images ""Mouse songs are not an exact parallel to human speech, but we found something very robust,"" said Erich Jarvis, a professor of neurobiology at Duke University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who co-led the study appearing in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience. Jarvis collaborated with Duke postdoctoral researcher Jonathan Chabout and Simon Fisher, director of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. ""This work provides an innovative way to study how genes affect sequencing of vocal sounds,"" said Fisher, who is also a professor of language and genetics at Nijmegen's Donders Institute. ""It's important because quite a few children have mysterious problems with learning to produce proficient speech, and we have found that genetic factors play a big role. The big challenge, then, is to understand exactly why damage to a particular gene can lead to those kinds of difficulties, and that is hard to do if we can only investigate humans."" The Duke researchers recorded ultrasonic sounds (above the range of human hearing) made by 50 adult male mice under a variety of conditions. They deciphered the structure of these mouse songs using new statistical tools to identify the ways four basic 'syllables' were strung together into more complicated sequences. They analyzed how these sequences (the syntax of the songs) changed in different social situations, such as when the male was in the presence of a female instead of another male. Their goal was to see whether mutation of the gene Foxp2 (forkhead-box P2) can affect the sequencing of the mouse songs, as it is known to do in human speech. Learn More: Finding thoughts in speech: How the human brain processes thoughts during natural communication Foxp2 has been the subject of intensive research in the 15 years since it was identified by Fisher and others as a key to mastering the rapid coordinated sequences of mouth, face and larynx (voice-box) movements that enable fluent human speech. ""We first found a mutation in this gene causing speech deficits in many relatives of a large British family,"" Fisher said. ""They made errors when speaking and these became worse as the things they were trying to say got longer and more complicated."" Scientists using mice to understand how Foxp2 can affect vocal behaviors have mainly focused on the acoustic structure of individual syllables in juvenile mice, which have more basic vocalizations. The new study by Jarvis and his team instead looked carefully into the sequence of syllables in the songs of mature adults. Super high-pitched mouse singing was identified decades ago, but only recently has it been possible to assign patterns to the chirping noises. In a 2012 paper appearing in PLoS One, the Duke team first proposed that mice have a limited version of the vocal learning brain structures and some of the vocal adaptability found in song-learning birds and humans. Follow-up work appearing last year in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience showed that male mice change their tune in response to different social situations especially the presence of active females. In this most recent study, the Duke team found that the songs of the mice become significantly more complicated in the presence of an active female than they do for a sleeping female, female urine or a sleeping male. ""Social context matters,"" Jarvis said. ""You have to be careful about the social context in which you record the mouse's behavior."" Don't Miss: Months before their first words, babies  brains rehearse speech mechanics Half of the male mice in the current study were genetically engineered to carry a mutation identical to the one that Fisher and colleagues had discovered causing speech problems in humans. Those mice did not switch to the more complex syntax in the presence of the live female, almost as if they were ""tongue-tied,"" Jarvis said. These findings are consistent with other newly emerging studies of mice with different mutations of the gene. ""So, while the mice aren't an exact model, and unlike humans they don't seem to learn their vocalizations, we did find that this mutation is having a similar impact on the sequence of ultrasonic songs,"" Jarvis said. But the researchers didn't have a way to statistically quantify changes in syntax, even for human speech. Jarvis and Chabout worked with Duke statisticians David Dunston and Abhra Sarkar to develop new tools to analyze the mouse syntax. ""If we're looking for the effect of a gene, we need real statistical power,"" Jarvis said. ""It's not enough to just eyeball it."" The team also traced the location of neurons that connect the muscles of the voice box with the higher parts of the brain involved in controlling movements. In mice with the Foxp2 mutation, the neurons were spread out in a wider pattern in this part of the brain. Because Foxp2 is a transcription factor a gene that tells other genes what to do this altered pattern of neurons suggests it may play a role in how neurons are routed across the brain, Jarvis said. But he emphasized that more research is needed on that question. Read Next: The digital therapist: Acoustic changes in speech of people with depression could be used to help monitor mental health The finding expands the usefulness of mice for studying human speech and the brain, Jarvis said. Though he and others have made tremendous progress by studying the brains of songbirds that can learn songs the way we learn words, ""having a mammalian model with even some rudimentary genetics and connectivity for vocal communication could still get you closer to the simpler aspects of speech,"" Jarvis said.

This makes it a common target for antidepressants, which block serotonin from being reabsorbed by neurons after it has dispatched its signal, so more of it stays floating around the brain. Now Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have developed an imaging technique that, for the first time, enables three-dimensional mapping of serotonin as it's reabsorbed into neurons, across multiple regions of the living brain. This technique, the researchers say, gives an unprecedented view of serotonin dynamics, and could be a powerful tool for the research and development of antidepressants. See Also: First serotonin neurons made from human stem cells""Until now, it was not possible to look at how neurotransmitters are transported into cells across large regions of the brain,"" says Aviad Hai, a postdoc in the Department of Biological Engineering and first author of a paper describing the technique in the journal Neuron. ""It's the first time you can see the inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, like antidepressants, working in different parts of the brain, and you can use this information to analyze all sorts of antidepressant drugs, discover new ones, and see how those drugs affect the serotonin system across the brain."" The paper's other authors are Alan Jasanoff, a professor of biological engineering; and three other researchers in Jasanoff's lab: Lili X. Cai, Taekwan Lee, and Victor S. Lelyveld. Many antidepressants that target serotonin work by blocking serotonin transporters that reabsorb the neurotransmitter into a neuron, so it can be reused after it has sent a chemical signal. Aptly called ""selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"" (SSRIs), these drugs increase levels of serotonin in the brain, alleviating feelings of anxiety and depression caused by low levels of the neurotransmitter. Researchers most commonly study the effect of antidepressants using a technique known as microdialysis, in which they insert a probe into the brain to take tiny chemical samples from the tissue. But this method is time-consuming and limited in scope, as it allows them to study only a single location at a time. Related: A surprising source of serotonin could affect antidepressant activity For the new imaging technique, the researchers engineered a protein to act as a sensor that latches onto serotonin and detaches at the moment of reuptake. The sensor is injected, along with serotonin, and emits a signal that can be read by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The trick is that the sensor remains off emitting a low signal when bound to serotonin, and turns on creating a much brighter signal when serotonin is removed. Molecular fMRI data showing signal changes from serotonin sensors in the absence (left) and presence (right) of the antidepressant Prozac, with each square denoting an individual brain voxel. Red squares indicate the signal has increased, as more serotonin is absorbed into neurons; blue squares indicate the signal has decreased, as less serotonin is absorbed into neurons. Dotted and solid lines graphed in each square show how the signal changes over time. The swirling black lines indicate features of the brain. A computer model uses this data to estimate neurotransmitter reuptake across the brain. Image courtesy of the researchers / MIT News  In the new system, a mathematical model uses the fMRI signal data to construct a 3-D map that consists of more than 1,000 voxels (pixels in three dimensions), with each voxel representing a single point of measurement of serotonin reuptake. Based on the signal strength at each point, the model calculates the amount of serotonin that gets absorbed, in the presence and absence of SSRIs. ""Basically, what we've seen in this work is a method for measuring how much of a neurotransmitter is being [absorbed], and how that amount, or rate, is affected by different drugs ... in a highly parallel fashion across much of the brain,"" Jasanoff says. That information could be very valuable for testing drug efficacy, he says. To validate the sensor, the researchers successfully measured the expected effect of the SSRI fluoxetine, commonly called Prozac, on serotonin transporters in six subregions of a brain area known as the basal ganglia. These subregions are thought to play a role in motivation, reward, cognition, learning, emotion, and other functions and behaviors. Don't Miss: The gates of serotonin: Cracking the workings of a notorious receptorIn doing so, the researchers simultaneously recorded a stronger decrease of serotonin reuptake in response to Prozac among three of the subregions, while noting a very weak response in one other region. These results were, more or less, anticipated, Jasanoff says. ""But now we're able to map that effect in three dimensions, across brain regions,"" he says, which could lead to advances in studying the effects of drugs on specific parts of the brain. But the researchers did uncover a surprising finding. While mapping the effects of a dopamine transport reuptake inhibitor -- made to target only dopamine -- they found the drug reduced serotonin reuptake, to an extent comparable to that of SSRIs, in three subregions, one of which is known for high dopamine transporter expression. Previous studies had indicated that dopamine transporter proteins can aid in low levels of serotonin reuptake, but the new findings show the effect is widespread in the living brain, Jasanoff says. This experiment provides further proof of a strong interplay between the serotonin and dopamine systems, and indicates that antidepressants may be less effective when targeting just one of the two neurotransmitters, Hai says. ""It may not be sufficient to just block serotonin reuptake, because there's another system dopamine that plays a role in serotonin transport as well,"" he says. ""It's almost proof that when you use antidepressants that ... target both systems, it could be more effective."" Read Next: Serotonin deficiency implicated in rheumatoid arthritisNext steps for the researchers are to explore different regions of the brain with this sensor, including the dorsal raphe, which produces most of the brain's serotonin.

The findings, in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), may lead to a better understanding of the genetic roots of autism in the wider population. See Also: New insights into the male bias of autism The findings are published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. Studying 531 patients at six clinical centers in the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Australia, the researchers found that mutations in the NF1 gene that cause the disease also contributed to autistic behaviors in almost half of the patients. ""NF1 is caused by mutations in a single gene NF1,"" said first author Stephanie M. Morris, MD, an instructor in neurology. ""Our research indicates that this single gene also is associated with autism spectrum disorders in these same patients. That may make it possible to look downstream from the gene to find common pathways that contribute to autism in the wider population."" NF1, the disorder caused by NF1 mutations, usually appears during childhood. Symptoms can vary in severity, but they include caf  au lait spots, which are flat, brown spots on the skin. Other symptoms include tiny nodules on the iris of the eye, nerve tumors, bone deformities such as a curved spine or a bowed lower leg, and optic gliomas, tumors of the optic nerve. Kids with NF1 also can have learning disabilities. ""In the 25-plus years that I've taken care of kids with NF1, we've only recently started to recognize that these children also often have symptoms of autism,"" said senior investigator David H. Gutmann, MD, PhD, the Donald O. Schnuck Family Professor of Neurology and director of the Washington University NF Center. ""In the past, we didn't really understand the association between NF1 and autism, but now we have new insights into the problem, which will allow us to design better treatments for children with NF1 and autism."" Related: Largest-ever autism genome study finds most siblings have different autism-risk genes The findings also could help scientists who study the genetics of autism understand how mutations in a single gene can contribute to symptoms of autism, such as problems with social and language skills and repetitive behaviors. About 100,000 people in the United States have NF1. It is equally common in both sexes and in all ethnic groups. Autism, meanwhile, affects 1 percent to 2 percent of all children in the United States and is four to five times more common in boys than in girls. ""What's unique about our findings is that it's likely mutations in the NF1 gene are driving most of the symptoms of autism in children with NF1,"" said the study's other senior investigator, John N. Constantino, the Blanche F. Ittleson Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics and director of the William Greenleaf Eliot Division of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. ""Here, we have a single-gene disorder that affects a fairly large number of people and is causing autism in a significant number of those who are affected. This work could provide us with an opportunity to study a single gene and figure out what it is doing to cause autistic syndromes."" Constantino said most autism spectrum disorders are influenced by multiple genes but that isolating this one gene can aid efforts to learn how other, unrelated genes may interact along that same pathway to contribute to autism in people who don't have NF1. Learning how those various genes come together to cause symptoms eventually could lead to better treatments.

Using a recently developed technology for analyzing DNA, the scientists found dozens of genes and two major biological pathways that are likely involved in the development of the disorder but had not been uncovered in previous genetic studies of schizophrenia. The work provides important new information about how schizophrenia originates and points the way to more detailed studies and possibly better treatments in the future. See Also: Uncovering clues to the genetic cause of schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling mental illness whose symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions and cognitive problems. The illness afflicts about 1 percent of the human population more than 50 million people worldwide. Because the causes of schizophrenia are poorly understood, current medications can help diminish the symptoms but do not cure the disorder. The study, which is published in the journal Nature, is likely to have an impact beyond schizophrenia research because it demonstrates a general and potentially powerful new strategy for illuminating the mechanisms of human disease. ""This work provides a road map for understanding how common genetic variation associated with a complex disease affects specific genes and pathways,"" said principal investigator Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Chair in Human Genetics and professor of neurology and psychiatry at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Schizophrenia has long been known to be highly genetic; it often runs in families. A large genome-wide association study of people with schizophrenia, published in 2014, linked the disorder to small DNA variations at more than 100 distinct locations on the human genome. However, most of those locations lie outside of actual genes, so their roles in schizophrenia have been unclear. Genome-wide study analyses of other major diseases have come up with similarly puzzling results. Learn More: EEG test to help understand and treat schizophreniaIn some cases, the non-gene locations identified in these studies have turned out to be what are known as ""regulatory regions,"" which serve to enhance or repress the activity of genes lying near them on the genome. But many of these disease-linked locations have no obvious gene target nearby on the genome. One possibility is that these mysterious disease-linked locations are also regulatory regions that target genes lying relatively far away on the genome. They could do this if they are brought physically close to those ""distant"" genes by the complex twisting and looping that DNA undergoes when packaged into a chromosome, just as two opposite ends of a rope can end up close together when the rope is coiled. To investigate that possibility, Geschwind and his team used a relatively new, high-resolution version of a technology called ""chromosome conformation capture,"" which chemically marks and then maps the locations where loops of chromosomal DNA come into contact. Read Next: Schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk deconstructedBecause each cell type in the body can have subtly different 3-D chromosome structures, the researchers applied the technique to immature human brain cells from the cortex -- the large region across the top of the brain that handles higher cognitive tasks. Schizophrenia is believed to be a disorder of abnormal cortical development. The mapping revealed that most of the more than 100 schizophrenia-linked sites from the 2014 study contact known genes during brain development. Many of these are genes that already have been linked to schizophrenia in previous studies. Others had been suspected of involvement, for example because their level of activity in schizophrenics is known to be abnormal in the cortex. The genes newly linked to schizophrenia in the study include several for brain cell receptors that are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, implying that variations in the functions of these receptors can help bring about schizophrenia. ""There's a lot of clinical and pharmacologic data suggesting that changes in acetylcholine signaling in the brain can worsen schizophrenia symptoms, but until now there's been no genetic evidence that it can help cause the disorder,"" Geschwind said. The analysis also pointed for the first time to several genes that are involved in the early-life burst of brain cell production that gives rise to the cerebral cortex of humans. In all, the researchers identified several hundred genes that may be abnormally regulated in schizophrenia but had not been linked to the disorder before. In further experiments and analyses of two dozen of those genes, they found additional evidence of abnormal regulation in schizophrenia. As further studies clarify the roles of these genes in schizophrenia, scientists will get a more complete picture of how the disorder develops and persists, and should then be able to develop more effective treatments. ""In the near term we're using the findings from this study to help us understand schizophrenia better, but we're also planning to apply this same strategy to identify key genes in the development of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders,"" Geschwind said. Don't Miss: Powerful genetic regulator identified as risk factor for schizophreniaIn principle, the 3-D chromosome mapping technology can be used to make sense of gene association data for any disease involving genetic risk.

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results. When we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation. Even when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins   known as  inflammatory markers    which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness. Inflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn s disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety. The team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient s depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. Dr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says:  It s becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.   It s too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,  adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study.  We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn s disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.  Dr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation   and hence potentially contribute to depression   their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.  About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,  adds Dr Khandaker.  So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.  The current approach of a  one-size-fits-all  medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of  personalised medicine  where we can tailor treatments to individual patients.

In their report published in the online journal Nature Communications, the investigators describe how suppressing the activity of a specific enzyme not only increased bone formation in mice but also reduced levels of the cells responsible for bone breakdown. While one currently available treatment   injections of a fragment of parathyroid hormone (PTH)   can stimulate bone formation, it also stimulates the resorption of bone.   We wanted to understand how PTH signaling affects gene expression within bone cells, particularly in osteocytes, which are buried deep within bone itself,  says lead author Marc Wein, MD, PhD, of the Endocrine Unit in the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Department of Medicine.  By identifying an essential step in that signaling cascade   turning off an enzyme called SIK2   our findings shed light on a new mechanism of PTH signaling in bone and identify a potential new treatment for osteoporosis,  Most currently available osteoporosis drugs work by slowing down the destruction of bone, but their effectiveness is limited and long-term use can occasionally have side effects. The PTH-based drug teriparatide increases bone density; but in addition to its also accelerating bone resorption, the fact that teriparatide must be administered by daily injection discourages many patients from using it to treat a symptom-free condition. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of PTH on osteocytes, the research team focused on a gene called SOST, which inhibits bone formation and is known to be suppressed by PTH.  The team s experiments first showed that PTH suppressed SOST expression by means of transcription-regulating enzymes called HDACs   specifically HDAC4 and HDAC5   activation of which previous research had indicated was regulated by enzymes called SIKs. In collaboration with SIK expert Olga Goransson, PhD, of Lund University in Sweden, the researchers confirmed that PTH signaling turns off the activity of the SIK2 enzyme.  A series of experiments with small-molecule SIK inhibitors   created by study co-authors Nathanael Gray, PhD, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Ramnik Xavier, MD, PhD, chief of the MGH Gastrointestinal Unit   revealed that they regulated not only the expression of SOST but also of other PTH target genes such as RANKL, a molecule that stimulates bone resorption. The research team then showed that an SIK2-specific inhibitor called YKL-05-093 mimicked the effects of PTH on gene expression both in cells and in mice.  Since repeat dosing with YKL-05-093 had adverse effects on mice, the researchers tested a closely related compound YKL-05-099 and found that daily doses safely stimulated bone formation in male mice. The team was surprised to find that YKL-05-099 also reduced levels of osteoclasts   cells responsible for the breakdown of bone   indicating that it had the desired dual effect of stimulating bone formation and suppressing bone resorption.   We don t completely understand why YKL-05-099 reduces osteoclasts, but we think the combination could be very useful therapeutically,  says Wein, who is an instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS).  In addition to concentrating on understanding how this compound inhibits osteoclasts   which may lead us to develop even more specific SIK2 inhibitors   we also need to see if it increases bone mass in an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, such as older female mice that have had their ovaries removed.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/enlisting-insects-to-protect-agriculture-193472,Enlisting Insects to Protect Agriculture New program aims for insect delivery of protective genes to modify mature plants within a single growing season  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It may not be obvious to humans, but the life of a plant is full of peril. Viruses, pests, fungi, herbicides, drought, pollution, salinity, flooding, and frost   plants that we depend on for food, clean air, and materials are challenged by a myriad of threats both natural and man-made. By extension, human populations are put at risk when food security is challenged and the agricultural underpinnings of our economies are destabilized, especially when threats emerge rapidly or unexpectedly.  Farmers and others responsible for plant health use longstanding tools such as crop rotation, selective breeding, pesticides, slash-and-burn clearing, and quarantine to shelter plants and defend against the worst effects of pathogens, pests, and environmental insults, but these methods can be slow, inefficient, and damaging to the environment, and may require extensive and expensive infrastructure. And while scientists and farmers are increasingly turning to molecular techniques to improve resilience in plant varieties, today s genomic tools generally do not allow for alteration of mature plants. A new DARPA program is poised to provide an alternative to traditional agricultural threat response, using targeted gene therapy to protect mature plants within a single growing season. DARPA proposes to leverage a natural and very efficient two-step delivery system to transfer modified genes to plants: insect vectors and the plant viruses they transmit. In the process, DARPA aims to transform certain insect pests into  Insect Allies,  the name of the new effort.   Insects eat plants and insects transmit the majority of plant viruses,  said Blake Bextine, the DARPA program manager for Insect Allies.  DARPA plans to harness the power of this natural system by engineering genes inside plant viruses that can be transmitted by insects to confer protective traits to the target plants they feed upon.  Insect Allies  three technical areas   trait design, insect vector optimization, and selective gene therapy in mature plants   layer together to support the goal of rapidly transforming mature plants to protect against natural or intentional agricultural disruption without the need for extensive infrastructure. The foundational knowledge and generalizable tools developed under the program could also support future agricultural innovation.  One of the most effective existing methods for protecting plants, the selective breeding of disease resistance, typically involves five to seven years of work to identify the relevant protective genes and another 10 years or more to propagate the desired traits throughout plant populations. Insect Allies aims to effect the expression of desired traits within a single season. Performers will be challenged to develop compatible systems of naturally occurring plant viruses, herbivorous insects, and target crops, and then genetically tune these systems to maximize transmission and uptake of traits across the entire target plant population with zero transmission to non-target plants.   Genetic modification of plants has historically been done only to plant embryos inside of laboratories using tissue cultures,  Bextine said.  Transforming mature plants en masse would be an enormous achievement and pave the way for future breakthroughs in agriculture. ","Published: October 20, 2016"

The findings move the scientific world one step closer to genetically engineering a toxin that would be lethal to species that carry dengue fever and the Zika virus. Nearly half of the world s population is at risk of contracting malaria, a life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Chemical insecticides are often a first line of defense against mosquitoes, but their application can result in both environmental pollution and resistance to the pesticide. Countries around the globe have recently begun killing mosquito larvae using a natural toxin derived from bacteria. Now, UCLA scientists and their collaborators have used X-rays to determine the atomic structure of this larvicide, which is lethal to mosquitoes transmitting malaria and West Nile virus. These results reveal how the toxin functions, knowledge that will inform future efforts to genetically engineer it to also kill mosquitoes carrying Zika virus and dengue fever. The research was published in the journal Nature.  This is a chance to have a positive effect on a lot of the world s population,  said senior author David Eisenberg, UCLA s Paul D. Boyer Professor of Molecular Biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Eisenberg and his colleagues studied the larvicide known as BinAB, which is produced by soil-dwelling bacteria. The bacteria pack BinAB into tiny crystals, thousands of which could be stacked across the head of a pin. When these crystals are scattered into the watery environments that mosquitos thrive in, hungry mosquito larvae eat them. But the meal turns out to be a deadly one. As the crystals pass through the larvae s digestive tract, the gut juices of the larvae trigger the crystals to dissolve. The BinAB toxin is released, and its component molecules   called BinA and BinB   play distinct roles in entering the cells of the larvae s guts and killing the young mosquitoes within 48 hours. BinAB is toxic to the Culex and Anopheles species of mosquitoes   carriers of West Nile virus and malaria, respectively   but currently is harmless to the Aedes species, the carriers of Zika virus and dengue fever.  The toxin is this complex shape, and it has to fit with another shape on the intestine of the larvae,  said Michael Sawaya, a staff scientist at UCLA involved in the study.  If the shapes don t match up precisely, the toxin cannot get in the cell. It s like a lock and key.  Researchers are interested in genetically engineering BinAB to also kill the larvae of Aedes mosquitoes, work that requires a detailed understanding of BinAB s atomic structure. However, the small size of the crystals containing BinAB has made it difficult for scientists to hold them securely in laboratory instruments for analysis. The UCLA researchers and their colleagues, including Dr. Jacques-Phillippe Colletier, a former UCLA researcher now working at the Institute of Structural Biology in Grenoble, France, overcame this size limitation by harvesting crystals from a particular strain of soil-dwelling bacteria engineered to produce larger crystals. The scientists then studied the precise shape of the BinAB toxin within the crystals using an X-ray laser. Eisenberg and his colleagues bombarded the crystals with an X-ray laser invented by Claudio Pellegrini, UCLA professor emeritus of physics.  When we shine X-rays on the crystals, the X-rays are scattered into thousands of X-ray beams,  said Eisenberg, who is also a professor of chemistry, biochemistry and biological chemistry and a member of UCLA s California NanoSystems Institute.  These beams contain information about the arrangement of the atoms that make up BinA and BinB.  This type of X-ray laser has never before been used to study a sample with an unknown structure.  We can do entirely new types of experiments using these X-ray lasers,  said co-author Jose Rodriguez, a UCLA assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry.  It would be hard to find a problem that could potentially affect the health of more people,  Eisenberg said. ","Published: October 20, 2016"

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-mechanism-of-plant-rna-degradation-identified-202747,New Mechanism of Plant RNA Degradation Identified Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which RNA is degraded  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The totality of RNA molecules in an organism at any one time is the product of a delicate dance. Genes must be  turned on,  or expressed, in order to turn DNA into RNA and then that RNA into proteins that accomplish an organism s physiological needs. But, just as important, those RNA transcripts must be cleared away once they are no longer required.  University of Pennsylvania researchers have new insights into the latter process, identifying a novel mechanism by which RNA molecules are degraded. The study, led by Brian D. Gregory, an associate professor in Penn s Department of Biology in the School of Arts & Sciences, and postdoctoral fellow Xiang Yu in the same department, provides the first evidence that RNA degradation can occur in the same space and at the same time that RNA translation is occurring in plants. Building on work that identified a similar process in yeast, the Penn research suggests that this may be an evolutionarily conserved process.  RNA degradation is, in my opinion, an overlooked aspect of gene regulation,  Gregory said.  The point being that it s just as important as gene expression, which we all think about. Our contribution here is to show that degradation doesn t have to happen separately from translation. We see that some percentage of RNA is being degraded as the ribosome moves down the length of the transcript. It s happening co-translationally.  The work appears in the journal Plant Cell. Gregory and Yu collaborated on the paper with fellow lab members Matthew R. Willmann, the co-first author, and Stephen J. Anderson. Prior to this study, scientists were aware of two ways that messenger RNA can be degraded, one starting at the beginning, or 5-prime end of an RNA transcript, and another starting at the end, or the 3-prime side. In both cases the degradation mostly occurs in the cytoplasm. Recent studies in yeast identified a pathway of RNA degradation that broke from this mold, occurring while the RNA transcript was still attached to a ribosome, the molecular machinery responsible for translating RNA into proteins. Gregory s lab focuses on RNA regulation in plants, and the Penn scientists wanted to explore whether the process the yeast researchers had observed was also found in plants. To do so, the team used a technique developed by Gregory as a postdoc, known as genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts, or GMUCT, which identifies only those RNA molecules that are either cleaved or in the process of degrading. Examining flower bud RNA from Arabidopsis, they performed GMUCT, sorting out the suspected co-translationally degrading transcripts from transcripts that were likely cleaved by another process governed by microRNAs by looking for the same signal the yeast researchers had seen: a cleavage event occurring 16 to 17 nucleotides upstream of messenger RNA stop codons, where translation ceases. This location lines up with the 5-prime edge of where a ribosome would be overlaying the transcript during translation termination.  We see that the degrading RNA is associated with the ribosome in plants, just as it had in yeast,  Yu said.  Many molecular events are coupled together. For example, gene transcription is coupled with splicing. So this is another example of a coupling, where two molecular events are linked in space and time.  To further explore this coupling event, the researchers interrogated the results of the GMUCT, looking for examples of where the ribosome paused during the degradation/translation process. They noted that the ribosome paused in particular at stop codons, and, to their surprise, they found a distinction between the three different sequences that code for stop codons.  Until now, everyone has thought that it doesn t matter which stop codon you use, that they all do the same thing,  Gregory said.  From our data, it looks like the kinetics of the interaction between ribosome and transcript are distinct for each type of stop codon, or that there may be a distinct complex of proteins associated with each.  The finding, the researchers said, could suggest that translation efficiency might be regulated by which of the three stop codons is present. Their results also detected signs of a regulatory region in the untranslated region of RNA transcripts, regions known as upstream open reading frames, or uORFs. They detected these active areas by noting a peak of cleavage points at specific places in the 5-prime untranslated regions of transcripts and a pausing at the stop codons present in the uORFs.  A lot of these active upstream open reading frames regulate the downstream open reading frames in a very tissue-specific and developmentally-specific manner, so we can use our approach to find out which ones are active in whatever tissue you re profiling,  Gregory said. The researchers performed experiments with mutant plants to gain a sense of the molecular players involved in co-translational RNA decay. Their work found roles for XRN4, an enzyme known to catalyze RNA degradation, and ABH1, part of the nuclear mRNA cap-binding complex, which is involved in many biological processes including messenger RNA stability and splicing and the initial round of protein translation. Their findings suggest that this process may be particularly important in regulating genes involved in response to stress, such as temperature.  This process looks like a very potent way to get rid of the transcripts that you need to get rid of in order to have a proper stress response,  Gregory said.  It seems reasonable that co-translational decay would be a more efficient, faster process than some of the classical, known degradation pathways,  Yu said. Because the researchers observed that transcripts regulated by microRNA-mediated translation inhibition were more likely to undergo co-translational decay, they are envisioning a model by which these may be responsible for directing their target transcripts into this process of co-translational decay, perhaps even physically shuttling them through this process. To follow up on their findings, Gregory s group would like to examine whether the processes they observed, co-translational degradation and the distinct interactions they observed based on different stop codons, are tissue-specific processes, that is, whether they appear in other plant tissues beyond flower buds. And they would also like to probe whether the process extends beyond yeast and Arabidopsis plants, perhaps even to humans.","Published: October 20, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/achieving-green-desalination-184980,Achieving  Green  Desalination Workshop explores ways to reduce or eliminate the carbon footprint of seawater desalination plants   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In one of the most remarkable turnarounds ever achieved in the face of a natural resource crisis, Israel has overcome a looming fresh water shortage in less than a decade. The country now has such a large water surplus that it can sell significant amounts to its parched neighboring countries. The reversal was made possible by the construction of the world s largest desalination plants, which convert seawater from the Mediterranean into potable water for both domestic use and agriculture. But while that new glut of water can provide a valuable example for nations and regions around the world that are facing water shortages, it also has an environmental price: Desalination plants are intensive users of energy, the production of which typically requires burning fossil fuels in large power plants. To address that issue and work toward a roadmap for future research and demonstrations, some of the world s leading specialists in the technology, economics, and regulatory issues surrounding desalination gathered at MIT this week. They discussed how to get the salt out of seawater or brackish aquifers at all scales, from small, local installations to the kinds of megaprojects that transformed Israel s situation, while minimizing or eliminating the associated greenhouse gas emissions. The two-day workshop, organized by MIT s Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security Lab (J-WAFS) and its director, John H. Lienhard V, brought together experts from 11 nations to discuss the issues and frame a report to be delivered next month at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or, COP22, in Marrakesh, Morocco. The aim is to map out the areas where research and development, and demonstration projects are most needed and could yield the greatest benefits.  What you are doing is so crucially important,  said Maria Zuber, MIT s vice president for research, to the participants at the conclusion of the workshop. She pointed out that while the world population is  going up, up, up, the amount of fresh water is basically a fixed asset.  And yet, there is  an incredible resource in the ocean, all the water you could want, yet it s not suitable for human needs.  That s why it is so essential, she said, to find a way to provide  access to clean water that doesn t impact the environment in a negative way with its carbon footprint.   We need breakthoughs on this,  Zuber said,  and thanks to the efforts of all of you, I think we re going to have it.  Many potential solutions to that problem   as well as the challenges that need further research   were discussed at length by the participants. Coupling desalination facilities with carbon-free or low-carbon power sources such as solar, wind, or nuclear power plants could make it possible to gain the benefits of clean water without the climate impact. But some of these renewable energy sources do not deliver power continuously and some types of desalination technology encounter difficulties when their operation is not constant. For example, variations in the operation of the plants can lead to increased fouling of the membranes that separate the salt from the water. Wind and solar installations produce variable power, so to avoid the ramping up and down of the desalination plants, these power sources might need to be coupled with storage systems, raising the cost. And nuclear plants tend to be larger than needed for desalination, so such facilities might have to be coupled with power production for other uses. Boris Liberman, vice president and chief technology officer of IDE Technologies, the Israel-based company responsible for the design and construction of that county s giant new seawater desalination plants, including the largest such plant in the world, said that those plants have now demonstrated that with proper design and operation it is possible to operate efficiently even with power supplies that ebb and flow. The key, he said, is to maintain constant pressure inside the system while allowing the flow rate and freshwater output to rise and fall. The company s largest plant, called Sorek, which produces 150 million cubic meters of water per year,  has worked for two years with no fouling,"" he said. Jacopo Buongiorno, MIT s TEPCO Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering, described a concept for making floating offshore desalination plants, which could be coupled to floating offshore nuclear plants that he and his students have been designing. The paired facilities would take advantage of the inherent advantages of building many identical units that could be assembled in shipyards and towed to their eventual point of use. This approach allows for controlled construction in facilities that could develop expertise in building those plants rather than relying on local construction crews and materials at each end-use location. Creating desalination plants on a floating platform, he said, would also eliminate many of the problems associated with the long and complex intake tubes that bring seawater to the plant and discharge brine back into the sea. These intake and outflow systems, in many locations, can now cost as much as the desalination plants themselves.  Offshore nuclear with water desalination offers a new and flexible deployment and operation paradigm for zero-carbon cogeneration of power and fresh water,  Buongiorno said. But there are many other potential pairings of power sources with desalination facilities, many workshop participants said. For example, geothermal energy could potentially provide both electricity and heat   the two big requirements for desalination   and could be suitable for many different kinds of locations, since geothermal heat is available anywhere if drills can reach deep enough. Other possibilities include the use of wave or tidal power, or of advanced solar technologies such as thermal plants that store the sun s heat in vats of molten salt. These plants can then be used to deliver that heat when it s needed, even during the night, providing a way to get constant output from solar power. Lienhard and others pointed out that desalination could, in fact, be thought of as a kind of storage technology in itself. That is, in situations where there is a mismatch between the times when renewable power sources are available and when the power is actually needed, the excess power could be used to make and store fresh water, which could then be delivered whenever needed without having to draw power for desalination during periods of peak loads on the grid.  Water is cheap to store,  he says, compared to electricity, which requires expensive battery or pumped-hydro storage systems. A final report from the workshop, based on the input from all of the participants, will be produced in the next few weeks, aiming to outline  what are the priorities for research funding, what are the barriers, and how to prioritize the work,  Lienhard said.","Published: October 20, 2016"

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes scar tissue inside the lungs, and patients may experience coughing and progressive shortness of breath. There is no cure for IPF. In a new study, the research team led by Yale Professor of Medicine Naftali Kaminski and by Marie Curie Fellow Dr. Argyrios Tzouvelekis explored the role of SHP2, an enzyme that removes phosphates from proteins and thus renders them inactive. The researchers found that the enzyme was low in lungs of humans with the disease. In both cell culture and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, the researchers found that suppression of the enzyme triggered pro-fibrotic changes in the lung, while increased enzyme activity prevented fibrosis. The findings suggest that SHP2 is an essential regulator and that potentially enhancing the activity or expression of it could provide a new therapeutic strategy for this deadly disease.","Published: October 20, 2016"

To tackle this global health problem, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with partial support through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is funding a $30.5 million, multi-country trial to determine if using a widely available, clean, alternative cooking fuel significantly reduces deaths and illnesses, especially in women and children who suffer the greatest exposure. This is the first large-scale trial to investigate whether home use of cookstoves that run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) improve air quality sufficiently to provide measurable health benefits and can be effectively adopted in real world situations. The five-year study is part of a broader international effort totaling more than $50 million to conduct research in 30 countries aimed at discovering how to prevent and manage chronic lung diseases. That initiative is being coordinated by the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD), a coalition of the world s largest public funders of health research.  Indoor air pollution caused by cookstoves is one of the top health risks in developing countries, causing deaths from low birth weight among babies, pneumonia in young children, and heart and lung problems in adults,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  By working with our global partners on alternative fuel solutions, we have an opportunity to reduce that risk significantly for millions of people.  Three billion people worldwide rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, according to the WHO. The resulting indoor pollution, which includes small particles that can lodge deep in the lungs, causes pneumonia, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular and heart disease, cancer and other conditions. Most solid fuel use occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but also takes place in high-income countries, largely in rural areas. The NIH award will enable researchers to conduct a randomized control trial of LPG cookstoves and fuel in four LMICs: India, Rwanda, Guatemala and Peru. U.S. investigators and their collaborators in the trial sites will follow pregnant women, their offspring and older women to provide evidence of the impact the alternative fuel has on household air pollution, child health and development, and adult chronic diseases. Emory University in Atlanta is leading the study. Investigators plan to recruit 800 pregnant women at each site and will randomly assign half to receive LPG stoves and a supply of gas. Mothers and infants will be followed until the children are 2 years old. Mothers will be evaluated to see if they suffer hypertension during pregnancy, while children will be examined to determine birth weight, growth and development progress, incidence of pneumonia and other health measures. In addition, several hundred older women will be enrolled at each site and monitored to assess cardiopulmonary, metabolic and cancer outcomes. Blood and urine samples will be collected for biomarker analysis. Homes in the control group will receive LPG stoves and fuel at the end of the trial. NIH funding for the trial comes from the NIH Common Fund; National Cancer Institute; National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, in addition to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. NHLBI will administer the award. NIH s Fogarty International Center provides scientific leadership on indoor air pollution initiatives and coordinates GACD activities across the agency. The household air pollution trial is one of more than a dozen research projects in the GACD program to address lung diseases. GACD s collaborative network of investigators will focus on implementation and intervention research in LMICs, vulnerable populations in high-income countries and aboriginal communities.  By working together on pressing global health issues such as indoor air pollution, we can share ideas, leverage resources, accelerate discovery and build international networks of scientists and communities that together are better able to produce solutions that benefit us all,  noted Fogarty Director Roger I.

According to the researchers, dust mite allergens are more chemically stable and produced in larger quantities than other dust mite proteins. This study is the first to provide specific information about the characteristics of dust mite proteins, and may help researchers uncover factors that lead to the development of dust mite allergy and assist in the design of better allergy therapies. The results, partially funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, appeared online in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. ""Allergy researchers have pondered what distinguishes an allergen from a non-allergen for years,"" said NIEHS Staff Scientist Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., corresponding author of the paper. ""There was anecdotal evidence in the field before, and it made sense to examine the organism that causes a lot of allergic sensitization in humans, the common dust mite."" Mueller and his collaborators used two approaches to tackle the question. The first used whole body extracts of dust mites to measure the amount of proteins being made. As a group, the allergens were much more highly produced than non-allergen dust mite proteins. The second approach involved Duke University scientist Michael Fitzgerald, Ph.D., who utilized a large-scale, mass spectrometry technique to measure the stability of many proteins at once. His team evaluated 656 non-allergens and 19 allergens, and found that the 19 allergens were statistically more stable than dust mite proteins in general. ""I am excited that the analytical methodology we spent so many years developing, turned out to be so useful in addressing this fundamental question about allergenic proteins,"" Fitzgerald said. The finding that dust mite allergens are more durable and more abundant than other dust mite proteins supports two hypotheses about how allergenic compounds stimulate an immune response in the body. Mueller said one theory is that proteins that are more stable do not break down during the journey from the source, such as dust mite, cockroach, and ragweed pollen, to a person. Another possible explanation is that more stable proteins are harder for the immune system to digest, therefore initiating signals in the body that indicate they are dangerous particles. Although the usual symptoms of sneezing, red or watery eyes, and nasal congestion, seen in allergies are unwelcome, they are, for the most part, lessened by prescription and over-the-counter allergy medications. However, for the millions of asthmatics who are allergic to dust mites, interacting with dust mite allergens can spur emergency room visits. ""Dust mite allergy is a risk factor for asthma, which is a disease of enormous public health importance in the U.S. and abroad,"" said NIEHS Scientific Director Darryl Zeldin, M.D. ""Studies such as this one, which enhance our understanding of the characteristics and biology of dust mite allergens, have significant potential to lead to development of new approaches that treat this condition."" NIEHS supports research to understand the effects of the environment on human health and is part of NIH.","Published: October 20, 2016"

As stated in our recent strategic update, TxCell continues to intensify its efforts on its ENTrIA platform of engineered regulatory T cells. TxCell has launched a third CAR-Treg collaboration in order to strengthen its recently initiated transplantation program,  said St phane Boissel, Chief Executive Officer of TxCell.  Thanks to TxCell s unparalleled expertise in the Treg space, we have secured access to the most advanced CAR-Treg programs worldwide. We expect this to help us achieve our goal of launching a first-in-man clinical study with a first CAR-Treg in 2018.  This collaboration agreement covers the development of a CAR-Treg-based cellular immunotherapy for the prevention of graft rejection in the context of Solid Organ Transplantation (SOT). Activities relating to this program will be primarily conducted in the UBC laboratories. The activities will be led by Professor Megan Levings, who earlier this year established a first preclinical proof of concept with human HLA-A2-specific CAR-Treg cells in a preclinical transplantation model1. UBC will conduct non-clinical pharmacology studies with CAR-Treg cells with the aim of initiating a first-in-man study in transplantation patients as soon as possible.  The recent in vivo proof of concept published by UBC in a leading international scientific journal is a critical milestone in the pioneering field of CAR-Treg cells,  said Arnaud Foussat, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Head of External Collaborations & Alliance Management of TxCell.  In contrast to existing approaches based on polyclonal Tregs already tested in clinical trials, we have chosen to bring antigen specificity through a CAR, with the aim of increasing the potential to address the vast unmet medical need in transplantation. We are honoured that Prof. Levings has chosen TxCell as its partner for this program and we are looking forward to our collaboration towards a common goal of initiating a first-in-man study as rapidly as possible.   TxCell has unique experience in the development of Treg-based cellular immunotherapies and we are excited to collaborate to develop CAR-Treg therapy for unmet medical needs in transplantation,  said Dr. Megan Levings, Professor, Department of Surgery, UBC and Head, Childhood Diseases Research Theme, BC Children's Hospital.  The collaboration will allow us to assess the potential of CAR-Treg cells in preclinical models of solid organ transplantation.  The UBC team demonstrated that, in a preclinical xenogeneic Graft-vs-Host Disease (GvHD) model, human CAR-engineered Treg cells that are specific for the molecule HLA-A2 were more effective than polyclonal Treg cells in reducing GvHD-related inflammation. The model used by Dr. Levings  team is based on xenogeneic GvHD induced in immunodeficient mice through the injection of human HLA-A2+ white blood cells. These human white blood cells (graft) attack the immunodeficient mice (host), resulting in an inflammatory reaction (Graft-vs-Host Disease, GvHD). The CAR used in this experiment was designed to specifically recognize the HLA-A2 molecule found solely on graft cells. These data will constitute the basis for the first product development under the new TxCell/UBC collaboration announced. Whilst the UBC team is focused on product development activities, it will in parallel perform research activities in the CAR-Treg field with the aim of optimizing and broadening the new product platform for transplantation. TxCell has an exclusive option on programs and products developed under this agreement. Financial terms of the collaboration have not been disclosed.","Published: October 20, 2016"

See Also: Zika virus tested in brain precursor cells The team, led by Forrest Goodfellow, a graduate student in the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, developed a neurodevelopmental chick model that could mimic the effects of Zika on the first trimester. Historically, chick embryos have been extensively used as a model for human biology. Early last spring, Goodfellow began inoculating chick embryos with a virus strain originally sourced from the Zika outbreak epicenter. ""We wanted a complete animal model, closely to that of a human, which would recapitulate the microcephaly phenotype,"" said Goodfellow, who recently presented the findings at the Southern Translational Education and Research (STaR) Conference. The RBC team, which included Melinda Brindley, an assistant professor of virology in the College of Veterinary Medicine, and Qun Zhao, associate professor of physics in the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, suggests that the chick embryo provides a useful model to study the effects of Zika, in part because of its significant similarity to human fetal neurodevelopment and rapid embryonic process. Learn More: Mouse models of Zika in pregnancy show how fetuses become infected ""Now we can look quickly, at greater numbers, to take a closer look at a multitude of different strains and possibly identify the critical window of susceptibility for Zika virus-induced birth defects,"" said Brindley. ""With this approach, we can continue to further design and test therapeutic efficacy."" The challenge today is unpredictable disease outbreaks and how to ramp up process and production of therapeutic antibodies in preparation. Having an active pathogen threat like Zika that can jump across continents reinforces the need for therapeutic innovation. Early stage chick embryos are readily available and low in cost, Goodfellow explained. Development within the egg (in ovo) provides an environment that can be easily accessed by high-speed automation. Poultry automation in the Southeast is impressive, and the industry is now using robotic technology, Goodfellow said. ""With egg injection automation and embryo viability technology, we could test tens of thousands of potential therapeutic compounds in a single day,"" he said. Since 2011, under the mentorship of Steven Stice, a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar and director of the Regenerative Bioscience Center, Goodfellow has worked extensively with eggs and chickens. In a previous project with Stice and Zhao, the team developed a unique approach of marrying stem cell biology and MRI to track and label neural stem cells. Related: New report details pre- and postnatal brain defects from Zika virus""We knew we could look at the brain structure, shape and size with MRI, but what we captured was evidence that the infection caused MRI-visible damage, and the total brain volume was substantially smaller,"" said Stice, faculty lead and principal investigator of the study.

However, modulating the immune response might help the human brain to better cope with such conditions and regenerate. The research group led by Caghan Kizil at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) report on these findings in the journal Cell Reports. Their conclusions are based on studying zebrafish, an organism well-known for its ability to counteract neuronal damage by regenerating lost cells. See Also: Self-repairing mechanism can help to preserve brain function in neurodegenerative diseases Zebrafish and humans are obviously quite different species. However, they share an evolutionary past that translates into various similarities on the cellular and molecular scale. ""The regenerative skills apparent in zebrafish might lie dormant in humans and might somehow be activated by pulling the right strings"", Kizil explains. ""This is why we study if and how zebrafish cope with neurodegeneration. We want to understand the basic molecular mechanisms of such a regenerative aptitude in order to design better clinical therapies."" In the current study, the Dresden-based neuroscientist and his co-workers succeeded in mimicking symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in zebrafish brain. Conditions were triggered by Amyloid-Beta42 (A 42) peptides - one of the major contributors to the disease in human brains. Similar to our brains, Amyloid molecules accumulated in the neurons of zebrafish leading to immune response, synaptic degeneration, cell death, learning deficits and other dysfunctions. ""This is the first time, such conditions have been generated in adult zebrafish through A 42 deposits"", Kizil says. Graphical abstract of the reserach. Credit: Bhattarai et al., Cell Reports, 2016  The A 42 deposits triggered a special inflammation-related signaling pathway that ultimately lead to enhanced neurogenesis, i.e. new neurons were built. ""We found that a molecule called Interleukin-4 is very much involved in the generation of neurons. The molecule is released by the dying neurons and immune system cells. It then acts on neural stem cells, which are the progenitors of neurons, by increasing their proliferation"", Kizil says. ""Interleukin-4 has been known to be a player in immune response and inflammation. But to date, the direct role of IL4 on stem cell proliferation has not been shown."" Learn More: Specific gene linked to adult growth of brain cells, learning and memory A better understanding of how we could manipulate inflammatory conditions might aid to develop novel therapies against Alzheimer's, Kizil argues. ""In humans inflammation does not seem to act as a positive cue for regeneration as it does in zebrafish. Possibly because other factors interfere in a complex manner. Our zebrafish model offers the opportunity to study such factors one by one in a reductionist manner. Besides, our study points to the significance of the immune response. That is to say: by tweaking the immune response, for example with drugs, and targeting the right cell types, we might unlock the potential of human neural stem cells to proliferate and build new neurons. Of course, the challenge remains as to what will happen to those new neurons. But first things first: we have to start from the stem cells.""

The scientists believe their findings, published by Cell Reports, open new treatment possibilities not just for TSC, but possibly for other forms of autism and some neurologic disorders. See Also: Interactions between cortical and subcortical regions important in hypersensitivity in ASDMitochondria, the organelles responsible for cellular energy production and metabolism, constantly get recycled. Through a process known as autophagy (""self-eating""), cells literally digest their damaged or aging mitochondria, clearing the way for healthy replacements. (Research on how autophagy works earned a Nobel Prize earlier this month). The new study, led by Mustafa Sahin, MD, PhD, and co-first authors Darius Ebrahimi-Fakhari, MD, PhD, a resident at Boston Children's Hospital, and medical student Afshin Saffari, in Boston Children's F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center, shows that autophagy is defective in TSC. The scientists further showed that two existing classes of drugs counter the defect: the epilepsy drug carbamazepine, and drugs known as mTOR inhibitors. When treated, the dysfunctional neurons were able to clear damaged mitochondria and replenish healthy mitochondria, restoring a normal turnover. ""Our findings point to possible treatments for enhancing mitophagy for some neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases,"" says Sahin, who is also director of the Translational Neuroscience Center at Boston Children's and senior author on the paper. Defects in mitophagy, or autophagy of mitochondria, have already been implicated in a number of neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Mitochondria have also been studied in autism for years, but the findings have been largely anecdotal and inconclusive, in part because the autism population is diverse and hard to define. Learn More: Link discovered between touch of individuals with autism, their social difficulties ""We decided to use tuberous sclerosis, a genetically defined disorder that has a high incidence of autism, as a model to understand the role of mitochondrial dynamics,"" says Sahin. Sahin, Ebrahimi-Fakhari and colleagues studied both rat neurons and patient-derived neurons (created from induced pluripotent stem cells) affected by TSC and used live-cell imaging to examine the distribution and dynamics of mitochondria. They found that the TSC neurons as a whole had more mitochondria, and in particular more fragmented and dysfunctional mitochondria. Then they examined the neurons' axons, the projections that send messages to other cells. Mitochondria play a critical role in axons, and are found in high numbers at presynaptic sites the tips of axons that form synapses or junctions with other neurons and release neurotransmitters. But the axons of both rat neurons and neurons from TSC patients were depleted of mitochondria. ""We think this could have implications for how neurons talk to each other,"" says Ebrahimi-Fakhari. ""Synapses that lose the support of mitochondria might be releasing neurotransmitters too much or too little."" Related: Altered cell cycle gene activity underlies brain overgrowth in toddlers with autism Diving deeper, they found that while mitophagy was increased in the body of the cell, it was reduced in the axons. Although proteins involved in the early steps of mitophagy increased in the axons, autophagosomes and lysosomes the organelles that do the digesting failed to appear around the damaged mitochondria. Instead, the mitochondria were being shuttled out of the axons, back to the body of the cell, without being replaced. The researchers were able to restore normal mitophagy and replenish functioning mitochondria in both neurons in a dish and in live mice in several ways: Most notably, mitochondria were replenished at presynaptic sites, where their presence is most critical. The findings shed intriguing light on what is already known about TSC and autism. Growing evidence, including from previous studies in the Sahin lab, shows that autism, intellectual disability and seizures in many patients with TSC may result, at least in part, from synaptic dysfunction. Autism itself is increasingly seen as a disorder of synapses and this study hints at one possible way synapses might go awry.

The reason you may have to say something twice when talking to older family members at Thanksgiving dinner may not be because of their hearing. Researchers at the University of Maryland have determined that something is going on in the brains of typical older adults that causes them to struggle to follow speech amidst background noise, even when their hearing would be considered normal on a clinical assessment. See Also: Cooling technique protects speech during brain surgeryIn an interdisciplinary study published by the Journal of Neurophysiology, researchers Samira Anderson, Jonathan Z. Simon, and Alessandro Presacco found that adults aged 61-73 with normal hearing scored significantly worse on speech understanding in noisy environments than adults aged 18-30 with normal hearing. The researchers are all associated with the UMD's Brain and Behavior Initiative. ""Evidence of degraded representation of speech in noise, in the aging midbrain and cortex"" is part of ongoing research into the so-called cocktail party problem, or the brain's ability to focus on and process a particular stream of speech in the middle of a noisy environment. This research brings together the fields of hearing and speech science, neuroscience and cognitive science, electrical engineering, biology, and systems science. The study subjects underwent two different kinds of scans to measure their brains' electrical activity while they listened to people talk. The researchers were able to see what the subjects' brains were up to when asked what someone was saying, both in a quiet environment and amidst a level of noise. The researchers studied two areas of the brain. They looked at the more 'ancestral' midbrain area, which most vertebrate animals -- all the way down to fish -- have, and which does basic processing of all sounds. They also looked at the cortex, which is particularly large in humans and part of which specializes in speech processing. In the younger subject group, the midbrain generated a signal that matched its task in each case looking like speech in the quiet environment, and speech clearly discernable against a noisy background in the noise environment. But in the older subject group, the quality of the response to the speech signal was degraded even when in the quiet environment, and the response was even worse in the noisy environment. Learn More: Patients improve speech by watching 3-D tongue images ""For older listeners, even when there isn't any noise, the brain is already having trouble processing the speech,"" said Simon. Neural signals recorded from cortex showed that younger adults could process speech well in a relatively short amount of time. But the auditory cortex of older test subjects took longer to represent the same amount of information. Why is this the case? ""Part of the comprehension problems experienced by older adults in both quiet and noise conditions could be linked to age-related imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neural processes in the brain,"" Presacco said. ""This imbalance could impair the brain's ability to correctly process auditory stimuli and could be the main cause of the abnormally high cortical response observed in our study."" ""Older people need more time to figure out what a speaker is saying,"" Simon noted. ""They are dedicating more of their resources and exerting more effort than younger adults when they are listening to speech."" ""Often we will hear an older person say, 'I can hear you, I just can't understand you,'"" said Anderson. ""This research gives us new insight into why that is the case."" This eroding of brain function appears to be typical for older adults and a natural part of the aging process. The researchers are now looking into whether brain training techniques may be able to help older adults improve their speech comprehension. Simple courtesies can help, too. Since being able to see as well as hear someone speaking helps with speech processing, it's a good idea to look directly at older adults and make sure you have their attention before talking with them. ""The older brain just drops part of the speech signal, even if the ears captured it all just fine,"" said Simon. ""When someone can see you speaking, instead of only hearing you, their visual system can sometimes make up for that loss."" Holding conversations in a quiet environment helps as well. Related: Brain s iconic seat of speech goes silent when we actually talk ""The main message is that the older adults in our study have normal hearing as measured on an audiogram, yet they have difficulty understanding speech in noise because the timing aspects of the speech signal are not being accurately encoded,"" said Anderson. ""Because they have normal hearing, talking louder does not help. So if someone is having trouble understanding you in a noisy restaurant or in a crowded room, it is most important to speak clearly at a normal or slightly slower than normal rate.

The ""Best of What s New"" Health category, in which the Zika test technology is a winner, recognizes medical treatments and devices that could ""solve an unsolvable problem"" and utilize entirely new ideas and functions. ""We are tremendously honored to receive a 'Best of What s New' award for our paper-based Zika diagnostic,"" said Collins, who is a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member, and Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) s Department of Biological Engineering. ""Using synthetic biology, we have developed an inexpensive test that could diagnose a patient with Zika in the field within a few hours, which we hope could be used to contain Zika or other viral outbreaks."" To build the Zika test, Collins brought together a team including Wyss Institute scientists as well as collaborators from MIT, the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Harvard Medical School (HMS), University of Toronto, Arizona State University (ASU), University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Boston University (BU), Cornell University, and Addgene. They envisioned a new class of diagnostic that is inexpensive and rapidly deployable to screen blood, urine, or saliva samples for Zika or any other RNA virus including Ebola, SARS, measles, influenza, hepatitis C, and West Nile fever. With that goal in mind, Collins' team has developed a diagnostic system that does not require refrigeration or electricity. They freeze-dry synthetic gene circuits onto paper discs. These biomolecular circuits are activated when the paper is rehydrated with a droplet of sample fluid; the disc changes color to indicate a positive result for Zika virus, similar to the visual readout of a home pregnancy test. To validate their rapid Zika test, the team successfully identified strain-specific Zika in blood samples from infected monkeys as well in laboratory cell cultures infected with the virus. More recently, working with collaborators in Ecuador, the test has been used to accurately diagnose presence of Zika virus in patient samples. The ability to discern between strains of Zika is especially important for diagnosing the American strain of the virus, which is associated with rare but severe neurological symptoms including fetal microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The ""Best of What s New"" judging criteria include the significance of the innovation, the quality of the design and its originality, and the ambition and scope of the project. ""The cell-free, paper-based tests developed by Jim Collins and his team provide a low-cost, stable platform for long-term storage and fast deployment of diagnostics, anywhere in the world, where they can rapidly diagnose the presence and identity of rapidly emerging viral pathogens.

""A staggering number of diseases are linked to the adaptive immune system,"" noted Buntzman, an immunologist in the lab of Dr. Monica Kraft in the UA College of Medicine   Tucson. ""Cancers such as lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and solid tumors, viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, asthma, inflammation, transplant tolerance or rejection   the list goes on."" Buntzman, who is based in the UA's BIO5 Institute, and his colleagues recently developed a tool that uses CyVerse supercomputing resources to create the first nearly comprehensive map of the human immunome, which contains all of the possible immune receptors our bodies can make. Then, with the immunome at their fingertips, the researchers went on to develop an informatics tool to find patterns denoting which immune receptors may be responsible for protecting humans from infectious disease and which ones may cause autoimmune disorders, tissue rejection or some types of cancer. ""Once we find these receptors, scientists can design unique therapies to enhance the protective response, or add just the right receptors to a patient who may be missing them, or deplete the cells that harbor receptors that cause autoimmune disease,"" Buntzman said. ""This is the basis of the burgeoning field of immunotherapy. ""The same tools we use to study basic science questions in adaptive immunology can be used clinically,"" he said. Now Buntzman and his colleagues at the UA Genetics Core and the UA Cancer Center are developing methods to test for lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia tumors. ""Buntzman's technique for immune-profiling with high-throughput informatics will help us to develop better clinical diagnostic tests, and will supplement our current clinical testing so that we can provide the UA clinical community with cutting-edge diagnostics to benefit the patients of the Banner   University Medical Center,"" noted Michael Hammer, UA geneticist and UAGC director. ""This is an example of real-world precision diagnostics being developed here on the UA campus."" ""The cancer cells of leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma are unique in that the tumor cells themselves are immune cells,"" Buntzman explained. ""These three diseases occur when an immune cell gets a mutation and starts to outgrow the healthy immune cells. But the tumor cells harbor a unique biomarker that our tools can follow diagnostically through the course of treatment and, hopefully, into remission."" With the immunome at their fingertips courtesy of Buntzman's informatics tool, ""it's very easy for us to see an overgrowth of immune receptors. We can sequence immune receptors to count the number of each receptor a person has in their bloodstream or at the site of the tumor. If there is one sequence that occurs out of proportion to the others, that's a marker for an existing tumor."" A healthy person would have mostly unique immune cell receptors, he added. ""Once we know the sequence of a cancerous immune cells, we know the tumor's bio-signature,"" Buntzman said. ""We can follow it for the time that the person is being treated and find the faintest trickle of it still remaining in their system. No other technique is as sensitive as this."" Buntzman envisions perfected tests to find cancer and cancerous remissions earlier, providing greater chance of successful treatment. According to one study, immunomic tests could be up to 100 times more sensitive than conventional tests. Buntzman believes that immunomic tests, which require only a small genetic sample, could be vital for tracking cancer treatment and remission. A highly sensitive test is more likely to detect whether a small amount of cancerous cells remain after treatment. ""It's a better test of the effectiveness of that treatment, and a better indicator of the next steps to take,"" Buntzman said. Immunomic tests also could be crucial for detecting cancer early by scanning people before they become ill. ""When people go to a clinic,"" Buntzman said, ""it s usually because they're already sick. If doctors could detect cancerous cells before they grow drastically out of proportion to healthy cells, patients would have much higher odds of successful cancer treatment and survival."" ""Buntzman's work is at the forefront of precision diagnostics and represents a major breakthrough in our ability to diagnose and treat oncologic disease,"" said Kenneth Ramos, associate vice president for Precision Health Sciences and director of the UA's Center for Applied Genetics and Genomic Medicine. ""His work has far-reaching implications, given the critical role of immune cells in all forms of chronic human disease.""","Published: October 19, 2016"

The findings indicate the need for a significant change in practice, given that selenium supplements cannot be recommended for preventing colorectal cancer. Selenium has been a popular nutritional supplement for decades, touted for its antioxidant properties and its role in stopping free radicals from damaging cells and DNA. Studies have shown a deficiency of this micronutrient to be associated with cancer risk. However, a randomized clinical trial involving 1,824 participants from clinical centers in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and New York indicates that selenium supplements failed to prevent the development of colon polyps, but significantly increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in older individuals.  The possibility that selenium supplements may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes has been hinted at before,  said Peter Lance, MD, deputy director of the UA Cancer Center and the study s principal investigator.  But this is the first study to have substantiated such a risk in the setting of a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  Study participants were randomized to take 200 mcg of selenium as selenized yeast or a placebo daily. The trial also looked at celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), versus placebo. While the once-daily 400 mg dose prevented colon polyps in high-risk patients, it increased the risk of hypertension in those with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors.  Our study has added important refinements to understanding who may benefit most from the colon polyp-preventing effects of celecoxib and how best to avoid cardiovascular toxicity caused by this agent,  added Dr. Lance. Further UA-led studies are under way to define the biological mechanisms underlying the effects, including toxicity, of selenium supplements. A study is planned to target celecoxib to those patients who will benefit most from the colon polyp-preventing actions of celecoxib while minimizing cardiovascular toxicity.","Published: October 19, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/less-frequent-cervical-cancer-screening-199539,Less Frequent Cervical Cancer Screening HPV vaccinated women may only need one screening every   to    years with screening starting later in life  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Women may only need cervical cancer screening every five to 10 years   instead of every three years, as currently recommended   and may be able to start screenings later in life, according to a new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The researchers found that women who have been vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) require less-intensive screening because HPV causes almost all cases of cervical cancer. Accordingly, the risk of these women developing cervical cancer is quite low. The study appears in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  This analysis enabled us to examine what would happen if we shifted from the current way we screen for cervical cancer   essentially, recommending the same type of screening for all women   to screening that takes into account whether women have been vaccinated against HPV and therefore face a substantially lower risk of cervical cancer,  said Jane Kim, professor of health decision science at Harvard Chan School.  We found that continuing intensive screening among HPV-vaccinated women yields excessive costs and harms with little to no health benefit.  Since 2012, major guideline-making organizations have recommended that all women in the United States be screened for cervical cancer every three years beginning at age 21 with a Pap test (which checks for abnormal cells in the cervix), with the option of switching to a combination of Pap test and HPV testing (known as  co-testing ) every five years beginning at age 30. However, current U.S. guidelines don t differentiate screening recommendations based on a woman s HPV vaccination status. The Harvard Chan researchers developed a disease-simulation model to estimate the risks and benefits of various screening protocols. Their model projected the health and economic effects of three different types of HPV vaccines that are currently approved for use, two of which have been available since 2006. The goal was to pinpoint screening strategies that would provide the biggest health benefit in the most cost-effective way. According to the model, women with the lowest risk of cervical cancer   those vaccinated with the new  nonavalent  HPV vaccine (HPV-9), which targets seven types of HPV that cause nearly 90 percent of all cervical cancers   would need screening only four times, every 10 years starting at age 30 or 35. Women vaccinated with earlier versions of the HPV vaccine   the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines (HPV-2 and HPV-4), which target two HPV types that cause roughly 70 percent of cervical cancers   would need screening every five years starting at age 25 or 30. The researchers also found that screening with HPV testing alone would provide similar health benefits and value as a Pap test or co-testing, because the HPV test is highly sensitive and can more efficiently identify women who are likely to develop cervical cancer. One limitation of the study is that it modeled scenarios in which women were fully vaccinated in pre-adolescence (as recommended) and fully compliant with screening protocols. The researchers noted that future studies should take into account actual vaccination uptake rates in the population and data on screening compliance in vaccinated women as these data become available over time.","Published: October 19, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/peptides-vs-superbugs-204964,Peptides vs  Superbugs Scientists successfully develop a shuttle system made of liquid crystalline nanomaterials that protect peptites  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Several peptides have an antibacterial effect   but they are broken down in the human body too quickly to exert this effect. Empa researchers have now succeeded in encasing peptides in a protective coat, which could prolong their life in the human body. This is an important breakthrough because peptides are considered to be a possible solution in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They occur in many organisms and constitute natural weapons against bacteria in the body, being known as antimicrobial peptides. They offer a possible   and now also urgently needed   alternative to conventional antibiotics, but have not yet been successfully used in a clinical context. The reason for this lies in their structure, which results in peptides being broken down relatively quickly inside the human body, before they can have an anti-bacterial impact. In Empa's Biointerfaces Department in St. Gallen, a team led by Stefan Salentinig has now succeeded, in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen, in developing a kind of shuttle system made of liquid-crystalline nanomaterials (so-called nanocarriers), which protect the peptides and thus ensure they safely reach the target site. The results of the study were recently published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. The specially developed nanocarriers consist of so-called structure-forming lipids, which can accommodate the antibacterial peptides and hold or release them based on the nature of the structure. Initial tests with bacterial cultures have shown that the peptides are completely enclosed by the nanocarriers and thus remain stable. However, once they are released they exert their full effect and prove extremely effective in fighting bacteria. Peptides are good   peptides with nanocapsules are even better The researchers have also documented an additional characteristic of the nanocarriers. Peptides are already effective against bacteria when working ""alone""   but in combination with the carrier structure they are even stronger. Thus the protective casings formed by the lipids not only ensure the safe delivery of the peptides to the area where they are needed, but also intensify their impact at the target site. The research carried out by Empa and the University of Copenhagen could, therefore, be a first step in the successful fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as peptides use a different mechanism from that used by antibiotics and destroy the membrane of bacteria. Even antibiotic-resistant superbugs are not equipped against such an effect. ""Of course, the bacteria might eventually also adapt to be more resistant,"" commented Salentinig. However, this would not happen overnight and we would have a new weapon in the arsenal for the fight against multi-resistant bacteria. In a next step, the researchers want to structure the nanocarriers in a way that enables them to take effect at a specific time. The peptides would therefore be protected within the nanostructure and then released when needed and as the result of an alteration in their structure at the ""press of a button"". This is especially important in the medical field, for example when treating open wounds or using catheters.","Published: October 19, 2016"

The technique could one day be used to treat cardiac arrhythmia or to restore electrical functions to scarred heart or nervous system tissues. It might also prove useful for treating a variety of genetic diseases involving poor conductivity in human sodium and calcium channels. The study appears online in Nature Communications on October 18. In mammals, the genes controlling the sodium ion channels responsible for a cell s electrical activity are surprisingly large. Too large, unfortunately, to be readily delivered to cells through a virus   standard procedure in modern gene therapy techniques. To skirt this size issue, the Duke team delivered smaller ion channels engineered from bacterial genes to primary human cells in a laboratory setting. With the replacement channels, cells that don t normally produce electrical signals became electrically active, and cells that normally produce signals did so more strongly.  In current medical practice, there is nothing that can be done to stably augment the electrical excitability of cells in the heart or brain,  said Nenad Bursac, professor of biomedical engineering at Duke.  There are no drugs that can efficiently do it, and any mammalian genes that might help are too large for gene therapy applications. Our technique, however, uses much smaller bacterial ion channels that proved successful in human cells in the laboratory. We re currently testing this in live animals.  While bacterial genes encoding sodium channels are different than their human counterparts, evolution has conserved many similarities of ion channel design since multi-celled animals diverged from bacteria hundreds of millions of years ago. Hung Nguyen, a doctoral student in Bursac s laboratory, mutated these bacterial genes so that channels they encode could become active in human cells. In one experiment, the researchers placed cultured cells in several parallel lines, alternating between electrically active and inactive cells. When stimulated at one end, the electrical signal traveled across the lines very slowly. The researchers then delivered three genes to the electrically inactive cells: one bacterial gene for a sodium ion channel and two supporting genes encoding a potassium channel and connexin-43, a protein that helps shuttle electrical signals between cells. When delivered to unexcitable cells taken from the skin, heart and brain, the trio of genes caused the cells to become electrically active, speeding up the electrical signals as they raced across the lines.  You could imagine using this to alter electrically dead cardiac scar tissue after a heart attack to bridge gaps between healthy cells,  said Nguyen, who also points out that all three genes are small enough to be delivered simultaneously by a single virus. Nguyen and Bursac also showed that the gene encoding the bacterial sodium channel could, by itself, enhance the excitability of cells that are already electrically active. In a second experiment, they delivered the sodium channel gene to cardiomyocytes   electrically active heart cells   in conditions mimicking various diseases or stressful situations, such as a heart attack.  In those pathological conditions, these cells become electrically silent,  said Bursac.  But when we add the bacterial channel, we can keep them conducting electrical signals under more severe conditions.  Nguyen adds that this work contributes to a growing body of research that is looking to so-called  primitive  organisms for help with our own health.  There s a large pool of bacterial species whose sodium channels might have slightly different electrical characteristics to draw from,  said Nguyen.  These channels can be also modified to pass calcium ions. We re developing a framework for others to begin exploring these opportunities.   I think this work is really exciting,  said Bursac.  We re basically borrowing from bacteria to eventually help humans suffering from heart or brain diseases. ","Published: October 19, 2016"

The ultra-rapid NICU whole-genome test is powered by Edico Genome s DRAGEN , the world s first bio-IT processor designed to rapidly accelerate the analysis of genomic data while maintaining high accuracy. Rady Children s Institute for Genomic Medicine and Edico Genome will work together to evolve the DRAGEN platform to impact additional areas of clinical genome analysis. This vision includes scaling the ultra-rapid NICU testing to additional NICUs and PICUs utilizing an all-in-one appliance deployed onsite or in the cloud and including analysis of additional clinically relevant variant types. Rady Children s Institute for Genomic Medicine began providing whole genome sequencing in July 2016 with clinical interpretation in a meaningful, timely and highly accurate manner to critically ill children. This rapid method allows the simultaneous evaluation of nearly all of the 4,500 known genetic diseases in a single test. Rapid diagnosis is essential in acute care situations, particularly in NICUs where medical decision-making must happen in minutes and hours, not weeks.  Rapid diagnosis of critically ill newborns is no longer an academic exercise, it s a reality for critically ill newborns admitted to the NICU and PICU at Rady Children s Hospital . The information we receive from this rapid and comprehensive testing is already helping our medical teams make treatment decisions and impacting the lives of these babies and their families,  said Stephen Kingsmore, M.D., D.Sc., president and chief executive officer of the Rady Children s Institute for Genomic Medicine.  Development of this ultra-rapid test could not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of our key partners, including Edico Genome. We look forward to working with Edico on evolving the platform and making this rapid testing capability available to additional NICUs around the globe.  Up to one-third of babies admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit in the United States have a genetic disease, and more than 20 percent of infant deaths are caused by genetic illnesses. Treatments are currently available for more than 500 genetic diseases; for many of these, initiation of therapy in newborns can help prevent disabilities and life-threatening illnesses. The cost of whole-genome sequencing has fallen to the point of feasibility for clinical testing of these and other conditions, and the DRAGEN bioinformatics chip is reducing time needed for analysis, facilitating the use of genomic medicine in acute medical care.  Rapid diagnostics is essential to fundamentally changing our ability to inform clinical care,  said Narayanan  Ray  Veeraraghavan, Ph.D., director of information technology, Rady Children s Institute for Genomic Medicine.  Deploying whole-genome based testing at the bedside becomes practical and actionable when results are consistently and expeditiously returned to the attending physician(s).  In 2015, while at Children s Mercy Kansas City, Dr. Kingsmore and his team successfully diagnosed critically ill newborns in 26 hours, as published in the journal Genome Medicine, using time-shrinking technologies including in-house software, Edico Genome s DRAGEN Bio-IT Processor for data analysis and one of Illumina s high-throughput sequencing instruments.  We could not be prouder that newborn babies are receiving rapid and potentially life-saving care based on the speed and accuracy of DRAGEN,  said Pieter van Rooyen, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Edico Genome.  This ultra-rapid NICU testing is the first clinical application of the DRAGEN platform. It s not enough for one institute to implement this technology though   this testing needs to be scaled for easy use by NICUs around the world. We look forward to working with Dr. Kingsmore and his team to realize the vision of an all-in-one appliance where the ultra-rapid test can be performed onsite or in the cloud and can be expanded to include analysis of additional clinically relevant variants, such as structural and copy number variants.  DRAGEN accelerates secondary analysis of next-generation sequencing data, reducing the time required for analyzing a genome at 30x coverage from  approximately 30 hours to nearly 22 minutes. DRAGEN uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to implement genome pipeline algorithms, including BCL conversion, compression, mapping, alignment, sorting, duplicate marking and haplotype variant calling. The platform includes whole genome and exome, transcriptome, joint genotyping, methylation, and GATK pipelines, and allows users to develop custom algorithms as well as refine and improve existing pipelines.

Contrary to the psychotropic actions of agonists of CB1 receptors, and serious side effects of the selective antagonists of this receptor, drugs acting on CB2 receptors appear as promising drugs to combat CNS diseases (Parkinson s disease, Huntington s chorea, cerebellarataxia, amyotrohiclateralsclerosis). Differential localization of CB2 receptors in neural cell types and up regulation in neuroinflammation are keys to understand the therapeutic potential in inter alia diseases that imply progressive neurodegeneration.

Once it has spread beyond the ovaries, it is more challenging to treat and can be fatal. During metastasis, ovarian tumor cells detach from the primary tumor site and migrate to the abdominal cavity, where their survival is supported by white blood cells known as tumor-associated macrophages. In a recent study, senior author and Yale pathology professor Wang Min demonstrated that the tumors release substances called cytokines to attract macrophages, which then secrete growth factors that promote tumor cell growth and proliferation. The study reveals a mechanism that provides researchers with a promising target for treating ovarian and other metastatic cancers.  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can influence ovarian cancer growth, migration, and metastasis, but the detailed mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer metastasis remain unclear. The study showed a strong correlation between TAM-associated spheroids and the clinical pathology of ovarian cancer. They also determined that TAMs promote spheroid formation and tumor growth at early stages of transcoelomic metastasis in an established mouse model for epithelial ovarian cancer.  M2 macrophage like TAMs were localized in the center of spheroids and secreted EGF, which upregulated  M 2 integrin on TAMs and ICAM-1 on tumor cells to promote association between tumor cells and TAM. Moreover, EGF secreted by TAMs activated EGFR on tumor cells, which in turn upregulated VEGF/VEGFR signaling in surrounding tumor cells to support tumor cell proliferation and migration. Pharmacological blockade of EGFR or antibody neutralization of ICAM-1 in TAMs blunted spheroid formation and ovarian cancer progression in mouse models. Their findings suggest that EGF secreted from TAMs plays a critical role in promoting early transcoelomic metastasis of ovarian cancer.  As transcoelomic metastasis is also associated with many other cancers, such as pancreatic and colon cancers, our findings uncover a mechanism for TAM-mediated spheroid formation and provide a potential target for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other transcoelomic metastatic cancers.","Published: October 19, 2016"

Yale researchers have been studying the role that the STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) protein plays in healthy functioning of synapses   the connections between brain cells.  Excessive amounts of STEP protein are found in the brains of humans and animal models of Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease, fragile X syndrome, and schizophrenia. The increase in STEP leads to a disruption of synaptic function and contributes to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The research was led by Yale s Paul Lombroso, the Elizabeth Mears and House Jameson Professor in the Child Study Center and professor of neurobiology and psychiatry, and Kristen Brennand at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In previous work, Lombroso and colleagues have shown that an experimental drug designed to inhibit the STEP protein restores cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer s disease. In the new paper, Lombroso shows that genetically eliminating STEP or using the drug to inhibit STEP activity improves cognitive deficits in a mouse model that has behaviorial features related to symptoms of schizophrenia. A team led by Brennand also found increased levels of STEP in human stem cells derived from skin cells taken from two groups of schizophrenia patients. A STEP inhibitor applied to those human stem cells corrected some of the biochemical and electrophysiological deficits that characterized these abnormal cells. While the drug used in the earlier Alzheimer s experiments has proven difficult to develop for clinical use, Lombroso said he and colleagues at Yale (professors Eric Ellman in chemistry and Angus Nairn in psychiatry) are developing new STEP inhibitors and, if successful, these may have more practical therapeutic value.  These findings suggest that a STEP inhibitor, when discovered, may be the basis of a new drug that can treat a number of neuropsychiatric disorders,  Lombroso said.","Published: October 19, 2016"

The study shows that depression affects the part of the brain which is implicated in non-reward the lateral orbitofrontal cortex so that sufferers of the disease feel a sense of loss and disappointment associated with not receiving rewards. See Also: Genetics in depression: What's known, what's nextThis area of the brain, which becomes active when rewards are not received, is also connected with the part of the brain which is involved in one's sense of self, thus potentially leading to thoughts of personal loss and low self-esteem. Depression is also associated with reduced connectivity between the reward brain area in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and memory systems in the brain, which could account for sufferers having a reduced focus on happy memories. These new discoveries could herald a breakthrough in treating depression, by going to the root cause of the illness, and helping depressed people to stop focussing on negative thoughts.

""This study is the first to demonstrate potential clinically significant benefits of open placebo treatment in chronic low back pain,"" according to the new research by Claudia Carvalho, PhD, of ISPA-Instituto Universit rio, Lisbon, and colleagues. ""Our data suggests that harnessing placebo effects without deception is possible in the context of a plausible rationale."" See Also: Placebo power: Depressed people who respond to fake drugs get the most help from real ones, study finds The study included 97 adult patients with low back pain lasting at least three months. Patients were randomly assigned to three weeks of treatment on their usual pain medications alone, or on their usual medications plus placebo. But unlike the usual ""placebo-controlled"" study, patients knew they were taking a placebo. The researchers explained to patients about the ""potentially powerful"" placebo effect, and how the body may automatically respond to placebo treatments. Previous studies have suggested that placebos can have ""clinically meaningful benefits"" possibly reflecting ""non-conscious processes"" related to participating in a study and taking pills. Measures of back pain and disability were compared between groups. After three weeks, patients initially assigned to usual treatment were offered the chance to take placebo pills. Eighty-three patients completed the study. The results showed greater reductions in pain for patients assigned to placebo. On a 0-to-10 scale, patients in the placebo group had a 1.5-point improvement in pain score, compared to no significant change for patients taking usual medications only. The placebo group also had nearly a three-point reduction in back pain-related disability score, compared to no change for the usual-treatment group. Read Next: Teaching neurons to respond to placebos as potential treatment for Parkinson s Overall, open placebo treatment reduced initial pain and disability scores by approximately 30 percent. Patients in the usual-treatment group had similar improvements after they started taking placebo pills. There were no adverse effects in either group. There's a pressing need for more effective treatments for low back pain, which causes more disability worldwide than any other medical condition. Conventional ""double-blind"" trials often find commonly prescribed treatments for back pain are no more effective than inactive placebos. Could the placebo effect be used to improve treatment of back pain? Giving placebo pills in open fashion including explanations of how the placebo effect may work--offers a way to overcome the ethical conflict of deceiving patients that they are taking an active medication. The researchers acknowledge some limitations of their study, particularly its small size and short duration. They also note that it was advertised as a ""mind-body clinical study,"" which might have attracted patients who are concerned about conventional medicine or attracted to complementary and alternative treatments.

These are the preliminary findings from a placebo-controlled trial in which children were randomized to receive either high-dose folinic acid or a placebo, says lead author Richard Frye of Arkansas Children's Research Institute in the US. The study, which is published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, also identified a specific blood marker that can be used to predict which patients have the best chance to respond to the treatment. See Also: Personalized approach enhances communication skills in children with autism study finds Up to two percent of children in the US are said to experience symptoms that place them on the autism spectrum. Many of these children have difficulty communicating and interacting with others, especially within a social setting. Researchers do not yet fully understand all the reasons behind the development of ASD and, importantly, there are currently no approved treatments that address the core symptoms of this disorder. ""The only currently approved medications for autism are both antipsychotic medications that address non-core symptoms and can lead to unwanted side effects,"" says John Slattery, a co-author of the study. Scientific research has linked this disorder to abnormalities in the metabolism of folate as well as genes that are involved in folate metabolism. Certain studies have also shown that the offspring of women who took folate supplements before conception and during pregnancy had a lower risk of having a child with ASD.  Learn More: Automated screening for childhood communication disorders About ten years ago a condition, known as cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), was described in which the concentration of folate is below normal in the central nervous system but not in the blood. Many children with CFD had ASD symptoms and responded well to treatment with high-dose folinic acid. Previously Frye's team could show that folate receptor autoantibodies were found with a high prevalence in children with ASD. In the current study, these researchers found that participants with folate receptor autoantibodies had a more favourable response to the folinic acid treatment. This leads the way to a test that might be useful for clinicians to determine if high-dose folinic acid might be a treatment for a particular child with ASD. The deleterious effects of folate receptor antibodies on brain development and function are now confirmed in a laboratory rat model.

In a study of mice, the researchers found that activating these cells stimulates overeating, and that when the cells are suppressed, appetite is also suppressed. See Also: Brain cells that aid appetite control identifiedThe findings could offer scientists a new target for developing drugs against obesity and other appetite-related disorders, the researchers say. The study is also the latest in recent years to implicate glial cells in important brain functions. Until about 10 years ago, glial cells were believed to play more of a supporting role for neurons. ""In the last few years, abnormal glial cell activities have been strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. There is more and more evidence to point to the importance of glial cells in modulating neuronal function and in mediating brain disorders,"" says Guoping Feng, the James W. and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience. Feng is also a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute. Feng is one of the senior authors of the study, which appears in the journal eLife. The other senior author is Weiping Han, head of the Laboratory of Metabolic Medicine at the Singapore Bioimaging Consortium in Singapore. Naiyan Chen, a postdoc at the Singapore Bioimaging Consortium and the McGovern Institute, is the lead author. It has long been known that the hypothalamus, an almond-sized structure located deep within the brain, controls appetite as well as energy expenditure, body temperature, and circadian rhythms including sleep cycles. While performing studies on glial cells in other parts of the brain, Chen noticed that the hypothalamus also appeared to have a lot of glial cell activity. Learn More: Mulling the marijuana munchies: How the brain flips the hunger switch ""I was very curious at that point what glial cells would be doing in the hypothalamus, since glial cells have been shown in other brain areas to have an influence on regulation of neuronal function,"" she says. Within the hypothalamus, scientists have identified two key groups of neurons that regulate appetite, known as AgRP neurons and POMC neurons. AgRP neurons stimulate feeding, while POMC neurons suppress appetite. Until recently it has been difficult to study the role of glial cells in controlling appetite or any other brain function, because scientists haven't developed many techniques for silencing or stimulating these cells, as they have for neurons. Glial cells, which make up about half of the cells in the brain, have many supporting roles, including cushioning neurons and helping them form connections with one another. In this study, the research team used a new technique developed at the University of North Carolina to study a type of glial cell known as an astrocyte. Using this strategy, researchers can engineer specific cells to produce a surface receptor that binds to a chemical compound known as CNO, a derivative of clozapine. Then, when CNO is given, it activates the glial cells. The MIT team found that turning on astrocyte activity with just a single dose of CNO had a significant effect on feeding behavior. ""When we gave the compound that specifically activated the receptors, we saw a robust increase in feeding,"" Chen says. ""Mice are not known to eat very much in the daytime, but when we gave drugs to these animals that express a particular receptor, they were eating a lot."" The researchers also found that in the short term (three days), the mice did not gain extra weight, even though they were eating more. Don't Miss: Obesity surgery normalizes brain opioids ""This raises the possibility that glial cells may also be modulating neurons that control energy expenditures, to compensate for the increased food intake,"" Chen says. ""They might have multiple neuronal partners and modulate multiple energy homeostasis functions all at the same time."" When the researchers silenced activity in the astrocytes, they found that the mice ate less than normal. Still unknown is how the astrocytes exert their effects on neurons. Some recent studies have suggested that glial cells can secrete chemical messengers such as glutamate and ATP; if so, these ""gliotransmitters"" could influence neuron activity. Another hypothesis is that instead of secreting chemicals, astrocytes exert their effects by controlling the uptake of neurotransmitters from the space surrounding neurons, thereby affecting neuron activity indirectly. Feng now plans to develop new research tools that could help scientists learn more about astrocyte-neuron interactions and how astrocytes contribute to modulation of appetite and feeding. He also hopes to learn more about whether there are different types of astrocytes that may contribute differently to feeding behavior, especially abnormal behavior.

In mathematical circles, the word  orthogonal  is used to define relations or objects that are non-overlapping, uncorrelated or independent. This definition is highly relevant when referring to analytical techniques as orthogonal, and, more importantly, understanding why orthogonality might be viewed as a desirable/valuable characteristic, as is often the case for technologies deployed in the development of biopharmaceuticals.   Researchers generally trust that their analytical instrumentation is producing robust, reliable and relevant results. However, in practice, it is advantageous to question and understand the factors that may impact those results, along with their potential role in influencing data interpretation. Orthogonal analytical techniques exploit different chemical or physical principles to deliver a measurement of the same parameter but via a different method, or to deliver different parameters that elucidate the same analytical challenge. The use of orthogonal analyses can therefore guide identification of the most sensitive or useful technique for a specific application, help with troubleshooting a method that is performing sub-optimally, validate or otherwise data obtained with an alternative approach, or simply boost insight and extend understanding.   To more tightly define the concept of orthogonality, let s consider two example techniques: Static Light Scattering (SLS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), both of which are applied routinely in biopharmaceutical development to measure molecular size and weight. There are clear differences in these techniques that would lead some to suggest they are orthogonal, but is this really the case? SLS generates absolute molecular weight data from measurements of the intensity of light scattered by a molecule as a function of angle, as described by the Rayleigh Theory. DLS, on the other hand, measures the size and size distribution of molecules and particles, based upon the variation in scattered intensity with time at a fixed scattering angle, as particles move under Brownian motion. However, as both techniques measure parameters via light scattering, they are both subject to certain identical limitations. A key advantage of true orthogonality is that the techniques in question are not subject to the same types of error.  So, let s compare DLS with a different sizing technique: Taylor Dispersion Analysis (TDA). Like DLS, TDA measures the hydrodynamic size of proteins and small molecules in solution; however, unlike DLS, and indeed SLS, TDA does not involve measurement of the scattering of light. TDA is a microcapillary flow technique that works by measuring the time-evolved concentration profile of a nanoliter-volume sample pulse injected into a laminar flow of matched buffer. The changing concentration of the solute is detected by ultraviolet area imaging.  TDA is a mass-weighted technique, since concentration measurements are dependent simply on the amount of material present. As a result, TDA size measurements are unaffected by the presence of a small amount of higher oligomers/aggregates. In contrast, DLS measurements are a function of the intensity with which molecules scatter light, which is related to size to the power six. This makes DLS very sensitive to the presence of larger aggregates, which can be ideal if you want to detect the presence of low levels of larger species, but less helpful if you are trying to analyze a mixture of smaller and larger particles. Here, TDA can be the better option, highlighting the complementary nature of the two techniques (see Figure 1).Figure 1. The presence of insulin hexamers can make it difficult for DLS to detect and size the smaller insulin species present, which in contrast are accurately detected and quantified via the orthogonal technique of TDA The preceding example demonstrates the approach of playing to the strengths of different techniques to access an optimized dataset   in this case, size data. However, the real value of orthogonal techniques lies in their ability to  round out  or balance the picture of the sample, to provide fuller insight and more complete understanding. This approach is perfectly illustrated by the complementary application of DLS along with a different technique, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), in thermal stability studies. Ensuring the stability of a biological formulation is crucial in maximizing its efficacy, safety and shelf-life. Thermal stability studies allow direct comparison of the inherent stability of different drug candidates, rather than just their response to temperature, and are a routine activity in early stage formulation development. As previously mentioned, the attributes of DLS make it an extremely sensitive technique for detecting aggregates. DSC, in contrast, detects unfolding of the protein structure, which may be a direct cause of instability in its own right, or a precursor to aggregation. DSC instrumentation measures changes in enthalpy and specific heat capacity resulting from a reaction or molecular change, by comparing the power input required to drive up the temperature of two cells, one containing the sample, the other containing a reference. The resulting data can be used to develop a complete thermodynamic profile for a sample, which will assist in understanding the factors which affect its biomolecular conformation and stability.  The principles underpinning these two methods of analysis mean that as with TDA, DSC can be classified as truly orthogonal to DLS.   Thermal stability studies using DLS and DSC both involve the application of a temperature ramp to quantify the ease with which events associated with instability occur. DSC determines the melting transition or thermal transition midpoint (TM). In solution, a protein is in equilibrium between its native (folded) and unfolded state. TM marks the point at which the populations of unfolded and native protein are present in equal proportions, and higher values are associated with more stable drug candidates which are less prone to unfolding. DLS, on the other hand, generates values for Tagg - the temperature at which aggregates are first detected. Higher values are associated with better stability here, too. These simple examples all serve to demonstrate the value and power of orthogonality in an analytical strategy. By utilizing orthogonal techniques, researchers can maximize the secure application of all analytical results generated. More importantly, they can look at the behavior of their biological samples from a variety of angles to ensure a comprehensive understanding. Testing a sample by various orthogonal techniques is a proven and robust strategy for securing the knowledge to progress rapidly to a safe and efficacious product.Figure 2.

The fiber, which is as bendable as a rope of licorice, may one day be implanted in the body to deliver therapeutic pulses of light or light up at the first sign of disease. The researchers say the fiber may serve as a long-lasting implant that would bend and twist with the body without breaking down. The team has published its results online in the journal Advanced Materials. Using light to activate cells, and particularly neurons in the brain, is a highly active field known as optogenetics, in which researchers deliver short pulses of light to targeted tissues using needle-like fibers, through which they shine light from an LED source.  But the brain is like a bowl of Jell-O, whereas these fibers are like glass   very rigid, which can possibly damage brain tissues,  says Xuanhe Zhao, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor in MIT s Department of Mechanical Engineering.  If these fibers could match the flexibility and softness of the brain, they could provide long-term more effective stimulation and therapy.  Getting to the core of it Zhao s group at MIT, including graduate students Xinyue Liu and Hyunwoo Yuk, specializes in tuning the mechanical properties of hydrogels. The researchers have devised multiple recipes for making tough yet pliable hydrogels out of various biopolymers. The team has also come up with ways to bond hydrogels with various surfaces such as metallic sensors and LEDs, to create stretchable electronics. The researchers only thought to explore hydrogel s use in optical fibers after conversations with the bio-optics group at Harvard Medical School, led by Associate Professor Seok-Hyun (Andy) Yun. Yun s group had previously fabricated an optical fiber from hydrogel material that successfully transmitted light through the fiber. However, the material broke apart when bent or slightly stretched. Zhao s hydrogels, in contrast, could stretch and bend like taffy. The two groups joined efforts and looked for ways to incorporate Zhao s hydrogel into Yun s optical fiber design. Yun s design consists of a core material encased in an outer cladding. To transmit the maximum amount of light through the core of the fiber, the core and the cladding should be made of materials with very different refractive indices, or degrees to which they can bend light.  If these two things are too similar, whatever light source flows through the fiber will just fade away,  Yuk explains.  In optical fibers, people want to have a much higher refractive index in the core, versus cladding, so that when light goes through the core, it bounces off the interface of the cladding and stays within the core.  Happily, they found that Zhao s hydrogel material was highly transparent and possessed a refractive index that was ideal as a core material. But when they tried to coat the hydrogel with a cladding polymer solution, the two materials tended to peel apart when the fiber was stretched or bent. To bond the two materials together, the researchers added conjugation chemicals to the cladding solution, which, when coated over the hydrogel core, generated chemical links between the outer surfaces of both materials.  It clicks together the carboxyl groups in the cladding, and the amine groups in the core material, like molecular-level glue,  Yuk says. Sensing strain The researchers tested the optical fibers  ability to propagate light by shining a laser through fibers of various lengths. Each fiber transmitted light without significant  attenuation, or fading. They also found that fibers could be stretched over seven times their original length without breaking. Now that they had developed a highly flexible and robust optical fiber, made from a hydrogel material that was also biocompatible, the researchers began to play with the fiber s optical properties, to see if they could design a fiber that could sense when and where it was being stretched. They first loaded a fiber with red, green, and blue organic dyes, placed at specific spots along the fiber s length. Next, they shone a laser through the fiber and stretched, for instance, the red region. They measured the spectrum of light that made it all the way through the fiber, and noted the intensity of the red light. They reasoned that this intensity relates directly to the amount of light absorbed by the red dye, as a result of that region being stretched. In other words, by measuring the amount of light at the far end of the fiber, the researchers can quantitatively determine where and by how much a fiber was stretched.    When you stretch a certain portion of the fiber, the dimensions of that part of the fiber changes, along with the amount of light that region absorbs and scatters, so in this way, the fiber can serve as a sensor of strain,  Liu explains.  This is like a multistrain sensor through a single fiber,  Yuk adds.  So it can be an implantable or wearable strain gauge.  The researchers imagine that such stretchable, strain-sensing optical fibers could be implanted or fitted along the length of a patient s arm or leg, to monitor for signs of improving mobility. Zhao envisions the fibers may also serve as sensors, lighting up in response to signs of disease.  We may be able to use optical fibers for long-term diagnostics, to optically monitor tumors or inflammation,  he says.  The applications can be impactful.   Hydrogel fibers are very interesting and provide a compelling direction for embedding light within the human body,  says Fiorenzo Omenetto, a professor of biological engineering at Tufts University, who was not involved in the work.  These efforts in optimizing and managing the physical and mechanical properties of fibers are necessary and important next steps that will enable practical applications of medical relevance.

They are a leading cause of sepsis and account for many cases of pneumonia and post-surgical infections. Despite the urgency of this situation, the antibiotic development pipeline is dwindling and multi-drug resistance is rampant, rendering the classical one-bug, one-drug approach obsolete. The ability of staphylococcal and streptococcal bacteria to cause disease is due to numerous virulence factors, among which a group called Superantigens play a prominent role. Several dozen superantigens are highly lethal in humans and are critical contributors to sepsis and progression to toxic shock. While the inflammatory immune response is essential to protecting humans against viruses and bacteria, superantigen toxins cause an exaggerated response -- called an  immune storm  --  that can do a great deal of damage in the body and can result in multiple organ failure. Even with currently available treatment strategies, most of these diseases have high mortality rates. Complicating treatment of these bacterial infections are multi-drug resistant strains. Now, in a landmark research paper culminating 20 years of scientific investigation, researchers at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem show for the first time how bacterial superantigen toxins work and how antagonists they designed can block toxin action and save lives. In the paper that was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the researchers describe a novel host-oriented therapeutic approach for preventing lethal immune responses. With major implications for medicine, the novel approach is both broad-acting and impervious to bacterial antibiotic resistance.  Prof. Raymond Kaempfer, the Dr. Philip M. Marcus Professor of Molecular Biology and Cancer Research at the Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada (IMRIC), in the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine, explains:  Rather than targeting the bacterial pathogens, which can then mutate to develop antibiotic resistance, host-oriented therapeutics have the advantage of remaining effective even against infections with antibiotic-resistant strains. This is because before the pathogens can cause severe disease, they must also pass through the same receptor bottleneck in the immune response, which we can block effectively.  A normal immune response is mediated by an antigen through the joining of cells through well-known receptors on their surface, a process that is helped by the so-called ""costimulatory"" receptors. Unexpectedly, the superantigen strongly promotes the interaction between the major costimulatory receptors, B7-2 and CD28, and this turns out to be critical for its ability to elicit an immune storm. Formation of the costimulatory axis was already known to be important for a full immune response, but the present findings propel this axis to the foreground as a key bottleneck. It was already shown by the same team that a superantigen must bind CD28 in order to do its harm but the mechanism underlying this need remained obscure. The researchers now show that in order to enhance B7-2/CD28 receptor engagement, superantigen molecules bind directly to both receptors. By binding not only CD28 but also its coligand B7-2 directly, superantigens potently enhance the B7-2/CD28 interaction, inducing thereby T-cell hyperactivation. Bacterial superantigens thus induce the pathogenic immune storm by strongly enhancing formation of the B7-2/CD28 costimulatory axis. Insight into this mechanism led the researchers to design new peptides   snippets of the human B7-2 receptor protein   that powerfully block the binding of a superantigen to its costimulatory receptor targets, and thereby protect against lethal toxic shock, as they showed in animals. Each peptide mimics a small part of the site in B7-2 where the superantigen must bind. Acting as a decoy of the intact receptor, such a peptide will bind the superantigen toxin and thereby block its access to the receptor needed for toxicity.  The strategy of using peptides that mimic regions of a human immune receptor, to put the brakes on the excessive inflammatory response triggered by superantigen toxins, is a host-oriented strategy that is broadly effective against the diverse family of superantigens,  said Prof. Raymond Kaempfer. Dr. Alan S. Cross, Professor of Medicine at University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research, shared his input: ""This is a major conceptual breakthrough in our understanding of infection and immune disease mechanisms and may have implications for novel approaches to the treatment of other diseases characterized by cytokine storm. The approach of targeting a host response required by a pathogen to cause disease rather than targeting the microbial pathogen is gaining wide support in the medical community.""","Published: October 18, 2016"

Some people who experience these diverse symptoms have elevated levels of tryptase   a protein in the blood often associated with allergic reactions. Multiple copies of the alpha tryptase gene drive these tryptase elevations and may contribute to the symptoms, according to a new study led by investigators at NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Other studies have indicated that four to six percent of the general public has high tryptase levels. While not all of these people experience symptoms, many do, raising the possibility that this mildly prevalent trait in some cases drives the symptoms, although how it does so remains unclear.  This work suggests that multiple alpha tryptase gene copies might underlie health issues that affect a substantial number of people,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  Identifying one genetic cause for high tryptase opens the door for us to develop strategies for diagnosing and treating people carrying this genetic change.  Previously, NIAID researchers had observed that a combination of chronic and sometimes debilitating symptoms, such as hives, irritable bowel syndrome and overly flexible joints, runs in some families and is associated with high tryptase levels. Many affected family members with high tryptase also reported symptoms consistent with disorders of autonomic nervous system function (dysautonomia), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is characterized by dizziness, faintness and an elevated heartbeat when standing up. In the current study, which appears online in Nature Genetics, the scientists describe how they identified a genetic cause of high tryptase by studying these severely affected families. Initial analyses pointed the researchers to the alpha tryptase gene, and they designed a novel laboratory test to detect the number of alpha tryptase gene copies. Analysis of 96 affected and 41 unaffected members from 35 families confirmed that all affected family members had inherited multiple copies of the alpha tryptase gene. Laboratory experiments suggested that the additional copies were leading to increased production and release of alpha tryptase protein from immune cells. Moreover, the scientists found that additional gene copies were associated with more severe effects. Family members with three copies of the alpha tryptase gene had higher tryptase levels and reported experiencing more symptoms than those who had two copies.  These families had gone for years without a medical diagnosis, and many had been told that some of their symptoms were  all in your head.  These results not only provide a genetic explanation for the combination of symptoms that these patients experience, but also point the way to a potential solution,  said Joshua Milner, M.D., chief of the Genetics and Pathogenesis of Allergy Section in NIAID s Laboratory of Allergic Diseases and the senior author of the study.  If we can devise a way to block alpha tryptase, we might be able to alleviate some or all of the symptoms related to elevated tryptase levels. The researchers next investigated this genetic change in a general population. They assessed a group of NIH patients who had their DNA sequenced for reasons unrelated to tryptase, as well as a group of healthy unrelated volunteers from the ClinSeq study   172 people in total. To the scientists  surprise, all those with high blood levels of tryptase also had duplications of the alpha tryptase gene. Many people with the duplicate gene reported experiencing symptoms similar to those seen in the original group of severely affected families, including irritable bowel syndrome, skin flushing and itching.  The families we originally studied may be among the more severely affected on a spectrum of disease, while some people with alpha tryptase gene duplications experience few or mild symptoms,  noted Jonathan Lyons, M.D., an assistant clinical investigator in NIAID s Laboratory of Allergic Diseases and the first author of the paper.  Additionally, it s important to note that many people with normal tryptase levels also suffer from these problems. We hope that our study opens the door for future work to understand the cause of their symptoms as well.  Although more research is needed to understand how elevated tryptase contributes to this constellation of symptoms, this study helps set the stage for future advances in diagnosis and treatment. For example, further development of the laboratory test to detect alpha tryptase gene copies eventually could lead to a diagnostic test that could be used clinically to identify people with this genetic change. The scientists also are planning to develop strategies to block alpha tryptase, which potentially could ease the health problems associated with additional copies of the gene. Meanwhile, people who suspect they may have this syndrome should work with their doctors to manage their symptoms, noted Dr. Milner. The study was supported by NIAID and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both components of NIH. Additional funding came from contract number HHSN261200800001E from NIH s National Cancer Institute; grant number HL024136 from NIH s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; and ARTrust/The Mastocytosis Society.

""There is no doubt that desalination is a blessing. However, we need to be mindful of unintended consequences,"" says Dr. Aron Troen from the Hebrew University s Institute of Biochemistry, Food Science and Nutrition, in the Robert H. Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment. ""Desalination removes minerals from the water and could conceivably diminish intake of minerals such as iodine that serve as essential micronutrients,"" he adds. His recent study, published on Public Health Nutrition, assessed the relationship between iodine intake and thyroid function in an area where drinking water is supplied from iodine-poor desalinated water. It found a surprisingly high prevalence of insufficient iodine intake and a strong association of thyroid dysfunction among adults with low intake of iodine. The study was conducted in the city of Ashkelon on the southern Mediterranean coast of Israel   a country with the highest percentage of desalinated water consumption in the world, where five desalination plants produce about 50 percent of its water.   In collaboration with Dr. Dov Gefel of Barzilai University Medical Center in Ashkelon and PhD student Yaniv Ovadia, the researchers used an Iodine Food Frequency Questionnaire to model the effect of depleting iodine content in drinking water on the distribution of iodine intake. Thyroid function was rigorously assessed by clinical examination, ultrasound and blood tests, including serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and autoimmune antibodies. ""Our estimated intake data are supported by significant associations of intake with a diagnosis of iodine deficiency disorders and with elevated thyroglobulin, a putative biomarker of inadequate intake,"" says Dr. Troen. With surging population growth and water scarcity worldwide, seawater desalination is increasingly used to meet increased demand for water. ""The increasing reliance on desalination could contribute to an increase in iodine deficiency disorders, which raises a nutritional and public health issue of a major global concern,"" says Dr. Troen. ""This research supports the urgent need to probe the impact of desalinated water on thyroid health in Israel and elsewhere,"" concludes Dr. Troen. Iodine deficiency is the single most important cause of preventable mental and intellectual deficiency worldwide. ""Luckily, any problems with iodine nutrition that might emerge from desalination can be easily and inexpensively remedied by the iodization of table salt,"" explains Dr. Troen. ""Unlike magnesium, the solution is relatively straightforward - to iodize salt, provided there is legislation for routine population surveillance for iodine intake to ensure that salt iodization does not lead to excessive intake.""","Published: October 18, 2016"

The partnership aims to investigate non-invasive specimen preparation techniques, which will facilitate the use of Arquer s MCM5-ELISA test in a wider range of cancers. Arquer s MCM5-ELISA is a simple, non-invasive test, which has been developed to accurately diagnose both bladder and prostate cancer. The test works by detecting the presence of minichromosome maintenance complex component 5 (MCM5) protein, a marker for the presence of dividing cancer cells, in urine. MCM proteins are directly involved in cell replication, and are shed into urine by both prostate and bladder tumours. Through the partnership with the University of Sunderland, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Arquer aims to identify the optimal conditions for processing various samples collected using different collection methods to assist in the preparation of a clinical feasibility study in a wider range of cancers. As part of the collaboration, the University will be carrying out in vitro work, using cell lines, to optimise non-invasive sample collection methods which may be compatible with the MCM5-ELISA. Arquer will supply the MCM5-ELISA tests to enable the University to test the effectiveness of the sampling methods. The study is expected to conclude in early 2017. Commenting on the partnership, Mr Tristan Sillars, Director of Arquer Diagnostics, said: ""As we prepare for EU regulatory submission and market launch of our MCM5-ELISA diagnostic test, we are delighted to be working with the University of Sunderland. The partnership has the potential to extend the application of MCM5-ELISA for use in a wider range of cancers, to benefit both patients and clinicians.

Bladder cancer is the seventh most common cancer in males worldwide. Every year, about 20,000 people in Japan are diagnosed with bladder cancer, of whom around 8,000 mostly men succumb to the disease. Bladder cancers can be grouped into two types: non-muscle-invasive cancers, which have a five-year survival rate of 90 percent, and muscle-invasive cancers, which have poor prognoses. The latter are normally treated with such anticancer drugs as cisplatin, but tend to become chemoresistant and, thus, spread to organs such as the lungs and liver, as well as bone. In the latest research, human bladder cancer cells labeled with luciferase were inoculated into mice, creating a xenograft bladder cancer model. The primary bladder xenograft gradually grew and, after 45 days, metastatic tumors were detected in the lungs, liver and bone. By using a microarray analysis including more than 20,000 genes for the metastatic tumors, the team discovered a three- to 25-fold increase of the metabolic enzyme aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1). They also found high levels of AKR1C1 in metastatic tumors removed from 25 cancer patients, proving that the phenomena discovered in the mice also occur in the human body. Along with anticancer drugs, an inflammatory substance produced around the tumor, such as interleukin-1 , increased the enzyme levels. The researchers also identified for the first time that AKR1C1 enhances tumor-promoting activities and proved that the enzyme blocks the effectiveness of cisplatin and other anticancer drugs. The researchers finally discovered that inoculating flufenamic acid, an inhibitory factor for AKR1C1, into cancerous bladder cells suppressed the cells  invasive activities and restored the effectiveness of anticancer drugs. Flufenamic acid is also known as a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug used for treating common colds. The team s discovery is expected to spur clinical tests aimed at improving prognoses for bladder cancer patients. In the latest cancer treatments, expensive molecular-targeted drugs are used, putting a large strain on both the medical economy and the state coffers.  This latest research could pave the way for medical institutions to use flufenamic acid a much cheaper cold drug which has unexpectedly been proven to be effective at fighting cancers,  says Dr. Shinya Tanaka of the research group.

Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence. The meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.  Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,  said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin.  We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.  Liu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes. But taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team s meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not. The greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or  good,  cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit. In general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn t depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in  dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.  The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate   a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,  Lin said.  Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn t be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.  The authors therefore concluded,  Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.

Leukaemia is cancer of the blood and it has one of the highest cancer mortality rates. This is partly because there is a high relapse rate, as some cancer cells can survive the initial treatment. These surviving cells are often resistant to treatment, allowing the cancer to spread and become fatal. How these treatment-resistant cells survive initial chemotherapy is not well understood. One popular theory has been that they sit hiding in specific niches within the bone marrow that usually harbour blood stem cells   basic cells that can become all other blood cells. However, new research in mice, and validated with human samples, has revealed that certain leukaemia cells do not sit and hide. The research was led by a team at Imperial College London with colleagues from the Francis Crick Institute in London and the University of Melbourne in Australia, and is published in Nature. Instead, to the researchers  surprise, the cells were scattered throughout the mouse bone marrow both before and after treatment, and they were moving around rapidly. After treatment, the leukaemia cells that survived were seen moving faster than those before treatment. The researchers suggest that the act of moving itself may help the cells to survive, possibly through short-lived interactions with an array of our own cells. Study leader Dr Cristina Lo Celso from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial said:  We expected the cells that survived treatment to be sat in particular niches, but instead they are very active throughout the bone marrow. We now know that it would be ineffective to target particular niches in the bone marrow to tackle treatment-resistant leukaemia.  Now that we know that the cells don t hide, we can explore why that is and how their movement helps them to survive. Ultimately we want to find out whether we can stop the movement, and whether this could kill the treatment-resistant cells.  This research is still in its early stages, but we believe we have already gained valuable insights to open up new avenues in the development of novel, more effective leukaemia treatments.  The team s investigation into leukaemia cells  behaviour also revealed that they actively attack bone cells, which are known to support healthy blood production. The researchers believe this insight could help scientists to develop treatments to safeguard production of healthy blood cells in leukaemia patients. Study co-author Dr Delfim Duarte, also from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said:  Our study supports the idea that, at least in this leukaemia, new therapies should target the cancer cells themselves instead of the surrounding normal stromal cells to better eradicate the disease.  Dr Edwin Hawkins, who worked on the project at Imperial and is now at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, added:  Our work also suggests that protecting normal stromal bone cells from the attack of leukaemia cells can have wide implications in the support of healthy blood cell production. Keeping blood cell levels up would prevent anemia, infection and bleeding.  To investigate the working of leukaemia at the cellular level, the team used a technique called intravital microscopy that allows high-resolution fast imaging of live animals. The team used mice with a particularly deadly type of leukaemia called T cell acute leukaemia and tracked the movement of disease cells before and after treatment. Moreover, through collaboration with the Francis Crick Institute and the University of Melbourne, they were able to demonstrate that the findings hold true in human samples too. The research was funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, alongside contributions to buy equipment and recruit team members from the European Research Council, the Human Frontier Science Program, and the European Hematology Association. Dr Alasdair Rankin, Research Director at Bloodwise, said:  Most children and adults with acute leukaemia respond well to chemotherapy initially, but one of the biggest challenges we face is the cancer returning. Although this is early work, these significant findings reveal that stopping cancer cells moving around the bone marrow may be a more targeted way to treat acute leukaemia, and could tackle resistant disease.  Dr Emma Smith, science communications manager at Cancer Research UK, said:  Shedding light on what s happening in the bone marrow could open up new approaches to prevent leukaemia cells becoming resistant to treatment, which makes the disease much harder to treat. This interesting study could also be a starting point for developing new treatments that help leukaemia patients by restoring the normal functions of their bone marrow, such as protecting from infections.

A new study reveals that the cutting of tau by an enzyme called caspase-2 may play a critical role in the disordered brain circuit function that occurs in these diseases. Of interest, the culprit tau fragment identified in this study is actually resistant to forming aggregates, and it causes a disturbance in memory function in animal models before brain cell loss occurs. In mice genetically engineered to mimic aspects of human tauopathy disorders, the researchers restored some of the learning and memory deficits by blocking caspase-2 activity, which suggests that some of the cognitive loss seen in tauopathies might be reversible. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and published in the journal Nature Medicine.  The results of this exciting study suggest that the cognitive loss that occurs in tauopathy may be reversed by blocking the function of caspase-2,  said Roderick A. Corriveau, Ph.D., a program director at NINDS.  This motivates further investigation of caspase-2 as a novel therapeutic target for dementia.  Using a mouse model of tauopathy that produces a mutated form of human tau protein, researchers correlated memory deficits with the presence of a fragment of the tau protein. The tau fragment, which is produced when caspase-2 cuts the full-length tau protein at a specific location, was also found at higher levels in the brains of Alzheimer s disease patients compared to healthy individuals of the same age. While the standard hallmark of tauopathies is the appearance in brain tissue of large tangles of abnormal tau protein, it has recently become less clear whether the tangles of tau are actually causing cognitive decline.  In the past, many studies focused on the accumulation of tangles and their connection to memory loss,  said Karen H. Ashe, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota and senior author of this study,  but the more we learn, the less likely it seems that they are the cause of disease symptoms. The pathological fragment of tau that we have identified resists forming tangles and can instead move freely throughout the cell. Therefore, we decided to look for other mechanisms that could affect synaptic function.  To do this, Dr. Ashe s group used fluorescent labeling to track and compare the behavior of normal and mutated tau in cultured neurons from the rat hippocampus, the brain region most associated with learning and memory. Unlike normal tau, both mutated tau and the short fragment produced when caspase-2 cuts tau were primarily found within structures called dendritic spines, where neurons receive inputs from neighboring cells. The overabundance of mutated tau, including the caspase-2-produced fragment, caused disruptions in synaptic function in the spines. The impact on synapses was specific, with no observed effects on the overall structure or survival of the neurons.    It appears that abnormally processed tau is disrupting the ability of neurons to properly respond to the signals that they receive, producing memory deficits independent of tangle formation,  said Dr. Ashe.  Because this effect is occurring without cell death or a loss of synapses, we have a better chance of intervening in the process and hopefully reversing symptoms of the disease.  Dr. Ashe and her team are now planning additional experiments to uncover the mechanisms by which abnormally processed mutant tau produces memory deficits.","Published: October 18, 2016"

Systems medicine is a new interdisciplinary research area which is gaining ground in medical science. Long story short the purpose of the research is to investigate the systems that form the foundation for the development of diseases. The research looks at the body as a whole and considers a large number of factors from biochemistry and reprofiling to influences from lifestyle and environment when trying to map out the entire pathological picture. Systems medicine is a new and modern way of understanding diseases. Traditionally, medical science has focused exclusively on one disease and for example tried to connect it to a specific gene. Systems medicine focuses on the entire pathological picture. In order to make this possible it is necessary to have an overall approach to the patient where all of the things that could influence the disease pattern is mapped out: genes, molecular and biochemical circumstances, environment, background, lifestyle and physical condition. All of these data combined give a more adequate picture of the systems that trigger diseases   this can either be one isolated disease or several diseases occurring with the same patient.  Better insight in the behaviour of the disease The systematic approach is especially necessary when working with chronically ill patients where doctors might have difficulties in diagnosing, mapping out and treating several overlapping diseases. If a patient has a number of diseases at once, it can be difficult to determine the source of the disease. It is also challenging to find out whether or not there is a main disease which is causing the development of the other diseases, or if there are any other underlying common factors that trigger the diseases. The systematic approach can be helpful in clarifying whether the diseases have a common cause and map out the mechanism and course of the disease. Treatmentwise it is beneficial to shed some light on the course of the disease. If you succeed in separating the common causes and the complications it is possible to concentrate the treatment more efficiently and to avoid treating in vain. We need insight into the behaviour of the disease and we can acquire that by using the large amount of data available about each specific patient. That is one of the fundamental ideas within the area. SUND is leading within systems medicine Today, SUND is one of the leading institutions of research working goal oriented with systems medicine. That is possible because we have the resources to do so: we have the most talented scientists, the best technique and the financial capacity. Professor S ren Brunak, who is also the man behind the previously mentioned review, is one of the pioneers within bioinformatics and is working determinately with systems biology and systems medicine. No more than 50 years ago it was not normal to gather data to the extent we do now. Today we have access to the data required to work with systematic medicine. Today we have the possibility and the technology to help us collect, save and analyse data. At the same time, it is possible to save molecular data which can help us sequence human DNA.","Published: October 18, 2016"

In recent years, research has shown that some coral reef fish may be able to adapt, at least some aspects of their physiology, to cope with the rapidly rising ocean temperatures. But a new study is now arousing interest. The study combined several different experiments, including one in which the fish, as a novel approach, were able to independently choose their preferred temperature. This method differs from all previous research, which simply exposed the fish to elevated temperatures. The new study shows a more nuanced picture of the impact of ocean warming on coral reef fish, and reveals that some species have a say in whether they are going to adapt, relocate or die. For instance, the colorful blue-green damselfishes, which are found on most tropical coral reefs, struggle to adjust to elevated temperatures. But when given the slightest chance, they choose to relocate to cooler waters where they can remain healthy. ""When fish have to deal with increased temperature, there are physical consequences. They need more energy to cope, and they may not be able to handle stress or reproduce or even grow,"" says Adam Habary, a marine biologist and previous student at University of Copenhagen. ""But when they find areas with the temperatures that they've evolved to be in over thousands of years, then they can mitigate the impact of increasing temperatures and not sacrifice critical physiological processes,"" says scientist Jacob Johansen of The University of Texas at Austin. Adam Habary and a group of international scientists from the University of Copenhagen, University of Texas at Austin, and James Cook University, collaborated on the just-published study titled ""Adapt, move or die   how will tropical coral reef fishes cope with ocean warming?"" Marine fish are faced with a tough decision. Ocean warming is occurring at such a rapid rate that they will need to rapidly adapt or move to avoid death. Most prior research has focused on the capacity for animals to adapt to increasing temperatures, given that animals have adapted to changes in temperature in the past. However, previous adaptations happened at evolutionary timescales, about 1 degree Celsius temperature change per million years. Global climate change is occurring at a much faster rate, with sea surface temperature predicted to increase 2 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. But what if fish moved? In fact, what if entire ecosystems were capable of moving to the cooler temperatures, toward the poles or to deeper water? There is already evidence that many coral reef fish and pelagic fish such as tuna are moving in response to warmer ocean waters, and that this is beginning to affect global fisheries, says Johansen. Picking up and moving may not be the silver bullet for some species, particularly those coral reef fish that are dependent on reefs for habitat. Corals cannot move pole-ward as fast as the temperature increases are predicted to happen, so the fish will have to save their own skin, so to speak, by seeking cooler-deeper water, notes Professor John Fleng Steffensen from University of Copenhagen.  Ocean warming does not occur as a steady slide upward on the thermometer. Unfortunately, it often occurs as severe and increasingly frequent heating events. It is these transient periods that are causing the most damage. This was seen in the spring of 2016 on the Great Barrier Reef, when temperatures rose as much as 4 degrees Celsius for several weeks, causing widespread coral bleaching and severe physiological stress in many fish.","Published: October 18, 2016"

In mice and roundworm adding the substance can both extend life and postpone the onset of aging processes. New research conducted at the Center for Healthy Aging and the American National Institute of Health shows that this new knowledge will eventually be able to help patients with Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease.  As we live longer and longer, a lot of people are occupied with their state of health and, not least, quality of life in old age. Therefore, researchers all over the world are trying to understand aging mechanisms, as this knowledge may eventually help to postpone physical aging and extend life. None of the existing explanations of physical aging are able to explain all the biological aspects of human aging. Substance Bridges Gap Previous research has shown that a main process in aging is the capacity of the cells to keep our genes, our DNA, more or less intact. However, changes in the cells  power stations, the mitochondria, also affect aging processes. An international team of researchers from the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen and the National Institute of Health in the United States has shown that the substance NAD+ bridges the gap between two main aging theories   repairs to the DNA and poor functioning mitochondria. The results have just been published in the leading journal Cell Metabolism.  Our new study shows an age-dependent decrease in the level of NAD+, and this decrease is far greater for organisms with early aging and a lack of DNA repairs. We were surprised to see that adding NAD+ postponed both the aging processes of the cells and extended life in worms and in a mouse model , says Professor Vilhelm Bohr from the Center for Healthy Aging and the National Institute of Health. The researchers have bred mice and roundworm with the illness Ataxia telangiectasia, A-T, for the purpose of the study. In A-T patients the part of the brain that is responsible for coordination gradually degenerates, DNA repairs are lacking, and they experience other symptoms characteristic of early aging. Adding NAD+ Postpones Aging  We know from previous studies that a drop in the level of NAD+ results in metabolism errors, neurodegeneration and aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear to us. Our new study stresses that the substance NAD+ plays a main role both in maintaining the health of the cells  power stations and in their capacity for repairing the genes , says Professor Vilhelm Bohr. The study also indicates that damage to the DNA can result in poor functioning mitochondria, and that this can lead to increasing neurodegeneration in A-T patients. Adding the substance NAD+ can stop the damage to the mitochondria.","Published: October 18, 2016"

The question of whether there s a causal link between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes has been unclear. In recent studies, Yale professor of medicine and investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gerald Shulman have identified factors that cause the normal function of insulin in the liver to go awry in NAFLD. A new study pinpoints the final link between NAFLD and the changes in insulin and blood sugar that give rise to type 2 diabetes. In this new study Shulman and his colleagues identified a single amino acid in the insulin receptor that undergoes phosphorylation (a process by which phosphate is added to an amino acid), causing liver insulin resistance in rodent models of NAFLD.  We were able to demonstrate the importance of this amino acid in causing liver insulin resistance associated with NAFLD by mutating this threonine amino acid to an alanine, which cannot undergo phosphorylation, and found that we could prevent hepatic insulin resistance despite the presence of fatty liver disease,  Shulman said. This latest finding gets scientists a step closer to developing new therapies for type 2 diabetes that target the root molecular cause of insulin resistance, as opposed to virtually all current antidiabetic medications which lower blood glucose concentrations without reversing insulin resistance, he noted.","Published: October 18, 2016"

This comprehensive transaction will provide the Company with a clean balance sheet and sufficient capital to achieve its planned expansion. Transgenomic has filed to complete a reverse stock split of between one-for-ten and one-for-thirty before the merger closes, and the company s outstanding debt is expected to convert into common and preferred shares. The companies expect that shares of the combined company will be listed on the NASDAQ exchange and trade under the  PRPO  ticker (subject to filing and approval by NASDAQ). The merger agreement provides that, Ilan Danieli, Precipio founder and Chief Executive Officer, will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. BV Advisory Partners is acting as advisor to the transaction. Paul Kinnon, Transgenomic President and Chief Executive Officer, said  In recent years we have transitioned from a provider of conventional life science tools and diagnostic services into an innovative biotechnology enterprise focused on advancing precision medicine. We have done this through our revolutionary ICE COLD-PCR (ICP) technology, which enables accurate, non-invasive tumor profiling using circulating DNA in patient plasma. We have established a solid platform for commercialization of ICP, with leading global distributors and a solid pipeline of potential agreements with partners and customers. This is a good time to join forces with Precipio, which shares our commitment to accurate and timely advanced cancer diagnostics and has established an impressive infrastructure of academic experts and a growing customer base, validated by successful case studies. I look forward to working with my new colleagues to ensure a successful transition.  Ilan Danieli, Precipio founder and Chief Executive Officer, said  We are proud of Precipio s progress in building a growing platform that provides unique services to cancer patients and their physicians by providing a demonstrated superior level of diagnostic accuracy, ensuring that patients receive the best possible treatment. Cancer misdiagnosis is an all too common and underappreciated problem, which frequently has a negative impact on patient treatment, and may cause needless loss of life. We provide both primary and second opinion screening, and our network of leading academic cancer researchers and advanced diagnostic technologies have proven to be an invaluable resource for patients and physicians. Our entire team is committed to ensuring that our services are made widely available. To that end we will continue building out our sales team to accelerate adoption and revenue growth. We believe Transgenomic s ICP technology and commercial infrastructure fit well with our values and our business model, and look forward to this next stage of growth, as we work together to integrate our teams, technologies and services.  Keith Barksdale, Founder of BV Advisory Partners, commented,  Transgenomic and Precipio have complementary strengths with the potential to be a dynamic and strong competitor in the rapidly growing market for advanced cancer diagnostics. ICP is a revolutionary mutation detection technology that is now available through global distributors, and adoption by drug researchers and developers is ramping up. The technology is also available to help guide cancer diagnosis and treatment through Transgenomic s CLIA laboratory. Precipio s platform of leading academic cancer experts provides superior diagnostic accuracy level to oncologists and their patients; it represents a unique resource that can benefit from and leverage the power of ICE COLD-PCR. We look forward to working with the combined company going forward to help assure its growth and success.  Transgenomic s ICE COLD-PCR offers major advantages over current sequencing technologies. It delivers at least a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to standard methodologies, allowing detection of both known and previously unknown genetic alterations in any exon of any gene using a single assay. It is robust, easy to use and easily implemented, requiring minimal disruption to established sequencing workflows. It is available as ICEme  Kits that deliver up to a 500-fold increase in mutation detection compared to most current methods, with levels of detection routinely achievable down to 0.01%. This ultra-high sensitivity enables detection of low level mutations and allows accurate patient monitoring as well as stratification of cancer sub-populations. ICEme Kits are compatible with most patient samples, including tissue, blood, plasma, urine and other biofluids. The kits are simple to use and work with most of the genomic analysis platforms available in laboratories today. They are easily customizable for use with single mutations or multiple mutations in combination. The current menu includes approximately 20 clinically relevant, actionable mutations that are associated with important cancers. The ICP range of mutation targets is being expanded on an ongoing basis. ICE COLD-PCR was originally developed by the laboratory of Dr. Mike Makrigiorgos at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which has exclusively licensed rights to the technology exclusively to Transgenomic.","Published: October 18, 2016"

Although these attributes provide adaptive value in enabling individuals to gain importance in the world, including independence from parents, if taken too far, this tendency could lead to potentially dangerous behavior, including drug use, harmful drinking, addiction, unsafe sex, and risky driving, which may result in unintended injuries, violence and/or even premature death. See Also: How the brain balances risk-taking and learning A new Dartmouth College study just published in Current Biology demonstrates for the first time, the causal relationship between behavioral control and a specific imbalance in brain function that exists during adolescence. Adolescent-specific behavior may be driven by an imbalance in activity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area of the brain involved in cognitive control and inhibition, which does not fully develop until the late teens/early 20s, and the nucleus accumbens (NAC), which plays a central role in reward-seeking and addiction. Past research has found that adolescents that engage in risk-taking behavior have trouble inhibiting such behavior as compared to either adults or pre-adolescents. Researchers have postulated that the low activity in PFC with concurrent high activity in NAC, an imbalance which appears to exist only during adolescence, is essentially at odds with each other. To test the causal imbalance, Heidi Meyer, a graduate student working in Professor David Bucci's Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Laboratory at Dartmouth, used a chemogenetic approach, known as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), to simulate the imbalance that takes place during adolescence by simultaneously altering the activity in PFC and NAC. DREADDs enables researchers to ""remotely control"" the activity of brain cells by temporarily turning cells off or on in a region for a short period of time, by injecting a virus that transfers genes for a synthetic receptor, which is only responsive to a synthetic drug that is also administered through a simple injection, which turns brain cells off or on temporarily. Learn More: This is your teen's brain behind the wheelFor the study, researchers used adult rats, which normally have balanced activity in these areas and used the DREADD approach to decrease the activity in PFC and simultaneously increase activity in NAC while the rats learned an inhibition task. A tone presented by itself signaled to the rats that a food reward would be delivered; however, a light preceding the tone indicated that there would be no food reward. Past studies on inhibition have typically examined reactive inhibition or the ability to stop a response once it has been initiated; yet, Dartmouth's study tested proactive inhibition or the ability to withhold an inappropriate response in the first place. The rats that were treated with the DREADD approach exhibited a dramatic delay in learning to inhibit their response to the tone when it was preceded by the light, requiring twice the amount of training to learn the behavior. The delay in learning this inhibitory response matched the delay that the researchers observed in normal adolescent rats during an earlier study. The new findings also illustrate how this form of proactive inhibition is age-dependent, which is consistent with the researchers' previous work on how inhibition is impaired during adolescence.

Using two separate samples from the study one of about 9,000 people and one of about 12,500 researchers looked at aging adults over a six-year period.

The body mass of these people predicted their cognitive decline through their levels of systemic inflammation."" The findings support existing literature linking inflammation to cognitive decline and take it a step further by illuminating the important role of body mass in the equation. Sbarra added a word of caution in trying to understand the findings. ""The findings provide a clear and integrative account of how BMI is associated with cognitive decline through systemic inflammation, but we need to remember that these are only correlational findings,"" he said. ""Of course, correlation does not equal causation. The findings suggest a mechanistic pathway, but we cannot confirm causality until we reduce body mass experimentally, then examine the downstream effects on inflammation and cognition.""

Fibromyalgia is commonly defined as chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety and mood disorders. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that fibromyalgia affects more than five million adults annually in the U.S., with significantly higher occurrence rates in women than in men. See Also: Fighting pain through knowledge about sensory organs in the fingertipsHistorically, fibromyalgia has been difficult to diagnose and treat due to a lack of a well-categorized tissue pathology and symptoms that overlap with other common chronic illnesses. CU Boulder researchers used functional MRI scans (fMRI) to study brain activity in a group of 37 fibromyalgia patients and 35 control patients as they were exposed to a variety of non-painful visual, auditory and tactile cues as well as painful pressure. The multisensory testing allowed the researchers to identify a series of three sub-markers, or neurological patterns, that correlated with the hypersensitivity to pain that characterizes fibromyalgia. ""The novelty of this study is that it provides potential neuroimaging-based tools that can be used with new patients to inform about the degree of certain neural pathology underlying their pain symptoms,"" said Marina L pez-Sol , a post-doctoral researcher in CU Boulder's Cognitive and Affective Control Laboratory and lead author of the new study. ""The set of tools may be helpful to identify patient subtypes, which may be important for adjusting treatment selection on an individualized basis."" The findings were recently published in the journal Pain, published by the International Association for the Study of Pain. ""Though many pain specialists have established clinical procedures for diagnosing fibromyalgia, the clinical label does not explain what is happening neurologically and it does not reflect the full individuality of patients' suffering,"" said Tor Wager, director of the Cognitive and Affective Control Laboratory.

While more research remains to be done, there s good reason to suspect that this test could be used to predict many other diseases of old age, said Mark Davis, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. A paper describing the test was published online Oct. 13 in Cell Systems. Davis is the senior author. Lead authorship is shared by former postdoctoral scholars Shai Shen-Orr, PhD, who is now an assistant professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, and David Furman, PhD, now a consulting associate professor at Stanford. Mounting evidence suggests that many diseases that become more common with advancing age do so because the immune system begins to malfunction, said Davis, a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator and the director of Stanford s Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection. In addition to responding more sluggishly to dangers such as infectious pathogens or incipient tumors, the aging immune system tends to spend its downtime   periods when it has no imminent challenge to respond to   in a low-grade inflammatory state. Medical experts are increasingly convinced that this constantly thrumming, systemic, inflammatory activity threatens diverse tissues throughout the body. A better test? Cholesterol testing, a diagnostic mainstay, flags cardiovascular risk only about half of the time, said Davis, who is also the Burt and Marion Avery Family Professor.  For too many men experiencing a heart attack or stroke, the first observed hint of cardiovascular risk is their death,  he said. Testing for levels of CRP, a circulating protein linked to inflammation, has been shown to further enhance the prediction of cardiovascular risk, even among patients with normal cholesterol levels. A CRP reading is relatively simple to get, requiring only a blood draw and relatively straightforward lab tests. The new test developed by the Stanford researchers is more complicated but appears to have superior diagnostic value to either the cholesterol or CRP test. Rather than testing circulating inflammatory proteins, it tests for the response of immune cells themselves to inflammation   a signal that appears to be more stable and hence a more robust diagnostic. In the study, it was able to detect early cardiovascular irregularities in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. The researchers took advantage of data from the first three years of what was to become a nine-year longitudinal project carried out at Stanford under the direction of study co-author Cornelia Dekker, MD, a professor of pediatric infectious disease. In all, 90 adults, divided into two groups   people younger than 40 and people older than 60   were assessed annually at high resolution with a battery of tests as to the state of their immune system, how it varied from year to year within and between individuals and how this related to clinical markers of inflammation. Isolating immune cells For the Cell Systems study, the researchers isolated several types of immune cells from individual blood samples and measured these cells  responses to stimulation by circulating signaling proteins called cytokines. Many cytokines tend to shift the immune system into high gear. The investigators recorded the extent to which several different types of immune cells mixed with cytokines in a lab dish increased the activation of intracellular substances called STAT proteins. In response to this stimulation, STAT proteins are known to undergo small chemical changes, causing them to head into a cell s nucleus and turn on batteries of genes that stir the erstwhile quiescent cell into a frenzy of immunological activity. When immune cells from young people were stimulated with certain cytokines, the activation levels of STAT proteins skyrocketed. When the same thing was done to immune cells from old people, STAT-protein activity rose a lot less. However, pre-stimulation levels of STAT-protein activation in immune cells from old people were substantially higher than in those from young people, suggesting that older people s immune systems are constantly somewhat revved up when they should be at rest. Still, older people s pre-stimulation STAT-protein activation levels, and these proteins  activation in response to cytokine stimulation, varied widely between individuals. Some showed few signs of it, while in others it was pronounced. Cytokine response score The investigators blended 15 separate cytokine-responsiveness measurements to generate a single number called a Cytokine Response Score. This measure, which varied considerably among different older adults, was quite stable from year to year for any given individual. A higher CRS is better, as it indicates a more-responsive immune system and lower background inflammation. Intriguingly, individuals taking fish-oil supplements had higher scores. (Fish oil is known to have anti-inflammatory properties.) No other drug tested showed this correlation. At the suggestion of study co-author Francois Haddad, MD, a clinical associate professor of cardiovascular medicine, the cytokine response score of each of 40 older subjects was then cross-referenced against cardiovascular-health assessments they underwent up to two years later. These assessments included a comprehensive clinical history and tests of atherosclerotic plaque, arterial stiffness and ventricular function. Of the 40 subjects, 18 were in good cardiovascular health. Ten had already suffered cardiovascular events, and seven had sufficient atherosclerosis to be considered subclinical. Five others had lesser signs of cardiovascular problems and were considered borderline. The researchers found that cytokine response scores were inversely correlated with clinical signs of atherosclerosis and with two measures associated with the heart s ability to relax between beats. Importantly, the borderline subjects also had low cytokine response scores. The scores  predictive value exceeded that of CRP tests, the current standard for measuring inflammation-based cardiovascular risk. For now, the test to obtain a cytokine response score is not available in clinics; it s too complex and expensive. Davis said he and his colleagues want to try to simplify it and drive down the cost.  The CRS may be a useful proxy for healthy aging,  said Davis.  And its predictive accuracy in cardiovascular disease further substantiates the inflammatory underpinnings of that prevalent, age-related condition. ","Published: October 17, 2016"

A new retrospective study of patient medical records suggests that men with prostate cancer who are treated with testosterone-lowering drugs are twice as likely to develop dementia within five years as prostate cancer patients whose testosterone levels are not tampered with. The study, by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, also demonstrates emerging techniques for extracting biomedical data from ordinary patient medical records. The paper describing the research was published online Oct. 13 in JAMA Oncology. Kevin Nead, MD, DPhil, a resident at the University of Pennsylvania who got his medical degree at Stanford, is the lead author. Nigam Shah, MBBS, PhD, associate professor of biomedical informatics research at Stanford, is the senior author. Testosterone can promote the growth of prostate tumors, and so clinicians have used androgen deprivation therapy to lower testosterone and other androgens in prostate cancer patients since the 1940s. In the United States, about a half-million men currently receive ADT as a treatment for prostate cancer.  The risk is real  A 2015 study by the same authors found an association between ADT and Alzheimer s disease. In the new paper, the team expanded their work to include several other forms of dementia.  When we published our last paper, a letter to the editor pointed out that Alzheimer s is often confused with vascular dementia,  said Shah.  So instead of looking for Alzheimer s and dementia separately, we decided to aggregate them into a higher-level category   all dementias and cognitive decline.  Such aggregation could minimize the question of misdiagnosis, Shah said, and increase the sample size to provide more statistical power. The team looked at deidentified records from Stanford Medicine s clinical-research data warehouse for nearly 10,000 patients with prostate cancer. Of the 1,829 who received androgen deprivation therapy, 7.9 percent developed dementia within five years, compared with 3.5 percent of those not treated with ADT.  The risk is real and, depending on the prior dementia history of the patient, we may want to consider alternative treatment, particularly in light of a recent prospective study from the U.K.,  said Shah. That study, published in September in The New England Journal of Medicine, revealed that prostate cancer patients randomized to either active monitoring, surgery or radiation therapy all had the same risk of death from the cancer after 10 years. Ninety-nine percent of men in the study survived regardless of initial treatment. These startling results suggest that active monitoring of prostate cancer patients may be as good as early radical treatment and may cause fewer side effects. And because the actual number of patients possibly at risk for dementia from androgen deprivation therapy is small, it makes sense when weighing the value of prescribing ADT to try to identify which prostate cancer patients might be vulnerable to dementia, said Shah. The new study adds to a growing body of evidence supporting Stanford Medicine s precision health approach, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill. Nead and Shah cautioned that prostate cancer patients who are receiving ADT shouldn t make changes to their medications without talking to their physicians.  I was surprised at how ubiquitous the effects on all types of dementia were, but I would definitely not alter clinical care based on our results,  Nead said. He added that he would like to see a prospective, randomized clinical trial to establish whether ADT can be more firmly linked to an increased risk of dementia and to help identify what kinds of patients might be vulnerable to that increased risk, he said. He anticipates that checking for dementia risk in people treated with ADT will be part of future randomized, clinical trials that have a larger focus. Retrospective complements prospective The new retrospective study of patient records took only a few weeks, said Shah.  We are working to make such studies as simple as a Google search,  he said.  We were down to weeks in this one, and our current efforts, which are funded by the Dean s Office, have gotten us to close to two to three days.  In contrast, a prospective, randomized clinical trial to study the same question would probably require thousands of patients, years to complete and many millions of dollars, said Kenneth Mahaffey, MD, a Stanford professor of medicine who was not involved in the study. Studies of existing patient health records are far cheaper and faster than  gold standard  randomized, clinical prospective studies. And patient health record studies offer powerful ways to identify hypotheses about efficacy and safety that are worth further testing in clinical trials, said Mahaffey, who is vice chair of clinical research in Stanford s Department of Medicine. But the lack of randomization in health record studies means the results can be misleading, cautioned Mahaffey.  This work is important,  he said,  but there are a number of examples of such retrospective studies where the results have been completely wrong.  Shah said the approach his team used minimized the chance of being wrong. For example, the authors matched patients who received ADT and those who did not according to how sick they were. They also explicitly and empirically quantified the chance of being wrong by testing associations they knew were not true, calibrating their approach. Retrospective studies of patient medical records aren t meant to replace randomized clinical trials, said Shah.  If we had infinite funding, we d do a trial for everything. But we don't have that,  he said.  These cheap, few-week studies can guide us where to point our clinical trial dollars. ","Published: October 17, 2016"

Our results further illuminate the complex processes involved in the degradation and decline of neurons, which is, of course, the essential characteristic and cause of AD,  said the study s senior author Larry Goldstein, PhD, Distinguished Professor in the Departments of Neuroscience and Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and director of both the UC San Diego Stem Cell Program and Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center at UC San Diego Health.  But beyond that, they point to a new target and therapy for a condition that currently has no proven treatment or cure.  Alzheimer s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. It affects more than 30 million people worldwide, including an estimated 5.4 million Americans. One in 10 persons over the age of 65 has AD; one in three over the age of 85. There are currently no treatments proven to cure or reduce the progression of AD.  Genetically, AD is divided into two groups: the much more common sporadic (sAD) form of the disease in which the underlying primary cause is not known and the rarer familial (fAD) form, produced by inherited genetic mutations. In both forms, the brains of AD patients feature accumulations of protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that lead to neuronal impairment and eventual cell death.  The prevailing  amyloid cascade hypothesis  posits that these plaques and tangles are comprised, respectively, of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments and tau proteins that fuel cellular stress, neurotoxicity, loss of function and cell death. There has been some evidence, however, of another disease-driver: defects in endocytic trafficking   the process by which cells package large, external molecules into vesicles or membrane-bound sacs for transport into the cell for a variety of reasons or uses.   But previous research focused on non-neuronal cells and did not examine the effects of normal expression levels of AD-related proteins, leaving it unclear to what degree decreased endocytosis and other molecular movement within cells played a causative role.  Goldstein and colleagues analyzed neurons created from induced pluripotent stem cells in which they generated PS1 and APP mutations characteristic of fAD using the emerging genome editing technologies CRISPR and TALEN. In this  disease-in-a-dish  approach, they found that the mutated neurons displayed altered distribution and trafficking of APP and internalized lipoproteins (proteins that combine with or transport fat and other lipids in blood plasma). Specifically, there were elevated levels of APP in the soma or cell body while levels were reduced in the neuronal axons.   In previous work, Goldstein s team had demonstrated that PS1 and APP mutations impaired the activity of specific cellular enzymes. In the latest work, they found that treating mutated fAD neurons with a beta-secretase inhibitor rescued both endocytosis and transcytosis (molecule movement within a cell) functions.

Genomics plc will be analysing genomes at an unprecedented scale and, together with the Company s existing knowledge base, be providing insights into human biology that will help to inform pharmaceutical R&D investment decisions. Genomics England is delivering the UK 100,000 Genomes Project   whole genome sequencing rare disease and cancer patients in the National Health Service. Genomic information has huge potential to transform drug development pipelines, and one of Genomics England s four main goals is  to enable new scientific discovery and medical insights . To that end, in 2015, it set up the GENE consortium, which included major pharmaceutical companies such as Abbvie, AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Roche, Takeda and UCB. With a focus on patients with rare diseases and cancers, over 13,000 genomes have already been sequenced and, within its secure IT infrastructure, de-identified data are being made available to Consortium participants to accelerate the development of new diagnostics and treatments for patients. The power of genomic data to gain novel biological insights grows with both the scale of the data and the breadth of associated physical and biological information. Genomics England s genetic information is increasingly linked to electronic medical records, a rich source of such phenotypic data, but one that adds many dimensions to the complexity of the analysis challenge. Understanding and using such datasets to their full potential requires an in-depth understanding of genomics, sophisticated statistical analysis approaches, creative visual representations, computationally efficient algorithmic design, a dedicated IT infrastructure, and an expert team of scientists and IT engineers. Since its formation in early 2014, Genomics plc has been building a powerful platform combining these elements along with a database of genetic and linked phenotypic data on almost 3 million individuals that seamlessly integrates results from over 700 genetic studies across over 500 phenotypes, the largest dataset of its kind in the world. It is also collaborating with major pharmaceutical companies including Biogen, Eisai, Merck and Vertex, as it applies its integrated platform across all areas of pharmaceutical R&D, including target validation, assessment of on-target safety effects and discovery of repositioning opportunities.

These are the first regional medical center enrollment sites in California, and join several other regional medical centers around the United States that were announced earlier this year. The PMI Cohort Program is a landmark longitudinal research effort that aims to engage one million or more U.S. participants to enable research that will, over time, improve the ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetics. Participants will be invited to contribute a range of data about themselves by completing questionnaires, granting access to their electronic health records, providing blood and urine samples, undergoing physical evaluations and sharing real-time information via smartphones or wearable devices. Data collected will be protected by privacy and security safeguards. A primary goal of the PMI Cohort Program is to create a national resource for researchers, including citizen scientists, to help answer important questions about a variety of health conditions.   The California Precision Medicine Consortium assembles a talented team from across California to develop a comprehensive approach that will ensure the rich demographics of the state are reflected in the cohort of one million or more people who will help advance health discoveries in the U.S.,  said Lucila Ohno-Machado, MD, PhD, a principal investigator in the California Precision Medicine Consortium and professor of medicine, chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics and associate dean for informatics and technology at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

To make ribosomes, cells need to make an abundance of amino acids (the raw material of proteins) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the energy currency required to run the ribosome). However, the assembly of functional ribosomes also requires magnesium. Yale postdoctoral fellow Mauricio Pontes has discovered a genetic  program  that enables cells to make functioning ribosomes even when magnesium is scarce. The first step involves activation of genes that inhibit ATP production. Because a large fraction of cellular magnesium is associated with ATP, a decrease in ATP levels makes magnesium available for ribosome assembly. Less ATP, however results in less energy, so fewer ribosomes are produced. However, without this program, cells create more ribosomal precursors but, lacking magnesium, they cannot produce functioning ribosomes, thereby hindering the creation of proteins.   It is a clear case of less is more,  said Eduardo Groisman, professor of microbial pathogenesis and senior author of the paper published Oct. 13 in the journal Molecular Cell.","Published: October 17, 2016"

To develop new approaches to cancer prevention, scientists have attempted to grow tumor cells from precursor states in animal models. A major deficiency in these studies, however, is that people study cancers of animals, not humans. Myeloma   a type of human cancer that forms in white blood cells   is an example of a cancer that is preceded by a condition called monoclonal gammopathy which has been impossible to study outside the human body. In a new study, Yale professors Madhav Dhodapkar, Richard Flavell, and their co-authors describe new mouse models, wherein mice carry human versions of six genes that are essential for growth of human tumor cells in these mice. They found that when the humanized mice were injected with tumor and non-tumor cells from human patients, both cell types were able to grow in their respective environments which mimic the human body. Now that it is possible to grow these human tumors and their progenitors in mice it will be feasible to understand how myeloma develops and one day to prevent it.","Published: October 17, 2016"

This could lead to a revolution in the pharmaceutical and biomedical communities, enabling researchers and companies to produce data-driven results on how protein molecules function, more easily and cheaply. 2D mass spectrometry allows chemists to explore the elemental composition and structure of a molecule by breaking it apart, and analysing its fragmented pieces   measuring mass, and gathering data on how the whole molecule functions and interacts with its environment. High numbers of molecules can be experimented on at the same time in this way, as the various fragments of different broken molecules can be modulated at the same frequencies as the molecule from which they originated. Professor O Connor and Dr van Agthoven have patented an instrument with which 2D Mass spectrometry can be performed using a linear ion trap   this is a cheaper, smaller, and much more accessible option than was previously available. The device can be added onto existing MS instruments as well as being bought with new instruments. The process is currently undertaken using large, expensive machinery, which makes it a relatively exclusive scientific activity. However, the new invention is opening up the technique to a much wider market. Mass spectrometry produces precise results during protein sequencing, and this type of data-driven biology will produce quicker, better results than are currently obtained in pharmaceutical and biomedical research. Dr van Agthoven comments that the breakthrough could have numerous and varied applications:  Two-dimensional mass spectrometry has the potential to exponentially increase our knowledge in all areas, from biochemistry to food safety and environmental chemistry.

See Also: New combination treatment strategy to 'checkmate' glioblastoma The findings, published in Cancer Cell, also present a potential alternative method for treating glioblastomas (GBM), the most common and most aggressive form of brain cancer. GBMs are extremely difficult to treat. The median survival rate is just over 14 months, with few treated patients living five years or more past diagnosis. Adult brain cancers are almost universally fatal, in part because of the biochemical composition of the central nervous system (CNS) and the blood-brain barrier, which selectively and protectively limits the passage of molecules from the body into the brain, but which also blocks most existing chemotherapies, contributing to treatment failure. This includes blocking small molecule inhibitors that target growth factor receptors, which have not proven to be effective with brain cancers, possibly due to their inability to get past the blood-brain barrier and achieve sufficiently high levels in the central nervous system. ""Researchers have been thinking about ways to deal with this problem,"" said senior author Paul S. Mischel, MD, a member of the Ludwig Cancer Research branch at UC San Diego and professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Pathology. ""We have been challenged by the fact that GBMs are among the most genomically-well characterized forms of cancer, with clear evidence of targetable driver oncogene mutations but this information has yet to benefit patients, at least in part, because the drugs designed to target these oncogenes have difficulty accessing their targets in the brain. We have been trying to find an alternative way to use this information to develop more effective treatments. Related: Epigenetic driver of glioblastoma provides new therapeutic target ""One such approach stems from the observation that oncogenes (mutated genes) can rewire the biochemical pathways of cells in ways that make them dependent on proteins that are not themselves encoded by oncogenes. Targeting these 'oncogene-induced co-dependencies' opens up a much broader pharmacopeia, including the use of drugs that aren't traditionally part of cancer drug pipelines but have better pharmacological properties."" Graphical abstract of the research. Credit: Villa GR et al., Cancer Cell, 2016.  In previous research, Mischel and others had noted GBM cells cannot synthesize cholesterol, which is vital to cell structure and function, particularly in the brain. Instead, GBM cells derive what they need from brain cells called astrocytes, which produce cholesterol in abundance. Roughly 20 percent of total body cholesterol is found in the brain. When normal cells have sufficient cholesterol, they convert some of it into molecules called oxysterols, which activate a receptor in the cell's nucleus the liver X receptor (LXR) to shut down the uptake of cholesterol. ""So when normal cells get enough cholesterol, they stop making it, stop taking it up and start pumping it out,"" said Mischel. ""We found that in GBM cells, this mechanism is completely disrupted. They're like parasites of the brain's normal cholesterol system. They steal cholesterol and don't have an off switch. They just keep gobbling the stuff up."" GBM cells ensure their cholesterol supply by suppressing the production of oxysterols, the researchers said, ensuring cells' LXRs remain inactive. The research team, including Andrew Shaiu and Tim Gahman of Ludwig's Small Molecule Development team at UC San Diego, identified an experimental metabolic disease drug candidate named LXR-623 that activates LXRs. In mouse models, LXR-623 easily crossed the blood-brain barrier to bind with LXRs in normal cells, stimulating the production of oxysterols and the reduction of cholesterol. There was no effect upon healthy neurons and other brain cells, the scientists found, but GBM cells were deprived of vital cholesterol, resulting in cell death and tumor regression. Read Next: Less is more: Modified poliovirus therapy for glioblastoma""Disrupting cholesterol import by GBM cells caused dramatic cancer cell death and shrank tumors significantly, prolonging the survival of the mice,"" said Mischel. ""The strategy worked with every single GBM tumor we looked at and even on other types of tumors that had metastasized to the brain. LXR-623 also had minimal effect on astrocytes or other tissues of the body."" Mischel suggested the GBM strategy could be implemented in clinical trials using drug-candidates under development or in early trials. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

In mice and roundworm adding the substance can both extend life and postpone the onset of aging processes. New research conducted at the Center for Healthy Aging and the American National Institute of Health shows that this new knowledge will eventually be able to help patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. See Also: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? As we live longer and longer, a lot of people are occupied with their state of health and, not least, quality of life in old age. Therefore, researchers all over the world are trying to understand aging mechanisms, as this knowledge may eventually help to postpone physical aging and extend life. None of the existing explanations of physical aging are able to explain all the biological aspects of human aging. Previous research has shown that a main process in aging is the capacity of the cells to keep our genes, our DNA, more or less intact. However, changes in the cells' power stations, the mitochondria, also affect aging processes. An international team of researchers from the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen and the National Institute of Health in the United States has shown that the substance NAD+ bridges the gap between two main aging theories repairs to the DNA and poor functioning mitochondria. The results are published in Cell Metabolism. 'Our new study shows an age-dependent decrease in the level of NAD+, and this decrease is far greater for organisms with early aging and a lack of DNA repairs. We were surprised to see that adding NAD+ postponed both the aging processes of the cells and extended life in worms and in a mouse model', says Professor Vilhelm Bohr from the Center for Healthy Aging and the National Institute of Health. Learn More: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice The researchers have bred mice and roundworm with the illness Ataxia telangiectasia, A-T, for the purpose of the study. In A-T patients the part of the brain that is responsible for coordination gradually degenerates, DNA repairs are lacking, and they experience other symptoms characteristic of early aging. 'We know from previous studies that a drop in the level of NAD+ results in metabolism errors, neurodegeneration and aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear to us. Our new study stresses that the substance NAD+ plays a main role both in maintaining the health of the cells' power stations and in their capacity for repairing the genes', says Professor Vilhelm Bohr. The study also indicates that damage to the DNA can result in poor functioning mitochondria, and that this can lead to increasing neurodegeneration in A-T patients. Adding the substance NAD+ can stop the damage to the mitochondria.

The condition may affect up to one in three people who have a major operation, causing confusion and hallucinations with the over-65s particularly at risk. The team believes the sedative may help the brain 'recover and reset' after surgery. See Also: How anesthesia's brain effects differ in older adults and in childrenPost-operative delirium usually strikes within the first two days of a person waking from general anaesthetic. The symptoms range from relatively mild, such as a person not knowing their name or where they are, to more severe, such as aggressive behavior, believing people are trying to harm them, or even hallucinations. Professor Daqing Ma, co-lead author of the new study from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said: ""Post-operative delirium is a huge challenge for the medical community - and incredibly distressing for patients and their families. In many cases patients become almost child-like, and do not understand where they are, what is happening, and become very upset. Hospital staff have also been injured by delirious patients becoming aggressive. However we currently have no treatments options available for this condition."" The causes are unknown, but one theory is that major surgery can trigger inflammation throughout the body, which in some cases can spread to the brain. The risk of the condition increases with age, and it seems to strike more often when patients undergo major, lengthy operations. The delirium can last from a few hours to a couple of days, and some research suggests it may be linked to an increased risk of elderly patients later developing dementia. In the new study, co-led by Professor Dongxin Wang at Peking University First Hospital, researchers assessed 700 patients age 65 or older who were about to undergo major surgery at the Beijing hospital. Half received a low dose of a type of sedative called dexmedetomidine after the operation, as an infusion directly into a vein in their arm, while half received a placebo salt-water infusion. Learn More: Major dopamine system helps restore consciousness after general anesthesia, study finds The patients received the infusion of sedative or placebo around an hour after surgery, and for the next 16 hours. This sedative, which is commonly used for medical procedures and in veterinary medicine, leaves a patient relaxed and drowsy, yet conscious. The drug is considered safe as it doesn't affect breathing. Both groups received the same general anaesthetic before undergoing their operation. They were then assessed for symptoms of delirium every day for a week after their procedure. The results revealed that nearly one in four patients in the placebo group 23 per cent developed delirium. However only just under one in ten patients 9 per cent who received the sedative developed the condition. Scientists are still unsure how the sedative works, but one theory is it allows the brain to rest and recover immediately after surgery, explained Professor Ma. ""Previous studies have shown that patients who struggle to sleep after their operation perhaps because they are in pain or on a busy, noisy ward - are at increased risk of delirium."" He added that the sedative dexmedetomidine seems to not only trigger sleep, but actually mimics the natural state the brain enters during sleep. ""Although other sedatives induce sleep, they do not trigger the natural 'sleep state' the brain requires to rest, reset, and recover."" Professor Ma added that previous research have suggested the sedative may help prevent delirium, but this is the largest study to show such beneficial effects. The study also confirmed there were no side effects of the sedative. Further results showed the patients given the sedative had fewer post-operative complications than the placebo group, and were discharged from hospital earlier. The team will now assess if the sedative has long-term benefits, beyond the seven-day study period.

Now, scientists at Rockefeller University have identified a key molecule within this circuitry that is responsible for relieving anxiety. Intriguingly, it doesn't appear to reduce anxiety in female mice, only in males. ""This is unusual, because the particular cell type involved here is the same in the male and female brain same in number, same in appearance,"" says Nathaniel Heintz, head of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. ""It's a rare case where a single cell type is activated by the same stimulus but yields two different behaviors in each gender."" See Also: Neurobiologists find chronic stress in early life causes anxiety, aggression in adulthoodHeintz and colleagues demonstrated that a protein called corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP) reduces anxiety in male mice by halting the activity of a stress-inducing hormone. Published in Cell, the results may provide insights into new therapies for anxiety-related conditions. It's a well-known fact that our social and emotional behaviors--and disorders associated with these behaviors vary between men and women. For example, autism is more prevalent among men, while anxiety-related disorders tend to be more common in females. Differences in hormone levels and brain circuitry are thought to contribute to this variation, but the specific mechanisms responsible are not well understood. Previous work in the Heintz lab, however, has provided one possible explanation. The researchers characterized a novel population of neurons that are activated by oxytocin, a hormone that promotes social behaviors like bonding between mother and baby or teamwork. They found that these neurons fire more rapidly in response to oxytocin in female mice, and are important for promoting certain social behaviors in which females interact with males, but had little affect on male social behavior. In this study, the researchers asked what this particular cell type does in a male brain, suspecting from previous research on oxytocin that the stress response may be affected. Using optogenetics, a technique in which these neurons were engineered to fire in response to light, they examined the mice performing several tasks to test their anxiety levels. Don't Miss: Mindfulness treatment as effective as CBT for depression and anxiety ""If mice are anxious, they won't go out into unprotected areas,"" says Heintz. ""We found that if you activate these cells in males, they will leave the protected area more often, meaning they are less anxious. But in females, activating these cells made no difference in anxiety."" These findings suggest that different behaviors are affected in male and female mice when these neurons are activated by oxytocin: anxiety is reduced in males, while social behavior is increased in females. Heintz and colleagues next sought to identify the molecular mechanisms at play in these varied responses. Using a technique known as TRAP--previously developed by the Heintz lab and Paul Greengard's Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at Rockefeller--they looked for proteins produced by the oxytocin-sensing neurons. The CRHBP protein was among the most abundantly produced in these cells. ""Our findings led us to propose a signaling pathway in these neurons in which oxytocin stimulates production of CRHBP,"" says Heintz. ""CRHBP then binds to a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone, preventing it from performing its normal job to increase stress."" The question then became, why is the anxiety-reducing effect of CRHBP dominant in males, but doesn't seem to work in females? Further experiments revealed that corticotropin-releasing hormone levels are much higher in females to begin with. One possibility, Heintz says, is that CRHBP can't lower corticotropin-releasing hormone levels enough in females to make a difference. In males, however, it lowers the level of the stress hormone below a threshold that matters behaviorally, and effectively decreases stress and anxiety. These results may explain how oxytocin can both promote social behaviors in females and alleviate stress and anxiety in males. And they suggest that while the brain circuits that control male and female behaviors may look exactly the same, they still function differently because they don't respond the same way to certain hormones.

The study showed that 2HG is an excellent biomarker for tracking certain gliomas with IDH mutations and also can provide a diagnosis when neurological risk from surgery is too high, researchers said. Researchers used MR spectroscopy, a method for distinguishing the chemical makeup of normal vs. mutated brain tissue, to track 2HG concentrations. See Also: Vitamin E a potential biomarker for development of brain tumors""We can measure 2HG concentration and follow it during the disease course - it's stable over long periods of time when the tumor is stable, increases when the disease progresses, and is an excellent marker of tumor response because it falls in response to treatment that is working,"" said senior author Dr. Elizabeth Maher, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, and Neurology and Neurotherapeutics. According to the National Cancer Institute (U.S.), cancers of the brain and nervous system affect nearly 24,000 people annually. In 2013, there were an estimated 152,751 people living with brain and other nervous system cancer in the United States. The overall 5-year survival rate is 33.8 percent. In addition to its value in clinical care, the application of 2HG imaging to clinical trials of IDH inhibitors is already underway at UT Southwestern. Researchers from UT Southwestern's Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute and Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center collaborated with investigators in the Advanced Imaging Research Center to identify 2HG (2-hydroxyglutarate), a metabolite that is produced in gliomas that carry IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) gene mutations. Using MR spectroscopy, the team announced in 2012 that they could detect 2HG in the tumor with high sensitivity and specificity. This next-step study, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, showed that 2HG can be useful in tracking the disease, researchers said. ""This is the first non-invasive biomarker for brain cancer and represents a major advance for the field. Our current imaging is not nearly as precise and takes a longer time to see results,"" said senior author Dr. Maher, who holds the Theodore H. Strauss Professorship in Neuro-Oncology. ""Within a week of starting treatment, we know whether we 'hit the target'. This new method will be a much more rapid way of assessing the therapy - allowing the physician to know to stop treatments that aren't working or continue treatments that are."" Learn More: Investigators discover mechanism responsible for tumor invasion in brain cancer Most biomarkers are in the blood, so identifying biomarkers that can be tracked without drawing blood or obtaining a tissue biopsy is particularly valuable, said Dr. A. Dean Sherry, Director of the Advanced Imaging Research Center and Professor of Radiology at UT Southwestern, and Professor of Chemistry at UT Dallas, where he holds the Cecil H. and Ida Green Distinguished Chair in Systems Biology. The technique also may serve as a model to develop other imaging biomarkers for the brain, and already is being used to learn more about the biology of glioma, the most common type of brain cancer. ""In terms of research, the biomarker is a 'window' into IDH-mutant glioma biology and we are using it to learn more about how the tumor grows, responds to therapy, and ultimately becomes resistant to treatment,"" said lead author Dr. Changho Choi, Professor of Radiology and with the Advanced Imaging Research Center, where the study was performed using a dedicated research MR scanner. 2HG tracking also could prove useful in diagnosing some brain tumors in which typical surgical procedures to obtain tissue samples can't be done. That may be because the tumor isn't accessible, such as near the brainstem, or when trying to get a sample could cause neurological damage. These patients are excluded from clinical trials because of the lack of available tumor tissue for diagnostic analyses. ""We established in this study that 2HG levels in these tumors can be used to make a 'presumptive' molecular diagnosis of an IDH mutation, based solely on imaging,"" said Dr. Choi. The impact of this finding is that the patient's physician will have a clear direction for treatment, including recommending a patient for treatment in a clinical trial. Dr. Maher said they were also very grateful for the study's participants.

An international research team that includes scientists from the German Primate Center (DPZ), Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in G ttingen, has developed a new treatment strategy against the HIV-related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). SI viruses infect different primate species and are regarded as the origin of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In the study, SIV-infected rhesus macaques were treated with an antiretroviral drug for 90 days and in addition they were treated with a specific antibody for 23 weeks. After finishing this therapy, all macaques showed sustained control of the infection as almost no SI viruses could be detected in the blood and gastro-intestinal tissues. The CD4+ T cells that are essential for the immune system were present in sufficient numbers in these tissues. Two years after finishing the treatment the viral load remained low, the immune system intact, and the rhesus macaques healthy. The treatment strategy thus offers a new and promising approach to the therapy of HIV infections in humans (Science). Antiretroviral therapy is currently the most frequently used treatment of HIV infections. The drugs effectively block the proliferation of the HI viruses in the infected cells and thus delay the onset of the disease. However, these drugs have to be administered permanently since their discontinuation would immediately lead to virus rebound in the body. Their continuous administration is accompanied by adverse effects such as chronic inflammation, poisoning symptoms and accelerated aging. ""The aim of the study was to find a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of infections with immunodeficiency viruses, which would permanently prevent the proliferation of the viruses even after only temporarily application,"" says Lutz Walter, head of the Primate Genetics Laboratory at the DPZ and co-author of the publication. The study was conducted in the US under the leadership of scientists from the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, USA. From the fifth to the 18th week after infection, the rhesus macaques received an antiretroviral drug identical to the ones given to humans. From the ninth week, this treatment was combined with a specific antibody therapy, which was repeated at regular intervals of three weeks. A control group received only antiretroviral therapy and an irrelevant control antibody. After the 18th week the antiretroviral therapy was terminated and only the antibody was administered until the 32nd week, whereupon the treatment of the monkeys was halted. ""It is known that the SI and HI viruses tend to multiply especially in CD4+ T cells of the intestinal mucosa and thereby establish a chronic infection"", explains Lutz Walter.  The specific antibody prevents the entry of these immune cells into the mucosa. A further spread of the viruses was thereby effectively stopped and the rhesus macaques have controlled the virus infection since almost two years without further medication.  After the treatment has ended, the viral load and the amount of CD4+ T cells in the animals were determined. In the blood and intestinal tissue, the virus load was below the detection threshold and the CD4+ T cells count were stable, indicating a functional immune system. In addition to Lutz Walter, the other DPZ participants in the study were Christian Roos and Angela Noll. The three primate genetics experts investigated certain genetic markers of rhesus macaques. The focus was on the MHC class I genes as well as the genes of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Both gene families are essential for a functional immune system as well as for the immunological identity of an organism.  Since certain variants of these genes are known to be beneficial or detrimental in the SIV infection, we have determined the alleles of these genes in all macaques of this study , says Lutz Walter.  We wanted to make sure that the monkeys of the control and antibody-treated group just by chance do not have unfavorable and favorable alleles, respectively.  This partial result is important to secure the outcome of the study. The antibody that was used to treat the macaques is a primatized variant of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody that is known as Vedolizumab and has been available since 2014 in the USA and in Europe. It is administered to patients to treat chronic inflammatory bowels diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis where the CD4+ T cells also play an important role. The scientists are seeking to test the new treatment strategy in clinical trials with HIV patients. A phase-I clinical trial is already underway in the United States. The aim is to find out whether a combination of antiretroviral therapy with Vedolizumab has the same effect in humans.  We have good reasons to believe that the therapy will work similarly in humans , says Lutz Walter.  It would be a breakthrough for the future treatment of HIV patients.  In addition to the scientists of the Emory University School of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the DPZ, researchers of the Center for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa, the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering, the John Hopkins School of Medicine, the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, and the University of Michigan were involved in the project.","Published: October 14, 2016"

The animals  immune systems have been suppressing the virus to undetectable levels for as long as 23 months since the monkeys completed an investigational treatment regimen. In addition, the regimen has led to the near-complete replenishment of key immune cells that SIV had destroyed, something unachievable with antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone. The findings will be published in the Oct. 14 issue of the journal Science.  Our data suggest that the immune systems of these animals are controlling SIV replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., who co-led the study as chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH.  The experimental treatment regimen appears to have given the immune systems of the monkeys the necessary boost to put the virus into sustained remission. The precise mechanisms of this effect are unclear and will be actively pursued since they could have important implications for the control of HIV infection in humans in the absence of ART. At this point it is also unclear whether the findings of the newly reported animal study will translate into a clinical benefit for HIV-infected people.  Dr. Fauci also is director of NIAID, the primary funder of the research. The investigational treatment regimen consisted of 90 days of ART combined with 23 weeks of treatment with a laboratory-derived monkey antibody against a cellular receptor called a4b7 integrin. This antibody is similar to the human drug vedolizumab, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease. When a SIV-infected monkey or an HIV-infected person receives ART, the therapy can suppress the virus to undetectable levels. Yet the virus still lurks silently in the genetic material of infected immune cells, known as viral reservoirs, even when suppressed. If ART is discontinued, SIV or HIV rapidly rebounds to high levels within a few weeks. Thus, treatment for HIV today involves taking ART every day for life. Although ART dramatically improves health overall and prolongs life, daily ART can be a challenge to stick to and also can have side effects over time.  The new findings suggest an alternative form of HIV therapy that may eliminate a requirement for lifelong daily ART, potentially improving the quality of life for people living with the virus and reducing the staggering, unmet cost of antiretroviral therapy for the 37 million people worldwide who need it,  said Aftab A. Ansari, Ph.D., senior author of the paper and co-leader of the study. Dr. Ansari is a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and a research associate at Emory s Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta. Vedolizumab consists of an antibody to a4b7 integrin, a receptor that is present at high levels on the immune-system cells that SIV and HIV preferentially infect. One function of this antibody is to prevent these immune cells from homing to gastrointestinal tissues, a major site of SIV and HIV replication and viral reservoir formation early in infection. A critical unanswered question, and the subject of ongoing research, is precisely how treatment with the a4b7 antibody led to the regulation of SIV replication in the study monkeys.  If we could figure out how the antibody works, then an effective HIV vaccine could be modeled on that mechanism,  said Dr. Ansari.  That is the most important implication of our findings.  In the newly published experiment, investigators infected 18 rhesus macaques housed at the NIH-supported Yerkes Research Center with a disease-causing clone of SIV. Five weeks after infection, all the animals began receiving a 90-day course of daily ART. In addition, nine weeks after infection, 11 monkeys began receiving infusions of the investigational treatment antibody every three weeks while the other seven monkeys began receiving infusions of a placebo antibody. The infusions continued for 23 weeks. At the 32nd week after infection, all treatment ceased. All 18 monkeys fully suppressed SIV by their third week on ART. Once the infusions began, three monkeys developed antibodies against the investigational treatment antibody and were excluded from further study. After the 15 remaining monkeys stopped receiving ART, SIV rebounded to high levels in the seven control animals within two weeks and remained high. Among the eight monkeys who received the investigational antibody infusions, SIV rebounded temporarily in six of them, but they regained control of the virus within four weeks. The virus never rebounded in the other two animals. These eight monkeys have continued to suppress SIV to undetectable levels in both the blood and gastrointestinal tissues for as long as 23 months since all treatment ended. Since it is unclear whether the findings of this monkey study will translate into a clinical benefit for HIV-infected people, NIAID researchers recently began an effort to determine whether short-term treatment with vedolizumab in combination with ART can generate sustained HIV remission in such individuals. Sustained HIV remission, also known as a  functional cure,  refers to the outcome of a treatment or therapeutic vaccination that induces prolonged, undetectable levels of HIV viremia without ART. The study investigators are hopeful that combining short-term vedolizumab treatment with ART will be as effective at suppressing HIV replication following withdrawal of ART in people as it appears to be at suppressing SIV replication in monkeys. A small, early-phase clinical trial testing the treatment regimen in HIV-infected people has already begun at the NIH Clinical Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02788175). The study is testing whether a 30-week course of vedolizumab is safe and tolerable and allows study participants  immune systems to control the virus when they temporarily stop taking ART. Preliminary results are expected by the end of 2017 with further data becoming available into 2018. Collaborating on the newly reported research with investigators at NIAID and Emory University were scientists at the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa, Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the German Primate Research Center, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and University of Michigan. These organizations and the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs also provided financial support.","Published: October 14, 2016"

The Houston-based proficiency test provider plans to incorporate these materials into their upcoming PGS proficiency scheme. PGS is a screening technique to evaluate cells from in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos for the presence of chromosomal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, or trisomy 13. This is increasingly being performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and there is a critical and urgent need for reliable reference materials to expedite new test development as well as enable routine monitoring of PGS assay performance. SeraCare's SeraseqTM PGS Reference Materials consist of precisely quantitated fetal DNA derived from trophoblast cells from either confirmed trisomies or normal pregnancies. These materials can easily be customized to a desired concentration (as low as a few picograms) depending on the PGS assay requirement. As the IVF market continues to expand globally, AAB s proficiency testing programs require precise and reliable source materials to ensure the accuracy of the growing number of PGS assays deployed worldwide. AAB is one of the nation s largest full-service proficiency testing providers, and the leading provider of IVF programs in the country.  As a proficiency test provider, we play an important and independent role in ensuring the accuracy and ongoing consistency of assay performance. It is important that we have a robust, reliable, and consistent supply of reference materials that mimic biochemical composition seen in actual clinical samples in a PGS lab,  said Eric Vanderslice, Ph.D., Vice President and Technical Director at AAB.  Seraseq PGS reference materials offer a consistent and precise supply of trisomy and euploid material that allows us to confidently evaluate assay performance, with the ultimate goal to ensure accurate results to clinicians and IVF patients.   SeraCare is already the leading provider of reference materials for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) assays with our Seraseq Trisomy Reference Materials and we are very excited to launch our first product for PGS through this partnership with AAB,  said Trevor Brown, Vice President of Precision Medicine at SeraCare.  We will continue to invest and grow our innovative QC portfolio in support of these fast growing clinical applications for reproductive health with the goal of helping labs develop better and more accurate assays with the ability to track their daily performance.

In a study recently published online in the journal Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, Dr. Shalini Prasad, professor of bioengineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, and her co-authors demonstrated the capabilities of a biosensor they designed to reliably detect and quantify glucose in human sweat. The team has previously demonstrated that their technology can detect cortisol in perspiration. But for diabetics and those at risk for diabetes, self-monitoring of blood glucose, or blood sugar, is an important part of managing their conditions.  Fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and step count are very popular, but wearable, non-invasive biosensors would be extremely beneficial for managing diseases,  said Prasad, the Cecil H. and Ida Green Professor in Systems Biology Science. Typical home-use blood glucose monitors require a user to obtain a small blood sample, usually through the prick of a finger and often several times a day. However, the UT Dallas textile-based sensor detects glucose in the small amount of ambient sweat on a person s skin.  In our sensor mechanism, we use the same chemistry and enzymatic reaction that are incorporated into blood glucose testing strips,  Prasad said.  But in our design, we had to account for the low volume of ambient sweat that would be present in areas such as under a watch or wrist device, or under a patch that lies next to the skin.  Prasad said that researchers who work with sweat often use a process called iontophoresis, which sends an electric current through the skin to generate enough perspiration for sensing experiments. However, because this method can lead to rashes and burns on the skin, the team sought an alternative that would work with small amounts of sweat. Their design works with volumes of sweat less than a microliter, which is the approximate amount of liquid that would fit in a cube the size of a salt crystal. The technology also provides a real-time response in the form of a digital readout. Prasad and bioengineering doctoral student Rujuta Munje, lead author of the journal article, incorporated an off-the-shelf polymer-based textile material in their glucose sensor and used UT Dallas clean-room facilities to construct the electronic elements. The prototype is a small, flexible, rod-shaped device about an inch long.  We used known properties of textiles and weaves in our design,  Prasad said.  What was innovative was the way we incorporated and positioned the electrodes onto this textile in such a way that allows a very small volume of sweat to spread effectively through the surface.  Typical blood glucose testing strips also contain a molecule that ultimately amplifies the signal from the chemical reactions on the strip enough to register electronically on a monitoring device. But if used in a device that is worn next to the skin, those molecules can be irritating, Prasad said, which presented another challenge. To ensure that such a tiny amount of sweat would generate a strong enough signal, Prasad and Munje modified the surface topography of the textile material.  Our modifications allow this material to entrap glucose oxidase molecules, which effectively amplifies the signal,  Prasad said.  We did it this way because we are thinking about possible commercialization   to make these, we need a fabrication process that is not complex.  Prasad and Munje also were able to account for the fact that the chemistry of a person s sweat changes throughout the day.  Glucose is a tricky molecule to monitor because other factors can confound a signal,  Prasad said.  For example, the pH, or acidity, of your sweat can vary greatly depending on the circumstances.  She noted that when individuals exercise or are under stress, the level of other compounds in their sweat, such as cortisol and lactic acid, change as well, and these can interfere with glucose detection.  We have shown that with our technology, we address three critical issues: low volume of ambient sweat, interference from other compounds and pH swings,  Prasad said Prasad and Munje tested their prototype using samples of human sweat from donors. While a consumer product based on the technology is still a few years away, the concept was developed with commercialization and scaled-up production in mind.  At this point, we are thinking of this sensor as something you use for a day and toss out, and we believe it could easily be incorporated into existing consumer electronics platforms,  Prasad said.  We re very excited about the potential for licensing this technology.  The research was supported by the Cecil H. and Ida Green endowed fellowship at UT Dallas. Researchers at UT Dallas and elsewhere have investigated whether glucose found in other bodily fluids   such as urine and tears   might be used to track glucose levels, further eliminating the need for invasive blood draws. Google, for example, is investigating a smart contact lens designed to measure glucose levels in tears. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 29 million people in the United States have diabetes and 86 million have prediabetes.","Published: October 14, 2016"

Cancer misdiagnosis is an all too common and underappreciated problem, which frequently has a negative impact on patient treatment, and may cause needless loss of life. We provide both primary and second opinion screening, and our network of leading academic cancer researchers and advanced diagnostic technologies have proven to be an invaluable resource for patients and physicians. Our entire team is committed to ensuring that our services are made widely available. To that end we will continue building out our sales team to accelerate adoption and revenue growth. We believe Transgenomic s ICP technology and commercial infrastructure fit well with our values and our business model, and look forward to this next stage of growth, as we work together to integrate our teams, technologies and services.  Keith Barksdale, Founder of BV Advisory Partners, commented,  Transgenomic and Precipio have complementary strengths with the potential to be a dynamic and strong competitor in the rapidly growing market for advanced cancer diagnostics. ICP is a revolutionary mutation detection technology that is now available through global distributors, and adoption by drug researchers and developers is ramping up. The technology is also available to help guide cancer diagnosis and treatment through Transgenomic s CLIA laboratory. Precipio s platform of leading academic cancer experts provides superior diagnostic accuracy level to oncologists and their patients; it represents a unique resource that can benefit from and leverage the power of ICE COLD-PCR. We look forward to working with the combined company going forward to help assure its growth and success.  Transgenomic s ICE COLD-PCR offers major advantages over current sequencing technologies. It delivers at least a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to standard methodologies, allowing detection of both known and previously unknown genetic alterations in any exon of any gene using a single assay. It is robust, easy to use and easily implemented, requiring minimal disruption to established sequencing workflows. It is available as ICEme  Kits that deliver up to a 500-fold increase in mutation detection compared to most current methods, with levels of detection routinely achievable down to 0.01%. This ultra-high sensitivity enables detection of low level mutations and allows accurate patient monitoring as well as stratification of cancer sub-populations. ICEme Kits are compatible with most patient samples, including tissue, blood, plasma, urine and other biofluids. The kits are simple to use and work with most of the genomic analysis platforms available in laboratories. They are easily customizable for use with single mutations or multiple mutations in combination. The current menu includes approximately 20 clinically relevant, actionable mutations that are associated with important cancers. The ICP range of mutation targets is being expanded on an ongoing basis.

Only female mice are affected by the gene mutation, and some of the abnormalities in the female mice depend on whether they are housed alone or together with other mice. Eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia are serious, sometimes life-threatening illnesses that affect millions of people in the United States, and are more prevalent in women. Although it has long been known that genetics play a major role in the risk of developing eating disorders, very little is understood about which genes are mutated in patients with eating disorders and how those mutations affect the brain and behavior. See Also: Mouse study advances our understanding of eating disorders In 2013, researchers led by University of Iowa scientists Michael Lutter, MD, PhD, and Huxing Cui, PhD, identified two genes from two different families that are associated with an increased risk of developing an eating disorder. In the new study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, the team has developed a mouse model to investigate the behavioral effects of one of those gene mutations. The gene in question is called histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). It is a transcriptional repressor, which means it turns off other genes. To create the new mouse model of this gene mutation, the researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to incorporate the human mutation in the mouse HDAC4 gene. ""The mutated female mice have several behaviors relevant to eating disorders,"" explains Lutter, formerly at the University of Iowa and now a psychiatrist at the Eating Recovery Center of Dallas. ""In particular, they work less hard to obtain high-calorie food when they are hungry, which is important because failure to increase food intake in response to hunger is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. Also, they have compulsive grooming, which is considered a model of obsessive-compulsive disorder in mice. OCD-like behaviors are very common in patients with anorexia nervosa as well."" ""These findings support a role for the HDAC4 mutation in causing eating disorders in humans and gives us an important tool (the mouse model) to study the neurobiological basis of eating disorders,"" adds lead study author Cui, assistant professor of pharmacology at the UI Carver College of Medicine. Learn More: In anorexia nervosa, brain responds differently to hunger signals The study also revealed a surprising relationship between the feeding and behavior abnormalities and the animals' living conditions. The genetically altered female mice were more anxious and irritable when they were in a group living situation than when they were individually housed and seemed to find social interaction less rewarding, Lutter says. The genetically altered mice also allowed the researchers to investigate the biological pathways involved in the animals' feeding and behavioral problems. Using bioinformatics analysis, the researchers identified genes that are controlled by HDAC4. They discovered that the HDAC4 mutation leads to a decrease in the expression of genes involved in synthesis of the neurotransmitter glutamate. ""This is important because glutamate has previously been implicated in feeding, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and depression,"" Lutter says. ""So this one observation could explain a whole array of behavioral deficits."" ""This is the first biological pathway that's been identified as being associated with the risk of developing an eating disorder,"" Cui notes. ""This work will open new avenues of research to understand the neurobiological basis of eating disorders and identify new opportunities for development of medications to treat eating disorders."" In addition to helping researchers tease out the biological pathways underlying eating disorders and identifying potential targets for new therapies, this mouse model could also be used to screen potential drugs to treat eating disorders. Read Next: Abnormalities found in 'insight' areas of the brain in anorexiaOne of the first questions the team will tackle is why the HDAC4 mutation affected only female mice.

A new study reveals that the cutting of tau by an enzyme called caspase-2 may play a critical role in the disordered brain circuit function that occurs in these diseases. Of interest, the culprit tau fragment identified in this study is actually resistant to forming aggregates, and it causes a disturbance in memory function in animal models before brain cell loss occurs. See Also: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein In mice genetically engineered to mimic aspects of human tauopathy disorders, the researchers restored some of the learning and memory deficits by blocking caspase-2 activity, which suggests that some of the cognitive loss seen in tauopathies might be reversible. The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and published in the journal Nature Medicine. ""The results of this exciting study suggest that the cognitive loss that occurs in tauopathy may be reversed by blocking the function of caspase-2,"" said Roderick Corriveau, PhD, a program director at NINDS. ""This motivates further investigation of caspase-2 as a novel therapeutic target for dementia."" Using a mouse model of tauopathy that produces a mutated form of human tau protein, researchers correlated memory deficits with the presence of a fragment of the tau protein. The tau fragment, which is produced when caspase-2 cuts the full-length tau protein at a specific location, was also found at higher levels in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy individuals of the same age. Related: Toxic Alzheimer's protein spreads through brain via extracellular spaceWhile the standard hallmark of tauopathies is the appearance in brain tissue of large tangles of abnormal tau protein, it has recently become less clear whether the tangles of tau are actually causing cognitive decline. ""In the past, many studies focused on the accumulation of tangles and their connection to memory loss,"" said Karen Ashe, MD, PhD, professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota and senior author of this study, ""but the more we learn, the less likely it seems that they are the cause of disease symptoms. The pathological fragment of tau that we have identified resists forming tangles and can instead move freely throughout the cell. Therefore, we decided to look for other mechanisms that could affect synaptic function."" To do this, Ashe's group used fluorescent labeling to track and compare the behavior of normal and mutated tau in cultured neurons from the rat hippocampus, the brain region most associated with learning and memory. Unlike normal tau, both mutated tau and the short fragment produced when caspase-2 cuts tau were primarily found within structures called dendritic spines, where neurons receive inputs from neighboring cells. The overabundance of mutated tau, including the caspase-2-produced fragment, caused disruptions in synaptic function in the spines. The impact on synapses was specific, with no observed effects on the overall structure or survival of the neurons. Read Next: Genetically engineered mice suggest new model for how Alzheimer's causes dementia""It appears that abnormally processed tau is disrupting the ability of neurons to properly respond to the signals that they receive, producing memory deficits independent of tangle formation,"" said Dr. Ashe. ""Because this effect is occurring without cell death or a loss of synapses, we have a better chance of intervening in the process and hopefully reversing symptoms of the disease."" Ashe and her team are now planning additional experiments to uncover the mechanisms by which abnormally processed mutant tau produces memory deficits.

Now imagine regaining that sensation, a decade later, through a mind-controlled robotic arm that is directly connected to your brain. That is what 28-year-old Nathan Copeland experienced after he came out of brain surgery and was connected to the brain computer interface (BCI), developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). In a study published in Science Translational Medicine, a team of experts led by Robert Gaunt, PhD, assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the Pitt, demonstrated for the first time ever in humans a technology that allows Mr. Copeland to experience the sensation of touch through a robotic arm that he controls with his brain. See Also: In UCLA study, non-surgical approach helps people with paralysis voluntarily move their legs   a first ""The most important result in this study is that microstimulation of sensory cortex can elicit natural sensation instead of tingling,"" said study co-author Andrew Schwartz, PhD, distinguished professor of neurobiology and chair in systems neuroscience, Pitt School of Medicine, and a member of the University of Pittsburgh Brain Institute. ""This stimulation is safe, and the evoked sensations are stable over months. There is still a lot of research that needs to be carried out to better understand the stimulation patterns needed to help patients make better movements."" This is not the Pitt-UPMC team's first attempt at a BCI. Four years ago, study co-author Jennifer Collinger, PhD, assistant professor, Pitt's Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and research scientist for the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, and the team demonstrated a BCI that helped Jan Scheuermann, who has quadriplegia caused by a degenerative disease. The video of Scheuermann feeding herself chocolate using the mind-controlled robotic arm was seen around the world. Before that, Tim Hemmes, paralyzed in a motorcycle accident, reached out to touch hands with his girlfriend. But the way our arms naturally move and interact with the environment around us is due to more than just thinking and moving the right muscles. We are able to differentiate between a piece of cake and a soda can through touch, picking up the cake more gently than the can. The constant feedback we receive from the sense of touch is of paramount importance as it tells the brain where to move and by how much. Don't Miss: Turning breath into words   New device to give paralysis victims a voice For Gaunt and the rest of the research team, that was the next step for the BCI. As they were looking for the right candidate, they developed and refined their system such that inputs from the robotic arm are transmitted through a microelectrode array implanted in the brain where the neurons that control hand movement and touch are located. The microelectrode array and its control system, which were developed by Blackrock Microsystems, along with the robotic arm, which was built by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, formed all the pieces of the puzzle. In the winter of 2004, Mr. Copeland, who lives in western Pennsylvania, was driving at night in rainy weather when he was in a car accident that snapped his neck and injured his spinal cord, leaving him with quadriplegia from the upper chest down, unable to feel or move his lower arms and legs, and needing assistance with all his daily activities. He was 18 and in his freshman year of college pursuing a degree in nanofabrication, following a high school spent in advanced science courses. He tried to continue his studies, but health problems forced him to put his degree on hold. He kept busy by going to concerts and volunteering for the Pittsburgh Japanese Culture Society, a nonprofit that holds conventions around the Japanese cartoon art of anime, something Mr. Copeland became interested in after his accident. Right after the accident he had enrolled himself on Pitt's registry of patients willing to participate in clinical trials. Nearly a decade later, the Pitt research team asked if he was interested in participating in the experimental study. Learn More: Neuroprosthetics for paralysis: A new implant on the spinal cord After he passed the screening tests, Nathan was wheeled into the operating room last spring. Study co-investigator and UPMC neurosurgeon Elizabeth Tyler-Kabara, MD, PhD, assistant professor, Department of Neurological Surgery, Pitt School of Medicine, implanted four tiny microelectrode arrays each about half the size of a shirt button in Nathan's brain. Prior to the surgery, imaging techniques were used to identify the exact regions in Mr. Copeland's brain corresponding to feelings in each of his fingers and his palm. ""I can feel just about every finger--it's a really weird sensation,"" Mr. Copeland said about a month after surgery. ""Sometimes it feels electrical and sometimes its pressure, but for the most part, I can tell most of the fingers with definite precision. It feels like my fingers are getting touched or pushed."" At this time, Mr. Copeland can feel pressure and distinguish its intensity to some extent, though he cannot identify whether a substance is hot or cold, explains Tyler-Kabara. Michael Boninger, MD, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Pitt, and senior medical director of post-acute care for the Health Services Division of UPMC, recounted how the Pitt team has achieved milestone after milestone, from a basic understanding of how the brain processes sensory and motor signals to applying it in patients ""Slowly but surely, we have been moving this research forward. Four years ago we demonstrated control of movement.

A new imaging method now makes it possible to observe the activation of large neural circuits, currently up to the size of a small-animal brain, in real time and three dimensions. Researchers at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and the Technical University of Munich have recently reported on their new findings in Light: Science & Applications. See Also: Researchers open  Golden Window  in deep brain imaging Nowadays it is well recognized that most brain functions may not be comprehended through inspection of single neurons. To advance meaningfully, neuroscientists need the ability to monitor the activity of millions of neurons, both individually and collectively. However, such observations were so far not possible due to the limited penetration depth of optical microscopy techniques into a living brain. A team headed by Prof. Dr. Daniel Razansky, a group leader at the Institute of Biological and Molecular Imaging, Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, and Professor of Molecular Imaging Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, has now found a way to address this challenge. The new method is based on the so-called optoacoustics, which allows non-invasive interrogation of living tissues at centimeter scale depths. Optoacoustics allows for high resolution, non-invasive, 3D imaging of living tissues. The technology uses short laser pulses that cause short-term expansion of the tissue, leading to tiny ultrasound vibrations. Those are registered with specially designed detectors, processed and converted into three-dimensional images of the interrogated tissue. To this end, the Helmholtz researchers have developed a number of optoacoustic imaging technologies for tracking hemodynamics and targeted agent delivery in a number of pre-clinical and medical imaging applications. The current work addresses significantly faster biological processes, such as neural activation. Related: Noninvasive imaging method looks deeper inside the body to study living brain ""We discovered that optoacoustics can be made sensitive to the differences in calcium ion concentrations resulting from neural activity and devised a rapid functional optoacoustic neuro-tomography (FONT) system that can simultaneously record signals from a very large number of neurons"", said Dr. Xos  Luis De n-Ben, first author of the study. Experiments performed by the scientists in brains of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G demonstrated, for the first time, the fundamental ability to directly track neural dynamics using optoacoustics while overcoming the longstanding penetration barrier of optical imaging in opaque brains. The technique was also able to trace neural activity during unrestrained motion of the animals. ""So far we demonstrated real-time analysis on whole brains of adult animals with roughly 2x3x4 millimeter dimensions (approximately 24 mm3),"" says the study's leader Razansky. State-of-the-art optical microscopy methods are currently limited to volumes well below a cubic millimeter when it comes to imaging of fast neural activity, according to the researchers. In addition, their FONT method is already capable of visualizing volumes of more than 1000 cubic millimeters with temporal resolution of 10 milliseconds. Read Next: Researchers devise tool to improve imaging of neuronal activity in the brainLarge-scale observation of neural activity is the key to understanding how the brain works, both under normal and diseased conditions.

Now we can also see how this message spreads like wildfire,"" explains Razansky.

See Also: Study findings challenge a scientific principle about amyloid beta The findings are published in Cell Reports. ""Our results further illuminate the complex processes involved in the degradation and decline of neurons, which is, of course, the essential characteristic and cause of AD,"" said the study's senior author Larry Goldstein, PhD, Distinguished Professor in the Departments of Neuroscience and Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and director of both the UC San Diego Stem Cell Program and Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center at UC San Diego Health. ""But beyond that, they point to a new target and therapy for a condition that currently has no proven treatment or cure."" Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. It affects more than 30 million people worldwide, including an estimated 5.4 million Americans. One in 10 persons over the age of 65 has AD; one in three over the age of 85. There are currently no treatments proven to cure or reduce the progression of AD. Genetically, AD is divided into two groups: the much more common sporadic (sAD) form of the disease in which the underlying primary cause is not known and the rarer familial (fAD) form, produced by inherited genetic mutations. In both forms, the brains of AD patients feature accumulations of protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that lead to neuronal impairment and eventual cell death. Related: Is the amyloid hypothesis the right path to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease? The prevailing ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" posits that these plaques and tangles are comprised, respectively, of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments and tau proteins that fuel cellular stress, neurotoxicity, loss of function and cell death. There has been some evidence, however, of another disease-driver: defects in endocytic trafficking the process by which cells package large, external molecules into vesicles or membrane-bound sacs for transport into the cell for a variety of reasons or uses. But previous research focused on non-neuronal cells and did not examine the effects of normal expression levels of AD-related proteins, leaving it unclear to what degree decreased endocytosis and other molecular movement within cells played a causative role. Goldstein and colleagues analyzed neurons created from induced pluripotent stem cells in which they generated PS1 and APP mutations characteristic of fAD using the emerging genome editing technologies CRISPR and TALEN. In this ""disease-in-a-dish"" approach, they found that the mutated neurons displayed altered distribution and trafficking of APP and internalized lipoproteins (proteins that combine with or transport fat and other lipids in blood plasma). Specifically, there were elevated levels of APP in the soma or cell body while levels were reduced in the neuronal axons. Learn More: New amyloid-reducing compound could be a preventive measure against Alzheimer s In previous work, Goldstein's team had demonstrated that PS1 and APP mutations impaired the activity of specific cellular enzymes.

The reason lies in the mechanism through which exercise and methamphetamine affect circadian rhythms, the roughly 24-hour cycles that drive all organisms. See Also: Research shows new neurons created through exercise don't cause you to forget old memoriesResearchers in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo (UB) based their hypothesis on the fact that both methamphetamine and running wheel activity target the same reward centers in the brain, which are also involved in daily synchronization of physiological rhythms. ""Our experiments show that it might be possible to use methamphetamine to treat meth addiction itself, by associating drug usage with a stimuli that's not harmful: exercise,"" explained Oliver Rawashdeh, PhD, co-first author, formerly a postdoctoral researcher in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and now a lecturer and head of the Chronobiology lab in the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Queensland in Australia. Shannon Clough, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the UB Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, is co-first author with Rawashdeh. The UB researchers were interested in circadian rhythms because addiction upsets them, increasing craving for the drug and making relapse after treatment more likely. ""Since various aspects of circadian rhythms are conserved among mammals, these findings may be directly translatable to humans,"" said Margarita Dubocovich, PhD, senior author and State University of New York Distinguished Professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Learn More: Exercise can tackle symptoms of schizophrenia""The circadian system is negatively impacted by drugs of addiction and it doesn't necessarily recover,"" said Rawashdeh. ""We also know that the success of rehabilitation and prevention of relapse is linked to the degree of circadian disturbance in addicts."" To better understand the relationship between addiction and circadian rhythms, the researchers studied mice from whom the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a small region in the brain's hypothalamus that acts as the master circadian clock, was removed. ""Metabolism and sleep cycles are all off kilter when someone is addicted,"" Rawashdeh explained, ""just like an animal whose master circadian clock has been removed."" ""It's like being in a constant state of jet lag,"" said Dubocovich. ""You are in a constant transition state and the same goes for these animals,"" she said. Don't Miss: Genetic pre-disposition toward exercise, mental development may be linked That's what happens when the SCN, the master circadian driver, becomes decoupled from the so-called ""slave"" oscillators that it controls, one of which is the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator or MASCO. The researchers found that running wheel access and methamphetamine reinstate circadian rhythmicity in animals with no SCN, providing periodic feedback to a newly activated circadian brain clock, which could be the MASCO. ""Our idea was that if you pair a reward, in this case access to the running wheel, along with methamphetamine in 24-hour intervals over a period of time, the animal's fragmented sleep/wake cycles would acclimatize to the 24-hour cycles, a process we call entrainment and consolidation,"" explained Rawashdeh. Even more fascinating, he added, is the fact that the re-established circadian rhythm in sleep/wake cycles persists even after removing methamphetamine. ""We created a new homeostatic state,"" he said. ""By using the principles of learning and memory, we may have rewired the brain's circuitry, activating a new clock - a form of plasticity - using the same stimulus that caused addiction in the first place, methamphetamine,"" said Rawashdeh. ""This was necessary in order to transfer the euphoric and pleasurable characteristics associated with the drug over to a healthy stimulus - exercise."" Exercise stimulates the growth of new neurons, which may also play a role in the successful brain rewiring that takes place, the researchers said. If this association can be duplicated in people, Rawashdeh added, it might be very possible to accelerate the efficiency of drug rehabilitation, decreasing the chances for relapse and re-establishing healthy circadian rhythms after withdrawal. The team's immediate next step is to understand how the pairing of exercise with methamphetamine activates a new circadian clock in the brain to induce robust rhythms and drug withdrawal, explained Dubocovich.

For the first time, they have corrected the mutation in a proportion of stem cells that is high enough to produce a substantial benefit in sickle cell patients. The researchers from UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco Benioff Children s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) and the University of Utah School of Medicine hope to re-infuse patients with the edited stem cells and alleviate symptoms of the disease, which primarily afflicts those of African descent and leads to anemia, painful blood blockages and early death.  We re very excited about the promise of this technology,  said Jacob Corn, a senior author on the study and scientific director of the Innovative Genomics Initiative at UC Berkeley.  There is still a lot of work to be done before this approach might be used in the clinic, but we re hopeful that it will pave the way for new kinds of treatment for patients with sickle cell disease.  In tests in mice, the genetically engineered stem cells stuck around for at least four months after transplantation, an important benchmark to ensure that any potential therapy would be lasting.  This is an important advance because for the first time we show a level of correction in stem cells that should be sufficient for a clinical benefit in persons with sickle cell anemia,  said co-author Mark Walters, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist and director of UCSF Benioff Oakland s Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program. The results were reported in the Oct. 12 issue of the online journal Science Translational Medicine. Sickle cell disease is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a single mutation in both copies of a gene coding for beta-globin, a protein that forms part of the oxygen-carrying molecule hemoglobin. This homozygous defect causes hemoglobin molecules to stick together, deforming red blood cells into a characteristic  sickle  shape. These misshapen cells get stuck in blood vessels, causing blockages, anemia, pain, organ failure and significantly shortened lifespan. Sickle cell disease is particularly prevalent in African Americans and the sub-Saharan African population, affecting hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. The goal of the multi-institutional team is to develop genome engineering-based methods for correcting the disease-causing mutation in each patient s own stem cells to ensure that new red blood cells are healthy. The team used CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the disease-causing mutation in hematopoietic stem cells   precursor cells that mature into red blood cells   isolated from whole blood of sickle cell patients. The corrected cells produced healthy hemoglobin, which mutated cells do not make at all. Future pre-clinical work will require additional optimization, large-scale mouse studies and rigorous safety analysis, the researchers emphasize. Corn and his lab have joined with Walters, an expert in developing curative treatments such as bone marrow transplant and gene therapy for sickle cell disease, to initiate an early-phase clinical trial to test this new treatment within the next five years. Notably, research groups might be able to apply the approach described in this study to develop treatments for other blood diseases such as  -thalassemia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), chronic granulomatous disease, rare disorders like Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and Fanconi anemia, and even HIV infection.  Sickle cell disease is just one of many blood disorders caused by a single mutation in the genome,  Corn said.  It s very possible that other researchers and clinicians could use this type of gene editing to explore ways to cure a large number of diseases.   There is a clear path for developing therapies for certain diseases,  said co-senior author Dana Carroll of the University of Utah, who co-developed one of the first genome editing techniques over a decade ago.  It s very gratifying to see gene editing technology being brought to practical applications.  The work is the fruit of the Innovative Genomics Initiative, a joint effort between UC Berkeley and UCSF that aims to correct DNA mutations that underlie human disease using CRISPR-Cas9, a pioneering technology co-developed by scientists at UC Berkeley that has made genome editing easier and more efficient than ever before. The project also leverages the expertise of physicians and scientists at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital Oakland, a major center for research and treatment of sickle cell disease, and Carroll s expertise in the field of genome engineering.

The study, published in Nature, was led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health.  This study elegantly shows how analysis of eye movement sheds more light on brain plasticity   an ability that is at the core of the brain s capacity to adapt and function. More specifically, it shows how the visual cortex continues to surprise and to awe,  said Houmam Araj, Ph.D., a program director at NEI. Without our being aware of it, our eyes are in constant motion. As we rotate our heads and as the world around us moves, two ocular reflexes kick in to offset this movement and stabilize images projected onto our retinas, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of our eyes. The optokinetic reflex causes eyes to drift horizontally from side-to-side   for example, as we watch the scenery through a window of a moving train. The vestibulo-ocular reflex adjusts our eye position to offset head movements. Both reflexes are crucial to survival. These mechanisms allow us to see traffic while driving down a bumpy road, or a hawk in flight to see a mouse scurrying for cover. The two reflexes occur automatically as a result of signals from the brainstem, an evolutionarily older part of the brain. These reflexes also are precisely coordinated in relation to each other. When one of the two reflexes is impaired by age or alcohol, for example, the other compensates. This orchestration requires adaptive plasticity, said the study s lead investigator, Massimo Scanziani, Ph.D., who at the time of the study was professor of neurobiology at UCSD before moving to UCSF. Scanziani collaborated with the study s first author, Bao-hua Liu, Ph.D., a post-doc at UCSD and Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., now associate professor at Stanford University. Scanziani and his colleagues sought to understand the origins of this adaptive plasticity by studying the eye movements in mice before and after disabling their vestibular ocular reflex. In their mouse model, disabling the vestibulo-ocular reflex increases the optokinetic reflex. They measure the increase by holding the mouse s head still and then presenting the mouse with visual stimuli in the form of black and white horizontal stripes that rotate around the mouse. A camera records the animal s eye movements. More forceful eye movements indicate an increase in optokinetic reflex activity. To test the visual cortex s role in the plasticity of these reflexes, the researchers applied a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to turn target cells on or off. The researchers targeted inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex to turn them  on,  thus silencing that region of the brain. Silencing the visual cortex led to a significant reduction in the activity of the optokinetic reflex, suggesting that it is the visual cortex that is involved in mediating the plasticity between the optokinetic and the vestibulo-ocular reflexes. Next, the researchers sought to learn more about how the visual cortex modulates the reflexes. It has long been observed that a collection of neural projections from the visual cortex extends to cells of the brainstem that regulate innate motor behaviors. The scientists lesioned these projections and again observed a decrease in the optokinetic reflex. Such findings suggest that the neural projections are the anatomical structures by which the visual cortex adjusts the plasticity of the optokinetic reflex, Scanziani said. The findings shed new light on the role of the mammalian cortex in orchestrating eye movement, according to Scanziani.  Most of our reflexes are encoded in the brainstem, but from an evolutionary standpoint, the ability for one s cortex to modify these reflexes expands one s behavioral repertoire as the circumstances require,  he said.  If you ve ever noticed how people in an audience tend to cough after a solo musical performance ends, you ve seen this ability to modify reflexes in action. It s an ability that appears to have been an attribute important for survival. After all when you re hiding from a tiger, it would be the very worst moment to cough.  The study was supported in part by NEI grant R01 EY025668. NEI leads the federal government's research on the visual system and eye diseases. NEI supports basic and clinical science programs that result in the development of sight-saving treatments.","Published: October 13, 2016"

Celgene is currently developing enasidenib (AG-221/CC-90007), an IDH2 mutant inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML who have an IDH2 mutation. Agios is developing AG-120, an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML who have an IDH1 mutation. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 20% of AML patients. An article published online this week in the journal Leukemia (Medeiros, Leukemia 2016) concluded that advances in the understanding of the genetics underlying myeloid malignancies are driving an era of development for targeted treatments such as IDH mutant inhibitors. The authors recommend that IDH mutational analysis should become part of the routine AML diagnostic workup and repeated at relapse to identify patients who may be eligible for targeted investigational treatments currently under clinical study.  AML is a complex and heterogeneous disease, making it difficult to treat,  said Han Myint, M.D., Vice President, Global Medical Affairs, Myeloid for Celgene.  IDH mutations lead to aberrant DNA methylation, causing a block in myeloid differentiation that leads to disease progression. Molecular profiling is important to identify genomic mutations which may have prognostic and potential treatment implications for patients with AML.  Abbott s m2000rt RealTime System, is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument designed to enable clinical laboratories to automate PCR and results analysis, simplifying the complex and manual steps often associated with molecular diagnostics. Both Celgene and Agios have incorporated this screening into clinical trial designs, including the recently initiated Phase 3 IDHENTIFY trial comparing enasidenib with conventional therapy in older patients with an IDH2 mutation and relapsed or refractory AML (NCT02577406).  The field of personalized medicine is advancing at a rapid pace for a broad range of medical conditions, especially within hematology-oncology,  said Chris Bowden, M.D., chief medical officer at Agios.  Our collaboration with Abbott will provide a test to help identify AML patients with IDH mutations who are in need of treatment options.

A new study reveals that the cutting of tau by an enzyme called caspase-2 may play a critical role in the disordered brain circuit function that occurs in these diseases. Of interest, the culprit tau fragment identified in this study is actually resistant to forming aggregates, and it causes a disturbance in memory function in animal models before brain cell loss occurs. In mice genetically engineered to mimic aspects of human tauopathy disorders, the researchers restored some of the learning and memory deficits by blocking caspase-2 activity, which suggests that some of the cognitive loss seen in tauopathies might be reversible. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and published in the journal Nature Medicine.  The results of this exciting study suggest that the cognitive loss that occurs in tauopathy may be reversed by blocking the function of caspase-2,  said Roderick A. Corriveau, Ph.D., a program director at NINDS.  This motivates further investigation of caspase-2 as a novel therapeutic target for dementia.  Using a mouse model of tauopathy that produces a mutated form of human tau protein, researchers correlated memory deficits with the presence of a fragment of the tau protein. The tau fragment, which is produced when caspase-2 cuts the full-length tau protein at a specific location, was also found at higher levels in the brains of Alzheimer s disease patients compared to healthy individuals of the same age. While the standard hallmark of tauopathies is the appearance in brain tissue of large tangles of abnormal tau protein, it has recently become less clear whether the tangles of tau are actually causing cognitive decline.  In the past, many studies focused on the accumulation of tangles and their connection to memory loss,  said Karen H. Ashe, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota and senior author of this study,  but the more we learn, the less likely it seems that they are the cause of disease symptoms. The pathological fragment of tau that we have identified resists forming tangles and can instead move freely throughout the cell. Therefore, we decided to look for other mechanisms that could affect synaptic function.  To do this, Dr. Ashe s group used fluorescent labeling to track and compare the behavior of normal and mutated tau in cultured neurons from the rat hippocampus, the brain region most associated with learning and memory. Unlike normal tau, both mutated tau and the short fragment produced when caspase-2 cuts tau were primarily found within structures called dendritic spines, where neurons receive inputs from neighboring cells. The overabundance of mutated tau, including the caspase-2-produced fragment, caused disruptions in synaptic function in the spines. The impact on synapses was specific, with no observed effects on the overall structure or survival of the neurons.  It appears that abnormally processed tau is disrupting the ability of neurons to properly respond to the signals that they receive, producing memory deficits independent of tangle formation,  said Dr. Ashe.  Because this effect is occurring without cell death or a loss of synapses, we have a better chance of intervening in the process and hopefully reversing symptoms of the disease.  Dr. Ashe and her team are now planning additional experiments to uncover the mechanisms by which abnormally processed mutant tau produces memory deficits. The study was supported by the NIH (NS63214 and NS79374) with additional funding provided by the T. and P. Grossman Family Foundation, B. Grossman, and K. Moe.

Jianguo Gu, PhD, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), has now unraveled how the sensory information is processed in the Merkel discs and further conveyed to the ending of a sensory nerve, the start of its journey to the brain. See Also: Neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations Such molecular understanding about the sensory information transmission between Merkel cells and nerve endings may lay the foundation to treat the intense pain felt by patients with a gentle touch of their inflamed skin a pathological pain known as tactile allodynia. This knowledge may also point to how diabetes patients lose their sense of touch. And this new knowledge may lead to preventive care. ""Cancer patients often have touch-induced pain after chemotherapy,"" said Gu, the Edward A. Ernst, MD, Endowed Professor in the UAB Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine. ""Touch-induced pain is also commonly seen in clinical conditions such as fibromyalgia, traumatic injury and in inflammation from sunburn. Our new findings may have profound implications in these conditions."" A Merkel disc consists of a Merkel cell and a closely associated nerve ending that branches from a single sensory nerve. Until recently, it was unclear how the physical pressure of a light touch gets transduced from a mechanical force to an electrical nerve signal in Merkel discs. In 2014, Gu's research team overturned the common assumption that transduction from the mechanical force takes place at the endings of the sensory nerves in Merkel discs. Instead, as he reported in the journal Cell, that mechanical transduction at Merkel discs initiates primarily in the Merkel cells. His team further pinpointed that a new ion channel in the Merkel cells called Piezo2 is the mechanical transducing molecule. Related: New findings on how brain handles tactile sensations Now Gu and colleagues have discovered how the signal transduced by Piezo2 is passed from the Merkel cells to the nerve endings. They report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the Piezo2 transducer triggers Merkel cells to release the neurotransmitter serotonin. This serotonin crosses the tiny gap to the nerve ending, where it activates 5-HT receptors and triggers nerve impulses. Such gaps from one nerve cell to the next are called synapses, and they are conventional in neural communication. The newly discovered Merkel cell-nerve ending synapse is unique, Gu says, ""because it is the only example of a synapse formed between a non-neuronal cell and a nerve cell, and it is the first synapse that is found underneath the skin."" Other types of sensory nerves from the skin which detect sensations like heat, cold or pain have their first synapse at the point where the sensory nerve meets the spinal column. Elucidation of a Merkel disc serotonin synapse in the skin opens several areas for future investigation. Don't Miss: Paying attention makes touch-sensing brain cells fire rapidly and in sync ""The serotonergic transmission in the epidermis, probably like that in the central nervous system, can be regulated by factors affecting serotonin uptake and release,"" Gu and colleagues write in their PNAS paper. ""This raises an interesting issue as to whether serotonin uptake inhibitors, such as cocaine, methamphetamine and other recreational drugs in this category, may act at the epidermal serotonergic synapses to alter tactile sensations. It would also be interesting to know whether the epidermal serotonergic transmission may be altered under pathological conditions in patients with diabetes, tissue inflammation and undergoing chemotherapy, because tactile dysfunctions including mechanical allodynia and reduced tactile sensitivity are commonly observed in these patients."" In humans and other primates, Merkel discs are concentrated in the fingertips, and lesser numbers are also found in other areas of the skin. ""They can sense the wind blowing on your skin,"" Gu said. Intriguingly, Merkel discs in nonprimate mammals are concentrated in whisker hair follicles at the base of their whisker hairs. Thus, a mouse whisker can act as a model for a human fingertip. Read Next: Touch-sensing neurons are multitaskers ""Nonprimate animals can use their whiskers to sense texture, shape and other physical properties of an object,"" Gu said.

Everett Koop Institute have shown. In the Dartmouth study, a particular gene that has been linked previously to obesity is now shown to play a role in overeating among children exposed to food cues such as TV food advertising. See Also: Obesity is associated with brain s neurotransmitters In a randomized experiment, 172 children aged 9-10 years ate lunch until they were full and then were immediately shown a 34-minute television show that contained either food or toy advertisements at normal commercial breaks. The children were given snacks that they could eat while watching the show. The researchers then measured how much the children ate and tested them for genetic variations in the Fat Mass and Obesity Associated Gene, known as FTO. The results of the study showed that children who watched food advertisements consumed an average of 41 percent more calories of a recently advertised food than those who watched ads for toys. The study further showed that the effect of food advertisements on overeating differed by FTO genotype, with the effect more than three times as large for children at the highest genetic risk.

This is due to a tiny change in a receptor molecule on cells called TrkA, as a research team from the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) has now discovered. The work, which appears in the journal Cell Reports, may be important for pain therapy in humans. When an animal suffers an injury or inflammation, nearby tissue usually becomes highly sensitive to pain. Skin becomes red and puffy, for example, and is hypersensitive to heat. This condition, called ""thermal hyperalgesia,"" acts as a warning that helps animals avoid further injuries. See Also: Implantable wireless devices trigger and may block pain signals? The only known animals unable to feel thermal hyperalgesia are naked mole-rats, rodents which live in extremely harsh conditions in underground tunnels. MDC researchers Dr. Damir Omerbasic and Dr. Ewan St. J. Smith from Prof. Gary Lewin's lab now found out the reasons and presented their work in Cell Reports. Hyperalgesia is mediated by the signaling molecule nerve growth factor (NGF), which is also responsible for the growth of new nerves, especially during embryonic development. Hyperalgesia occurs when inflamed or injured tissue releases NGF molecules which subsequently bind to protein molecules on the surfaces of specialized, pain-sensing nerve cells. These surface proteins are called TrkA receptors, and when they are stimulated by NGF they relay a signal into the nerve cell. This causes other proteins to interact with the receptor, starting a cascade of biochemical signals which ultimately makes the cell oversensitive to thermal stimuli. TrkA receptors evolved in an ancient animal and have been passed down to all its descendants. TrkA is so important that it has been protected from most evolutionary change. When the researchers compared the receptor of naked mole-rats to TrkA receptors in other mammals, they found minute differences in a region of the molecule that projects into the cell interior. This region triggers the biochemical signaling cascade and is virtually identical in all mammals. Related: New technologies can help short circuit chronic pain In naked mole-rats, the differences in this portion of the receptor alter a few of the protein's building blocks and severely diminishes the signal-relaying action of the TrkA receptor. The researchers found that it took ten times the amount of NGF compared to TrkA receptors from other animals to trigger the signaling cascade, explaining why naked mole-rats are almost completely insensitive to thermal hyperalgesia. NGF has another important function: it stimulates the growth and maintenance of nerves as the nervous system develops in the embryo. That's why defects of the TrkA receptor in other mammals often lead to a degeneration of the nervous system during embryonic development. ""The nervous system of the naked mole-rat can develop normally because while the function of its TrkA receptors is lowered, it is not completely abolished,"" principal investigator Gary Lewin explains. ""Evolution has selected a version of the molecule that can send just enough signal to build a proper nervous system, but not enough to make cells hypersensitive to pain."" The difference surely makes life more bearable for the rodents, which live underground in densely packed colonies. Injuries and inflammations are common, and under the same conditions other mammals would suffer intense, continual pain. Don't Miss:  Pain sensing  gene discovery could help in development of new methods of pain relief That's a daily experience for many people who suffer from chronic pain. In many cases the problem also involves NGF and TrkA; treatments that block the binding of these two molecules have had very positive effects in clinical trials. It's another example, Gary says, of how basic research even when it starts in a very unusual animal could pave the way toward new human therapies.

The groups will study and translate essential cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders into novel therapeutic strategies for diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s. Professor Rubinsztein is Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics and Deputy Director of the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research. He also holds the appointment of Lead Academic Scientist of the Alzheimer s Research UK Cambridge Drug Discovery Institute. Professor Rubinsztein s laboratory is a world leader in cell autophagy, which is a natural pathway that monitors and degrades defective proteins in healthy cells. Therapeutic regulation of this pathway has the promise to reverse or prevent the deposition of aggregation-prone proteins in nerve cells that lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, few druggable targets have yet been discovered that modulate the autophagy pathway. To address this issue, PhoreMost will work with cutting edge autophagy models from Professor Rubinsztein s lab. PhoreMost will apply its novel SITESEEKER  discovery technology to comprehensively screen for  hidden  targets and drug sites that are the most relevant for treating neurodegenerative disorders. The studies have the potential to reveal novel insights for previously unknown autophagy signalling components, which could suggest rapid and innovative starting points for new drug treatments. Dr Chris Torrance, CEO of PhoreMost Ltd., commented:  We are very excited to be joining forces with Professor Rubinsztein, whose expert insights into neurodegenerative diseases will enable PhoreMost to expand into this important yet therapeutically unmet disease area of aging, and thereby complement our growing oncology discovery pipeline. This collaboration with the Rubinsztein research team fits our scientific and corporate mantra: find and drug the best disease targets, even if they are currently considered impossible, and engage closely with experts to solve the problem.  Professor Rubinsztein said:  Autophagy is a fundamental protein quality control process in cells. It has the potential to significantly impact several neurodegenerative disorders, if we can recruit it to degrade intracellular, disease-causing, aggregate-prone proteins in the brain. Combing our cutting-edge research and cell models in this area with innovative techniques like SITESEEKER will enable us to exploit the full depth of targetable disease biology that is present in this pathway.  Both parties also highlight Professor Rubinsztein s position at the Alzheimer s Research UK Cambridge Drug Discovery Institute, a venture focused on early stage drug discovery based on targets identified by the academic community. Dr Torrance added:  The Drug Discovery Institute provides an innovative path for companies to translate early collaborations, like this current one we hold through the University, into later-stage research and development efforts. Like many new drug start-up companies, PhoreMost benefits greatly by working in collaborative networks such Alzheimer s Research UK s Drug Discovery Alliance, which is a creative initiative that shares PhoreMost s primary mission of translational research and rapid new medicine development.

This work builds upon their demonstrated ability to bioprint tissue constructs composed of multiple types of living cells patterned alongside a vascular network in an extracellular matrix. The Wyss team has also previously shown that these constructs could be scaled up to create thick, vascularized tissue constructs, sustained viable for more than a month in vitro. Now, in close collaboration with Roche Pharmaceuticals scientist Annie Moisan, they have leveraged their bioprinting and materials expertise to construct a functional 3D renal architecture containing living human epithelial cells, which line the surface of tubules in the kidney. The study appears online in the journal Scientific Reports. ""The current work further expands our bioprinting platform to create functional human tissue architectures with both technological and clinical relevance,"" said Lewis, who is also the Hansj rg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The 3D renal architecture created by Lewis' team mimics a proximal tubule, a serpentine hollow tube that is an essential part of each nephron. Every human kidney has over one million nephrons, which perform the vital function of transferring components between blood and urine. Inside the convolutions of a nephron's proximal tubules, 65-80% of nutrients are reabsorbed and transported from the renal filtrate back into the bloodstream. Therefore, the bioprinted 3D renal architecture recapitulates a very small - yet critical - subunit of a whole kidney. Lewis' team achieved this advance by adapting their earlier approach for bioprinting living cells to form thick tissues. Using a customizable, 3D-printed silicone gasket as a mold, they begin by casting an engineered extracellular matrix as a base layer. Next, a ""fugitive ink"" (which is eventually liquefied and removed from the final architecture) is printed in a convoluted, winding tubular shape similar to the structure of natural renal proximal tubules. This printed feature is then encapsulated with another layer of extracellular matrix. Finally, the entire construct is cooled, the fugitive ink is removed, and the result is an open tubule embedded within extracellular matrix. A single inlet and outlet on opposite ends of the tubule are first perfused with cell growth medium and then human proximal tubule cells, which quickly begin to adhere to the lining of the open channel. Eventually, these cells orient into a tightly packed monolayer that lines the entire length of the 3D renal architecture and acts as a cell barrier between the inner lumen of the tubule and the extracellular matrix outside. Nutrients, which perfuse the tubule through the inlet and outlet, nourish the living cells and a keep them alive and functional for more than two months. As the cells mature, the 3D renal architecture begins to perform the same important duties as a natural nephron's proximal tubule. Drugs or other factors can be pumped through the 3D renal architecture to investigate their nephrotoxicity and overall effects on the proximal tubule cells. Co-first authors of the study Kimberly Homan, Ph.D., a Wyss Research Associate, and David Kolesky, Ph.D., a Wyss Postdoctoral Fellow, stress that the most exciting aspect of the work is that - far beyond mimicking the form of the kidney's proximal tubule - it is a credible in vitro model that functions like living kidney tissue, representing a significant advance from traditional 2D cell culture. The team devoted great effort to characterizing the structure and biological function of the model. As a result, their approach could one day be scaled up and translated into an implant or organ-assistive device. In the near term, it may offer clinicians a patient-specific tool for assessing treatment options or diagnosing diseases and also give the pharmaceutical industry a powerful way to determine how drugs impact the health and function of the kidney's nephrons. ""The use of functional tissue-like models during pre-clinical studies will provide unprecedented insights into human-relevant drug response prior to clinical development,"" said Moisan, a Laboratory Head in Mechanistic Safety at Roche Pharmaceutical Sciences and author of this study. As a fabrication platform, the approach is flexible, scalable, and adaptable, meaning that in addition to working towards larger, scaled-up kidney constructs, the team also plans to explore development of other types of complex functional human tissues and organs. ""We have initially targeted this renal architecture, because the kidney represents such a pressing clinical need across the world,"" said Lewis. ""While thus far we have merely demonstrated a functioning subunit within the kidney, we are actively scaling up the method and its complexity to enable future in vivo applications."" ""This advance in 3D printing of living tissues that recapitulate crucial organ functions by Jennifer and her team opens a new path to engineering model systems for drug development, as well as for creating more functional extracorporeal devices and whole organ implants in the future,"" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., Founding Director of the Wyss Institute, Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.

Results of these preclinical studies are published in the Journal of Neuroscience. The technology, called designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, or DREADDs, is one of the most promising gene therapies for the future treatment of addiction in humans. See Also: Scientists unravel brain circuits involved in cravingsThe brains of people who use cocaine become hijacked by drug cues. Powerful memories are formed between these cues-such as the using environment and drug paraphernalia-and the dopamine flood that occurs from using the drug itself. In users trying to quit, these drug cues activate an intense desire to seek cocaine again. Resistance to relapse is partly mediated in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex-the brain region slightly above and behind our eyes, where previously learned associations are broken. This region of the brain stores extinction memory, which works to suppress the emotional response to drug cues, according to Jamie Peters, PhD, Research Assistant Professor in the MUSC Department of Neuroscience. ""Extinction doesn't overwrite the original memory,"" explained Peters. ""It just helps suppress the pathological component of the response."" Peters and her colleague Peter W. Kalivas, PhD, Chair of the MUSC Department of Neuroscience, wanted to know if the response to drug cues associated with the dopamine rush of cocaine could be suppressed when the extinction memory region was activated. To test their hypothesis, they obtained viruses carrying the DREADD gene from Bryan L. Roth, MD, PhD, in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. The DREADD technology is openly accessible to researchers around the world through the National Institutes of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, where Roth serves as director. Learn More: A BRAIN Initiative first: new tool can switch behavior  on  and  off The viruses work by inserting the DREADD gene directly into the genome of cells, causing them to grow receptors on their surface that are normal except for a slight alteration. These receptors express a protein encoded by the DREADD gene that allows them to be activated by a single drug designed to bind that protein. In this case, the Peters lab infused a virus carrying a DREADD gene designed to change surface receptors on neurons. After the neurons were infected, they would fire in response to administration of the designer drug. Because the body's other cells had not been infected with the DREADD gene, they would remain unaffected. ""This new approach for treating drug addiction is exactly what is needed because it is targeted to a specific circuit in the brain regulating addiction,"" said Kalivas. ""This may allow the circuit to be selectively regulated with minimum side effects on other circuits and brain functions."" The researchers allowed rats to self-administer cocaine by pressing one of two levers, one active and one inactive. Once a rat pressed the active lever, cocaine was delivered along with a brief audio tone and a pulse of light that would serve as the drug cues. After a series of daily cocaine exposure sessions, the rats had learned to associate the simple drug cues with cocaine availability. Then they were removed from the drug. Next a surgical technician infused virus carrying the DREADD gene directly into the rats' ventromedial prefrontal cortices. After two weeks of cocaine abstinence, the rats were placed back in front of the two levers in ten daily sessions, but this time the levers produced neither cues nor cocaine. The next day, rats were subjected to a relapse test where the cues were returned. Before testing, half of the rats were given designer drug and half were not. Next, rats underwent an additional relapse test where they were given a low dose of cocaine to trigger relapse. Read Next: Novel compound halts cocaine addiction and relapse behaviors The experiments worked. Rats that were given the designer drug relapsed less in the presence of drug reminder cues. However, when exposed to cocaine again, rats relapsed regardless of whether they were given the designer drug. In other words, Peters' hypothesis was correct: rats with activated extinction memories weren't as susceptible to relapse triggered by cocaine-associated cues but were still vulnerable when exposed to cocaine again. This meant that extinction memory retrieval reduced relapse triggered by reminder cues. This study shows that it is possible to use this technology to target a small population of cells in the brain that is important for regulating addiction, thereby inhibiting the drive to relapse to addictive drug use. In the future, Peters hopes that safe and effective viruses of this kind can be infused into the brains of human addicts during neurosurgery. A person would simply take a pill to activate the extinction memory region of their brain, helping them to suppress the urge to seek out drug in the face of those reminder cues. Since extinction memory isn't as powerful as the emotional response to a drug, this strategy could work when paired with effective psychological counseling approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Clinicians interested in using DREADDs in humans will have to remain patient, however. DREADDs have to be designed to match drugs that suppress only memories of drug cues while leaving other memories unaffected. And the crystal structure of newer human-appropriate designer drugs bound with the special receptors is being actively investigated in order to visualize exactly how they might work some day in patients with cocaine addiction. Don't Miss: Cocaine addiction, craving, relapse: Paradigm shift in treatment holds promise, thanks to epigenetics ""Certainly within my lifetime I would expect to see these virus-mediated gene therapies start to be used in the brain, in a neurosurgical setting,"" said Peters.

That's the question concerning University of California, Irvine (UCI) scientists probing a phenomenon called ""space brain."" UCI's Charles Limoli and colleagues found that exposure to highly energetic charged particles much like those found in the galactic cosmic rays that will bombard astronauts during extended spaceflights causes significant long-term brain damage in test rodents, resulting in cognitive impairments and dementia. See Also: Three-minute test detects common form of dementia that's hard to diagnose Their study appears in Nature's Scientific Reports. It follows one last year showing somewhat shorter-term brain effects of galactic cosmic rays. The current findings, Limoli said, raise much greater alarm. ""This is not positive news for astronauts deployed on a two-to-three-year round trip to Mars,"" said the professor of radiation oncology in UCI's School of Medicine. ""The space environment poses unique hazards to astronauts. Exposure to these particles can lead to a range of potential central nervous system complications that can occur during and persist long after actual space travel such as various performance decrements, memory deficits, anxiety, depression and impaired decision-making. Many of these adverse consequences to cognition may continue and progress throughout life."" For the study, rodents were subjected to charged particle irradiation (fully ionized oxygen and titanium) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at New York's Brookhaven National Laboratory and then sent to Limoli's UCI lab. Six months after exposure, the researchers still found significant levels of brain inflammation and damage to neurons. Imaging revealed that the brain's neural network was impaired through the reduction of dendrites and spines on these neurons, which disrupts the transmission of signals among brain cells. These deficiencies were parallel to poor performance on behavioral tasks designed to test learning and memory. Learn More: Tissue biomarker for dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease identified In addition, the Limoli team discovered that the radiation affected ""fear extinction,"" an active process in which the brain suppresses prior unpleasant and stressful associations, as when someone who nearly drowned learns to enjoy water again. ""Deficits in fear extinction could make you prone to anxiety,"" Limoli said, ""which could become problematic over the course of a three-year trip to and from Mars."" Most notably, he said, these six-month results mirror the six-week post-irradiation findings of a 2015 study he conducted that appeared in the May issue of Science Advances. Similar types of more severe cognitive dysfunction are common in brain cancer patients who have received high-dose, photon-based radiation treatments. In other research, Limoli examines the impact of chemotherapy and cranial irradiation on cognition. While dementia-like deficits in astronauts would take months to manifest, he said, the time required for a mission to Mars is sufficient for such impairments to develop. People working for extended periods on the International Space Station, however, do not face the same level of bombardment with galactic cosmic rays because they are still within the Earth's protective magnetosphere. Limoli's work is part of NASA's Human Research Program. Investigating how space radiation affects astronauts and learning ways to mitigate those effects are critical to further human exploration of space, and NASA needs to consider these risks as it plans for missions to Mars and beyond.

Professor Adela Ben-Yakar and her team of postdocs and graduate students   Sudip Mondal, Evan Hegarty, Christopher Martin, Sertan Kutal G k e and Navid Ghorashian   describe their new platform in a study published in the journal Nature Communications on Oct. 11.  The team believes their platform will allow researchers and pharmaceutical companies to undertake image-based analysis of thousands of live, 1-millimeter-long roundworms, called Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), simultaneously and at the speed and cost of in vitro cell-based platforms.  Ben-Yakar, a researcher in the Departments of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, led the design of the new platform, which takes the form of a cellphone-size chip that can immobilize and analyze small animal models using a high-powered microscope. The platform is similar to screening platforms for cells, but it can screen a whole organism made of multiple cells by immobilizing thousands of them inside micro-traps to prevent their natural movement. In addition, the platform can automatically understand data using image analysis software, which was also developed by the researchers. This information can help determine whether a drug is effectively treating a disease in the roundworms. The researchers  microfluidic device is designed to simultaneously image approximately 3,600 roundworms at high resolutions and high speeds, ranging from 12 to 16 minutes. Today s conventional platforms can image only a few animals within such a short time. The device also has the ability to assess the efficacy of many different drug compounds at once. Whereas other microfluidic platforms used today are capable of analyzing only one drug compound at a time, the researchers  new platform can assess 96. The roundworms, which are desirable in the study of neurodegenerative diseases because they have full nervous systems and a diverse group of neurons, are also the first multicellular organism to have a completely sequenced genome. Approximately one-third of C. elegans  genes are the same as disease-causing genes in humans.   The C. elegans are thousands of times bigger than cells, so now that we have developed a way to capture and immobilize so many of them so quickly, we can determine much more information about the efficacy of drugs in a whole organism rather than the limited information that is derived when we used isolated individual cells,  Ben-Yakar said.  What sets the chip apart from existing platforms is that it is capable of high-throughput screening, the study of thousands to hundreds of thousands of compounds in a rapid and very high-resolution manner, and high-content fluorescence screening, which allows for a faster yet more in-depth analysis of the animals  phenotype.  Made of a flexible polymer, the microfluidic chip contains 96 wells for receiving drug-treated animals. Underneath each well are special microchannels that can trap 40 roundworms. A tapered design squeezes the C. elegans into microchannels in a flat orientation that can be more easily imaged. The microfluidic chip then relies on a gasket system that applies pressure to the chambers to immobilize the roundworms.   This proof-of-principle study opens the door to using this technology to identify and develop treatments for some of the most intractable human diseases,  said Anne Hart, a professor of neuroscience at Brown University who has followed the development of the chip. To demonstrate the efficiency of their patent-pending device, the team analyzed approximately 1,000 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration aimed at treating the protein aggregation found in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington s disease. In doing so, they were surprised to find a potential drug that is particularly effective at treating Huntington s.  Four of the drugs we tested were effective at treating a protein aggregation model that is directly related to Huntington s, and one of these drugs became even more effective at increased doses without causing toxicity,  Ben-Yakar said.

It was thought to have been comprehensively studied, but scientists at the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) have now discovered a new layer of PKA regulation and published their findings in Nature Communications. The MDC research team headed by Dr. Oliver Rocks is investigating the mechanisms that control the remodeling of the cell skeleton. During a screen of proteins involved in this process the scientists made an interesting discovery   they noticed that one of the proteins binds the catalytic subunit of the PKA.  We were surprised to find the catalytic subunit of PKA, because normally control of this pathway is through the regulatory subunit,  says the researcher. In the classical model of PKA regulation, the regulatory subunits dock onto the catalytic ones and stop them sending signals. They only release the catalytic subunits when the cell receives a signal that increases the levels of the cellular chemical cAMP. cAMP clips onto the regulatory subunits and force them to set the catalytic subunits free. In the screen the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAC) was binding to a protein called ARHGAP36. For her PhD research in Dr. Rocks s lab, Rebecca Eccles investigated how ARHGAP36 interacts with PKAC. She worked with other scientists at the MDC, the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), as well as partners at the University of Liverpool. Eccles found that ARHGAP36 can turn off PKAC in two ways: by binding to it and blocking its action, and by sending it on the path to one of the cell s degradation centers. PKA s job in the cell is to pass on signals, which the catalytic subunit does by its kinase action   kinases attach a phosphate molecule to their target proteins (substrates). ARHGAP36 stops PKAC from binding its substrates in much the same way as a key stuck in a lock prevents you opening a door. Because PKA occurs in almost all tissues, the researchers wanted to identify where and when it is inhibited by ARHGAP36.  ARGAP36 is a strong inhibitor, so you wouldn t want it turning off PKA everywhere,  Rocks explains. He and his team found that ARHGAP36 is not present in all cells all the time   in fact its expression is quite limited, for example to embryonic muscle cells. Abnormally high levels of ARHGAP3 are also found in at least one of the four subtypes of medulloblastoma, the most common childhood brain cancer, as well as in neuroblastoma, another frequent cancer of the nervous system in children. The exact biological role of ARHGAP36 is not yet understood, but it may well play a role in muscle development and in tumor progression in some cancers. For example, changes in PKA signaling could influence tumor growth in many types of cancer. Understanding how signaling pathways are controlled may also be useful in drug development since it opens up opportunities for regulating proteins indirectly and thus blocking enzymes that are otherwise hard to manipulate.","Published: October 11, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-life-cycle-of-proteins-211600,The Life Cycle of Proteins Systems biology study discovers proteins that become more stable with increasing age ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Some proteins behave in an unusual way: the older they become, the more stable they are. A research team at the Max Delbr ck Center in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) has now published this surprising finding in the journal Cell. Their work has traced the life cycle of thousands of proteins from synthesis to disposal. The results are relevant for diseases where there are surplus copies of certain genes. Throughout their lives, proteins have a plethora of different tasks and finally are being disposed in an orderly manner. Scientists had thought that young and old proteins carry the same risk of being degraded. While this is true for most proteins, around one-tenth of the analyzed proteins don't behave that way. Once these special proteins manage to reach a particular age, they remain unusually stable and live longer than expected. This is the surprising finding of an international research team headed by Prof. Matthias Selbach of the MDC and Charit -Universit tsmedizin Berlin in the prestigious journal Cell. Working with partners from the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces and other labs, the researchers traced the life cycle of thousands of proteins from synthesis to disposal. Tracking the life of proteins The researchers tracked the protein's lifecycles in cultures of human and mouse cells with a method called mass spectrometry, allowing them to watch the creation and disposal of specific molecules over time. The measurements revealed that the cell initially produces an excessive number of certain types of proteins, the majority of which are immediately degraded. Those that remained then become stable. The consequences of a gene overdose This would explain why additional copies of a gene do not automatically result in more copies of a protein, as scientists would normally expect. In cases of trisomy, for example, an organism has three copies of a chromosome rather than two, normally leading to an overproduction of the proteins encoded by the genes on that chromosome. This often creates imbalances and leads to internal disequilibrium and stress for the cell. For the proteins with the newly discovered properties, however, the cell can maintain equilibrium by simply dismantling copies of the protein early on, when too many are present.  We are now better able to explain the relationship between the 'dose' or rate of a gene's productivity and the resulting quantity of the protein it encodes,  explains lead investigator Prof. Matthias Selbach. Most cases of trisomies result in the death of an organism prior to birth. But in the case in which humans contain three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21, the cause of Down syndrome), the consequences are less serious. The reason why trisomies of different chromosomes result in such a diversity of effects is unclear, but this may be due to the lifecycles of some proteins encoded on the affected chromosome. Selbach is therefore keen to follow up the study with further research.  We are now looking at other cells with an abnormal genetic makeup, in order to improve our understanding of the consequences of multiplied gene segments,  he says.","Published: October 11, 2016"

The early-stage findings, by scientists from Imperial College London, open avenues for potential new treatments for the disease. In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team used a type of modified virus to deliver a gene to brain cells. The research was funded by Alzheimer s Research UK and the European Research Council. Previous studies by the same  team suggest this gene, called PGC1   alpha, may prevent the formation of a protein called amyloid-beta peptide in cells in the lab.  Amyloid-beta peptide is the main component of amyloid plaques, the sticky clumps of protein found in the brains of people with Alzheimer s disease. These plaques are thought to trigger the death of brain cells. Alzheimer s disease affects around 520,000 people in the UK. Symptoms include memory loss, confusion, and change in mood or personality. Worldwide 47.5 million people are affected by dementia   of which Alzheimer s is the most common form. There is no cure, although current drugs can help treat the symptoms of the disease.  Dr Magdalena Sastre, senior author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, hopes the new findings may one day provide a method of preventing the disease, or halting it in the early stages. She explained:  Although these findings are very early they suggest this gene therapy may have potential therapeutic use for patients. There are many hurdles to overcome, and at the moment the only way to deliver the gene is via an injection directly into the brain. However this proof-of-concept study shows this approach warrants further investigation.  The modified virus used in the experiments was called a lentivirus vector, and is commonly used in gene therapy explained Professor Nicholas Mazarakis, co-author of the study from the Department of Medicine:  Scientists harness the way lentivirus infects cells to produce a modified version of the virus, that delivers genes into specific cells. It is being used in experiments to treat a range of conditions from arthritis to cancer. We have previously successfully used the lentivirus vector in clinical trials to deliver genes into the brains of Parkinson s disease patients.  In the new study, the team injected the virus, containing the gene PGC-1   alpha, into two areas of the brain in mice susceptible to Alzheimer s disease.  The areas targeted were the hippocampus and the cortex, as these are the first regions to develop amyloid plaques in Alzheimer s disease.  Damage to the hippocampus affects short-term memory, and leads to a person forgetting recent events, such as a conversation or what they ate for breakfast. The hippocampus is also responsible for orientation, and damage results in a person becoming lost on familiar journeys, such as driving home from the shops. The cortex, meanwhile, is responsible for long-term memory, reasoning, thinking and mood. Damage can trigger symptoms such as depression, struggling to work out how much money to give at a checkout, how to get dressed or how to cook a familiar recipe. The animals were treated at the early stages of Alzheimer s disease, when they still had not developed amyloid plaques. After four months, the team found that mice who received the gene had very few amyloid plaques when compared with the untreated mice, which had multiple plaques in their brain.  Furthermore, the treated mice performed as well in memory tasks as healthy mice. The tasks included challenges such as replacing a familiar object in the mouse s cage with a new one. If the mice had a healthy memory, they would explore the new object for longer. The team also discovered there was no loss of brain cells in the hippocampus of the mice who received the gene treatment. In addition to this, the treated mice had a reduction in the number of glial cells, which in Alzheimer s disease can release toxic inflammatory substances that cause further cell damage.  The protein PGC-1   alpha, which is coded by the gene, is involved in metabolic processes in the body, including regulation of sugar and fat metabolism.  Dr Sastre added that other studies from different institutions suggest physical exercise and the compound resveratrol, found in red wine, may increase levels of PGC-1   alpha protein. However, resveratrol has only been found to have benefits as a pill, rather than in wine, as the alcohol counteracts any benefit. The team suggest injections of the gene would be most beneficial in the early stages of the disease, when the first symptoms appear. They now hope to explore translating their findings into human treatments, said Dr Sastre.  We are still years from using this in the clinic. However, in a disease that urgently needs new options for patients, this work provides hope for future therapies.  Dr David Reynolds, Chief Scientific Officer at Alzheimer s Research UK, said:  There are currently no treatments able to halt the progression of damage in Alzheimer s, so studies like this are important for highlighting new and innovative approaches to take us towards that goal. This research sets a foundation for exploring gene therapy as a treatment strategy for Alzheimer s disease, but further studies are needed to establish whether gene therapy would be safe, effective and practical to use in people with the disease. The findings support PGC-1-alpha as a potential target for the development of new medicines, which is a promising step on the road towards developing treatments for this devastating condition.

In many patients, however, tumors recur after immunotherapy. In the latest issue of the Journal of Experimental Medicine, the members of a research team from the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in the Helmholtz Association, the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), and Charit    Universit tsmedizin Berlin explain why some tumors recur and how this can be prevented. The findings will aid the selection of suitable targets for immunotherapy.   One form of immunotherapy for cancer is T-cell receptor gene therapy. It involves removing T-cells (a type of immune cell) from the blood and altering them in the test tube to enable them to target cancer cells. The cells are then re-introduced into the patient s bloodstream, where they find and destroy the tumor cells. In clinical trials, this procedure has proved effective for some types of cancer, but it has often been found that new tumors recurred after treatment.  The tumors are not recognized by the T-cells,  explains biologist Dr. Ana Textor. The postdoc researcher in the team headed by Prof. Thomas Blankenstein at the MDC and the Charit  is the lead author of the current study.  We want to find out how to reduce the frequency with which the cancer recurs after treatment,  says Dr. Textor. T-cells kill cells bearing certain molecules on their surface To achieve this, Textor focused on a particular molecule on the cell surface, the epitope. Epitopes are at the heart of the immune response. They are produced inside the cell by specialized enzymes, which split and trim proteins into short fragments and send them to the cell surface as epitopes. In cancer, proteins are pathologically altered through mutation; they too appear on the cell surface, in this case as  neo-epitopes. A cell with a neo-epitope can be recognized by T-cells, which then destroy the cell. Some epitopes escape the modified T-cells Successful T-cell receptor gene therapy involves training T-cells with the help of a suitable neo-epitope. T-cells are modified to recognize the neo-epitope and thus recognize and destroy the tumor. In their experiments, the researchers trained two different types of T-cell, each of which recognized one of two epitopes that are characteristic of tumors. One of the T-cell types permanently destroyed the tumors in a mouse model. After treatment with the other T-cell type, initial tumor regression was followed by recurrence. Epitopes are produced in the cell in different ways The researchers found that when the tumor recurred, the epitopes were no longer present on the cell surface in sufficient quantity. This was because the epitopes in these cancer cells were no longer correctly trimmed enzymatically   in this case by the enzyme ERAAP.ERAAP is not being properly activated until the cell is stimulated by the signal molecule interferon gamma.The tumor cells, however, were insensitive to interferon gamma and could no longer be recognized by the T-cells because they were no longer producing the epitope. By contrast, the epitopes on the cells of the successfully treated tumor did not require processing by ERAAP and were therefore also not dependent on stimulation by interferon gamma. The new findings thus represent an important step towards the more successful application of T-cell receptor gene therapy, as Textor explains:  Epitopes that do not need processing by the enzyme ERAAP are therefore likely to be a better choice for immunotherapy.

At present, however, reading DNA sequences from genomes using current next generation sequencing methods is still a costly endeavor restricted to well-equipped laboratories. Now, Church s team at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and the Harvard Medical School developed a new electronic DNA sequencing platform based on biologically engineered nanopores that could help overcome these limitations. The method is reported in PNAS. ""In this study, we have explored the foundation for a highly scalable, accurate, single-molecule DNA sequencing platform with the potential for extensive sampling of environmental genomes, of pathogens as well as long DNA reads at lower costs, transforming precision medicine,"" said Church, Ph.D., who is Core Faculty Member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, leader of its Synthetic Biology Platform, and Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. Since the 1990s, Church and other researchers have been investigating an alternative method to sequence DNA called nanopore-based sequencing-by-synthesis (Nanopore-SBS). Nanopores are tiny holes within a membrane separating two different electrolyte solutions. By applying a voltage differential, a continuous stream of small charged ion molecules can be made to pass through each pore, from one side of the membrane to the other. The changes in current produced allow researchers to interpret the molecules  shapes and tell their identities. In his previous Nano-SBS work, Church applied this principle to the electric discrimination of the four DNA nucleotides. With the help of the enzyme DNA polymerase, the DNA template of unknown sequence is copied into the complementary string composed of the four different nucleotides, each of them carrying a nucleotide-specific synthetic tag. The bulky tags are then successively released into the nanopore where they can be identified in real time. The method is complicated when several DNA polymerase molecules copy their DNA template sequences into complementary nucleotide strings that get mixed up in the nanopore and also trigger a mixed series of changes in the pore s electric current. ""A key problem of the method at the time is that it lacked accuracy. This is because more than one complementary DNA strand is synthesized close to the nanopore opening, which produces jumbled electrical signals inside the pore that don t anymore relate to a single original DNA template molecule. But we have now engineered a new sequencing engine that gives robust and reliable sequencing results, can be loaded with different DNA templates, and can be highly multiplexed in a chip composed of hundreds nanopores individually addressable by electrodes,"" said P. Benjamin Stranges, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow working with Church and one of the two first authors of the study. This new sequencing engine contains seven protein subunits that together build a suitable nanopore complex. Only one of them can be specifically conjugated to a DNA polymerase enzyme that is positioned right at the pore opening. Being able to multiplex and individually analyze many DNA sequences electronically on the same chip at the same time, compared with conventional sequencing procedures performed with much less throughput, as well as expensive reagents and machines, has the potential to dramatically lower the costs of sequencing. ""We are able to identify the correct nucleotide between 79%-99% of the time and only found background events classified as true captures less than 1.2% of the time,"" said Mirk  Palla, Ph.D., the second first author of the study and a Research Fellow at the Wyss Institute. ""This presents a remarkable advance over previous Nanopore-SBS systems."" Other authors of the study were from the Center for Genome Technology and Biomolecular Engineering and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, and Genia Technologies, which also provided the semiconductor chips. ""This technology is a great example of how our deep understanding of how living systems function at the molecular scale can be leveraged to develop breakthrough technologies,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and also Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

It has been thought that the environment in which particular cancer cells live could impact their response to specific drugs, but until now, it s been difficult to analyze exactly how mechanics   specifically stiffness of the extracellular material that surrounds cells and structures tissues   alter a drug s efficacy. At Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, scientists have now found a way to analyze how the stiffness of this ""extracellular matrix"" affects chemotherapy treatment. Wyss Core Faculty member David Mooney, Ph.D., is the senior author on the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences report that details the novel method. Working with Jae-Won Shin, Ph.D., Mooney has unveiled a new drug screening assay using alginate hydrogels   biocompatible materials made from a polysaccharide found in brown seaweed   which can be tuned to recapitulate mechanical stiffness and other physical properties that are characteristic within tumor and normal tissue. ""To have success with chemotherapy and other drug therapies, we will likely need to screen their effectiveness against cells living in various environments, and not just assume that cells will always respond to a drug the same way that they would in conventional cell culture,"" said Mooney, who is also the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Mooney s team has previously analyzed and confirmed the importance of mechanical cues by developing tunable alginate hydrogels for applications such as tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, stimulation of blood vessel formation, and bone and cartilage repair. Now, Mooney and Shin have designed a 3D microenvironment with tunable matrix stiffness, inside of which cancer cells can be bombarded with drugs and their resistance (or destruction) observed. By varying matrix stiffness, they demonstrated that mechanical cues control how cancer cells respond to chemotherapy drugs. For many drugs, the softer the matrix, the more that cancer cells resisted treatment. Using this approach, a wide array of different cellular environments mimicking various tissues in the body could be used to more realistically screen cancer cells for their responses to potential drugs, allowing the right drug regimen to be selected for treating a specific patient s type of cancer and its location. Mooney and Shin implanted the same hydrogels in mice to investigate in vivo if matrix softening would accelerate cancer growth and increase its resistance to chemotherapy   and indeed, it did. In the future, 3D hydrogels could better identify promising drugs early on in the discovery process, and much farther down the pipeline, potentially be used to design personalized cancer drug therapy to overcome resistance. ""We envision that our 3D hydrogels could bridge the gap between in vitro drug screening and in vivo pre-clinical studies,"" said Shin, who was formerly a Wyss Institute Postdoctoral Fellow and is currently Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Bioengineering at University of Illinois at Chicago. Although Mooney and Shin have initially zeroed in on using the method to improve cancer treatment, it could be used more broadly to screen drugs for their efficacy in treating a number of different diseases throughout the body. ""It is crucial that we consider the importance of the local tissue microenvironment when designing new cancer therapies, as we now understand that mechanics is as important as biochemistry,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard SEAS. ""These engineered 3D hydrogels, which enable investigators to mimic the mechanical environment of cancers in different organs, also potentially offer a new approach to developing precision medicine therapies being that could be tailored to patient-specific tumor environments.""","Published: October 11, 2016"

He was leaning to one side and seemed to lose his balance easily. When he became lethargic and started vomiting a few days later on Dec. 28, she knew action was needed. Following tests, they were sent to Seattle Children s for further testing and to find an answer. Unfortunately, further analysis determined it to be a brain tumor.  Tumor Paint sheds some light Hunter was immediately scheduled for surgery to remove the brain tumor that was the size of a golf ball. In preparing for the operation, Coffman and her husband, Atom, were also presented with the opportunity to enroll Hunter in Seattle Children s Phase 1 trial of BLZ-100 Tumor Paint. Since tumor cells can be difficult to distinguish from healthy cells, the drug aims to improve surgical outcomes by acting as a molecular flashlight that allows surgeons to visibly distinguish a tumor from normal brain tissue.  We didn t see how it could hurt and we wanted them to use every tool at their disposal so we enrolled him in the trial,  said Coffman. Dec. 30 was the day of Hunter s surgery. Another day the Coffman s will never forget.  As a parent you know that your child may never be the same after brain surgery   they may not be able to see, walk or speak,  Coffman said.  It s the risk you have to take to save their life. But we trusted our surgeon, Dr. Amy Lee, with everything we had.  Prior to surgery, BLZ-100 Tumor Paint was administered by intravenous injection. In the operating room, the tumor glows green when viewed under a laser light and imaged with a near-infrared camera system. BLZ-100 Tumor Paint was invented by a team led by Dr. Jim Olson, pediatric neuro-oncologist at Seattle Children s and Fred Hutch and co-founder of Blaze Bioscience: The Tumor Paint Company. While this Phase 1 trial is focused on examining the safety of the drug and how well it targets tumor tissue, the hope is that it will eventually help guide skilled surgeons to prevent the removal of healthy tissue that can lead to serious long-term side effects.  Cure is not just about successful treatment of a tumor, but successful treatment of a child,  said Dr. Sarah Leary, principal investigator for the trial and Hunter s oncologist at Seattle Children s.  Much of cancer treatment for children is a trade-off where curative therapy comes with serious long-term side effects. By lighting the way for expert surgeons, we re hopeful that BLZ-100 Tumor Paint could help improve the quality of life for children by reducing treatment-related damage to the healthy brain.  Hunter s surgery went well and the majority of his tumor was removed. One small piece on his brain stem was intentionally left because removal may have led to serious neurological injury. After surgery, it was not long until Hunter was back to his young self.  We were incredibly lucky to have such an amazing surgeon and we were thrilled that he was able to bounce back so quickly,  said Coffman.  He was able to walk, run and put words together only weeks after the operation.  What s next for BLZ-100 Tumor Paint in children Since the trial began in June 2015, Seattle Children s has performed 15 brain surgeries with BLZ-100 Tumor Paint. To date, none of the patients have had any negative side effects and Leary and her team are working to determine the best dose. The drug also appears to be doing what it was designed to do   make tumor tissue glow.  We have been excited to see that BLZ-100 Tumor Paint is binding to many different types of brain tumors in children and so far has not resulted in any side effects,  said Leary.  We are optimistic that in the future it could be an incredible tool when placed in the expert hands of a neurosurgeon that could lead to improved patient outcomes.  Dr. Amy Lee, the lead neurosurgeon in the trial and Hunter s surgeon, adds,  We believe BLZ-100 Tumor Paint holds tremendous potential and eventually could be a valuable aid for surgeons in differentiating tumor from healthy tissue, particularly when there are areas of question.  Leary said their goal is that this Phase 1 trial at Seattle Children s, which has the largest pediatric Brain Tumor Program and the most pediatric neurosurgeons in the Northwest, will be followed by other studies that lead BLZ-100 Tumor Paint to become a part of standard care for brain tumor surgery. The next step will be to determine the effectiveness of the drug, which will involve a larger collaborative study that will involve 15 of the leading pediatric brain tumor centers across the country.  In the future, I hope we ll look back and wonder how these surgeries were ever done without the lights on,  said Leary.","Published: October 11, 2016"

The researchers believe the method they developed will help others who are trying to make many edits at once to any organism s genome.  We are changing the way the DNA code is being translated. Most organisms on Earth use 64 codons to translate their DNA into proteins. Our recoded E. coli is designed to use only 57 codons. We are pushing to unprecedented levels the technologies available for changing whole genomes... We don t know of any other organism that uses only 57 codons, and it will be very interesting to investigate the effects of large-scale codon exchange.  said Nili Ostrov, a George Church lab postdoctoral researcher who was part of the research team. The team aimed to make over 60,000 genome modifications in order to replace seven codons at once. This was achieved by designing and synthesising an entirely new E.coli genome, with the modifications built in rather than editing an existing genome. To determine the success of the project, 55 of the 87 genome segments were analysed to locate problems with the code. To the surprise of the research team, very few faults were found; only 13 of 2229 genes that were tested, far fewer than were anticipated due to the extent of modification. The purpose of such a project was summed up by Mattieu Landon, a Church lab graduate student:   The main reason is that the bacterial strain we are trying to build will have new properties useful for medical and industrial applications that are very difficult or impossible to obtain through so-called punctual changes to the genome. Examples of useful properties are virus resistance and genetic isolation. Many valuable compounds, including drugs such as insulin, are produced using bacterial strains. Usually, if a virus infects a batch of drug-producing bacteria, the whole plant has to be stopped and all the infected batches thrown away. Having virus-resistant bacteria could prevent such problems and potentially save millions of dollars. ","Published: October 11, 2016"

The findings are published in the Oct. 10 online early edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most prevalent gynecologic tumors in women, with over 76,160 newly diagnosed cases and about 14,270 deaths in 2015 in the United States alone. Although CSs comprise only 2-5% of all uterine malignancies and 1-2% of all ovarian tumors, they are responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths due to their high biologic aggressiveness and resistance to standard treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy. The collaborative research team   which included experts in gynecological cancer, genomics, pathology and computational biology   performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of ovarian and endometrial CSs. The team collected tumors from 68 women affected with ovarian and uterine CSs to try to determine the molecular basis of the tumor s aggressive behavior. They sequenced all the genes from the tumors and identified mutations that are crucial for these tumors to grow. The team also studied the copy number variations   genes that are not mutated but are amplified in the tumors to give them a growth advantage over normal tissues.  We identified a number of new genes that are frequently mutated in CS,  said senior author Dr. Alessandro Santin, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine, and program leader of the gynecological cancers research program at Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven and a member of Yale Cancer Center.  In addition to mutations in cancer genes previously identified in uterine and ovarian carcinomas, we found an excess of mutations in genes encoding specific groups of proteins, which may potentially explain their mixed tissue characteristics,  said Santin.  We ve established unequivocally the common genetic origin of these tumors as epithelial tumors,  he added.  Importantly, by studying the genetics of both the carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements of these tumors, we demonstrated that the transition from carcinoma to sarcoma, which represent one of the main characteristics of these tumors, may happen at different times during the evolution of these cancers.

Drugs that work well for some patients may not help others, and tumors that are initially susceptible to a drug can later become resistant. In a new approach to devising more personalized treatments, researchers at MIT and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a novel way to test tumors for drug susceptibility. Using a device that measures the masses of single cells, they can predict whether a particular drug will kill tumor cells, based on how it affects their growth rates. The researchers successfully tested this approach with a very aggressive type of brain cancer called glioblastoma and a type of blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They reported their results in the Oct. 10 issue of Nature Biotechnology.  We ve developed a functional assay that can measure drug response of individual cells while maintaining viability for downstream analysis such as sequencing,  says Scott Manalis, the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, who is one of the paper s senior authors. David Weinstock and Keith Ligon of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are also senior authors of the paper. The lead authors are Mark Stevens, a former MIT graduate student who is now a research scientist at Dana-Farber; MIT graduate student Nigel Chou; and Dana-Farber postdocs Cecile Maire and Mark Murakami. Measuring cell growth In recent years, scientists have been trying to identify genetic markers in tumors that suggest susceptibility to targeted cancer drugs. However, useful markers have been found for only a small percentage of cancers so far, and even when there is a predictive test, it is not accurate for all patients with that type of cancer. The MIT and Dana-Farber researchers took a different approach, inspired in part by a test that has been used for decades to choose antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. The antibiotic susceptibility test involves simply taking bacteria from a patient, exposing them to a range of antibiotics, and observing whether the bacteria grow or die. To translate that approach to cancer, scientists need a way to rapidly measure cell responses to drugs, and to do it with a limited number of cells available. For the past several years, Manalis  lab has been developing a device known as a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), which can measure cell masses 10 to 100 times more accurately than any other technique. This allows the researchers to precisely calculate growth rates of single-cells over short periods of time. In this study, Manalis  lab worked with Dana-Farber researchers to determine whether drug susceptibility could be predicted by measuring cancer cell growth rates following drug exposure. The team analyzed different subtypes of glioblastoma or leukemia cells that have previously been shown to be either sensitive or resistant to specific therapies: For glioblastoma, these are drugs called MDM2 inhibitors, and for acute lymphocytic leukemia, the drugs are known as BCR-ABL inhibitors. This allowed the researchers to test whether their approach would yield accurate predictions. After exposing cancer cells to the drug, the researchers waited about 15 hours and then measured the cell s growth rates. Each cell was measured several times over a period of 15 to 20 minutes, giving the researchers enough data to calculate the mass accumulation rate. They found that cells known to be susceptible to a given therapy changed the way they accumulate mass, whereas resistant cells continued growth as if unaffected.  We re able to show that cells we know are sensitive to therapy respond by dramatically reducing their growth rate relative to cells that are resistant,  Stevens says.  And because the cells are still alive, we have the opportunity to study the same cells following our measurement.  One major advantage of this technique is that it can be done with very small numbers of cells. In the experiments with leukemia cells, the researchers showed they could get accurate results with a tiny droplet of blood containing about 1,000 cancer cells. Another advantage is the speed at which small changes in cell mass can be measured, says Anthony Letai, an associate professor of medicine at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who is working on a different approach to monitoring cancer cells  reactions to drugs.  This system is well suited to making rapid measurements,  says Letai, who was not involved in this study.  I look forward to seeing them apply this to many more cancers and many more drugs.  Understanding resistance The researchers are now using this technique to test cells  susceptibility and then isolate the cells and sequence the RNA found in them, revealing which genes are turned on.  Now that we have a way to identify cells that are not responding to a given therapy, we are excited about isolating these cells and analyzing them to understand mechanisms of resistance,  Manalis says. In a recent paper in Nature Biotechnology, the researchers reported on a higher throughput version of the SMR device that can do in one day the same number of measurements that took several months with the device used in this study. This is an important step toward making the approach suitable for clinical samples, Manalis says.","Published: October 10, 2016"

Instead, scientists and clinicians need to pay attention to abnormalities in networks of genes, Yale researchers report in a paper published Oct. 10 in the journal Annals of Oncology. The Yale team studied all the genes of 200 patients who had HER2-positive breast cancer (about 15% of breast cancers have too many copies of the HER2 gene). About half of the patients responded very well to HER2-targeted therapy, but half did not, researchers reported.  However, they were not able to find a single gene abnormality that could serve as a biomarker to predict treatment outcomes for all patients.  If we keep looking for one marker at a time, we will not find a clinically useful marker to guide treatment selection for these drugs,  said Dr. Lajos Pusztai, researcher at the Yale Cancer Center and senior author of the study. However, they did find abnormalities in several dozens of genes in a single molecular network that aid in transmitting chemical information from the HER2 molecule on the cell surface to the interior of the cell. The presence of these abnormalities predicted which patients would be resistant to standard therapies. Only few patients, however, shared the same individual abnormalities, and the network was affected at different genetic locations in different patients.  You can look at these treatment-resistant cancers like a broken car    there are many different ways for a car to break down but the outcome is the same: The car is not working,  Pusztai said. He said a diagnostic test that can pinpoint abnormalities in this network of genes might help customize treatment. A new generation of drugs to treat women with HER2-positive breast cancer are now available and are effective, but are also extremely costly, Pusztai said.  We could save this new generation of drugs for those who really need it and treat women who don t with therapies that are less intense. ","Published: October 10, 2016"

A research team at the University of California, Riverside now shows that mother s milk also contributes to the development of the baby s own immune system by a process the team calls  maternal educational immunity.  Specific maternal immune cells in the milk cross the wall of the baby s intestine to enter an immune organ called the thymus. Once there, they  educate  developing cells to attack the same infectious organisms to which the mother has been exposed. The research, which used mouse foster nursing models, has important implications for vaccinating newborn babies. The researchers show that you can vaccinate the mother and this results in vaccination of the baby through this process.  It s another way moms provide immune information to their babies,  said Ameae Walker, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UC Riverside School of Medicine, who led the research.  It s as though the mother is saying,  Look what I have seen in the environment that you need to be immune to as well.   The replicas   the copies of the maternal immune cells that the baby makes   will provide immunity to the baby for life.  Research results appear in the Sept. 15 issue of the Journal of Immunology  Some vaccines are not safe to give a newborn baby and others just don t work very well in newborns,  Walker said.  If we can instead vaccinate mom or boost her vaccination shortly before she becomes pregnant, transferred immune cells during breast feeding will ensure that the baby is protected early on. While our work has used mouse models because we can study the process in detail this way, we do know that milk cells cross into human babies as well.  One of the infectious agents the research team studied was the organism that causes tuberculosis (TB)   a disease that is a huge problem in many countries of the world and getting worse because of the development of antibiotic-resistant strains. Generally, babies directly vaccinated against TB do not have a very good response: while the vaccination prevents some of the worst complications, it does not prevent the respiratory part of the disease   what was once called consumption.  We hope that by vaccinating the mother, who will eventually nurse the baby, we will improve infant immunity against TB,  Walker said.  It s like vaccinating the baby without actually vaccinating the baby.  In some instances, our work has shown that immunity against TB is far more effective if acquired through the milk than if acquired through direct vaccination of the baby. Of course, clinical trials will need to be conducted to test whether this is the case in humans.  How many cells get passed from mother to child depends a lot on how exposed the mother was to an infection. If she gets repeatedly exposed to an infection, her immune response would be boosted, and more cells would be passed on to the baby. According to Walker, the passing of both antibodies and cells through the milk of wet nurses likely contributed to the survival of royal babies in times past.  Wet nurses were usually from a lower social echelon,  she explained,  and were likely exposed to more infectious agents. They had to have very robust immune systems to survive, and transfer of antibodies and cells through their milk probably contributed greatly to the survival of royal babies. What the research is telling us is that a baby would likely gain from nursing by multiple women with different immune backgrounds.  Not too long ago in most cultures, if a baby cried a woman would pick it up and nurse it; most women were pregnant or lactating. Now, socially, we would think that rather peculiar   to nurse someone else s baby.  But is the change in how society thinks about this issue the best for the baby s health?

Endoglin, a receptor involved in cell signaling, has previously been known mostly for its function in blood vessels and angiogenesis. In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers showed endoglin modulates key signaling pathways to encourage early cells to develop into blood cells at the expense of the heart.  During the early stages of development, cells have to make decisions very quickly,  said Rita Perlingeiro, Ph.D., professor of Medicine in the University of Minnesota Medical School s Cardiovascular Division.  Fine-tuning of these early cell fate decisions can be easily disrupted by levels of key proteins within these cells.  When one cell type is favored, this implies less of another. In this case, high levels of endoglin expression enhance the cell differentiation into blood cells, whereas cardiac cells are in deficit.  June Baik, PhD, a member of the Perlingeiro s lab, and the leading author of this study, wanted to pinpoint the mechanism underlining the dual function of endoglin in blood and cardiac cell fate. She manipulated the levels of endoglin in differentiating mouse pluripotent stem cells as well as primary heart cells from zebrafish and mice. Her findings confirmed the endoglin expression connection. The next step was to further understand the molecular regulation associated with endoglin s function in this differentiation process. By looking closely at the pathways of development and differentiation, the research team identified JDP2 as a novel and important downstream mediator sufficient to induce blood fate when the endoglin signaling is disturbed.  The blood and heart systems are the first organs to develop in mammals, but the mechanisms regulating these earliest cell fate decisions are poorly understood,  said Perlingeiro.  By using multiple model systems, combined with specialized cell sorting technology and sequencing tools, our findings help uncover mechanisms previously unseen in the few cells engaged in these early development decisions. Perlingeiro points to a great opportunity to collaborate on next steps, identifying this as an interesting area to pursue in relation to the role of endoglin in congenital heart defects.  The importance of these studies by the Perlingeiro laboratory is the discovery of key regulatory factors governing blood and heart formation,  said Daniel Garry, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Lillehei Heart Institute at the University of Minnesota, and co-author in this study.  The clinical significance of these findings rests in the possibility of targeting these newly discovered networks to promote the development of blood or heart tissue in congenital diseases and following injuries in adults.

Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader that targets the function of the hormone receptor so, unlike aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, it does not interfere with estrogen levels themselves. The randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase III trial enrolled 462 women with inoperable locally-advanced or metastatic ER-positive, HER-negative breast cancer, who had not received prior hormone therapy. Half the patients (n=230) were randomized to 500mg intramuscular injections of fulvestrant (Days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 days), or to 1mg of anastrozole daily (n=232), and were also allowed one line of chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 25 months, patients treated with fulvestrant had a statistically significant 21% improvement in progression-free survival compared to those treated with anastrozole (16.6 months vs. 13.8 months, p = 0.048). However subgroup analysis showed an even greater impact on progression-free survival in patients whose disease had not spread to the liver or lungs at baseline (22.3 vs. 13.8 months).  For patients with non-visceral disease whose life isn t immediately threatened by breast cancer   a group for whom physicians would typically choose endocrine therapy as a first approach   it looks like fulvestrant could be a new standard of care compared to anastrozole,  said the study s principle investigator Dr. Matthew Ellis, from the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, USA. Both groups showed a similar health-related quality of life, and the most common adverse events were arthralgia (joint pain) (16.7% vs. 10.3%) and hot flushes (11.4% vs. 10.3%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole, respectively.  It s tolerated as well as anastrozole, and better than other drugs that could potentially be used in this setting such as chemotherapy or CDK4 inhibitors,  Ellis said.  In patients for whom you are looking for a low toxicity approach, such as older patients or those with low volume disease, it looks like a good option.  Researchers also observed a significantly greater duration of response to treatment in the fulvestrant group compared to the anastrozole group, which Ellis suggested could account for the increase in progression-free survival. Commenting on the study, Dr Nicholas Turner, team leader at the Institute of Cancer Research and Medical Oncologist at the Royal Marsden, London, UK, said the results represent an important advance in the treatment of the most common form of breast cancer, and suggest a potential benefit for using fulvestrant earlier in a patient s treatment.  However two factors complicate moving this new finding into routine clinical practice: firstly, the study only included patients with no prior hormone treatment yet many patients presenting with advanced breast cancer have previously been treated for the primary breast cancer,  Turner said.  Secondly, since the design of the study, the standard of care for these women has moved on, with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib now licensed in US, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, for the same group of patients. Further studies will help define the most optimal sequence of therapy for women with advanced breast cancer. ","Published: October 10, 2016"

The findings, reported in the journal Molecular Cell, could lead to therapies that boost existing drug treatments and counter drug-resistance.  Rad4 is like the cop who is the first responder at an accident,  said senior author Bennett Van Houten, Ph.D., Richard M. Cyert Professor of Molecular Oncology, Pitt School of Medicine, and co-leader of UPCI s Molecular and Cellular Cancer Biology Program.  The cop can move quickly to recognize where the incident is, and regulate traffic while directing the paramedics arriving in an ambulance.  Constrained motion allows Rad4 to be fast enough to scan large lengths of DNA quickly yet slow enough that it does not miss structural errors in DNA that could be caused by chemicals or ultraviolet (UV) light.  Mutations in Rad4, called XPC in humans, and other proteins in the DNA repair machinery are known to cause a genetic condition called xeroderma pigmentosum, where individuals have sensitivity to sunlight and are at an extremely high risk for developing skin cancer. Muwen Kong, a graduate student in Dr. Van Houten s laboratory, along with his collaborators, tagged normal and mutant Rad4 molecules with light-emitting quantum dots. They then watched them move across strands of DNA suspended between beads using a fluorescence microscope.  The results obtained suggest that the first responder, consisting of Rad4 and another protein, Rad23, quickly scans the DNA for accidents by attempting to bend it. Alterations in the structure of DNA, such as those caused by chemicals or UV light, change the ease with which DNA can be bent. Once a potential accident is recognized, the Rad4-Rad23 first-responder team slows down to a  constrained motion  pattern to more carefully examine a smaller region of 500-1,000 base pairs in the DNA. When structural damage is confirmed, Rad4-Rad23 stays near the scene and flags down the 'paramedics,' comprised of the rest of the DNA repair machinery, to fix the damage. This mechanism, which Dr. Van Houten calls  recognition-at-a-distance,  allows Rad4 to be near the error without impeding the rest of the DNA repair crew. Though much work is needed before these results can be translated to the clinic, the results provide new avenues to improve treatment methods, especially in cancer. Resistance is a major problem with current treatments, such as the drug cisplatin, which kills cancer cells by introducing DNA crosslinks similar to UV light. By developing drugs that target Rad4/XPC or other repair proteins, it could be possible to enhance the effects of current treatments when they are used together, and also reduce the chances of tumor cells developing resistance, Dr. Van Houten said.","Published: October 10, 2016"

One of the mechanisms leading to rifampicin s resistance is the action of the enzyme Rifampicin monooxygenase. Pablo Sobrado, a professor of biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and his team used a special technique called X-ray crystallography to describe the structure of this enzyme. They also reported the biochemical studies that allow them to determine the mechanisms by which the enzyme deactivates this important antibiotic. The results were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry and PLOS One, respectively.  In collaboration with Professor Jack Tanner at the University of Missouri and his postdoc, Dr. Li-Kai Liu, we have solved the structure of the enzyme bound to the antibiotic,  said Sobrado, who is affiliated with the Fralin Life Science Institute and the Virginia Tech Center for Drug Discovery.  The work by Heba, a visiting graduate student from Egypt, has provided detailed information about the mechanism of action and about the family of enzymes that this enzyme belongs to. This is all-important for drug design.  Heba Adbelwahab, of Damietta, Egypt, a graduate student in Sobrado s lab, was a key player in the research and first author of the PLOS One paper.  Antibiotic resistance is one of the major problems in modern medicine,  said Adbelwahab.  Our studies have shown how this enzyme deactivates rifampicin. We now have a blueprint to inhibit this enzyme and prevent antibiotic resistance.  Rifampicin, also known as Rifampin, has been used to treat bacterial infections for more than 40 years. It works by preventing the bacteria from making RNA, a step necessary for growth. The enzyme, Rifampicin monooxygenase, is a flavoenzyme   a family of enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions that are essential for microbial survival. These latest findings represent the first detailed biochemical characterization of a flavoenzyme involved in antibiotic resistance, according to the authors. Tuberculosis, leprosy, and Legionnaire s disease are infections caused by different species of bacteria. While treatable, the diseases pose a threat to children, the elderly, people in developing countries without access to adequate health care, and people with compromised immune systems.","Published: October 10, 2016"

For cancer cells to grow and spread they undergo a complex metabolic transformation. This allows the cells to meet the energy needs for the cancer to proliferate. Increasing our understanding of the genes that underpin the changes to metabolic pathways will provide further insight into the events that lead to the spread of cancer within the body. To this end, Dr Christian Frezza, programme leader, and Edoardo Gaude, a PhD student, from the MRC Cancer Unit, analysed the expression of metabolic genes across 20 different solid cancer types from 8,161 tumour and non-cancerous samples held in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  The researchers found that genes related to the OXPHOS pathway - a metabolic pathway in the cell s mitochondria that provides energy to the cell - were significantly down-regulated in the tumour cells from patients with poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, suppression of OXPHOS genes was linked to metastasis, where the cancer spreads to other parts of the body and is linked to even poorer prognosis. Although the link between OXPHOS genes and cancer survival has been found only to be an association at this stage, these results suggest that mitochondrial function might play an important role in metastasis and, therefore, patient prognosis.  Further work is needed to validate these results and to assess to what extent mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the malignancy of cancer cells.  Dr Christian Frezza said:  Cellular metabolism is known to be a key part of cancer progression. In our work we used data on patient s prognosis to identify a genetic signature related to metabolism that correlated with poor clinical outcome. Using this information, it could be possible in the future to tailor treatments specific to patients. This genetic signature also gives a new target for the development of drugs that could prevent a cancer from spreading throughout the body.  Dr Adam Babbs, research programme manager for cancer at the MRC, said:  The work will inform future patient stratification efforts and demonstrates the important links between metabolism and cancer. Further validation of this work may allow us to predict with greater accuracy a patient s long term survival and design a treatment strategy personalised to improve their chances of living longer.

The novel compound uses messenger RNA (mRNA) in tumours to identify patients who will respond.   Most studies of FGFR inhibitors have looked at FGFR abnormalities in tumours with limited success,  said lead author Dr Markus Joerger, attending medical oncologist, St Gallen Cancer Centre, Switzerland.  This study used an innovative biomarker approach of tumour FGFR mRNA expression.  This multicentre phase I study was conducted in six countries. The dose-escalation study was followed by expansion cohorts in patients with high tumour FGFR mRNA levels. A total of 80 patients were enrolled and treated, including 23 patients in the dose-escalation phase and 57 patients in the expansion cohorts in bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, and all comers. The dose escalation study tested five doses ranging from 50 800 mg BID (twice daily). BAY 1163877 has a half-life of about 12 hours and revealed less than dose-proportional increase in exposure at doses above 200 mg. A maximum tolerated dose was not defined because there were no dose-limiting toxicities. Based on the results of preclinical studies, the effect on serum phosphate levels and clinical analyses, 800 mg BID was recommended for future study. Regarding toxicities, most patients developed low-grade hyperphosphatemia, which occurs with all FGFR inhibitors. These patients were given a phosphate binder and the dose of BAY 1163877 could be reduced to avoid further increases of phosphate levels in the blood. In the expansion cohorts, the highest activity of BAY 1163877 was seen in bladder cancer, with three partial remissions out of eight patients. Partial remissions were also seen in individual patients with squamous cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and adenoid cystic carcinoma, the latter response lasting more than one year. Joerger said:  BAY 1163877 is a well-tolerated compound with an innovative biomarker approach that effectively identifies patients who have a good chance to benefit. Further studies should be conducted, particularly in bladder cancer where about 35% of patients are FGFR mRNA positive.  Commenting on the results, Prof Giuseppe Curigliano, Chair of the Division of Early Drug Development Therapeutics, European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy said:  FGFR inhibitors may provide a therapeutic opportunity to patients with rare tumours. In this patient population there were some patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma with long term control of the disease. In the context of molecular screening programmes we may offer a chance to patients with FGFR mRNA expression.   The toxicity profile of BAY 1163877 is better than other FGFR inhibitors under development,  he continued.  More studies are needed to identify which patients will benefit from FGFR inhibitors   in this study; tumour FGFR mRNA expression was the best predictor of response.

But no clear consensus has emerged about what exactly has gone ""wrong"" in the brain.

They hope to stimulate interest in the theory and invite others in the field to test it. The bottom line, they say, is that people with PTSD appear to suffer from disrupted context processing. That's a core brain function that allows people and animals to recognize that a particular stimulus may require different responses depending on the context in which it is encountered. It's what allows us to call upon the ""right"" emotional or physical response to the current encounter. A simple example, they write, is recognizing that a mountain lion seen in the zoo does not require a fear or ""flight"" response, while the same lion unexpectedly encountered in the backyard probably does. For someone with PTSD, a stimulus associated with the trauma they previously experienced - such as a loud noise or a particular smell -- triggers a fear response even when the context is very safe. That's why they react even if the noise came from the front door being slammed, or the smell comes from dinner being accidentally burned on the stove. Learn More: Study identifies two genes that boost risk for PTSD Context processing involves a brain region called the hippocampus, and its connections to two other regions called the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. Research has shown that activity in these brain areas is disrupted in PTSD patients. The U-M team thinks their theory can unify wide-ranging evidence by showing how a disruption in this circuit can interfere with context processing and can explain most of the symptoms and much of the biology of PTSD. ""We hope to put some order to all the information that's been gathered about PTSD from studies of human patients, and of animal models of the condition,"" says Israel Liberzon, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at U-M and a researcher at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System who also treats veterans with PTSD. ""We hope to create a testable hypothesis, which isn't as common in mental health research as it should be. If this hypothesis proves true, maybe we can unravel some of the underlying pathophysiological processes, and offer better treatments."" Liberzon and his colleague, James Abelson, MD, PhD, describe in their piece models of PTSD that have emerged in recent years, and lay out the evidence for each. The problem, they say, is that none of these models sufficiently explains the various symptoms seen in patients, nor all of the complex neurobiological changes seen in PTSD and in animal models of this disorder. Don't Miss: Trauma experiences change the brain even in those without PTSD The first model, abnormal fear learning, is rooted in the amygdala, the brain's 'fight or flight' center that focuses on response to threats or safe environments. This model emerged from work on fear conditioning, fear extinction and fear generalization. The second, exaggerated threat detection, is rooted in the brain regions that figure out what signals from the environment are ""salient"", or important to take note of and react to. This model focuses on vigilance and disproportionate responses to perceived threats. The third, involving executive function and regulation of emotions, is mainly rooted in the prefrontal cortex, the brain's center for keeping emotions in check and planning or switching between tasks. By focusing only on the evidence bolstering one of these theories, researchers may be ""searching under the streetlight"", says Liberzon. ""But if we look at all of it in the light of context processing disruption, we can explain why different teams have seen different things. They're not mutually exclusive."" The main thing, says Liberzon, is that ""context is not only information about your surroundings - it's pulling out the correct emotion and memories for the context you are in."" A deficit in context processing would lead PTSD patients to feel ""unmoored"" from the world around them, unable to shape their responses to fit their current contexts. Instead, their brains would impose an ""internalized context"" one that always expects danger on every situation. This type of deficit, arising in the brain from a combination of genetics and life experiences, may create vulnerability to PTSD in the first place, they say. After trauma, this would generate symptoms of hypervigilance, sleeplessness, intrusive thoughts and dreams, and inappropriate emotional and physical outbursts. Liberzon and Abelson think that testing the context processing theory will enhance understanding of PTSD, even if all of its details are not verified. They hope the PTSD community will help them pursue the needed research, in PTSD patients and in animal models. They put forth specific ideas in the Neuron paper to encourage that, and are embarking on such research themselves.

In the meantime, they note that there is a growing set of therapeutic tools that can help patients with PTSD, such as cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness training and pharmacological approaches. These may work by helping to anchor PTSD patients in their current environment, and may prove more effective as researchers learn how to specifically strengthen context processing capacities in the brain.

The findings advance the possibility, they say, of identifying a substance that makes ""human flavor"" repulsive to the malaria-bearing species of the mosquitoes, so instead of feasting on us, they keep the disease to themselves, potentially saving an estimated 450,000 lives a year worldwide. See Also: Decoding characteristic food odors Malaria is an infectious parasite disease of humans and animals transmitted by the bite of the female Anopheles gambiae mosquito. In 2015, experts estimate it affected 214 million people, mostly in Africa, despite decades of mosquito eradication and control efforts. There is no malaria vaccine, and although the disease is curable in early stages, treatment is costly and difficult to deliver in places where it is endemic. ""All mosquitoes, including the one that transmits malaria, use their sense of smell to find a host for a blood meal. Our goal is to let the mosquitoes tell us what smells they find repulsive and use those to keep them from biting us,"" says Christopher Potter, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Because smell is essential to mosquito survival, each mosquito has three pairs of ""noses"" for sensing odors: two antennae, two maxillary palps and two labella. The maxillary palps are thick, fuzzy appendages that protrude from the lower region of the mosquito's head, more or less parallel to its proboscis, the long, flexible sheath that keeps its ""feeding needle"" under wraps until needed. At the very tip of the proboscis are the labella, two small regions that contain both ""gustatory"" neurons that pick up tastes and olfactory neurons for recognizing odorants. To better understand how An. gambiae mosquitoes that cause malaria receive and process olfactory information from so many sensory regions, Potter's team wanted to see where olfactory neurons from those regions go to in the brain. Learn More: Why you smell better with your nose than with your mouthThey used a powerful genetic technique never before accomplished in mosquitoes, according to Potter to make certain neurons ""glow"" green. The green glowing label was designed to appear specifically in neurons that receive complex odors through proteins called odorant receptors (ORs), since OR neurons are known to help distinguish humans from other warm-blooded animals in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which carry the Zika virus. ""This is the first time researchers managed to specifically target sensory neurons in mosquitoes. Previously, we had to use flies as a proxy for all insects, but now we can directly study the sense of smell in the insects that spread malaria,"" says Olena Riabinina, PhD, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow now at the Imperial College London. ""We were pleasantly surprised by how well our genetic technique worked and how easy it is now to see the smell-detecting neurons. The ease of identification will definitely simplify our task of studying these neurons in the future."" As expected, Potter says, the OR neurons from the antennae and maxillary palps went to symmetrical areas of the brain called antennal lobes, just as they do in flies. But Potter was quite surprised when he saw that the OR neurons from the labella went to the so-called subesophageal zone, which, he says, had never before been associated with the sense of smell in any fly or insect; it had only been associated with the sense of taste. ""That finding suggests that perhaps mosquitoes don't just like our smell, but also our flavor,"" says Potter. ""It's likely that the odorants coming off our skin are picked up by the labella and influence the preferred taste of our skin, especially when the mosquito is looking for a place to bite."" Don't Miss: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells Potter says the finding potentially offers researchers one more way to repel mosquitoes. The antennae and maxillary palps are more specialized for picking up long-range signals, while the labella come into direct contact with our skin. In fact, Potter says, before injecting their needlelike proboscis, mosquitoes use the labella to probe about on a victim's skin. ""We don't really know why they do that, but we suspect that they're looking for sensory cues that hint at easy access to a blood vessel,"" he says. ""This suggests that a combination of repellants could keep mosquitoes from biting us in two ways. One could target the antennal neurons and reduce the likelihood that they come too close, while another could target the labellar neurons and make the mosquitoes turn away in disgust before sucking our blood if they got close enough to land on us."" The two-part genetic system Potter devised to generate the glowing neurons will make it much easier for his and other laboratories to mix and match genetically altered mosquitoes to generate new traits, he says. His group has already created a strain of An. gambiae mosquitoes whose OR neurons glow green upon activation. Scientists can thus see which neurons light up in response to a specific smell. ""Using this method, we hope to find an odorant that is safe and pleasant-smelling for us but strongly repellant to mosquitoes at very low concentrations,"" says Potter. His group was also able to compare the brains of male and female mosquitoes. Since only females use their sense of smell to find humans and males feed only on nectar, it was previously thought that males had just a rudimentary sense of smell. The Potter group found instead that males have the same level of complexity in their brains to detect odors as females but have fewer olfactory neurons. ""It appears that males might just have a scaled-down version of a female's sense of smell. So they can still smell everything a female smells, just not as well,"" Potter says. Related: Stinky or fragrant? Predicting changing odor preferencesHis group plans to study other types of neurons to better understand how signals from the mosquitoes' three types of olfactory receptors interact to influence their behavior. For example, why is lactic acid not attractive on its own but highly attractive when mixed with carbon dioxide? ""We'd like to figure out what regions and neurons in the brain lead to this combined effect,"" says Potter. ""If we can identify them, perhaps we could also stop them from working.""

This finding could ultimately lead to new ways to protect against brain damage. Researchers discovered that the protein, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), breaks the cell s DNA, resulting in brain cell death.  Stroke is a major cause of death and serious long-term disability in the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that annually more than 795,000 U.S. residents have a stroke,  said lead author Dr. Yingfei Wang, Assistant Professor of Pathology and of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics at UT Southwestern. The Department of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics is part of UT Southwestern s Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, a comprehensive initiative dedicated to better understanding the basic molecular workings of the brain and applying these discoveries to the prevention and treatment of brain diseases and injuries. The study, which appears online in Science, outlines three possible ways to manipulate MIF to protect brain tissue during a stroke   and possibly in other brain-damaging conditions such as Alzheimer s, Parkinson s, and Huntington s diseases, although this study examined only stroke. Dr. Wang screened thousands of human proteins to find 160 that could be the culprits behind stroke-induced cell death. Eventually, the researchers were able to narrow the field to just one   MIF, a protein long known for its roles in immunity and inflammation.  The MIF protein was identified in the 1960s, but the function we found related to DNA damage in the cell s nucleus after stroke is brand new,  Dr. Wang said. The MIF finding is the final piece in a puzzle that collaborating researchers at Johns Hopkins University have been carefully assembling for years to reveal the process by which brain cells die. This work was started in the labs of research partners Dr. Ted Dawson, Director of the Institute for Cell Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Dr. Valina Dawson, Professor of Neurology at Johns Hopkins, where Dr. Wang began her work as a postdoctoral researcher and continued it as a collaboration between UT Southwestern and Johns Hopkins. Despite their very different causes and symptoms, brain injury, stroke, and Alzheimer s, Parkinson s, and Huntington s diseases have a shared mechanism involving a distinct form of  programmed  brain cell death called parthanatos, researchers said. The name comes from the personification of death in Greek mythology, and PARP, an enzyme involved in the cell death process.  I can t overemphasize what an important form of cell death it is; it plays a role in almost all forms of cellular injury,  said Dr. Dawson, whose research group has spent years delineating each of the links in the parthanatos chain of events and the roles of the proteins involved. The researchers are working to identify chemical compounds that could block MIF s actions and possibly protect brain cells from damage. UT Southwestern authors include: postdoctoral researchers Dr. BongWoo Kim and Dr. Lei Bao and research assistant Jennifer Wang, all of Pathology at the time of the study. Dr. Kim is now in Physiology. The collaboration involved researchers from Johns Hopkins, Fudan University and Sun Yat-sen University in China, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

In their report that has been published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the National University of Singapore describe how different atrophy patterns may explain the different ways that Alzheimer's disease can be manifested in individual patients. See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression ""The symptom severity and neurodegeneration can vary widely across patients in Alzheimer's disease,"" says Thomas Yeo, PhD, of the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH. ""Our work shows that participants in this study exhibit at least three atrophy patterns - cortical, temporal or subcortical - that are associated with variability in cognitive decline not only in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's but also in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or those who are cognitively normal but are at risk for Alzheimer's."" In addition to his affiliation with the Martinos Center, Yeo is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clinical Imaging Research Centre and Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology at the National University of Singapore. The study analyzed data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multi-institutional project to develop biomarkers - including blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid tests, and imaging studies - that can be used for diagnosis or in clinical trials. Yeo and his team - including investigators at the MGH and in Singapore - analyzed MR images taken of the brains of 378 ADNI participants when they enrolled in the study. Of these participants, 188 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease; the others - 147 with mild cognitive impairment and 43 who were cognitively normal - were at increased risk based on levels in their brains of the beta-amyloid plaques that are characteristic of the disease. As a first step, the research team analyzed data from the baseline structural MRIs using a mathematical model that estimated the probability that particular details of each image were associated with atrophy of a specific location within the brain. Based on the location of atrophy factors, they determined three atrophy factor patterns: cortical - representing atrophy in most of the cerebral cortex; temporal - indicating atrophy in the temporal cortex (the cortical lobe behind the ears), hippocampus and amygdala; and subcortical, indicating atrophy in the cerebellum, striatum and thalamus, structures at the base of the brain. Learn More: Research discovers neuroprotective protein in blood is biomarker of Alzheimer's disease Analysis of study participant scans taken two years later indicated that atrophy factor patterns were persistent in individuals and did not reflect different stages of disease. Most participants - including those in the mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal groups - showed levels of more than one atrophy factor. Behavioral and cognitive tests of study participants taken at six-month intervals indicated associations between particular atrophy factor patterns and specific cognitive deficits. Individuals in whom temporal atrophy predominated had greater problems with memory, while cortical atrophy was associated with difficulties with executive function - the ability to plan and to accomplish goals. Individual differences in how atrophy factors are distributed within the brain may allow prediction of the rate at which cognitive abilities would be expected to decline. ""Most previous studies focused on patients already diagnosed, but we were able to establish distinct atrophy patterns not only in diagnosed patients but also in at-risk participants who had mild impairment or were cognitively normal at the outset of the study,"" Yeo says. ""That is important because the neurodegenerative cascade that leads to Alzheimer's starts years, possibly decades, before diagnosis. So understanding different atrophy patterns among at-risk individuals is quite valuable. He adds, ""Previous studies assumed that an individual can only express a single neurodegenerative pattern, which is highly restrictive since in any aged person there could be multiple pathological factors going on at the same time - such as vascular impairment along with the amyloid plaques and tau tangles that are directly associated with Alzheimer's. So individuals who are affected by multiple, co-existing pathologies might be expected to exhibit multiple atrophy patterns."" Read Next: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein Future research could further determine whether and how these atrophy patterns relate to the distribution of amyloid and tau and the mechanisms by which they affect specific cognitive abilities, Yeo explains. The same analytic approach also could be applied to other types of patient data and extended to other neurodegenerative disorder that produce varying symptom patterns, such as Parkinson's disease and autism.

This was established when researchers had ten study participants stick probes into their noses, and then made electro-physical recordings of how the epithelium cells reacted to different odors presented to them. The study was led by Thomas Hummel of the Technische Universit t Dresden in Germany, and is published in Springer's journal Chemosensory Perception. See Also: Decoding characteristic food odors Olfaction refers to the action or capacity of smelling. People are able to smell thanks to their noses (an ability referred to as their orthonasal sense of smell) and through their mouths (their retronasal smelling sense) when odorous molecules are released into the nasal cavity during the process of chewing and swallowing. According to Hummel, retronasal olfaction, although not as sensitive, represents a peculiar aspect of the olfactory system in that it allows for smells to be evaluated within the interior of the body rather than from the external world. Retronasal olfaction adds to people's experience of eating or drinking, as it evokes different sensations compared to orthonasal smelling. It also helps to keep people out of harm's way when they put potentially harmful substances into their mouths. Don't Miss: Can autism be measured in a sniff?Hummel's team used electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings to evaluate how the epithelium lining in the nasal cavity reacts to stimuli that are either breathed in or are released thanks to the workings of the mouth. This electrographic technique is similar to electrocardiograms that provide neuronal information about the changing bioelectrical potential of the heart. The experiment was performed on six men and four women, who had to insert a tubular electrode about seven centimeters deep into their nasal cavity. The reaction of the participants' epithelial lining to three odorants (phenylethyl alcohol, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) were then recorded. The epithelial lining responded more to orthonasal stimuli than to retronasal ones. This indicates that orthonasal stimuli are perceived with a higher intensity than retronasal ones. The findings are in line with the thought that the odors of food and liquids, most often experienced through chewing and swallowing, are typically encountered at higher concentrations than orthonasal perceived ones, to allow them to be picked up adequately. ""Compared to the smell of a given food, such as cheese, odor release from that same food is higher intraorally due to salivation, warming, and chewing,"" explains Hummel. ""Because of these conditions, retronasal perception of odors, compared with orthonasal olfaction, may be adjusted to a higher range of odor concentrations.""

The field of DNA sequencing is full of ideas that are just crazy enough to work. We now have technology that uses light emitted from glowing molecules to figure out the correct order of a DNA sequence, and a cell phone-size device that harnesses electric current to decipher the genome. ""Parts of the genome remain hidden, or are extremely hard to analyze with current methods,"" said Jeffery Schloss, Ph.D., director of the Division of Genome Sciences at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). ""If we can't see what's there then we can't learn how it works. New technologies are still needed."" To that end, NHGRI is awarding $6.7 million in new research grants to develop DNA sequencing technologies that are more sensitive, faster, cheaper and more accurate than those we already have. These new awards are a re-up in an investment that began in 2004 through the Genome Technology Program. ""Direct RNA sequencing is one of the particularly exciting aspects of these new awards,"" said Michael Smith, Ph.D., program director for NHGRI's Genome Technology Program. ""The awards enable novel research in RNA function across a broad swath of biomedical and biological research."" The information stored in our DNA is converted into RNA transcripts that serve many biological functions, including containing the basic instructions for making proteins. RNA is an essential product of the genome and, in one role, is directly responsible for which - and how much - protein is made in each cell of our bodies. However, in spite of numerous attempts to develop technology to directly sequence RNA, it continues to hide many of its mysteries. Current methods, which use next-generation DNA sequencing to characterize all of the transcripts expressed at a given time (collectively known as the transcriptome), involve an intermediate step where researchers must convert the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) so that the current sequencing machines can read it. This is an imperfect copying process that, when combined with short sequencing reads, results in some transcripts being sequenced more easily than others, and in difficulty putting the transcriptome puzzle back together. These limitations ultimately lead to imprecise and incomplete read-outs of gene expression and transcript diversity. Additionally, this way of doing things can completely miss reading the chemical modifications of RNA, explained Stuart Lindsay, Ph.D., professor of physics and chemistry at Arizona State University, and a grantee of the program. These chemical modifications can alter the function of an expressed gene or modify how stable it is in the cell. The new ability to directly sequence the RNA will allow researchers to tackle an entirely new set of experiments. These experiments have broad applications not only in the research lab, but also in the clinic. ""The most compelling argument for the use of direct RNA sequencing is precision medicine,"" said Dr. Wanunu, whose award money will be used to overcome some of the challenges associated with direct RNA sequencing. ""We can already sequence the genome of a person, and those six billion letters will tell you a lot about them, but the transcriptome can supplement that."" Dr. Lindsay agreed: ""The transcriptome can be more medically informative than the genome in certain cases,"" he said. ""Gene expression in a cancer cell is going to be different than in a normal cell."" Drs. Wanunu and Lindsay aren't alone in their creative approaches to problem solving. In total, six new awards have been made through a program called the Novel Nucleic Acid Sequencing Technology Development program (previously known as the Advanced Sequencing Technology Awards program). These projects focus on a variety of issues in nucleic acid sequencing such as work focused on direct RNA sequencing to further improvements on nanopore-based sequencing of DNA. ""This particular program is unique in many aspects,"" said Dr. Wanunu. ""It has supported people from all different backgrounds of science from chemists, physicists, engineers to biologists. These challenges we face in this field are very real. Thanks to NHGRI, this program will continue to do wonders in order to improve nucleic acid sequencing technologies.""","Published: October 7, 2016"

This decision was made yesterday evening and has been communicated to investigators, study sites, and regulatory authorities. Following recent reports in the Phase 2 OLE study of new onset or worsening peripheral neuropathy, the ENDEAVOUR DMC assembled yesterday at the Company's request to review these reports and ENDEAVOUR data on an unblinded basis. The DMC did not find conclusive evidence for a drug-related neuropathy signal in the ENDEAVOUR trial, but informed the Company that the benefit-risk profile for revusiran no longer supported continued dosing. The Company subsequently reviewed unblinded ENDEAVOUR data which revealed an imbalance of mortality in the revusiran arm as compared to placebo. ""Patient safety comes first. We have stopped all dosing and are actively monitoring patients across revusiran studies to ensure their safety. We will also continue to evaluate ENDEAVOUR data to understand the potential cause of these findings,"" said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Alnylam. ""While this outcome is disappointing given the lack of available treatment options for patients suffering from this devastating disease, we remain committed to serving the needs of the ATTR amyloidosis community. We would like to thank patients, caregivers, investigators, and study staff who have been so supportive of the revusiran program."" The decision to discontinue development of revusiran does not affect patisiran, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), or any other Alnylam investigational RNAi therapeutic program in development. Based on a current assessment of the safety data across the Company's other programs, which include the ALN-PCSsc program partnered with The Medicines Company, there is no evidence of a drug-related neuropathy signal in over 800 treated subjects and patients with exposure of up to 34 months. This includes patisiran, which utilizes a lipid nanoparticle delivery formulation, and the seven other clinical programs in Alnylam's pipeline, which all use Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC) GalNAc delivery technology. ESC-GalNAc conjugates enable dose and exposure levels that are 12-30 times lower than revusiran, which uses Standard Template Chemistry (STC) GalNAc delivery technology.

This milestone marks a significant step for the synchrotron that is used by over 8,000 scientists each year. Diamond accelerates electrons to produce powerful light, 10 billion times brighter than the sun. This allows scientists to investigate the molecular and atomic nature of matter. The 5000th paper, published by an international scientific collaboration reveals the discovery of one of the genetic triggers behind a range of birth defects, including congenital heart disease. The group from the UK, USA and Japan published their findings in PLOS Genetics. Andrew Harrison, CEO at Diamond, said:  Our 5000th paper represents a significant milestone for the facility. As we move towards the tenth anniversary of Diamond in 2017, this work underscores the vital human impact that synchrotron research can have.  If we can uncover more about the intricate processes at the heart of embryonic development, we may eventually be able to prevent some of the birth defects that can occur as a result. These findings are a tangible step forwards towards that goal.  The new research reveals the genetic pathways by which proteins in the body help to align a developing embryo in the very early stages of development at just 19-22 days after conception. During this period, a developing embryo begins to take shape by adopting a left and a right hand side. Major organs, like the heart and liver, exist only on one side of the body, whilst our left hand lung is shaped slightly different to our right hand lung so as to make space for the heart. The orientation of our internal organs is vital for the body to correctly function, so when the alignment process goes wrong it can cause serious genetic defects, the most common being congenital heart disease. The process of early-stage alignment has not been previously well understood, as the genetic pathways behind it are highly complex, containing many different proteins and cell reactions. However, these findings help to shed light on the interactions that determine our organ alignment   and resulting personal health   at such an early stage of development. Using the powerful light produced at Diamond, the researchers were able to study a pocket inside mouse embryos. This pocket, known as the  node , is where the process of organ alignment originates. Fluid begins flowing through the embryo at a very early stage of development. This research shows that it is the physical direction of this flow that helps to shape the young embryo, determining the development of the foetus at a later stage. The group were able to show, for the first time, that cilia   minute hair-like structures on the surface of the embryo s cells   are able to detect the direction of fluid flow within the node, triggering a genetic chain reaction that leads to the correct alignment of the embryo. There are many different proteins involved in this process, and if just one of them contains a mutation that causes them to read the signals coming to them incorrectly, it can lead to misalignment of the young embryo, sometimes resulting in birth defects. Rohanah Hussain, Senior Beamline Scientist on Diamond s B23 beamline, where the work was carried out, said:  Now that we have identified the complex processes involved in embryonic alignment, we are better equipped to investigate exactly how and why things go wrong, and potentially develop ways of preventing these issues and the birth defects that result.  There is still some way to go before we fully understand the delicate and highly intricate processes that govern embryonic alignment, but this work constitutes a major step forwards in efforts to understand developmental milestones that take place at a very early stage.  This research has emerged from an international collaboration that has made it possible to combine genetics, biophysics and structural biology. In the UK, Dominic Norris and colleagues from Medical Research Council (MRC) Harwell who conceived the research together with Rohanah Hussain and colleagues at Diamond Light Source, the UK synchrotron science facility, made it possible to understand the nature of structural changes caused by a point mutation in PKD1L1. This work took place on Diamond s B23 beamline for Circular Dichroism. beamline, B23. Surya Nauli and colleagues at Chapman University, USA, allowed the role of PKD1L1 in flow detection to be assessed in cells. Hiroshi Hamada and colleagues in Osaka, Japan, provided novel techniques that allowed the team to more precisely analyse  nodal flow .","Published: October 7, 2016"

See Also: Doctors unleash new weapon to fight pediatric neuroblastomaEYA1, a protein that contributes to ear development, is present in the cytoplasm of many neuroblastoma tumors, but this protein migrates to the nucleus in the cells of more aggressive forms of the disease. The research, recently published in two medical research journals, allows for the development of targeted drugs that will work to prevent the neuroblastoma from reaching this more aggressive stage; researchers at URMC and elsewhere have already begun testing some of these potential treatments in a laboratory setting. ""Neuroblastoma is one of the most common and deadly forms of childhood cancer, and this discovery allows us to identify drugs that prevent the change in EYA1 structure and potentially minimize the danger to a child who has this disease,"" said Nina Schor, MD, PhD, professor of Pediatrics and Neuroscience and the William H. Eilinger Chair of Pediatrics at URMC. The EYA1 protein enters the cancer cell's nucleus due to the presence of an enzyme called PRMT1.

In more than 90 percent of cases, physicians and scientists do not know what causes these processes to occur. See Also: Finnish study establishes connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease Robert Friedland, MD, the Mason C. and Mary D. Rudd Endowed Chair and Professor of Neurology at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, and a team of researchers have discovered that these processes may be triggered by proteins made by our gut bacteria (the microbiota). Their research has revealed that exposure to bacterial proteins called amyloid that have structural similarity to brain proteins leads to an increase in clumping of the protein alpha-synuclein in the brain. Aggregates, or clumps, of misfolded alpha-synuclein and related amyloid proteins are seen in the brains of patients with the neurodegenerative diseases AD, PD and ALS. Alpha-synuclein (AS) is a protein normally produced by neurons in the brain. In both PD and AD, alpha-synuclein is aggregated in a clumped form called amyloid, causing damage to neurons. Friedland has hypothesized that similarly clumped proteins produced by bacteria in the gut cause brain proteins to misfold via a mechanism called cross-seeding, leading to the deposition of aggregated brain proteins. He also proposed that amyloid proteins produced by the microbiota cause priming of immune cells in the gut, resulting in enhanced inflammation in the brain. The research, which was supported by The Michael J. Fox Foundation, involved the administration of bacterial strains of E. coli that produce the bacterial amyloid protein curli to rats. Control animals were given identical bacteria that lacked the ability to make the bacterial amyloid protein. The rats fed the curli-producing organisms showed increased levels of AS in the intestines and the brain and increased cerebral AS aggregation, compared with rats who were exposed to E. coli that did not produce the bacterial amyloid protein. The curli-exposed rats also showed enhanced cerebral inflammation. Related: Researcher finds link between gut bacteria and multiple sclerosis Similar findings were noted in a related experiment in which nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) that were fed curli-producing E. coli also showed increased levels of AS aggregates, compared with nematodes not exposed to the bacterial amyloid. A research group led by neuroscientist Shu Chen, PhD, of Case Western Reserve University, performed this collaborative study. This new understanding of the potential role of gut bacteria in neurodegeneration could bring researchers closer to uncovering the factors responsible for initiating these diseases and ultimately developing preventive and therapeutic measures. ""These new studies in two different animals show that proteins made by bacteria harbored in the gut may be an initiating factor in the disease process of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS,"" Friedland said. ""This is important because most cases of these diseases are not caused by genes, and the gut is our most important environmental exposure. In addition, we have many potential therapeutic options to influence the bacterial populations in the nose, mouth and gut."" This work supports recent studies indicating that the microbiota may have a role in disease processes in age-related brain degenerations. It is part of Friedland's ongoing research on the relationship between the microbiota and age-related brain disorders, which involves collaborations with researchers in Ireland and Japan.

The finding along with the discovery of the molecular process behind it provides the first insight into how the clock regulates a physiological function. And while the research was conducted in mice, ""the findings could point the way toward drugs that target receptors implicated in problems that people experience from shift work or jet lag,"" says the study's senior author, Charles Bourque, a professor in McGill's Department of Neurology and scientist at the Brain Repair and Integrative Neuroscience Program at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. See Also: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions Scientists knew that rodents show a surge in water intake during the last two hours before sleep. The study by Bourque's group revealed that this behavior is not motivated by any physiological reason, such as dehydration. So if they don't need to drink water, why do they? The McGill team, which included lead author and PhD student Claire Gizowski, found that restricting the access of mice to water during the surge period resulted in significant dehydration towards the end of the sleep cycle. So the increase in water intake before sleep is a preemptive strike that guards against dehydration and serves to keep the animal healthy and properly hydrated. Then the researchers looked for the mechanism that sets this thirst response in motion. It's well established that the brain harbors a hydration sensor with thirst neurons in that sensor organ. So they wondered if the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain region that regulates circadian cycles - a.k.a. the biological clock - could be communicating with the thirst neurons. The left and right components of the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus with clock neurons stained in green. Credit: Bourque lab, McGill University  The team suspected that vasopressin, a neuropeptide produced by the SCN, might play a critical role. To confirm that, they used so-called ""sniffer cells"" designed to fluoresce in the presence of vasopressin. When they applied these cells to rodent brain tissue and then electrically stimulated the SCN, Bourque says, ""We saw a big increase in the output of the sniffer cells, indicating that vasopressin is being released in that area as a result of stimulating the clock."" To explore if vasopressin was stimulating thirst neurons, the researchers employed optogenetics, a cutting-edge technique that uses laser light to turn neurons on or off. Using genetically engineered mice whose vasopressin neurons contain a light activated molecule, the researchers were able to show that vasopressin does, indeed, turn on thirst neurons. Related: Setting the circadian clock ""Although this study was performed in rodents, it points toward an explanation as to why we often experience thirst and ingest liquids such as water or milk before bedtime,"" Bourque says. ""More importantly, this advance in our understanding of how the clock executes a circadian rhythm has applications in situations such as jet lag and shift work. All our organs follow a circadian rhythm, which helps optimize how they function. Shift work forces people out of their natural rhythms, which can have repercussions on health. Knowing how the clock works gives us more potential to actually do something about it."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

In the world's largest MRI study on brain size to date, University of California (USC) researchers and their international colleagues identified seven genetic hotspots that regulate brain growth, memory and reasoning as well as influence the onset of Parkinson's disease. See Also: Substance abuse reduces brain volume in women but not men Most brain imaging studies evaluate around 100 people, but this new study published in Nature Neuroscience examined 32,438 adults, said Paul Thompson, a corresponding author and associate director of the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute. The results bring scientists closer to understanding the genetic program that builds the living brain. ""Brain measures from MRI account for about 15 percent of the differences in our cognitive ability that is, brain-based skills required to perform simple and complex tasks,"" said Thompson, who led a team of more than 300 international scientists. ""The genes underlying brain development have far-reaching effects that extend well beyond the initial years of life. You have genes that are beneficial for you and help build brain structures early in life. Yet some of these are harmful later in life and promote diseases such as Parkinson's."" Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement and often leads to tremors. Like many other degenerative brain disorders, a cure does not yet exist. Although scientists have not determined an ideal healthy brain size, a brain that is too small (microcephaly) or too big (macrocephaly) can lead to abnormal cognitive development and lifelong challenges. The human brain reaches maximum size around a person's early 20s, Thompson said. Learn More: Mini-brain model of idiopathic autism reveals underlying pathology of neuronal overgrowthThe study used data on subjects from 52 study sites that are part of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium and Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium, which is based at USC and led by Thompson. The research supports the notion that brain size could be used as a measure of ""brain reserve,"" meaning brain size can promote resilience to age-related brain diseases. ENIGMA is part of the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, which aims to enhance discovery through the application of imaging and information techniques in the study of the brain. The institute is a leader in data acquisition, analysis stewardship and computational innovation for the purpose of biomedical research. Both genetics and environmental factors affect brain size. Good diet, education and exercise build a healthy brain in young people and protect older people from tissue loss. ""This research is on the leading edge of cracking the brain's genetic code,"" Thompson said. ""Millions of people carry variations in their DNA that help boost or lower their brains' susceptibility to a vast range of diseases. Once we identify these genes, we can target them with drugs to reduce the risk of disease. People also can take preventive steps through exercise, diet and mental stimulation to erase the effects of a bad gene."" The study began seven years ago. Its technique of using brain scans to identify gene hotspots provides more information than the traditional method of collecting DNA samples from patients. Don't Miss: New model recreates early spread of Parkinson s disease in the brain ""Now that we can see a gene's imprint in brain scans, it's like capturing a thief red-handed,"" Thompson said. ""You can chase it down brain pathways and circuits and discover what brain cells the gene is damaging. Using brain scans builds a foundation so that scientists in the future can better focus their studies on hotspots of interest."" Thompson and his colleagues identified five new gene hubs that predict brain growth and confirmed two known hotspots. The genes in these areas provide links between an individual's maximum brain size and processes such as: Researchers adjusted their data for height and confirmed growth predictions by examining 2,824 children from before birth until age 6. Of note, one of the areas of the human genome that affects brain size has a normal version and an inverted alphabet variant that evolved some 3 million years ago, Thompson said. ""MAPT is one of the most dangerous genes in this inverted zone,"" he said.

Although prions are infamous for causing Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow s disease, the present study indicates that prions identified in yeast, and possibly in plants, and other organisms may be beneficial. All prions identified thus far share defining characteristics, including the ability to fold into a self-perpetuating conformation, efficient transmission when the contents of a prion-containing cell are injected into a  na ve  cell (a technique known as cytoplasmic transfer), and the ability to form large aggregates of similarly folded proteins, called amyloids. The biological importance of these molecules is underscored by the presence of cellular machines that evolved to propagate prions. One helper protein, called Hsp104, dices up prion aggregates into smaller  seeds  that are passed from a mother to all or almost all daughter cells and confer dominant traits. To assess the breadth of such protein-based inheritance, the lab of Whitehead Member Susan Lindquist lab devised an unbiased screen that examines all proteins in yeast for those capable of producing stable phenotypes that are passed from mother to daughter cells for at least 100 generations. The screen and its outcome are described in this week s issue of the journal Cell. When they scrutinized the results, the team noted that most of the 46 prion prospects lack some conventional characteristics, specifically amyloid formation and the dependence on a helper protein to transform the amyloid into heritable seeds. Nevertheless, their protein-conformation dependent traits are dominantly inherited from mother cells to all daughter cells and could be transmitted via cytoplasmic transfer two key prion traits. Interestingly, most of the identified  molecular memories  help yeast cells adapt to varied stressful environments. Unlike canonical prions, which are noted for creating specific structures, these proteins contained large sections that are intrinsically disordered, meaning that those domains lack a fixed three-dimensional architecture. In this way, they are related to human proteins that also have prion-like characteristics. According to Sohini Chakrabortee, lead author of the Cell paper, the physical flexibility of intrinsically disordered proteins could allow them to fulfill a variety of roles in a cell, from an enzyme to a chaperone protein like Hsp70. When the team examined other fungal cognates of the prion-proteins, the intrinsically disordered domains were conserved over hundreds of millions of years.  This conservation over millennia could be because these proteins are vastly beneficial in nature,  says Chakrabortee, who is currently Research Development Officer for European and International Funding for the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. For Chakrabortee, the unbiased screen has called into question the fundamental assumptions surrounding prions.  We don t know how deep is the ocean,  she says about the pool of potential prions.  This opens up new directions, and we re just starting to look into what these proteins do and their impact. This screen just gives us a taste of the breadth of prions and protein-based inheritance.

As it turns out, those tests, as well as the standards behind them, have not been updated in decades. Now scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have developed a highly accurate, DNA-based method to detect and distinguish sources of microbial contamination in water. Using the award-winning PhyloChip, a credit card-sized device that can detect the presence of more than 60,000 species of bacteria and archaea, the new method was found to be more sensitive than conventional methods at assessing health risks. In tests at the Russian River watershed in Northern California, the Berkeley Lab researchers found instances where their method identified potential human health risks that conventional fecal indicator tests had failed to detect. Conversely, they also found instances where the conventional tests flagged bacteria that weren t likely risks to human health. The research was led by Eric Dubinsky and Gary Andersen, microbial ecologists at Berkeley Lab, and was published recently in the journal Water Research in an article titled,  Microbial source tracking in impaired watersheds using PhyloChip and machine-learning classification.  Steven Butkus of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, which supported part of the research, was also a co-author.  With the PhyloChip, in an overnight test we can get a full picture of the microorganisms in any given sample,  Dubinsky said.  Instead of targeting one organism, we re essentially getting a fingerprint of the microbial community of potential sources in that sample. So it gives us a more comprehensive picture of what s going on. It s a novel way of going about source tracking.  What local water agencies currently do is collect water samples, culture the bacteria overnight, and then check the growth level of two types of bacteria, E. coli and Enterococcus, which are presumed to be indicators of fecal contamination. Power of the PhyloChip However, this method doesn t distinguish between sources . The bacteria could have come from humans, cows, ducks, sewage, or even decaying vegetation.  These tests have been used for decades and are relatively primitive,  Dubinsky said.  Back in the 1970s when the Clean Water Act was developed and we had sewage basically flowing into our waters, these tests worked really well. Epidemiological studies showed an association of these bacteria with levels of illness of people who used the water. These bacteria don t necessarily get you sick, but they re found in sewage and fecal matter. That s why they re measured.  As pollution from point sources single identifiable sources such as sewage has been cleaned up over time, the emerging concern has become what are known as nonpoint sources, or diffuse sources, throughout the watershed, such as agricultural lands.  The picture is much more complicated now than it was back then, when the concern was really point sources,  Dubinsky added. The PhyloChip, which was developed by Andersen and several other Berkeley Lab scientists, has been used for a number of medical, agricultural, and environmental purposes, including understanding air pollution, the ecology of coral reefs, and environmental conditions of the Gulf of Mexico after the BP oil spill. With 1 million probes, it identifies microbes based on variations of a specific gene, with no culturing needed.  About seven years ago we started doing water quality work, and we realized the PhyloChip could provide a fundamentally new and improved method for doing source tracking,  Andersen said. A Library of Poop Determining the source of any particular pathogen is not a straightforward task. In most cases, a single microbe is not a definitive marker of an animal or other source.  A microbial community is complex,  Dubinsky said.  A cow may have 1,000 different organisms.  So Andersen and Dubinsky had an idea.  We had Laleh Cot , an intern at the time and now a Lab employee, run around and basically collect poop from all sorts of animals,  said Andersen.  What we ve done since then is develop a reference library of the microbial communities that occur in different types of poop we have cows, horses, raccoons, humans, different types of birds, pigs, sea lions, and other animals, as well as sewage and septage. We used that library to develop a model.  The new method takes the unknown sample and compares it against this microbial reference library.  We ve used the PhyloChip in a way that it hasn t been used before by using machine learning models to analyze the data in order to detect and classify sources,  Andersen said.  It s essentially giving you a statistical probability that a microbial community came from a particular source.  They validated their method by comparing it to about 40 other methods of microbial source tracking in a California study.  We were the only method that could detect all sources and get them right,  Dubinsky said. If the source is an animal that is not in the reference library, their method can still point you in the right direction.  For example, in that study, one sample was a chicken,  said Dubinsky.  We hadn t analyzed chickens, but we had geese, gulls, and pigeons. We were still able to determine that the sample was a bird.  In extensive testing throughout the Russian River watershed, which is out of compliance with the Clean Water Act, the Berkeley Lab researchers found widespread contamination by human sources close to areas where communities rely on aging septic tanks. They also found significant human contamination immediately after a weekend jazz festival, whereas testing by conventional methods yielded a much weaker signal after a time lag of a couple days.  Our method is more sensitive to human contamination than those fecal indicator tests are,  Dubinsky said. Next Steps The team is now working on characterizing the microbial community of naturally occurring E. coli and Enterococci, using Hawaii with its warm waters as a testing ground.  They can occur naturally in sediments and decaying kelp and vegetation,  Dubinsky said.  It is known that they do, but nobody has developed a test to definitively show that.  The researchers will also be able to study whether climate affects microbial communities.  Does a Hawaiian cow look like a California cow in terms of fecal bacteria composition? That s a good question and something we ll be able to find out,  he said. They are working closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is looking at new technologies for what it calls  next generation compliance.  Ultimately the goal is to develop their method possibly with a downsized version of the PhyloChip to the point where it can be universally used in any location and by non-experts. Dubinsky says the method should also be useful with the burgeoning issue of algal blooms, to understand, for example, the processes by which they form, or the microbial dynamics before and after a bloom, and specifically, whether runoff from livestock production in the Midwest is related to algal blooms in the Great Lakes, a question they re investigating with the EPA.","Published: October 6, 2016"

UT scientist Floris van den Brink developed a fast and efficient mixer for this. Substances foreign to the human body   toxic substances, or medication, for example   can have such a short lifetime that the effect is hard to examine. Sometimes the damage already has been done. For example: what happens if PAHs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, interact with hemoglobin in blood? PAHs are released at asphalt road works or coal power plants, for example. Using his new lab-on-a-chip system, Floris van den Brink is able to examine this fast interaction, just like in the human body. Our body, especially the liver, converts these foreign substances into metabolites. The chip does this as well: a tiny electrochemical reactor produces PAH metabolites like hydroxypyrene. The next step is mixing these metabolites with hemoglobine, to see in what way the toxic and highly reactive metabolite binds to hemoglobine. Using a new mixing technique, this can be done very fast: well within a second. Using the same micro laboratory, possible remedies can be examined as well, for detoxing the blood. In this way, the chip can also be used for measuring the effects of medication without the need of using laboratory animals.  Rapid mixing Mixing of fluids on a micro or nano scale is not trivial: they behave differently in the tiny fluid channels, and mechanical stirring is not an option. Van den Brink therefore designed two circular mixing chambers, consisting of tiny channels that have a gradient. One substance enters above, the other below. Using the angle difference, mixing can be accelerated substantially. The entire mixer is no bigger than 0.1 square millimeter. Using mass spectrometry, the output is analysed. The reactor is also special: using diamond electrodes instead of platinum ones, the yield is improved.  Proteomics Measuring the effect of hydroxypyrene metabolites on hemoglobine is just one example of the possible applications of the new chip. The system is suitable for analysing numerous types of interactions with proteins, possibly DNA as well. As proteomics is gaining importance in the development of medicine, the chip is a fast and powerful tool.","Published: October 6, 2016"

Professor Peter O Connor and Dr Maria van Agthoven in the Department of Chemistry have invented a device which makes 2D mass spectrometry - an effective process for analysing and sequencing proteins - widely accessible for the first time ever. This could lead to a revolution in the pharmaceutical and biomedical communities, enabling researchers and companies to produce data-driven results on how protein molecules function, more easily and cheaply. 2D mass spectrometry allows chemists to explore the elemental composition and structure of a molecule by breaking it apart, and analysing its fragmented pieces   measuring mass, and gathering data on how the whole molecule functions and interacts with its environment. High numbers of molecules can be experimented on at the same time in this way, as the various fragments of different broken molecules can be modulated at the same frequencies as the molecule from which they originated. Professor O Connor and Dr van Agthoven have patented an instrument with which 2D Mass spectrometry can be performed using a linear ion trap   this is a cheaper, smaller, and much more accessible option than was previously available. The device can be added onto existing MS instruments as well as being bought with new instruments. The process is currently undertaken using large, expensive machinery, which makes it a relatively exclusive scientific activity. However, the new invention is opening up the technique to a much wider market. Mass spectrometry produces precise results during protein sequencing, and this type of data-driven biology will produce quicker, better results than are currently obtained in pharmaceutical and biomedical research. Dr van Agthoven comments that the breakthrough could have numerous and varied applications:  Two-dimensional mass spectrometry has the potential to exponentially increase our knowledge in all areas, from biochemistry to food safety and environmental chemistry.  Professor O Connor is confident that this invention will change biomedical research dramatically: ""2-Dimensional mass spectrometry in a simple and cheap linear ion trap will revolutionise proteomics and detailed characterisation of complex samples.""","Published: October 6, 2016"

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/size-matters-for-particles-in-bloodstream-209625,Size Matters for Particles in Bloodstream Research uncovers more information about how particles behave in the human bloodstream  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.A UConn engineering professor has uncovered new information about how particles behave in our bloodstream, an important advancement that could help pharmaceutical scientists develop more effective cancer drugs. Making sure cancer medications reach the leaky blood vessels surrounding most tumor sites is one of the critical aspects of treatment and drug delivery. While surface chemistry, molecular interactions, and other factors come into play once drug-carrying particles arrive at a tumor, therapeutic medication doesn t do very much good if it never reaches its intended target. Anson Ma, assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, used a microfluidic channel device to observe, track, and measure how individual particles behaved in a simulated blood vessel. Ma says he wanted to learn more about the physics influencing a particle s behavior as it travels in our blood and to determine which particle size might be the most effective for delivering drugs to their targets. His experimental findings mark the first time such quantitative data has been gathered. The study appears today in the Biophysical Journal.  Even before particles reach a target site, you have to worry about what is going to happen with them after they get injected into the bloodstream,  Ma says.  Are they going to clump together? How are they going to move around? Are they going to get swept away and flushed out of our bodies?  Using a high-powered fluorescence microscope in UConn s Complex Fluids Lab, Ma was able to see particles moving in the simulated blood vessel in what could be described as a vascular Running of the Bulls. Red blood cells race through the middle of the channel as the particles   highlighted under the fluorescent light   get carried along in the rush, bumping and bouncing off the blood cells until they are pushed to open spaces   called the cell-free layer   along the vessel s walls. What Ma found was that larger particles   the optimum size appeared to be about 2 microns   were most likely to get pushed to the cell-free layer, where their chances of carrying medication into a tumor site are greatest. The research team also determined that 2 microns was the largest size that should be used if particles are going to have any chance of going through the leaky blood vessel walls into the tumor site.  When it comes to using particles for the delivery of cancer drugs, size matters,  Ma says.  When you have a bigger particle, the chance of it bumping into blood cells is much higher, there are a lot more collisions, and they tend to get pushed to the blood vessel walls.  The results were somewhat surprising. In preparing their hypothesis, the research team estimated that smaller particles were probably the most effective since they would move the most in collisions with blood cells, much like what happens when a small ball bounces off a larger one. But just the opposite proved true. The smaller particles appeared to skirt through the mass of moving blood cells and were less likely to experience the  trampoline  effect and get bounced to the cell-free layer, says Ma. Ma proposed the study after talking to a UConn pharmaceutical scientist about drug development at a campus event five years ago.  We had a great conversation about how drugs are made and then I asked,  But how can you be sure where the particles go?  Ma recalls, laughing.  I m an engineer. That s how we think. I was curious. This was an engineering question. So I said,  Let s write a proposal!  The proposal was funded by the National Science Foundation s Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research or EAGER program, which supports exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. Knowing how particles behave in our circulatory system should help improve targeted drug delivery, Ma says, which in turn will further reduce the toxic side effects caused by potent cancer drugs missing their target and impacting the body s healthy tissue. The findings were particularly meaningful for Ma, who lost two of his grandparents to cancer and who has long wanted to contribute to cancer research in a meaningful way as an engineer. Measuring how particles of different sizes move in the bloodstream may also be beneficial in bioimaging, where scientists and doctors want to keep particles circulating in the bloodstream long enough for imaging to occur. In that case, smaller particles would be better, says Ma. Moving forward, Ma would like to explore other aspects of particle flow in our circulatory system, such as how particles behave when they pass through a constricted area, such as from a blood vessel to a capillary. Capillaries are only about 7 microns in diameter. The average human hair is 100 microns.  Ma says he would like to know how that constricted space might impact particle flow or the ability of particles to accumulate near the vessel walls.  We have all of this complex geometry in our bodies,  says Ma.  Most people just assume there is no impact when a particle moves from a bigger channel to a smaller channel because they haven t quantified it. Our plan is to do some experiments to look at this more carefully, building on the work that we just published. ","Published: October 6, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/junk-dna-critical-for-heart-function-199009, Junk  DNA Critical for Heart Function Loss of noncoding elements of genome  known as enhancers  results in abnormalities of heart functions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers have shown that when parts of a genome known as enhancers are missing, the heart works abnormally, a finding that bolsters the importance of DNA segments once considered  junk  because they do not code for specific proteins. The team, led by scientists at the Department of Energy s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), examined the role of two heart enhancers in the mouse genome, showing that the loss of either one resulted in symptoms that resemble human cardiomyopathy, a disease in which the heart muscle often becomes enlarged or rigid. In humans, the disease often leads to heart failure. The findings appear in a study published in the journal Nature Communications. In that same paper, the researchers provided a comprehensive genome-wide map of more than 80,000 enhancers considered relevant to human heart development and function. The two heart enhancers that they tested were the mouse equivalent of enhancers chosen from among that catalog.  The cardiac changes that we observed in knockout mice lacking these enhancers highlight the role of noncoding sequences in processes that are important in human disease,  said study co-senior author Axel Visel, senior staff scientist and one of three lead researchers at the Mammalian Functional Genomics Laboratory, part of Berkeley Lab s Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology (EGSB) Division.  Identifying and interpreting sequence changes affecting noncoding sequences is increasingly a challenge in human genetics. The genome-wide catalog of heart enhancers provided through this study will facilitate the interpretation of human genetic data sets.  Study lead author Diane Dickel, project scientist, and co-senior author Len Pennacchio, senior staff scientist, both work with Visel at Berkeley Lab s Mammalian Functional Genomics Laboratory. DNA Dark Matter When scientists sequenced the human genome, they discovered that less than 5 percent of our DNA were genes that actually coded for protein sequences. The biological functions of the noncoding portions of the genome were unclear. Over the past fifteen years, however, there has been a growing appreciation for the importance of these noncoding regions, thanks in large part to the efforts of individual labs and, more recently, large international efforts such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. What became clear from this work is that there are many elements of the genome, including enhancers, which are involved in regulating gene expression, even though they do not encode for proteins directly. This realization meant that there were vast sections of the genome that needed to be explored and understood. Dickel noted that there are about 20,000 genes in the mouse genome, and in many cases, scientists have a fairly good understanding of what will happen if any one of them is disabled. In contrast, there are 80,000 candidate heart enhancers in the human genome, and it is still unclear how important they are for human development.  In genetic studies the way you establish whether a gene is important is you delete it from the genome and see what happens,  said Dickel.  In many cases, there are genes that, if disabled, make it difficult for the organism to survive. For enhancers, it s less known what the consequences are if they are damaged or missing. To use a car analogy, if we took the battery out of a car, it wouldn t start. That s a critical component. A missing or damaged enhancer could be essential like a battery, or more similar to a missing passenger seat in the car. It s not as nice, but it s still possible to drive the car.  Mapping and Testing the Enhancers To assess the function of heart enhancers, the researchers first compiled a single road map to guide them. They used results from a technology called ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) to identify the likely heart enhancers in the human genome. The researchers say this map will become an important tool as advances in genomics usher in a new era of personalized medicine.  This compendium of human heart enhancers will be a valuable resource for many disease researchers who have begun adopting whole genome sequencing of patients to look for disease-causing mutations in both the coding and noncoding portion of the genome,  said Dickel. Using the map, the researchers picked two enhancers located near genes associated with human heart disease. They then determined their equivalent enhancers on the mouse genome and disabled them in mice. They compared the mice with the disabled enhancers with control mice that had no mutation and saw very large changes in gene expression in the test mice. Echocardiograms used to image the hearts from the two groups of mice confirmed that the heart tissue of mice with a disabled enhancer was pumping with less power than normal, consistent with the signs of human cardiomyopathy.  Prior to this work, no study had looked at what happens to heart function as a result of knocking out the heart enhancers in the genome,  said Dickel.  What was surprising to me was that outwardly, the knockout mice seemed fine. If you just looked at them, you wouldn t necessarily see anything wrong. ","Published: October 6, 2016"

It can however become a formidable pathogen causing fatal infections, especially in intubated patients, people suffering from cystic fibrosis or severe burns. The presence of certain metals in the natural or human environment of the bacterium makes it more dangerous and, in particular, resistant to antibiotics of last resort.  A team of researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, has shown that a specific protein of P. aeruginosa, called Host factor q (Hfq), is essential for reacting to these metals and acquiring these new properties. The results, presented in the special issue Virulence Gene Regulation in Bacteria of the journal Genes, single out the Hfq protein as the Achilles heel of P. aeruginosa. Indeed, blocking its action could make this pathogen unable to adapt to a new environment and to resist to certain antibiotics.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous bacterium found in both land and water. This organism is known as opportunistic, as it is able to produce various virulence factors and to adapt to its environment to invade, colonize and survive within human beings, taking advantage of a weakening of its host to become pathogenic. The infections it causes are often difficult, if not impossible to treat because of a resistance to many types of antibiotics.  Abnormal amounts of metals  'We had discovered that high concentrations of metals, such as zinc, could induce a resistance to carbapenems, which are antibiotics of last resort, as well as an increase in the production of virulence factors , says Karl Perron, researcher at the Department of Botany and Plant Biology of the UNIGE Faculty of Science. This metal may be present in abnormal amounts in the lung secretions of cystic fibrosis patients and in some urinary catheters, contributing to an increase in the pathogenicity of the bacterium and to treatment failure.  Some antibiotics must penetrate the bacteria to exert their effect. Carbapenems, for example, pass through a specific porin, a sort of channel normally used to import nutrients. When the bacterium is present in an environment containing an excess of zinc, it becomes resistant to carbapenems.  We had observed that zinc and other metals induce a suppression of the production of this porin, but we did not know exactly how , specifies Verena Ducret, biologist in the Geneva group and first author of the article.  Target the bacterium without affecting the host  The team of Karl Perron has solved this enigma by uncovering the central role of a bacterial protein called Host factor q (Hfq).  This chaperone, a molecular assistant that allows the bacterium to adjust the synthesis of various proteins according to its needs, inhibits the synthesis of certain porins by intervening at several levels of the production chain , explains Verena Ducret. By studying a bacterium that does not express Hfq, the scientists have thus discovered a real Achilles heel, because the mutant is unable to respond to zinc and other metals. Therefore, it cannot express its virulence or become resistant to carbapenems in the presence of these metals.  Since the different pathways leading to the inhibition of the production of this porin use Hfq, this chaperone becomes a promising therapeutic target.  We are looking for different inhibitors of Hfq that act on Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. These drugs should counter all of the pathogen s direct and indirect effects without affecting the host cells, because they do not have proteins such as Hfq , says Karl Perron.

When skeletal muscles, those connected to the bone, are injured, muscle stem cells wake up from a dormant state and repair the damage. When muscles age, however, stem cell number and function declines, as do both tissue function and regenerative ability.  Carnegie s Christoph Lepper and team, including researchers from the University of Missouri, investigated muscle stem cell pool size. In particular, they asked if stem cell number could be increased, and if there would be any associated functional benefits. Using genetically modified mice, the scientists found that while a muscle s size remained unchanged, it surprisingly, is capable of supporting a much greater number of these stem cells than previously thought. These  super-numeral  stem cells could repair injured muscle and were faster at it than when only normal numbers are present. The team also found that the increase in stem cells stunts the decline of weakened, degenerative muscles, potentially a boon for fighting muscular dystrophy. The study is published in the October 11, 2016, issue of eLife.   Muscle stem cells, called satellite cells, are undifferentiated muscle cells that promote growth, repair and regeneration. As Lepper explained:  These satellite cells make up some 5-7% of all muscle cells and are essential to muscle regeneration. When a mouse is born, the satellite cells divide and differentiate for about 3 to 4 weeks driving tissue growth. They then go quiet until an injury is detected. The number of satellite cells set aside at this time appears to be relatively constant with regard to the host muscle tissue size. We wanted to see whether this ratio could be manipulated and, if so, whether there would be any physiological consequences.  Lepper s collaborator Richard Tsika had previously generated mice that overexpressed a gene called TEAD1 and found that the protein the gene produces, TEAD1, affects the regulation of the type of muscle fiber produced. The current study documents the dramatic effect TEAD1-expressing muscle fibers have on their associated satellite cells, which do not express TEAD1. TEAD1 transgenic mice have up to a six-fold increase in the number of satellite cells, which was true across all muscle groups that were analyzed. This study facilitated the surprising discovery that the muscle fiber can  communicate  to its stem cells to influence the stem cell pool size. This molecular communication to the satellite cells was the origin of the stem cell increase.  We were very surprised to find that it was possible to uncouple the number of stem cells from the host tissue size without seeing negative consequences to muscle physiology,  remarked Sheryl Southard, co-lead author on the paper with Ju-Ryoung Kim. Remarkably, the increased number allowed muscles to regenerate much faster after injury. Importantly, the scientists found that in a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, TEAD1 overexpression stunted the wasting disease. The researchers suggest that the increase in the number of satellite cells, without any changes to overall muscle size, makes the genetically modified TEAD1 mouse a good model organism. With it, they hope to discover the molecular cascade that regulates muscle stem cell number and the  stop  and  go  signals that cause the cells to differentiate and go quiet.","Published: October 6, 2016"

Using a modified C-130 Hercules aircraft, expert spotters, and an experimental array of plastic scanning equipment, the expedition aims to accurately measure the biggest and most harmful debris in the ocean. This is an essential milestone in preparation for the cleanup of the patch, scheduled to begin before the end of the decade.  This first-ever aerial survey of floating ocean plastic provided confirmation of the abundance of plastic debris sized 0.5m and up. While the flight plan took them along the Northern boundary of the patch, more debris was recorded than what is expected to be found in the heart of the accumulation zone. Initial estimates of the experienced observer crew indicate that in a span of 2.5hours, over a thousand items were counted.  For the development of a cleanup technology, it is essential to understand the problem, specifically the dimensions of the individual objects and the plastic accumulation as a whole. The nature and amount of the debris determine the design of cleanup systems, the logistics of hauling plastic back to shore, the methods for recycling plastic, and the costs of the cleanup.  The quest to answer this question started in August 2015, when The Ocean Cleanup s fleet of about 30 vessels crossed the patch simultaneously in an operation named the Mega Expedition. On their crossing wide range of debris sizes were sampled, producing the first high-resolution map of the patch. By using sampling nets that were 80x larger than conventional scientific measurement tools, it was discovered that the amount of large debris was heavily underestimated.  The Mega Expedition successfully measured plastic up to 0.5m in size, but there were signs of a significant mass of plastic even larger than that. This includes  ghost nets  - discarded fishing nets many meters in diameter, which are notorious for ensnaring sea life and ship propellers. To accurately quantify those and other very large debris, a much larger area must be covered, which lead to the launch of the Aerial Expedition. For every 5 minutes of flight the same ocean surface area is scanned that was covered by the entire Mega Expedition in 2015. This increase in survey area enables the quantification of the largest pieces of trash in the ocean, resolving the last piece of this puzzle.","Published: October 6, 2016"

They act on a wide variety of biological pathways, including those regulating cell division and circadian rhythms. It is known that circadian clocks can modify cancer therapy effectiveness, according to studies aimed at optimizing treatments based on the circadian cycle. It is therefore important to determine whether treatments with curcumin or similar chemotherapeutic agents are regulated by circadian timing. Similarly, it is important to characterize any effects of curcumin on timing abilities of the circadian clocks within cancer cells. Methods We examined the circadian clock s impact on the timing of cell death and cell division in curcumin-treated C6 rat glioma cells through continuous video microscopy for several days. To evaluate its persistence and distribution in cancer cells, curcumin was localized within cell compartments by imaging its autofluorescence. Finally, HPLC and spectroscopy were used to determine the relative stabilities of the curcumin congeners demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin that are present in turmeric. Results Circadian rhythms in cell death were observed in response to low (5  M) curcumin, reaching a peak several hours before the peak in rhythmic expression of mPER2 protein, a major circadian clock component. These results revealed a sensitive phase of the circadian cycle that could be effectively targeted in patient therapies based on curcumin or its analogs. Curcumin fluorescence was observed in cell compartments at least 24 h after treatment, and the two congeners displayed greater stability than curcumin in cell culture medium. Conclusions We propose a mechanism whereby curcuminoids act in a sustained manner, over several days, despite their tendency to degrade rapidly in blood and other aqueous media. During cancer therapy, curcumin or its analogs should be delivered to tumor cells at the optimal phase for highest efficacy after identifying the circadian phase of the cancer cells. We confirmed the greater stability of the curcumin congeners, suggesting that they may produce sustained toxicity in cancer cells and should be considered for use in patient care.","Published: October 6, 2016"

The findings, published in the September 9 issue of Scientific Reports, represent a rare attempt to use metabolic biomarkers to assess the reported health benefits of integrative medicine and holistic practices. Senior author of the study, which included researchers from multiple institutions, was Deepak Chopra, MD, clinical professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and a noted proponent of integrative medicine.   It appears that a one-week Panchakarma program can significantly alter the metabolic profile of the person undergoing it,  said Chopra, whose foundation provided and managed funding for the study.  As part of our strategy to create a framework for whole systems biology research, our next step will be to correlate these changes with both gene expression and psychological health.  Study co-author Paul J. Mills, PhD, professor of family medicine and public health and director of the Center of Excellence for Research and Training in Integrative Health, both at UC San Diego School of Medicine, noted that alternative and integrative medicine practices, such as meditation and Ayurveda, are extremely popular, but their effects on the human microbiome, genome and physiology are not fully understood.  Our program of research is dedicated to addressing these gaps in the literature.   The researchers looked at the effects of a Panchakarma-based Ayurvedic intervention on plasma metabolites in a controlled clinical trial,  said first author Christine Tara Peterson, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  Panchakarma refers to a detoxification and rejuvenation protocol involving massage, herbal therapy and other procedures to help strengthen and rejuvenate the body.  The study involved 119 healthy male and female participants between 30 and 80 years of age who stayed at the Chopra Center for Wellbeing in Carlsbad, Calif. Slightly more than half were assigned to the Panchakarma intervention (the Chopra Center s Perfect Health program, which typically costs $2,865 for a six-day treatment). The remainder to a control group. Blood plasma analyses, using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, were taken before and after the six-day testing period. The researchers found that in the Panchakarma group there was a measurable decrease in 12 specific cell-membrane chemicals (phosphatidylcholines) correlating with serum cholesterol and inversely related to Type 2 diabetes risk.   These phospholipids exert broad effects on pathways related to inflammation and cholesterol metabolism,  said Peterson.  Plasma and serum levels of the metabolites of phosphatidylcholine are highly predictive of cardiovascular disease risk.     ","Published: October 6, 2016"

The record shows that atmospheric oxygen has declined 0.7 percent relative to current atmospheric-oxygen concentrations, a reasonable pace by geological standards, the researchers said. During the past 100 years, however, atmospheric oxygen has declined by a comparatively speedy 0.1 percent because of the burning of fossil fuels, which consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Curiously, the decline in atmospheric oxygen over the past 800,000 years was not accompanied by any significant increase in the average amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though carbon dioxide concentrations do vary over individual ice age cycles. To explain this apparent paradox, the researchers called upon a theory for how the global carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide and Earth s temperature are linked on geologic timescales.  The planet has various processes that can keep carbon dioxide levels in check,  said first author Daniel Stolper, a postdoctoral research associate in Princeton s Department of Geosciences. The researchers discuss a process known as silicate weathering in particular, wherein carbon dioxide reacts with exposed rock to produce, eventually, calcium carbonate minerals, which trap carbon dioxide in a solid form. As temperatures rise due to higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, silicate-weathering rates are hypothesized to increase and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere faster. Stolper and his co-authors suggest that the extra carbon dioxide emitted due to declining oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere stimulated silicate weathering, which stabilized carbon dioxide but allowed oxygen to continue to decline.  The oxygen record is telling us there s also a change in the amount of carbon dioxide [that was created when oxygen was removed] entering the atmosphere and ocean,  said co-author John Higgins, Princeton assistant professor of geosciences.  However, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels aren t changing because the Earth has had time to respond via increased silicate-weathering rates.  The Earth can take care of extra carbon dioxide when it has hundreds of thousands or millions of years to get its act together. In contrast, humankind is releasing carbon dioxide today so quickly that silicate weathering can t possibly respond fast enough,  Higgins continued.  The Earth has these long processes that humankind has short-circuited.  The researchers built their history of atmospheric oxygen using measured ratios of oxygen-to-nitrogen found in air trapped in Antarctic ice. This method was established by co-author Michael Bender, professor of geosciences, emeritus, at Princeton. Because oxygen is critical to many forms of life and geochemical processes, numerous models and indirect proxies for the oxygen content in the atmosphere have been developed over the years, but there was no consensus on whether oxygen concentrations were rising, falling or flat during the past million years (and before fossil fuel burning). The Princeton team analyzed the ice-core data to create a single account of how atmospheric oxygen has changed during the past 800,000 years.  This record represents an important benchmark for the study of the history of atmospheric oxygen,  Higgins said.  Understanding the history of oxygen in Earth s atmosphere is intimately connected to understanding the evolution of complex life. It s one of these big, fundamental ongoing questions in Earth science. ","Published: October 6, 2016"

Every year, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) rises during winter and then falls slightly during the Northern Hemisphere s growing season, as plants take up the greenhouse gas during photosynthesis. But this year, for the first time since before the Ice Age, CO2 will not fall below 400 ppm.   It s unlikely we ll ever see CO2 below 400 ppm during our lifetime and probably much longer,  says Pieter Tans, lead scientist of NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network.  Measurements taken at NOAA s atmospheric observatories on Mauna Loa and at the South Pole both indicate that CO2 has passed 400 ppm for good.  What s so important about 400 ppm?  Four hundred parts per million is an arbitrary milestone, but it also may be a window on our future.  The last time CO2 levels were this high was the mid-Pliocene warm period   about three million years ago. Paleoclimate research suggests that there was a lot less ice to cool the planet then. The extent of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were severely reduced. Ditto for the Arctic.  Three million years ago, sea levels were up to 65 feet higher than today. Forests replaced tundra as trees marched toward the North Pole. Tropical rainforests were squished into a narrow band around the equator. In the United States, the Central and Southern plains might not have had sub-freezing temperatures in winter, let alone white Christmases.   There were some differences in continent locations, and in Earth's orbit around the sun, but the Pliocene is considered a bellwether for what future climate might be like,  says Bruce Bauer, a scientist with NOAA s National Centers for Environmental Information. The race towards greater warming What s more troubling, says Tans, is that the rate of CO2 increase is more than 100 times faster than anything observed in the ice core record that goes back 800,000 years. This will continue as long as fossil fuel consumption remains at its current high level worldwide. For most of human evolution, CO2 levels hovered around 278 ppm, helping to maintain the global climate in a relatively stable state conducive to agriculture and the growth of human populations. That all changed, starting in the 1850s with massive deforestation around the world; then in the 1950s, a dramatic increase in the burning of fossil fuels   coal to make electricity and steel, oil for vehicles and manufacturing   vastly accelerated the rate of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere.    About 85% of all fossil fuel consumption since the start of the industrial revolution took place during my lifetime,  said Tans.","Published: October 6, 2016"

This is the Company s first product to enter clinical trials. KA2237 is a dual-selective inhibitor of two PI3K isoforms, p110  and p110 . Inhibiting these two isoforms combines an immunotherapeutic response and a direct effect on tumor growth, through selective, targeting of the PI3K pathway. Karus believes that KA2237 has broad therapeutic applicability in the treatment of hematological and solid tumors, as a single agent and in combination with other drugs. This study forms part of the pre-clinical and clinical collaboration between Karus and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the world s leading cancer research and care center. The first part of the trial has been designed to assess the safety of KA2237 alone in relapsed, treatment-resistant B cell lymphoma patients. An expansion cohort study will follow and is scheduled to start in 2017. Karus anticipates that up to 40 patients will be treated over the entire study. Dr. Simon Kerry, CEO of Karus Therapeutics, commented:  Our first clinical trial is a major milestone for the company. Karus has made exceptional progress and our collaboration with MD Anderson will help us to accelerate this clinical program. We believe that as an orally-active dual p110 /  inhibitor, KA2237 has significant potential in the treatment of hematological and solid tumors in areas of high, unmet medical need.  Professor Stephen Shuttleworth, CSO, added:  Our R&D programs are built on many years  investment in research that have given us a deep understanding of PI3K medicinal chemistry and tumor biology. To take a scientific concept through rational de novo-design to create KA2237, a dual-selective, small molecule PI3K inhibitor that has been designed specifically to address areas of unmet medical need, is a very rewarding moment in our journey towards developing new cancer treatments for patients with few remaining therapeutic options.  The agreement with MD Anderson covers a number of preclinical studies of Karus s two cancer programs, KA2237 and KA2507, with a focus on identifying optimal drug combinations and the appropriate patient populations for further clinical development. The second program, KA2507, a selective-HDAC6 inhibitor, also has both a targeted therapy and immunotherapeutic action and has potential in the treatment of multiple myeloma, B- and T-cell lymphomas and PD-L1 expressing hematological and solid tumors.","Published: October 6, 2016"

The induced (man-made) germline mouse mutations developed in Dr. Beutler s UT Southwestern laboratory are critical to support genetic research in all mammals, including humans. Germline DNA is the genetic material in egg and sperm cells. Dr. Beutler, Director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at UT Southwestern, transferred the samples to the NIH-supported Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC), which collects, distributes, and flash-freezes scientifically valuable, genetically engineered mouse strains and cell lines. The repository, which makes these samples available to researchers worldwide, provides academic researchers with unique genetic models that are unavailable commercially. UT Southwestern President Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky hailed the transfer as part of the institution s bench-to-bedside priority to translate scientific advances into lifesaving, improved patient care.  There are many striking similarities between the genomes of the mouse and human, such that some genes have the same effects in both species. This contribution will make these powerful resources available to investigators worldwide to accelerate the discovery of new treatments and means of disease prevention,  said Dr. Podolsky, who holds the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science.  We are proud that this work has been done on our campus, and we expect that sharing this scientific resource will exert far-ranging impacts across the fields of science and medicine.  The estimated 175,000 mutations, cryopreserved in mouse sperm, represent nearly 90 percent of the man-made germline mutations available worldwide, said Dr. Beutler, also Professor of Immunology, a Regental Professor, and holder of the Raymond and Ellen Willie Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research, in Honor of Laverne and Raymond Willie, Sr. The mutations are found in 21,000 genes and include more than 16,000 characterized as  probably null,  which to scientists and geneticists means the gene in question is essentially inactivated.  Thousands of these null mutations   which are usually equivalent to a knockout model   are not available from any other source,  Dr. Beutler said. Dr. Beutler s UTSW laboratory was designed for high-throughput mutagenesis and phenotyping, meaning identification of genetic traits based on the interaction of genetics and the environment. The approximately 175,000 transferred mutations are part of the current mutation tally surpassing 265,000 logged on his laboratory s Mutagenetix website, Dr. Beutler said. Professor Chris Goodnow of the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sidney, Australia   a close collaborator of Dr. Beutler and co-recipient of funding from the NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)   archived an additional 91,000 induced mutations, which are viewable at the Australian Phenomics Facility. In addition to receiving primary funding from the NIAID, Dr. Beutler also received generous support from several sources, including the Kent and JoAnn Foster Family Foundation for the five-year effort that resulted in creating and characterizing the mutations. The mutagenesis project grew out of his Nobel-prize winning research done at UT Southwestern from 1993 to 1998 exploring the genetics of host defense, meaning when the host, or body, recognizes and responds to infection. One line of defense is the body s innate immune response, which is launched against newly encountered pathogens. A desire to find and understand all the genes and mutations involved in innate immunity led Dr. Beutler to create the Mutagenetix database to characterize every mutation responsible for immune abnormalities in mice and, ultimately, in humans.  We are continuing to generate, index, and preserve close to 2,000 new mutations each week, and we would like all of the scientific community to benefit from them,  Dr. Beutler said.","Published: October 6, 2016"

The integrated circuits that powered the past 50 years of technological revolution are reaching their physical limits. This predicament has computer scientists scrambling for new ideas: new devices built using novel physics, new ways of organizing units within computers and even algorithms that use new or existing systems more efficiently. To help coordinate new ideas, Sandia National Laboratories has assisted organizing the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Rebooting Computing being held Oct. 17-19, 2016. See Also: Touchless technology for vascular surgery is now being extended to neurosurgery Researchers from Sandia's Data-driven and Neural Computing Department will present three papers at the conference, hi ghlighting the breadth of potential non-traditional neural computing applications. ""We're taking a stab at the scope of what neural algorithms can do. We're not trying to be exhaustive, but rather we're trying to highlight the kind of application over which algorithms may be impactful,"" said Brad Aimone, a computational neuroscientist and co-author of one paper. Historically, neural computing has been seen as approximate and fuzzy, he added; however, Sandia researchers in their papers aim to extend neural algorithms so they incorporate rigor and predictability, which shows they may have a role in high performance scientific computing. The three papers are entitled ""Overcoming the Static Learning Bottleneck the Need for Adaptive Neural Learning"" by Craig Vineyard and Steve Verzi; ""Computing with Dynamical Systems"" by Fred Rothganger; and ""Spiking Network Algorithms for Scientific Computing"" by William Severa, Ojas Parekh, Kris Carlson, Conrad James and Aimone. The brain is continually learning. ""While we do learn in school, our learning doesn't stop when school ends. Instead, our brains are continually adapting through processes, such as synaptic modifications. However, most machine-learning algorithms learn once and are done,"" said Vineyard, a computer scientist. Most so-called machine-learning algorithms have a learning phase and a separate testing and operation phase. This is really time consuming. Ambitious and challenging attempts to develop algorithms that learn continuously also run the risk of the algori hm ""learning"" something that's wrong, Vineyard said. Learn More: New technology allows medical professionals to step into the shoes of patients with Young-Onset Parkinson's disease His paper argues for continual learning and suggests the use of game theory the mathematics of logical decisions, such as when to take out the trash and when to hope your roommate will do it for you -- to bring precision to the decision of when an algorithm should learn. A dynamical system is an equation that describes how things change with time. A simple dynamical system is a function that describes the movement of a grandfather clock's pendulum. ""The idea behind using dynamical systems for computation is to build a machine such that its dynamics which has to do with the structure of the machine or the structure of the math -- will lead it to the answer based on feeding it the question,"" said Rothganger, a computer scientist. Both our brains and, in a way, conventional computers are dynamical systems: They find answers just based on the question and how the computers are constructed, said Rothganger. His paper proposes that if researchers think of a traditional scientific computing problem, matrix decomposition, as a dynamical system, they could solve them rigorously on neuro-inspired systems. ""There's a lot of potential and also a lot of risk in the idea I'm working on,"" said Rothganger. If his idea works, ""it would provide a point of unification between neural algorithms and traditional numerical algorithms."" The third paper identifies three hand-crafted algorithms that use the careful arrangement of spiking neuron-like nodes to perform precise computations. In the brain, each neuron is connected to many other neurons and uses spikes of electricity to communicate. Severa, a mathematician, and his co-authors took inspiration from these aspects of the brain. Don't Miss: Novel eye-tracking technology detects concussions and head injury severity An example of these innovative algorithms is a kind of flow estimation called particle image velocimetry. By taking two pictures of dust motes moving through the air and figuring out how far they moved in the time between photos, researchers can determine the speed of the air and any local eddies. This can be done on a conventional computer using fancy math, but Severa's method uses the massively parallel nature of neurons to calculate all the possible shifts efficiently, he said. ""By carefully designing your networks and the properties of your neurons, you can do exact things,"" said Severa. ""You can push the envelope of what you can expect a neural network to do."" Whether the future holds neuro-inspired computers in your cellphone that understand phrases like ""Show me a cute picture of Fluffy"" and ""Order my favorite Chinese food,"" or if neural computers can also work alongside future quantum computers in solving tough math problems quickly, computing needs to be reinvented, and soon, said Aimone. By bringing together experts in many different disciplines, he said the International Conference on Rebooting Computing aims to nurture new ideas and spur this revolution. Funding for all the projects was provided by Sandia's Laboratory Directed Research and Development office. Two projects also were part of the Hardware Acceleration of Adaptive Neural Algorithms (HAANA) Grand Challenge.

""Identifying new pathways that can be targeted for drug design is an important step forward in improving the treatment of depressive disorders,"" said Sarah Brooker, the first author and an MD/PhD student at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Brooker did the research in the lab of senior study author Dr. Jack Kessler, a professor of neurology at Feinberg and a Northwestern Medicine neurologist. The aim of the study was to better understand how current antidepressants work in the brain. The ultimate goal is to find new ones that are more effective for people not currently getting relief from existing drugs. Learn More: A fast-acting antidepressant appears within reach In the study, scientists discovered for the first time that antidepressant drugs such as Prozac and tricyclics target a pathway in the hippocampus called the BMP signaling pathway. A signaling pathway is a group of molecules in a cell that work together to control one or more cell functions. Like a cascade, after the first molecule in a pathway receives a signal, it activates another molecule and so forth until the cell function is carried out. Brooker and colleagues showed that Prozac (fluoxetine) and tricyclics inhibit this pathway and, thereby, trigger stem cells in the brain to produce more neurons. These particular neurons are involved in mood and memory formation. But the scientists didn't know if blocking the pathway contributed to the drugs' antidepressant effect because Prozac acts on multiple mechanisms in the brain. After confirming the importance of the BMP pathway in depression, Northwestern scientists tested a brain protein, Noggin, on depressed mice. Noggin is known block the BMP pathway and stimulate new neurons, called neurogenesis. ""We hypothesized it would have an antidepressant effect, but we weren't sure,"" Brooker said. They discovered Noggin blocks the pathway more precisely and effectively than Prozac or tricyclics. It had a robust antidepressant effect in mice. Scientists injected Noggin into the mice and observed the effect on mood by testing for depression and anxiety behavior. A sign of depression in mice is a tendency to hang hopelessly when held by the tail, rather than trying to get upright. After receiving Noggin, mice energetically tried to lift themselves up, whereas control mice were more likely to give up and become immobile. The mice were then put in a maze with secluded (safe) and open (less safe) spaces. The Noggin mice were less anxious and explored more mazes than the control mice.

The most common symptoms of more than 3,000 adolescents who participated in the research were bodily discomfort, hostility and aggression. A study with 3,696 university students of 18 years old conducted by scientists at UCM and the University of Santiago de Compostela and founded by the National Drug Plan (Spain) reveals that starting drinking alcohol at an early age is associated with an increase of psychopathological symptoms, i.e. certain possibility of suffering from a psychological disorder in the future. See Also: Your adolescent brain on alcohol: Changes last into adulthood""The presence of these signs does not necessarily mean the existence of clinical disorders, but it can be interpreted as a susceptibility to suffer them"", said Luis Miguel Garc a Moreno, researcher at the Department of Psychobiology at the UCM and co-author of the study published in Psicothema. Scientists took into account nine psychopathological domains: anxiety, depression, obsession-compulsion, phobia, hostility, paranoid ideation, interpersonal sensitivity, psychoticism and somatization. The participants, which did not include any teetotaler, had to fill out anonymous questionnaires where they were asked about the frequency of alcohol consumption, age of onset and questions determining the existence of any of the nine symptoms selected. The study reveals that starting drinking between eleven and thirteen increases the risk of experiencing symptoms of discomfort compared to those whose consumption onset was at sixteen. The most common symptom recorded by those adolescents was somatization which involves experiencing feelings of bodily discomfort, especially with muscle aches, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. Other common symptoms were hostility and aggression, leading to a greater propensity to expressing ideas or violent behavior towards others or themselves. Regarding gender differences, ""women showed signs of anxiety and depression, while men showed a certain degree of psychoticism"", said Garc a Moreno. Overall, women recorded higher values of indicators which, according to the psychologist, may point out a greater vulnerability of adolescent women to alcohol effects. Learn More: Older adults with long-term alcohol dependence lose neurocognitive abilities The authors indicate that a cause-effect relationship between alcohol consumption and the symptoms found cannot be established because of the cross-sectional nature of the study. ""We can only be sure that there is a relationship and we cannot say what happens first: if the consumption produces these symptoms or if certain symptoms predispose to alcohol consumption"", recalled Garc a Moreno. At present, the research team is working on more personalized ways of preventing alcohol intake, depending on the personal characteristics of each adolescent. To do this, they are trying to figure out what drives them to alcohol binge drinking. Part of the team, along with researchers of the Center of Biomedical Technology (Madrid) and the University of Minho (Portugal), have participated in another study published this year in Scientific Reports. They have found that there are functional brain alterations in those binge drinkers who persisted drinking after a two-year follow-up period. These scientists, who proved last year how occasional binge drinking episodes alter the brain circuitry of adolescents, have gone a step further. They analyzed, by means of Magnetoencephalograh (MEG), how functional connectivity has evolved in adolescent who persisted drinking for at least two years. To this end, they evaluated thirty-nine students, 22 nonusers and 17 binge drinkers. ""In a previous study we found a different functional brain connectivity pattern in those adolescents who had a binge drinking alcohol consumption. In the recent study, we found that these differences increased over the two-year follow-up period in those participants who persisted with this consumption pattern"", summarized Garc a Moreno.

Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of Wisconsin have begun to untangle a web of connections that includes a gene; mitochondria, which produce energy for cells; insulin resistance; and how well the body s metabolism functions.  We ve identified a mechanism for insulin resistance that involves a gene that ties insulin resistance to mitochondrial function,  said Joshua Knowles, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford. A paper describing the work was published in the Oct. 4 issue of Cell Reports. Knowles is the senior author, and Indumathi Chennamsetty, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford, is the lead author. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that helps fat and muscle cells take glucose from the blood. When a person s cells stop responding to insulin, the person has insulin resistance and glucose builds up in the blood, signaling the pancreas to produce ever more insulin. Insulin resistance severe enough to damage body tissues is common. One 2015 study estimated that nearly 35 percent of all U.S. adults are sufficiently insulin-resistant to be at greater risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The environmental causes of the skyrocketing rate of insulin resistance in the United States include poor diet and sedentary habits, but the molecular mechanisms have been unknown, said Knowles. Suspect gene Previous work by Knowles and his team linked a variant of a human gene called NAT2 with insulin resistance in humans. In mice, suppressing a similar gene, called Nat1, caused metabolic dysfunction, including decreased insulin sensitivity and higher levels of blood sugar, insulin and triglycerides. The new study shows that suppressing the expression of the Nat1 gene in mice interferes with the function of mitochondria   cell structures that make ATP, the energy currency of cells. Without ATP, cells cannot live and function. In addition, mice whose Nat1 gene had been eliminated gained more weight and had larger fat cells and higher levels of biomarkers indicating inflammation than did regular mice, even though all the mice got the same amount of food and water. The mice without Nat1 also had a decreased ability to use fat for energy, said Knowles, and they were also pretty slow on the exercise wheel.  When we put mice on a treadmill and make them exercise really, really hard, the mice that lack this Nat1 gene don t have the ability to keep up with normal mice,  Knowles said.  And that supports the hypothesis that poorly functioning mitochondria are part of the problem.  Insulin resistance is a known forerunner to Type 2 diabetes. But insulin resistance by itself   characterized by the decreased uptake of sugar by muscle and fat cells   can lead to cardiovascular disease, inflammation, polycystic ovary syndrome, fatty liver disease and other health conditions, even in people who do not have Type 2 diabetes. A person who is insulin-resistant but still making plenty of insulin may not have diabetes, said Gerald Reaven, MD, professor emeritus of cardiovascular medicine and a co-author of the paper. But the person will have higher triglyceride levels; lower levels of high-density lipoproteins   the  good  cholesterol; and higher blood pressure. All of these conditions increase the risk of heart disease. Mystery of the slow-going mice Exactly why the Nat1-free mice have trouble running is something Knowles and his colleagues are still working out.  Is that physically an effect on muscle, skeletal muscle? Is that an effect on the heart? We don't know exactly yet,  he said. Upcoming work will focus on identifying a factor that links all these metabolic effects.","Published: October 5, 2016"

Researchers with University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center have identified a strategy to selectively sensitize certain cancer cells to radiation therapy that may improve tumor control and reduce treatment-related side effects. In a paper published October 4 in Nature Communications, researchers report that in mouse models tumors testing positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were sensitized to a combination of radiation therapy and an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) called ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). ADC is a new technology that chemically links an antibody to a targeted cell receptor to deliver a drug to specific cells   in this case a very potent chemotherapy to HER2 positive tumors   while sparing normal tissue.  A biomarker-driven, tumor-targeted radiosensitization approach to treating cancer is a potentially significant advancement from current chemotherapy and radiation therapy,  said Sunil J. Advani, MD, associate professor in the Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences and the paper s senior author.  Non-targeted, highly toxic chemotherapies continue to remain the most effective treatments for patients treated concurrently with chemotherapy and radiation, but these treatments have significant toxicity and we need alternatives that are molecularly guided based on mutations found in specific patients. Our approach is to use antibodies to restrict delivery of powerful drugs to cancer cells that sensitize tumors to radiation therapy.  The study shows promise in HER2 cancers, which occur in a percentage of lung, esophageal, gastric and bladder cancers.  T-DM1 is already approved for use in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer treatment. Researchers repurposed the existing drug to sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy among patients who simultaneously receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy at the beginning of the treatment process, instead of waiting until the cancer spreads or becomes resistant to treatment. Intensifying a dose of non-targeted chemotherapies increases normal tissue toxicities, often precluding further radiation therapy or chemotherapy escalation. Using targeted ADC with radiation therapy would reduce toxicity, reduce the risk of tumor resistance and attacks both known tumors as well as cancer cells that may have metastasized, while sparing normal tissue.   Our hope is that the results can transition to clinical studies quickly to help patients with advanced cancers that are difficult to treat with standard therapies,  said Stephen R. Adams, PhD, project scientist in the Department of Pharmacology and first author on the paper.","Published: October 5, 2016"

The Council, which includes academics from King's, has today published the first findings of its review looking at the potential impact of recent advances in genome editing such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system across many areas of biological research. The report found evidence that, given its technical advantages and rates of uptake, genome editing is already having an almost unprecedented impact in research. The Council considered the possible effects of these advances in fields such as health care, food production, industry and public health. Professor Karen Yeung, Director of the Centre for Technology, Law & Society at King s and a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Group, who conducted the review said:  We examined the way in which these technologies are being taken up in the research community and what we found is that, because of a number of advantages which they offer in relation to existing techniques for manipulating DNA, they are having an unprecedented transformative effect on the biological sciences and for that reason they have the potential to change our expectations and ambitions about human control over the biological world.  One of the reasons why we are undertaking this review is to encourage public deliberation. We think that the potential applications for human health are very important, but also in relation to food production where the technology is really almost ready to go and that is why we are trying to think carefully about the ethical dimensions in order to try and identify the paths of development that we think are the most ethically appropriate.  The Council will now begin work on two further inquiries addressing the ethical and practical questions raised by possible uses of genome editing in different fields. The first of these will focus on the potential use of genome editing in human reproduction to avoid the transmission of heritable genetic conditions, and the second on livestock to improve systems of animal husbandry and food production. Dr Andy Greenfield, Chair of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Group who conducted the review, said: Genome editing is already showing a potential to transform not only how biological research is carried out, but more importantly our expectations and ambitions for addressing challenges such as disease prevention and food security. Although most uses so far have been in research, the potential applications seem to be almost unlimited, given that the techniques are applicable to all organisms, from bacteria to plants, animals, and human beings.  Avoiding genetic disease Human reproductive applications are probably the most talked about potential application of genome editing technologies and raise some of the most complex ethical concerns. Genome editing could one day offer an alternative approach to preventing the inheritance of diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Concerns have been stirred by reports of research in China to correct disease-causing genetic mutations in non-viable embryos in 2015 and the granting, by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), of a licence to allow genome editing of embryos in the UK February 2016. Professor Yeung is Chair of the newly established Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on human reproductive applications and said:  Genome editing is a potentially powerful set of techniques that holds many future possibilities, including that of altering certain genetic features at the embryonic stage that are known to lead to serious and life-limiting disease. In the UK and in many other countries, a long path to legislative change would have to be followed before this could become a treatment option. But it is only right that we acknowledge where this new science may lead and explore the possible paths ahead to ensure the one on which we set out today is the right one. We will be very interested to hear people s views on this aspect of genome editing technologies in our new inquiry.  Many people have concerns about the possible use of genome editing in humans, for example, about the risks of unintended effects due to off target DNA alterations, and the implications of making irreversible changes that will be passed on to future generations. Another key concern is the possible orientation of research towards human enhancement, going beyond disease prevention into the engineering of  desirable  genetic characteristics. As with other technologies and innovations, the potential benefits and harms of genome editing might not be distributed equitably, and some people are worried that negative effects could cause discrimination, injustice or disadvantage to certain individuals or groups.","Published: October 5, 2016"

The Deisseroth Laboratory works on developing and applying high-resolution tools for controlling and mapping specific well-defined elements within intact and fully-assembled biological systems. The development and application of these and other tools (integrated with optical, electrophysiological, computational, molecular, and behavioral approaches) are used to study neural physiology and behavior in freely-moving mammals. The Laboratory is based on the Arastradero site where many of the group's newer technologies are being developed (this campus is part of the Stanford CNC program and the site of CLARITY development and training).  Their most recent work has developed a quantitative analysis of the wiring and molecular properties of neurons in the prefrontal cortex that are associated with distinct behavioural experiences that illuminates the logic of information processing in the brain. The work has been published online in Cell.1 Entitled  Wiring and Molecular Features of Prefrontal Ensembles Representing Distinct Experiences,  the paper reports on how they have developed quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype.  For light sheet imaging of whole mouse brains, the group uses the LaVision BioTec UltraMicroscope which provides high speed imaging and large fields of view. Talking about his use of the light sheet microscopy, Dr Ye says  We really like the convenience and flexibility of the microscope. It has been a true workhorse for everyday sample imaging as well as for reliable data collection at the behavior-cohort scale. It works like a benchtop scanner for brains, with which you can quickly visualize the  big picture  of a whole brain in real time, yet at the same time have the option to zoom in to explore the details easily and immediately.

These findings give us new insights into the basic biology of cancer and open opportunities for new ways to type and potentially treat a wide variety of cancers,  said senior author Stephen J Salipante, University of Washington assistant professor of laboratory medicine. Microsatellites are short stretches in our genomes made up of repetitive sequences of DNA, the molecules that code genetic instructions. These microsatellites are typically made of units composed of 2 to 5  DNA building blocks, called nucleotides, that repeat between 5 to 50 times. For example, a microsatellite might be composed of five repeats of the nucleotides thymine, designated by the letter T, and adenine, designated A, and read  TATATATATA . Because of these repetitions, the enzymes which copy DNA may accidentally add or subtract nucleotides from them. As a result, microsatellite sites often mutate relatively quickly. They grow longer and shorter over time. In some cancers, these sites become even more prone to mutations, often because of faulty DNA repair mechanisms. The result is a condition called  microsatellite instability.  Our genomes have hundreds of thousands of microsatellites, but most are in areas where mutations, if they occur, seem to have no effect on cell growth, development and function. However, microsatellite mutations that occur near or within genes or in areas of the genome that regulate gene expression can have a biological effect. A number of these appear to play a role in gastric, colorectal, and endometrial cancers. Previous research has mainly looked at relatively few microsatellites in just a handful of cancers types with the microsatellite instability condition. In the latest published study, Salipante worked with collaborators Ronald Hause and Jay Shendure, both in the UW Department of Genome Sciences, and Colin Pritchard in the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. The team used a new technique to analyze sequences of all the genes from nearly 6,000 tumors from 18 different kinds of cancer. The researchers obtained the sequencing information from a massive genome database storehouse called The Cancer Genome Atlas. Their technique and the availabily of this atlas allowed them to examine more than 200,000 microsatellite sites in many different cancer types. They found that most cancer types had examples of tumors with microsatellite instability. They also learned that different cancer types had distinct patterns of mutation across their microsatellites. Over half of the microsatellite instability sites they uncovered were within or near so-called  cancer genes    genes that that are implicated in cancer development and progression. This finding suggests the microsatellite mutations may be causing these genes to malfunction. The other half of the microsatellite instability sites were not located in or near known cancer genes, but because these mutations were frequent among the different tumor types, they could possibly play a yet undetermined role in cancer.  These sites may be pointing to new cancer genes that we haven t previously known about,  Salipante said. The researchers also observed a paradox: patients who had tumors with comparatively more unstable microsatellite sites tended to survive longer. Salipante and his colleagues hypothesize that cancers cells with relatively high numbers of microsatellite instability events are producing more mutated proteins of all kinds, not just cancer genes.  These mutated proteins draw the attention of the immune system and trigger immune attacks that slow tumor progression.  This suggests that by analyzing the entire genome of a tumor instead of just a few microsatellite sites as is done now, it will be possible to identify those patients with tumors that will most likely to respond to new cancer immunotherapies,  Salipante said.","Published: October 5, 2016"

Knowing the full potential for our immune systems to protect us from harmful pathogens brings us one huge step closer to finding cures for illnesses such as cancer, infections, autoimmune diabetes and asthma, as well as developing improved diagnostic tests and immune therapies. ""Understanding adaptive immunity is one of the grand challenges in science,"" said Yves Lussier, associate vice president for UA Health Sciences and executive director of the UA Center for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatics. ""The unique genetics and massive diversity that occur exclusively in cells of the adaptive immune system has posed a dire need for computer tools created specifically to analyze adaptive immune receptors."" Now Buntzman and his collaborators have combined the expertise of immunologists, mathematicians and computer scientists to develop these much-needed computational tools. ""If we were on a treasure hunt, where the cure to many illnesses is the buried treasure, then we've just drawn the first map of Treasure Island,"" said Buntzman, an investigator in the lab of Dr. Monica Kraft, a physician-scientist specializing in research of dysfunctional autoimmune response in asthma and chair of the UA Department of Medicine. More Complex than the Human Genome The adaptive immune system is perhaps the most mysterious   and certainly one of the most vital   systems of the human body, protecting us from everything from common cold germs to serious infections. Cells within the human adaptive immune system produce antibodies and T-cell receptors that identify and remove harmful foreign substances from the body. Unfortunately, the immune system can become a powerful enemy when it misidentifies a part of the body as pathogenic, leading to autoimmune diseases, or when it overreacts to foreign materials such as pollen, resulting in allergies such as asthma. The immune system is considered to be ""adaptive"" because it can respond to our unique environments. Once it has overcome a particular pathogen, the immune system will ""remember"" and quickly destroy that pathogen if it ever enters our bodies again, thus giving us immunity. Adaptive immune systems also vary from one person to the next, providing immunity depending upon what microbes an individual has been exposed to throughout their lifetime. ""Humans have about 25,000 genes in our genome, but there are millions of harmful microbes, which begs the question: How does such a small number of genes code for all of the immune receptors needed to recognize the enormous array of microbes that can hurt us?"" Buntzman said. It turns out that immune receptor genes do not code for immune receptors; rather, broken gene fragments combine in novel ways to produce new code. Every time a new antibody or T-cell receptor is created, the adaptive immune system ""shuffles the deck"" of gene fragments, blending together the broken pieces through a process called VDJ Recombination. ""These gene fragments are then modified by enzymes, creating a dizzying array of variation,"" Buntzman said. The possible variation of immune receptors far exceeds the number of genes in our genome, at roughly 10 million times more than the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, he noted. That's also about 100-fold the number of ants on Earth. This is the complication. ""How do we study this much diversity? How do we find which receptors cause autoimmune disorders, and which receptors protect us from influenza?"" Buntzman said. Genome sequencing instruments have addressed the problem yet remain incapable of handling the enormity of data; until now. How to Count Countless Possibilities Just as genomics involves sequencing whole genomes, the field of immunomics involves mapping sequences of immune receptors   a mathematical challenge given that the human adaptive immune system swamps the diversity of most genomics studies. Buntzman calculated that using traditional computational methods to generate a complete genetic map of the immunome   all possible receptors the immune system might generate   would take roughly 106 years. ""Waiting that long is clearly impractical,"" he said, ""but this is where CyVerse comes in."" CyVerse is a National Science Foundation-funded project to provide computational infrastructure for big-data problems in the life sciences. Buntzman began working with CyVerse collaborator Ali Akoglu of the UA College of Engineering to develop computational tools to map the immunome using high-performance computing, or HPC, techniques. With CyVerse s support and access to HPC technology, Buntzman, Akoglu and Akoglu's graduate student Gregory Striemer developed a program to run the analysis in under 17 days on a computer chip housed inside a simple laptop. ""My role was to restructure the algorithm to accelerate the results,"" Akoglu said. ""This was the first study to generate and process terabytes of data exhaustively, going through all possible combinations of sequences, and in a relatively short amount of time. And CyVerse was the catalyzer that brought us together."" Armed with the power of computation, Buntzman and his colleagues have developed a software tool capable of comprehensively mapping the adaptive immune system without limitation, and a computer program that is a community-accessible utility to database these complex immunome datasets, as described at the 2016 conference of the American Association of Immunologists and in an upcoming publication to be released in the journal BMC Bioinformatics. In addition, Buntzman's group has developed another computer program to run a novel algorithm called iWAS, or immunome-Wide Association Study, that can mine the immunome for patterns of immune receptors responsible for protecting us from specific diseases or causing autoimmune disorders. Understanding the role of individual immune receptors could pave the way to developing advanced therapies, potentially revolutionizing the field of adaptive immunity. ""This work will aid in the study of cancer, autoimmunity, transplantation and vaccination, and assist in developing new precision medical diagnostics and patient-centered immunotherapies, as well as identify biomarkers for inflammatory diseases,"" Lussier said. Collaboration was key, Buntzman added. ""By working across disciplines as immunologists, mathematicians and computer scientists,"" he said, ""we were able to tackle a problem that was untenable to any discipline alone. We've created an analytical infrastructure with CyVerse that allows for all the data to be stored and analyzed by researchers everywhere.""","Published: October 5, 2016"

When challenged with Zika virus within a week of their birth, both vaccines protected the pups against neurological damage better than pups with no maternal-conferred immunity. The results are published online today and scheduled for the November issue of EBioMedicine.  We ve not only developed a promising vaccine candidate to move toward larger preclinical and, eventually, human clinical trials, but also a delivery format that would be inexpensive to produce and distribute to hundreds of thousands of people,  said senior author Andrea Gambotto, M.D., associate professor of surgery in Pitt s School of Medicine.  Zika is a virus spread primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito of the Aedes species. When pregnant women are infected, the virus can pass to their fetus, which can damage the developing baby and cause severe neurological birth defects, including microcephaly, or an abnormally small head.  One of the two vaccines uses a  microneedle array  to deliver the vaccine just below the surface of the skin through tiny crystals that dissolve after being affixed to the skin by a Band-Aid-like patch. The technology was co-invented by Louis D. Falo, M.D., Ph.D., chair of Pitt s Department of Dermatology and co-author of the study.  The other vaccine uses the traditional needle delivery format and adenovirus, a type of common cold virus, to present Zika antigens to the immune system to induce immunity.  Both vaccines used proteins on the  envelope,  or outer shell, of the virus as the antigen to prime the immune system so it can quickly recognize and fight off the actual virus. This approach has worked in the past to develop West Nile, yellow fever and dengue vaccines.  Three groups of female mice, with five mice per group, were immunized with either one of the two vaccines or a saline solution with no vaccine for the control group. Two weeks after the initial vaccination, the mice received a booster of the same vaccine they originally received.   Blood tests were performed at vaccination and every two weeks afterward. The mice showed immunity against Zika two weeks after immunization with the adenovirus Zika vaccine and six weeks after immunization with the microneedle array Zika vaccine.  Five weeks after initial immunization, the female mice were mated with unvaccinated males. Because mice do not develop microcephaly, giving the mothers Zika while pregnant would be unlikely to affect the pups. So the researchers waited until one week after the pups were born and then exposed them to Zika. All of the pups from the mothers immunized with adenovirus Zika vaccine and half of the pups from the mothers who received the microneedle array vaccine survived infection. Only 12.5 percent of the pups from mothers in the unimmunized control group survived. Furthermore, all of the control group pups showed signs of neurological damage, including loss of balance, muscle weakness and hind-limb paralysis. Five out of six of the microneedle array group pups also exhibited neurological issues, though they weren t as severe as the control group s symptoms. None of the adenovirus vaccine pups showed significant neurological problems.  Although the adenovirus Zika vaccine definitely performed better in this study, Dr. Gambotto said it was used as a proof-of-principle vaccine in mice to quickly develop and test if the envelope protein antigen would work in a mouse model. It wouldn t work well in humans because the vast majority of us have already had adenovirus colds so our immune systems would simply neutralize the vaccine and not develop proper Zika antibodies.   We decided to move forward with the microneedle array Zika vaccine and have since developed a promising, second-generation vaccine,  said Dr. Gambotto.  We are hopeful, now that Congress has approved the $1.1 billion bill to provide funding for Zika prevention and research, that we ll be able to do larger-scale studies to evaluate and develop this vaccine for possible human clinical trials in the future.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in August has awarded a five-year, $1.3 million grant to start working on the forecasts. The new early warning system will transition to operation starting in 2017. Once up and running, the forecasts will help coastal communities from Neah Bay, Washington, to Newport, Oregon, target their shellfish monitoring and fine-tune decisions about closing beaches to shellfish harvesting to have more advance warning and potentially avoid some beach closures.  This will be a sort of weather forecast for Pacific Northwest harmful algal blooms,  said Parker MacCready, a UW professor of oceanography and member of the UW Coastal Modeling Group. Forecasts will be produced by the UW s LiveOcean model, which creates three-day forecasts for Washington and Oregon coastal waters. The model provides results for open-ocean beaches as well as complex protected waterways   including Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor   that are home to many of the region s shellfish beds. Up-to-date monitoring of offshore conditions will be provided by Vera Trainer, a biologist at NOAA s Northwest Fisheries Science Center, and members of the Makah Tribe. Starting this spring, they will collect samples by ship every two weeks in an eddy near the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which has been identified as a source of toxin-producing algae that can reach local beaches. The team will then analyze water samples within a day at the Makah Tribal lab in Neah Bay. The new collaboration  will bring the most powerful technologies for cell and toxin detection to our partners who are directly impacted by these blooms,  Trainer said.  This will help the tribe and all coastal managers make rapid, informed decisions about seafood safety.  At the UW, MacCready will work with oceanographers Ryan McCabe, at the UW s Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean, and Barbara Hickey, in the School of Oceanography, to combine their LiveOcean model with those water sample results and other information, including beachside monitoring by the Washington Olympic Region Harmful Algal Blooms program and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and real-time data from a NOAA offshore robot, the Environmental Sample Processor, launched in May by the UW and NOAA. The team will use the LiveOcean model to produce a forecast mapping toxicity risk leading up to each scheduled razor clam dig, in the form of a bulletin for coastal resource managers.  This really is the culmination of more than a decade of basic research on the physics and biology behind these toxic blooms,  said project co-lead Neil Banas, a former UW scientist now based at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. A previous version of the HAB Bulletin was produced by Hickey and Trainer from 2008 to 2011 with funding from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new project is funded by NOAA s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, through its Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal Blooms research program.

This University of Rochester Medical Center discovery could provide a new strategy for live influenza vaccines in the future. A new approach to the live flu vaccine would be particularly advantageous right now after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped recommending use of the live attenuate flu vaccine, FluMist  earlier this year.  Several studies found that the pain-free nasal spray, which was used in about one-third of young children in the U.S., offered no protection to that especially vulnerable population. The flu shot, on the other hand, performed well and the CDC recommends using this vaccine in place of FluMist .  There is a need to understand what's happening with the existing live vaccine and potentially a need to develop a new one,  said David Topham, Ph.D., Marie Curran Wilson and Joseph Chamberlain Wilson Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at URMC and author of the study.  We proposed that the mutation we found could be used to create a live vaccine.  The mutation weakens the flu virus by making the flu-encoded protein, called Non-Structural 1 (NS1), defunct. Flu virus needs NS1 to prevent interferon, the immune system s front line against viruses, from alerting the host cell that it has been infected. Inhibiting interferon affords the virus time to multiply and spread before the immune system can mount an attack.   Most people have healthy interferon responses and would quickly and easily fend off this weakened mutant strain of flu, but,  this virus somehow managed to find the one person that had an interferon defect that allowed it to replicate,  said Topham.   The probability of this virus surviving and infecting a human is so low - it is as if Topham and lead study author, Marta Lopez de Diego, Ph.D., research assistant professor of Microbiology and Immunology, found a needle in a haystack. The pair isolated the mutated virus from a nasal swab of a single flu sufferer who happened to be among the small percentage of people with inadequate interferon responses.  When they looked for the NS1 mutation in a national database, it showed up in just 0.03 percent of all flu strains reported. This naturally-occurring  attenuating  flu mutation could provide a new way to make live flu vaccines, which contain viruses that are alive, but  attenuated , or weakened, so the vaccine itself does not cause illness in humans. Topham and Lopez de Diego suspect their NS1 mutation could be a great way to prevent viruses in the live vaccine from infecting anyone who has normal interferon responses, which is most people. The study, published online in the Journal of Virology, also highlights the importance of flu virus surveillance   conducting studies like Topham s to see how the flu is changing, what flu mutations are circulating in humans and animals, and how those mutations affect virus function. Topham believes health leaders are not doing enough of that research.  The influenza field is largely fixated on studying pandemic or potential pandemic viruses, but those viruses only infect a few dozen people every year whereas seasonal flu infects millions - and yet we don't study human influenzas closely enough.  Until recently, researchers believed that proteins like NS1 did not change much from strain to strain and season to season, but Topham s study and others show that NS1 mutations occur naturally and can affect its ability to suppress immunity. Monitoring for these mutations in nature could help us produce better vaccines that save more lives. ","Published: October 5, 2016"

The virus spreads mostly through bites from infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact or from mother to child during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Most Zika infections cause no symptoms or a mild illness lasting about a week. Zika infection during pregnancy can affect the fetus and lead to serious birth defects, especially those involving the developing brain. The virus also is associated with neurological diseases such as Guillain-Barr  syndrome in infected adults. Currently, there are no vaccines or effective treatments. NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is supporting the research and development of multiple Zika vaccine candidates. Scientists from NIAID s Vaccine Research Center developed 2 experimental DNA vaccines against Zika virus. The team, led by Drs. Theodore C. Pierson and Barney S. Graham, engineered circular pieces of DNA to contain genes that code for viral proteins. When the vaccine is injected into muscle, cells read the genes and make Zika proteins, which self-assemble into virus-like particles. The body then mounts an immune response to these particles. DNA vaccines have been shown to be safe in previous clinical trials for other diseases. They don t contain infectious material, so they can t cause Zika infection. Both experimental vaccines, called VRC5283 and VRC5288, were engineered to prompt cells to produce the Zika virus structural proteins premembrane (prM) and envelope (E). Both vaccines included portions of an unrelated virus to improve protein expression. VRC5288 also included another portion of an unrelated virus to improve secretion of virus particles from cells. Results appeared online on September 22, 2016, in Science. The researchers vaccinated groups of rhesus macaques using the 2 different Zika DNA vaccines in different doses. Most animals received 2 vaccinations. Eight weeks after the first immunization, the monkeys were exposed to Zika virus. Both vaccines were highly effective when given in 2 doses. All but 1 of the 18 animals that received 2 doses of vaccine (94%) had no detectable virus in their blood. Researchers plan to evaluate both experimental vaccines in people to test a variety of regimens and doses for safety and immune responses. VRC5288 is now being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial in volunteers in Maryland and Georgia. If the results are favorable, NIAID plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in Zika-endemic countries in early 2017. The second vaccine (VRC5283) is awaiting a start date for a Phase 1 clinical trial. These studies and others will inform the next steps of Zika vaccine development. The results will guide efforts toward both the short-term goal of identifying an intervention to protect women of child-bearing age in the current outbreak, and the long-term goal of vaccinating the general population of endemic regions and travelers to those regions.","Published: October 5, 2016"

The venom includes insulin, which acts within minutes to immobilize nearby fish by inducing hypoglycemic shock a sedation-like state caused by extremely low blood sugar. Scientists have been intrigued by how rapidly this insulin works compared to human insulin. In people, when blood glucose levels rise, such as after a meal, insulin is released from the pancreas into the blood stream. It binds to insulin receptors on tissues to trigger them to take in glucose from the blood. Diabetes occurs when this process doesn t work correctly. In type 2 diabetes, the most common form, tissues in the body lose their sensitivity to insulin, and pancreatic cells can t make enough insulin to keep glucose levels in check. In type 1 diabetes, the body s own immune system attacks and destroys pancreatic cells. Many people rely on injections of synthetic insulin to manage their diabetes, and the timing can be crucial. Human insulin is stored in the pancreas as a cluster of 6 insulin molecules bound together. To work, the human insulin molecules have to first separate into 6 individual units, a time-consuming process. In contrast, the cone snail has the smallest known insulin found in nature and works rapidly.  An international research team led by Drs. Helena Safavi of the University of Utah and Michael Lawrence of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia set out to characterize cone snail insulin to gain insights into therapeutic insulin design. The research was supported in part by NIH s National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). Results were published online on September 12, 2016, in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. Each insulin molecule consists of an A and a B chain. Cone snail insulin lacks a segment of the B chain. In human insulin, this region functions to help the hormone assemble in a cluster for storage and to interact with the insulin receptor. The researchers synthesized and purified snail insulin. They found that despite its smaller structure, the snail insulin could bind the human insulin receptor and turn on the receptor to activate signaling.  To determine how the shorter snail insulin could bind, the team assessed its 3-D structure by using X-ray crystallography. They created a model of snail insulin bound to the human insulin receptor and compared the binding to that of human insulin.  We found that cone snail venom insulins work faster than human insulins by avoiding the structural changes that human insulins undergo in order to function they are essentially primed and ready to bind to their receptors,  Lawrence says.   You can get new ideas from venoms,  Safavi says.  To have something that has already been evolved   that s a huge advantage. ","Published: October 5, 2016"

The work is featured in the advance online publication of Nature Materials. Such neuromorphic computing in which microprocessors are configured more like human brains is one of the most promising transformative computing technologies currently under study. J. Joshua Yang and Qiangfei Xia are professors in the electrical and computer engineering department in the UMass Amherst College of Engineering. Yang describes the research as part of collaborative work on a new type of memristive device.   Memristive devices are electrical resistance switches that can alter their resistance based on the history of applied voltage and current. These devices can store and process information and offer several key performance characteristics that exceed conventional integrated circuit technology.  Memristors have become a leading candidate to enable neuromorphic computing by reproducing the functions in biological synapses and neurons in a neural network system, while providing advantages in energy and size,  the researchers say. Neuromorphic computing meaning microprocessors configured more like human brains than like traditional computer chips is one of the most promising transformative computing technologies currently under intensive study. Xia says,  This work opens a new avenue of neuromorphic computing hardware based on memristors.  They say that most previous work in this field with memristors has not implemented diffusive dynamics without using large standard technology found in integrated circuits commonly used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static random access memory and other digital logic circuits. The researchers say they proposed and demonstrated a bio-inspired solution to the diffusive dynamics that is fundamentally different from the standard technology for integrated circuits while sharing great similarities with synapses. They say,  Specifically, we developed a diffusive-type memristor where diffusion of atoms offers a similar dynamics and the needed time-scales as its bio-counterpart, leading to a more faithful emulation of actual synapses, i.e., a true synaptic emulator.  The researchers say,  The results here provide an encouraging pathway toward synaptic emulation using diffusive memristors for neuromorphic computing. ","Published: October 5, 2016"

The marking extends the scope of breath testing in early stage diagnostics and therapy response to include children and in particular, the difficult to manage group of child asthma patients. Both the adult and pediatric versions of the breathalyzer are now being used in EMBER (East Midlands Breathomics Pathology Node), a  2.5 million project, funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The primary aim of EMBER is to develop breath-based systems for molecular pathology of disease and clinically validate breathomics as a new diagnostic modality. Currently one in 11 children in the UK has asthma and it is the most common long-term medical condition. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath have been shown to correlate to inflammatory subtype in asthma, which helps guide better treatment decisions. Owlstone Medical uses the Respiration Collector for In Vitro Analysis (ReCIVA), in combination with the Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer (FAIMS) sensor platform, to accurately and selectively detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath. In February, the company won an NHS contract for STRATA (Stratification of Asthma Treatment by Breath Analysis) to adapt its disease breathalyzer technology for precision medicine and companion diagnostics in asthma. The paediatric version of ReCIVA is suitable from ages 5 and up and has been developed as breath sampling offers a completely non-invasive way to test children. EMBER was established by the MRC and EPSRC as an academia/industry consortium to develop breath-based systems for molecular pathology. EMBER draws upon expertise in clinical research, analytical chemistry, data management and mathematical modelling of complex data across the East Midlands to develop rapid, near patient non-invasive approaches to diagnosis, phenotyping and stratification. Billy Boyle, co-founder and CEO at Owlstone Medical commented:  Managing the diagnosis and treatment of children presenting with asthma and severe breathing difficulties is often problematic. Breath analysis presents a significant opportunity to better predict how a child will respond to certain treatments, including steroids and expensive biologics. In developing a paediatric breath sampler we are expanding the scope of projects such as EMBER to include children as an important group in the study of asthma, and more generally extending other biomarker and discovery studies using breath.  Professor Chris Brightling, EMBER and Leicester NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit Director, Professor in Respiratory Medicine at University of Leicester, Precision Medicine Institute added:  Choosing the right treatment for the right patient is especially challenging in children as obtaining samples such as blood to measure disease activity can be difficult. Breath analysis offers an excellent opportunity to sample the airway by simply breathing into a mask. This presents a new approach to understand disease and make better treatment decisions .","Published: October 5, 2016"

The study from the Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute also showed, however, that the protein s absence in other parts of the body hinders brain function as blood cholesterol levels rise. This result substantiates previous research that indicated cardiovascular health affects the brain. Researchers focused on the removal of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which in a certain form can support the buildup of toxic plaques in the brains of Alzheimer s patients. Studies elsewhere have sought to determine whether reducing ApoE could be an effective treatment in preventing the disease, but a lingering question has been whether the protein is necessary for healthy brain function. The study found that mice can maintain their learning and memory when virtually all ApoE is removed from the brain but kept present in the liver to filter cholesterol. Mice that lacked ApoE in both the brain and liver experienced unhealthy cholesterol levels and lost cognitive function. More research is needed to determine what causes the cardiovascular issues to affect the brain, said Dr. Joachim Herz, the study s Principal Investigator and Professor of Molecular Genetics, Neuroscience, Neurology and Neurotherapeutics at the O Donnell Brain Institute at UT Southwestern Medical Center. But the findings, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, add support to the belief that reducing ApoE in the brain could eventually be a viable therapeutic option for treating Alzheimer s.  This approach still holds potential,  said Dr. Herz, holder of the Thomas O. and Cinda Hicks Family Distinguished Chair in Alzheimer's Disease Research and Director of the Center for Translational Neurodegeneration Research. ApoE has several roles in the body, including transporting cholesterol and related molecules such as b-amyloid that form plaques in the brains of Alzheimer s patients if not properly filtered or removed. The type of ApoE produced by the ApoE gene determines how effectively the amyloid is removed from the brain. ApoE2 is the most effective, ApoE3 is in the middle and ApoE4 is the most likely to allow for the buildup of amyloid plaques. People whose genes produce ApoE4 are at high risk of developing Alzheimer s. Studies are ongoing at UT Southwestern and elsewhere to further understand the various effects that ApoE4 removal has on brain and body function. The latest study was performed by Courtney Lane-Donovan, a Medical Science Training Program student in her final clinical year with her colleagues and co-authors Wen Mai Wong, Dr. Murat S. Durakoglugil, Dr. Catherine R. Wasser, Dr. Shan Jiang, and Dr. Xunde Xian in the Department of Molecular Genetics and the Center for Translational Neurodegeneration Research.

If adults remain awake for longer than usual, the brain responds with an increased need for deep sleep. This is measured in the form of ""slow wave activity"" using electroencephalography (EEG). In adults, these deep-sleep waves are most pronounced in the prefrontal cortex the brain region which plans and controls actions, solves problems and is involved in the working memory. See Also: Lead exposure impacts children s sleep For the first time, researchers from University of Zurich (UZH) have now demonstrated that curtailed sleep in children also results in locally increased deep sleep. ""However, a child's brain reacts differently to acute sleep deprivation than an adult's,"" stresses Salome Kurth from the Pulmonary Clinic at University Hospital Zurich. ""The deep-sleep effect doesn't appear in the front regions of the brain like in adults, but rather in the back in the parietal and occipital lobes."" The team of researchers also discovered that the heightened need for sleep measured as an increase in deep sleep in children is associated with the myelin content in certain nerve fiber bundles: the optic radiation. This brain region is part of the visual system responsible for spatial perception and processing multi-sensorial input. The level of myelin (the fatty sheath around the nerve fibers, which accelerates the transfer of electrical signals) is a yardstick for brain maturity and increases in the course of childhood and adolescence. The new results now reveal that the higher the myelin content in a brain region, the more similar the deep-sleep effect is to adults. Don't Miss: Twitter data may help shed light on sleep disordersIn order to study the effects of sleep deprivation in children a collaboration was launched with the University of Colorado, Boulder. The sleep researchers measured the brain activity in 13 healthy five to 12-year-olds as they slept. The EEG measurements with a total of 128 electrodes were conducted twice overnight at home with the families. On the first occasion, the children went to bed at their normal bedtime; the second time, they stayed awake until late and thus received exactly half the normal amount of sleep. The scientists also determined the myelin content in the brain with the aid of a recently developed, non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging technique. Read Next: No rest for the bleary: Study investigates the effects of interrupted sleep ""Our results show that the deep-sleep effect occurs specifically in a particular region of the brain and is linked to the myelin content,"" sums up Kurth. According to the researcher, this effect might only be temporary, i.e. only occur during sensitive developmental phases in childhood or adolescence. The scientists assume that the quality of sleep is jointly responsible for the neuronal connections to develop optimally during childhood and adolescence. Consequently, it is important for a child to sleep sufficiently during this life phase. According to international guidelines, the recommended amount of sleep for children aged 6 to 13 is 9 to 11 hours per night. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

He's had two concussions as the result of bicycling accidents. While he doesn't doubt that wearing a helmet is better than no helmet at all, Camarillo thinks that traditional helmets don't protect riders as well as they could. See Also: Football helmet tests may not account for concussion-prone actions ""Foam bike helmets can and have been proven to reduce the likelihood of skull fracture and other, more severe brain injury,"" said Camarillo, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford. ""But, I think many falsely believe that a bike helmet is there to protect against a concussion. That's not true."" Knowing what he does about traditional bike helmets, Camarillo, whose lab works on understanding and preventing concussion, decided to test a new type of helmet that is starting to be available in some European countries. The results are published in the Annals of Biomedical Engineering. The helmet Camarillo tested comes in a soft pocket worn around the neck. It pops up, like an air bag, around a person's head when it senses a potential collision. It was originally designed to address the fact that people don't like to wear helmets for aesthetic reasons. The researchers compared this air bag helmet directly to traditional foam bike helmets. Their results were striking. ""We conducted drop tests, which are typical federal tests to assess bicycle helmets, and we found that air bag helmets, with the right initial pressure, can reduce head accelerations five to six times compared to a traditional bicycle helmet,"" said Mehmet Kurt, a postdoctoral scholar in the Camarillo Lab. Related: U.S. may be greatly undercounting pediatric concussionsThe drop test consisted of putting the helmets on a dummy head containing accelerometers and dropping it, neck-side up, from various heights onto a metal platform. The head form was tilted at two different angles, simulating hits to the crown and the side of the head. Researchers dropped the helmets from as low as 0.8 meters (2.6') to as high as two meters and measured the linear acceleration of the helmet as it struck the ground. Camarillo said that the large size of the air bag helmet compared to foam bike helmets is the likely source of its success. Being larger, it can also be softer, allowing for a more cushioned fall. However, this cushioning also has a potential downside. In the testing, the air bag helmet was pre-inflated and the researchers maximized the pressure of the air inside the helmet before each drop in order to get these results. ""As our paper suggests, although air bag helmets have the potential to reduce the acceleration levels that you experience during a bicycle accident, it also suggests that the initial pressure that your air bag helmet has is very critical in reducing these acceleration levels,"" Kurt said. Without the maximum amount of air, the air bag helmet could bottom out, causing the head to hit the ground with much more force than if it were wearing a traditional foam helmet. In current versions of the air bag helmet, a chemical process triggers expansion, which doesn't seem to guarantee maximum air pressure. In this study the researchers measured linear acceleration of a head upon impact, which can tell us about risk of skull fracture and head injury. It does not directly relate to risk for concussion. Concussion is a rapidly evolving area of research but experts currently think that concussion may be related to angular stretching of the brain, which is more likely caused by a twisting motion rather than linear motion. ""There are many theories as to why concussion happens, but the predominant one is that, as your head rotates very quickly, the soft tissue within your brain contorts and, essentially, what you get is a stretching of the axons, which are the wiring of the brain,"" Camarillo said. Learn More: High school football helmets offer similar protections despite different prices The drop test used in this study is currently the standard test for bicycle helmets. Although testing the abilities of the helmets to reduce rotational forces would better tell us how they could protect against concussion, Camarillo said that, given the large advantage of the air bag helmet in this research, there is a good chance it would reduce the likelihood of concussion compared to a foam helmet. The air bag helmet is not available in the United States but is sold in some European countries. It's a relatively new innovation and, by comparison, helmet standards and testing are very far behind. ""If our research and that of others begins to provide more and more evidence that this air bag approach might be significantly more effective, there will be some major challenges in the U.S. to legally have a device available to the public,"" Camarillo said. Even for conventional foam helmets, the standard testing doesn't address some elements that science indicates matter when it comes to brain injury and head trauma, including assessment of rotational forces and drop tests of parts of the helmet other than the crown. The air bag helmet would raise additional testing issues, including the fact that helmets are generally tested on a head dummy without a neck, which couldn't wear the air bag helmet. Next steps for the air bag helmet include testing how it affects rotational accelerations and forces on the head during impact and how the helmet could reduce tissue-level strains in the brain. The researchers also want to more closely investigate the bottoming out weakness of this helmet type, dropping it from greater heights and seeing how this air cushioning holds up.

This brain hacking ""transcranial direct current stimulation"" (tDCS) is used to treat neurological and psychiatric symptoms. A do-it-yourself community has sprouted on Reddit, providing unconventional tips for how to use a weak electric current to treat everything from depression to schizophrenia. People are even using commercial tDCS equipment to improve their gaming ability. But tDCS is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and scientists are split on its efficacy, with some calling it quackery and bad science. See Also: Neurostimulation: What is being said in the media and academic literature? Here's the issue: Until now, scientists have been unable to look under the hood of this do-it-yourself therapeutic technique to understand what is happening. Danny Wang, a professor of neurology at the University of Southern California (USC) Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, said his team is the first to develop an MRI method whereby the magnetic fields induced by tDCS currents can be visualized in living humans. Their results are published in Scientific Reports. ""Although this therapy is taking off at the grassroots level and in academia [with an exponential increase in publications], evidence that tDCS does what is being promised is not conclusive,"" said Wang, the study's senior author. ""Scientists don't yet understand the mechanisms at work, which prevents the FDA from regulating the therapy. Our study is the first step to experimentally map the tDCS currents in the brain and to provide solid data so researchers can develop science-based treatment."" People in antiquity used electric fish to zap away headaches, but tDCS, as it is now known, was introduced in 2000, said Mayank Jog, study lead author and a graduate student conducting research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. ""Since then, this noninvasive, easy-to-use, low-cost technology has been shown to improve cognition as well as treat clinical symptoms,"" Jog said. Learn More: Changing the Way We Think: Daydreaming and tDCS The study is a technological breakthrough, said Maron Bikson, study co-author and a professor of biomedical engineering at The City College of New York. ""You cannot characterize what you cannot see, so this is a pivotal step in the development of tDCS technology,"" Bikson said. The science on tDCS is inconclusive. The brain-hacking technique has been shown to improve symptoms in a wide swath of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression, drug cravings and stroke. Scientists also have pointed to how it enhances learning, affects working memory and imparts other cognitive benefits among healthy people. However, some people say tDCS is ineffective and even harmful. In rare cases, the technique causes burns where the electrodes were applied. Researchers have mapped the human brain and demonstrated that putting a positive current (anode) in one area and a negative current (cathode) in another will foster an environment that prompts nearby neurons either to fire more rapidly or slowly, respectively. Theoretically, putting an anode on the right prefrontal (right side of the forehead) and parietal lobe (above the eyes and behind the right ear) influences the executive network and could enhance attention and motor ability, Wang said. Stroke patients could apply an anode in the damaged hemisphere and a cathode in the good hemisphere. This rehabilitative technique may suppress the healthy part of the brain from overcompensating and pushes the damaged area to try to become fit again. ""This technique is very cheap,"" Jog said. ""You can do it at home. Most studies show people only need two weeks to show improvements, and the effects can last beyond the treatment period. So the technique fosters hope, but researchers need to get a better grasp on what is happening."" Don't Miss: Popular electric brain stimulation method detrimental to IQ scoresThere has been some debate about whether the 1-2 milliamp (mA) zap that creates a tingling sensation in most people actually travels to the brain. A New York University researcher tested tDCS on a cadaver and said no current reached the brain. He insisted that at least 4 mA roughly equivalent to the discharge of a stun gun is needed to stimulate neurons to fire. Wang, however, said tDCS does not cause neurons to fire. It creates an environment that makes it more or less likely for neurons to fire. The researchers validated their MRI algorithm with a phantom, where the current path and induced magnetic field was known. Then they tested the method using simple biological tissue: a human calf. Finally, they repeated the process on the scalp of 12 healthy volunteers. After 20 to 30 minutes in a scanner, the new algorithm produced an image of the magnetic field tDCS created. Researchers noted that a current did enter the body and brain. Next, scientists compared the technique with that of a computer simulation. The phantom test highly matched the computational modeling, thus verifying the algorithm. The calf test was a moderate match. The brain test showed expected magnetic field changes under and between the electrodes. However, computational modeling was not performed on the brain test because there are too many variables, strengthening the argument that using computational modeling is not ideal for understanding what really happens inside people's heads when tDCS is applied, Wang said. Another tDCS measurement technique in use today is fMRI, which looks at the change in blood-oxygen levels to infer which areas the current passes through. This measurement is not directly related to the electric current and could introduce false positives. So rather than playing a game of telephone, it is best to go to the primary source. Read Next: Researchers demonstrates the potential to enhance the human intellect's existing capacity to learn new skills ""Scientists who have comprehensively studied the tDCS literature are in broad agreement that tDCS can change brain function, but that application in central health and neuro-enhancement will benefit from a deeper understanding of mechanism and enhanced technology,"" Bikson said.

Although axons elsewhere in the body can regenerate to some extent after such damage, those in nerves are far less capable, resulting in long-lasting or permanent impairment. See Also: New way to enhance nerve growth following injury discovered Treating such injuries requires clarification of how certain nerves are induced to regenerate and which molecular pathways are involved. By studying nerve regeneration in roundworms, Nagoya University researchers have discovered another signaling pathway that induces nerves to regenerate. The team also showed that this pathway is the same as the one that leads to identification and subsequent clearance of dying cells. Neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals conveyed through dendrites and axons. This connectivity within the nerve is a source of the multiple functions of this organ, but damage to these connections due to trauma can cause functional impairment. Nerve regeneration after nerve injury is therefore an issue of special interest, but is difficult to study in humans. A non-parasitic, free-living roundworm nematode is a useful model for studying this issue as it avoids the ethical problems associated with human experimentation and its short generation time and simple development facilitate genetic engineering experiments. To shed light on how damaged nerves are induced to regenerate, the researchers investigated various strains of this worm in which different genes were mutated or inactivated. They subjected the worms to a range of experiments, including labeling nerves with a fluorescent marker, cutting the nerves with a laser, and then monitoring their regrowth under a microscope. They also examined the worms' resistance with different genetic backgrounds to heavy metal stress, based on earlier findings that similar genes may be involved in both resistance to heavy metal exposure and nerve regeneration. When certain proteins encoded by these genes were absent or dysfunctional in the worms, their nerves were less able to regenerate, particularly during adulthood. They were also less able to endure exposure to a toxic level of copper. Learn More: New discovery gives hope that nerves could be repaired after spinal cord injury By comparing these results among the strains in which single or multiple genes had been inactivated, the researchers established a complex molecular pathway that allows nerves to regenerate.

""Many of the molecules and mechanisms we identified in worms have equivalents in humans,"" corresponding author Naoki Hisamoto says.

From the biochemistry behind the first cells, evolution has constructed wonders like hard bone, rough bark and plant enzymes that harvest light to make food. But our tools for manipulating life to treat disease, repair damaged tissue and replace lost limbs come from the nonliving realm: metals, plastics and the like.

In a paper published in Scientific Reports, engineers at the University of Washington unveiled peptides small proteins which carry out countless essential tasks in our cells that can provide just such a link. The team, led by Unversity of Washington (UW) professor Mehmet Sarikaya in the Departments of Materials Science & Engineering, shows how a genetically engineered peptide can assemble into nanowires atop 2-D, solid surfaces that are just a single layer of atoms thick. These nanowire assemblages are critical because the peptides relay information across the bio/nano interface through molecular recognition the same principles that underlie biochemical interactions such as an antibody binding to its specific antigen or protein binding to DNA. Since this communication is two-way, with peptides understanding the ""language"" of technology and vice versa, their approach essentially enables a coherent bioelectronic interface.

Learn more: Brain-machine interface triggers recovery for paraplegic patientsHis team in the UW Genetically Engineered Materials Science and Engineering Center studies how to coopt the chemistry of life to synthesize materials with technologically significant physical, electronic and photonic properties. To Sarikaya, the biochemical ""language"" of life is a logical emulation. ""Nature must constantly make materials to do many of the same tasks we seek,"" he said. The UW team wants to find genetically engineered peptides with specific chemical and structural properties. They sought out a peptide that could interact with materials such as gold, titanium and even a mineral in bone and teeth. These could all form the basis of future biomedical and electro-optical devices. Their ideal peptide should also change the physical properties of synthetic materials and respond to that change. That way, it would transmit ""information"" from the synthetic material to other biomolecules bridging the chemical divide between biology and technology. In exploring the properties of 80 genetically selected peptides which are not found in nature but have the same chemical components of all proteins they discovered that one, GrBP5, showed promising interactions with the semimetal graphene. They then tested GrBP5's interactions with several 2-D nanomaterials which, Sarikaya said, ""could serve as the metals or semiconductors of the future."" ""We needed to know the specific molecular interactions between this peptide and these inorganic solid surfaces,"" he added. Their experiments revealed that GrBP5 spontaneously organized into ordered nanowire patterns on graphene. With a few mutations, GrBP5 also altered the electrical conductivity of a graphene-based device, the first step toward transmitting electrical information from graphene to cells via peptides.

They also computationally predicted how different arrangements of GrBP5 nanowires would affect the electrical conduction or optical signal of each material, showing additional potential within GrBP5's physical properties. ""In a way, we're at the flood gates,"" said Sarikaya.

The two companies have partnered to deliver technical advancements in ChIP-Seq workflow, a foundation application for epigenetics. Samples used in the ChIP-Seq workflow are often challenging samples due to their limited amounts. Swift Biosciences has developed novel technologies that enable the use of very low input samples and when combined with Active Motif s industry leading ChIP based technologies, the combination provides better sensitivity in detecting key protein-DNA interactions. The resulting combination of technologies is allowing researchers to use 10x to 100x less sample, using as little as 10pg of ChIP enriched samples. This approach enables powerful techniques such as ChIP-Seq to now be used by disease researchers working with rare cell populations and extremely limited sample materials.  This is an important strategic partnership,  said Joseph Fernandez, CEO of Active Motif.  ChIP-Seq is a technically challenging application where a major hurdle for researchers is generating good quality libraries from small amounts of starting material and the Swift Biosciences  technologies overcome many of these hurdles. By implementing these technologies into our R&D efforts, we have generated many impactful advancements in our low cell ChIP programs and are now close to launching new, low cell ChIP-kits that will outperform anything else on the market.   We are honored to partner with one of the key thought leaders and major players in the ChIP-Seq market,  stated Timothy Harkins, Ph.D., President and CEO of Swift Biosciences.  Epigenetics is one of the more challenging genetic fields and had seemed to hit a plateau due to the limitations of sample inputs. One key technical advancement we are introducing with Active Motif is our molecular indices to enable the unique barcoding of every DNA molecule within a sample, providing better signal detection while utilizing more of their data. By working together to combine the best of our respective technologies, we are providing real advancements that the broader community will be able to take as they continue to push how proteins and DNA interact.

They are a rare but important cause of dementia and it is increasingly recognised that the fundamental process involved in these diseases   prion proteins changing shape and sticking together to form fibres or polymers that damage the brain   is also what happens in the much more common dementias such as Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.  CJD is a degenerative neurological disease that is currently incurable. Variant CJD (vCJD) was identified in 1996 and is linked to the consumption of meat infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). There are also inherited forms of human prion disease linked to mutations of a prion protein gene and cases caused by infection via medical or surgical treatments (iatrogenic CJD). Sporadic CJD is the most common form of the disease and represents about 85% of all CJD cases. In the UK the lifetime risk for sCJD is around 1 in 5000 the cause of which remains unclear.   Currently, the only ways to determine in life whether or not a patient has sCJD are complex and may include MRI scans, brain biopsy and sampling of cerebrospinal fluid. These procedures are usually only performed when there is already a high likelihood that a patient has the disease, and sadly, the patient may have just weeks to live by the time the diagnosis is confirmed.  In all forms of CJD, abnormal infectious prion proteins accumulate through a mechanism of  misfolding . While previous work has shown that the abnormal proteins can be detected in the blood of patients with vCJD, the process was unable, until now, to detect them in patients with the sporadic form of the disease.  In this study, published in the journal JAMA Neurology, the researchers used a modification of a test developed for blood samples to test the urine of patients known to have CJD. They analysed anonymised samples from 162 people - 91  controls  (patients known not to have the disease), 34 patients with non-prion neurodegenerative disease, and 37 patients with prion disease, 20 of whom had sCJD. The results showed a very high specificity for the prion target, and correctly identified 40% of sCJD cases.  The researchers hope to be able to increase the performance of the test by isolating the molecule or molecules in urine that are present in patients with sCJD.  Dr Graham Jackson from the MRC Prion Unit and lead author of the study, said:  Although there is currently no cure for this disease, an accurate and early diagnosis is extremely important for patients and their families. In the future, as trials of potential therapies become available, the earlier a patient can be diagnosed the more effective any treatment is likely to be.  This test could be a critical step forward in being able to identify disease sufferers early using a simple test, perhaps at the first signs of being unwell or even as part of routine screening. By studying the nature of these disease-specific forms of the prion protein we hope to be able to improve the reliability and speed of the test to a point where it could one day be routinely used by clinicians including GPs to detect all forms of CJD.  Dr Nathan Richardson from the Medical Research Council, which funded the study, said:  Although we currently have no cure for CJD, or for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s, understanding the early biomarkers for these can be extremely important in identifying targets for the eventual development of drugs treatments.","Published: October 4, 2016"

The collaboration involving the universities of Lancaster, Aston and Complutense in Madrid have applied ground-breaking computational techniques to design the vaccine in a study published in the leading journal Bioinformatics. The researchers have devised two universal vaccines;Dr Derek Gatherer of Lancaster University said:  Every year we have a round of flu vaccination, where we choose a recent strain of flu as the vaccine, hoping that it will protect against next year s strains. We know this method is safe, and that it works reasonably well most of the time.  However, sometimes it doesn t work   as in the H3N2 vaccine failure in winter 2014-2015   and even when it does it is immensely expensive and labour-intensive. Also, these yearly vaccines give us no protection at all against potential future pandemic flu.  Previous pandemics include the  Spanish flu  of 1918, and the two subsequent pandemics of 1957 and 1968, which led to millions of deaths. Even today, the World Health Organisation says that annual flu epidemics are estimated to cause up to half a million deaths globally. Dr Gatherer said:  It doesn t have to be this way. Based on our knowledge of the flu virus and the human immune system, we can use computers to design the components of a vaccine that gives much broader and longer-lasting protection.  Dr Pedro Reche of Complutense University said:  A universal flu vaccine is potentially within reach. The components of this vaccine would be short flu virus fragments   called epitopes   that are already known to be recognized by the immune system. Our collaboration has found a way to select epitopes reaching full population coverage. Dr Darren Flower of Aston University said:  Epitope-based vaccines aren t new, but most reports have no experimental validation. We have turned the problem on its head and only use previously-tested epitopes. This allows us to get the best of both worlds, designing a vaccine with a very high likelihood of success.  The team are now actively seeking partners in the pharmaceutical industry to synthesize their vaccine for a laboratory proof-of-principle test.","Published: October 4, 2016"

Carpizo, MD, PhD, will further aid the work of the physician-scientist in exploration of mechanisms behind the p53 gene   which is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer.  The funding from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation will help Dr. Carpizo build upon previous research from his laboratory examining a drug compound that restores tumor suppressor function of p53, with an aim of providing a foundation for the development of a new type of anti-cancer drug. Known as the  guardian of the human genome,  the p53 gene recognizes cellular stress and stops cell proliferation by either allowing the cell to recover from the stress or activating a protein that induces a program to kill the cell if the damage can t be repaired. The loss of this function can result in cancer cells escaping a controlled environment and multiplying throughout the body. Previous research by Carpizo s laboratory identified a drug compound that restores this tumor suppressor function by targeting a common p53 mutation.  Along with restoring structure and function to the p53 mutant protein, this drug compound has the ability to to activate a program that selectively kills cancer cells with this particular mutation while leaving normal cells undisturbed.  The mechanism behind this action is characterized as a  zinc metallochaperone  and is considered novel. This latest grant will fund research to determine the application of zinc metallochaperones in breast cancer.  One form of breast cancer called  triple negative  breast cancer is known for its biological aggressiveness and lack of effective chemotherapy options.  The preliminary data that Carpizo and colleagues have generated suggest that zinc metallochaperones have activity and that breast cancers with a mutation in the BRCA1 gene are particularly sensitive to zinc metallochaperones.  These ideas will be explored further in this grant.  Restoring the tumor suppressor ability of p53 with a drug is paramount in anti-cancer drug development,  notes Carpizo, who is an associate professor of surgery and pharmacology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  By further examining zinc metallochaperones on other p53 mutants that are similarly structured, we have an opportunity to increase the potential pool of patients that could theoretically benefit from zinc metallochaperones resulting in broad activity against all cancer types. I am grateful to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation for its support of this work.

The results, published in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society, are part of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, which looks at stroke incidence in approximately 30,000 individuals. The REGARDS study is funded by the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  As life expectancy continues to increase, we need to improve risk factor prevention and management for stroke and heart disease across the lifespan, including those adults over the age of 65,  said Claudia Moy, Ph.D., acting director of the Office of Clinical Research at NINDS, and one of the study authors.  The latest findings from the REGARDS study reveal that no age group is immune to risk factors related to cardiovascular disease and that prevention efforts should target all adults.  In the current study, led by George Howard, Dr.PH, a biostatistics professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, researchers examined individuals over the course of 10 years to determine how many developed risk factors known to be associated with stroke and heart disease. The specific risk factors that the researchers focused on in the current study were high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol and atrial fibrillation, a type of problem with heart rate rhythm that is greatly associated with stroke. The authors noted that while smoking is also a risk factor for stroke and heart disease, it is uncommon for individuals to begin smoking after the age of 30. The REGARDS study is made up of a sample of black and white Americans, with more than half of the participants living in the Stroke Belt, an area of the southeastern U.S. where stroke mortality is higher than in the rest of the country. Dr. Howard s team discovered that development of cardiovascular disease risk factors remains high among adults older than 65. The study also confirmed large racial disparities in the incidence of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol and atrial fibrillation. Overall, nearly half of the participants whose blood pressure was normal at the beginning of the study went on to develop high blood pressure during the nearly 10 years of follow-up. Across all age groups, including participants older than 75, black men had a 24 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure compared to white men. Black women aged 45 to 54 had a 93 percent higher risk of developing high blood pressure than did white women. However, that racial disparity shrank among women older than 75, because in that age group, incidence of high blood pressure continued to increase in white women while remaining stable among black women. The findings suggest that efforts to prevent high blood pressure may be beneficial in all subgroups. As study participants got older, their risk of developing diabetes mellitus decreased, although a large racial disparity was seen across all age groups. Overall, compared to whites, black men were 52 percent and black women were 114 percent more likely to develop diabetes mellitus. The incidence of high cholesterol increased through age 74, then decreased slightly among participants older than 75. Among all age groups, Dr. Howard s team found that there was at least a 20 percent risk of developing high cholesterol and that the incidence for blacks was greater than for whites. The researchers also discovered that risk of atrial fibrillation increased as participants got older, with whites more likely to develop the condition than blacks.  In addition to improving treatment and control of potent risk factors for stroke and heart disease, finding ways to prevent development of those risk factors may be a potential strategy to lower rates of cardiovascular disease across the age span, but especially in black Americans,  said Dr. Moy. Earlier this year, the NINDS launched a stroke prevention campaign called Mind Your Risks, designed to educate people aged 45-65 about the link between uncontrolled high blood pressure and the risk of having a stroke or developing dementia later in life. This study emphasizes the importance of providing evidence-based clinical preventive services to adults 65 years and older. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommendations on healthful diet and physical activity, screening for diabetes and lipid disorders and use of aspirin to prevent CVD in patients who are at increased risk. See the Task Force website for specific recommendations. This study was supported by the NINDS (NS041588). The NINDS is the nation s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.","Published: October 4, 2016"

The breakthrough at the Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute comes after decades of failed attempts to crystallize and determine the 3D structure of a protein that scientists expect will help them develop new treatments by understanding nicotine s molecular effects.  It s going to require a huge team of people and a pharmaceutical company to study the protein and develop the drugs, but I think this is the first major stepping stone to making that happen,  said Dr. Ryan Hibbs, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and Biophysics with the O Donnell Brain Institute at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who co-authored the findings published in Nature. The protein, called the  4 2 (alpha-4-beta-2) nicotinic receptor, sits on nerve cells in the brain. Nicotine binds to the receptor when someone smokes a cigarette or chews tobacco, causing the protein to open a path for ions to enter the cell. The process produces cognitive benefits such as increased memory and focus but is also highly addictive. Until the new findings were generated, scientists didn t have a way to examine at atomic resolution how nicotine achieves these cognitive and addictive effects. Who will benefit? The expectation is that the 3D structures will help researchers understand how nicotine influences the activity of the receptor and lead to a medication that mimics its actions in the brain. The finding may also have benefits in creating medications for certain types of epilepsy, mental illness, and dementia such as Alzheimer s, which are also associated with the nicotinic receptor. However, Dr. Hibbs cautioned that testing of any ensuing treatment would likely take many years. Studies have shown smoking cessation drugs have mixed results in treating nicotine addiction, as have other methods such as nicotine patches and chewing gum.  I just cannot quit smoking,  said Tom Loveless of Dallas, who has tried many times to kick his cigarette habit after becoming addicted 40 years ago while in the Air Force. He found the study s findings encouraging and hopes one day scientists can find a way to beat nicotine addiction.  I hate what it does to me,  said Mr. Loveless, a retired 65-year-old grandfather.  I hate the expense. I hate the odor. It upsets my wife. It isn t worth it.  Motivating Factors Despite widespread education on the dangers of tobacco use, it still causes nearly 6 million deaths per year worldwide, with smoking the leading cause of preventable death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cigarettes alone account for 1 in 5 deaths annually in the U.S. Those statistics are among the motivating factors for Dr. Hibbs, whose laboratory team began researching how to determine the structure of the receptor in 2012. The receptor is  a critically important therapeutic target  for addiction and various mental and neurological disorders, said Dr. Joseph Takahashi, Chairman of Neuroscience and Investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  This is a major advance and solves a longstanding problem in crystallizing  the nicotinic receptor, said Dr. Takahashi, who holds the Loyd B. Sands Distinguished Chair in Neuroscience. How they did it For years scientists around the globe had concentrated efforts on the receptor found in the electric organ of a torpedo ray, a rich source of nicotinic receptors that yielded a wealth of biochemical information and held promise for obtaining a high-resolution atomic map of the protein.  But they were never able to get the torpedo protein to crystalize,  Dr. Hibbs said, explaining that the protein from the ray proved too unstable and couldn t be genetically modified.  Many very good research groups had tried to do this and failed. We took a different approach.  Instead, UT Southwestern researchers developed a method for mass producing nicotinic receptors by viral infection of a human cell line. The team inserted genes encoding the proteins that make the receptor into the virus, and the infected human cells started producing large amounts of the receptor. They then used detergent and other purification steps to separate the receptor from the cell membrane and wash away all other proteins. Researchers were left with milligrams of the pure receptor that they mixed with chemicals known to promote crystallization. The team looked at thousands of chemical combinations before eventually being able to grow crystals of the receptor, bound by nicotine and about 0.2 mm long. Lastly, they used X-ray diffraction measurements to obtain a high-resolution structure of the receptor. The team s next steps involve determining structures in the absence of nicotine, and in the presence of molecules with different functional effects. Comparisons between structures will allow them to understand better what nicotine does, and how its actions are distinct from those of other chemicals, said Dr. Hibbs, Effie Marie Cain Scholar in Medical Research. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, a HHMI Gilliam Fellowship, the Welch Foundation, Friends of the Alzheimer s Disease Center, a McKnight Scholar award and a Klingenstein-Simons award. Other Hibbs lab researchers included first author Claudio Morales-Perez, student in the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and Dr. Colleen Noviello, Research Scientist.","Published: October 4, 2016"

Research at Binghamton University, State University of New York suggests that significant changes in the structure of brain activity occur during the early school years, and that such changes can potentially benchmark normative brain development in children. See Also: Researchers observe brain development in uteroBinghamton psychology researchers measured the ""resting state"" brain activity of over 450 children ages 7 to 11 using electroencephalography (EEG) technology to learn how brain electrical activity changes during this period. The brain waves of older children were found to contain greater signal complexity compared to the younger children. The researchers also found that, from year to year, the most impressive changes in this complexity of brain signals was occurring over frontal brain regions, known to be important for things like planning and impulse inhibition. The largest jump in brain signal complexity occurred between 7 and 8 years of age. ""We were looking for how the ways in which different brain regions are communicating is changing across age to sort of test this theory that as kids get older, there is more integration happening within their brain,"" said Vladimir Miskovic, assistant professor of psychology at Binghamton University. ""So there's more exchange of information in terms of their brain signals, representing a greater space of neuronal possibilities.

""We know kids are developing, but now we're trying to learn what exactly that means, what's the timing, and what are these critical periods when you see these massive changes."" For the bigger picture, these critical periods can be most important to detect ""developmental lagging"" before it worsens. According to Gibb, it's important because it can start telling doctors and psychologists not only how to intervene, but when. They are hoping to establish a normative standard for children's neurological development, much like pediatricians use standardized growth charts to evaluate children's physical development. However, they're looking to build on this information with more specific studies in the future. Miskovic laid out some of the team's next steps. ""One is looking at genetic influences on the developmental trajectories, especially since we know that certain genes influence neurogenesis and neural pruning. Also, looking at environmental influence, particularly things like family income as a measure of poverty, and also neighborhood crime statistics. And using these trajectories and seeing if variations from normal in terms of brain development is associated with depression, anxiety, externalizing problems,"" he said.

According to Gibb, the ultimate goal is to develop and standardize brain growth charts than include normative development of brain structure and function as a way of assessing children's development and spotting early warning signs for mental illness so that these can be addressed prior to the child developing any significant problems.

Our brains hold on to memories like these via physical changes in synapses, the tiny connections between neurons. A new study by researchers at Duke University and the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience reveals unexpected molecular mechanisms by which these changes take place. Published in the journal Nature, the findings could also shed light on how some diseases develop, including certain forms of epilepsy. ""We're beginning to unlock some of the mysteries underlying both the acquisition of a memory in the normal brain, as well as how a normal brain is transformed into an epileptic brain,"" said the study's co-senior investigator James McNamara, MD, a professor in the departments of neurobiology and neurology at Duke University. See Also: Robot model for infant learning shows bodily posture may affect memory and learning As we acquire a new memory, the connections, or synapses, between certain sets of neurons strengthen. In particular, the receiving end of a pair of these neurons -- consisting of a little nub called a spine -- gets a little larger. Researchers have long suspected that a brain receptor called TrkB was involved with the growth of spines when we learn, but the new study confirms that the receptor is indeed crucial and delves further into how it works. The key technologies that enabled this finding included a molecular sensor that the group developed to track activity of TrkB, and microscopes that allowed them to visualize a single spine in the area of living mouse brain tissue, all in real time. The group also was able to add a tiny amount of signaling chemical, glutamate, at the single spine in order to mimic what happens during learning. This caused the spines to grow. ""The mouse brain has approximately 70 million neurons, and most of them are dotted with thousands of spines,"" McNamara said. ""So, to be able to model and study the events occurring in a single spine in a single neuron is remarkable."" Learn More: Working memory hinders learning in schizophrenia Without the TrkB receptor, spine growth did not occur in response to the signaling chemical, the group found. The team suspected that yet another player, brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF), was involved because it is the molecular key to TrkB's lock. The scientists created a molecular sensor for BDNF and showed that mimicking the signal associated with learning caused the release of BDNF from the receiving end of the synapse. This was surprising because conventional wisdom holds that BDNF is only released from the sending neuron, not the receiving neuron. The fact that the receiving neuron both discharges BDNF into the gap between neurons and also senses it is ""extremely unique, biologically,"" said co-senior investigator Ryohei Yasuda, scientific director of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. ""One possibility is that BDNF is regulating several surrounding cells at once. We're interested in following up to understand the exact process."" Although the experiments were conducted in mice, the interaction between TrkB and BDNF is likely to be important for learning and memory in people, McNamara said. What's more, the same mechanisms are likely at play in one of the most common forms of epilepsy, called temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which targets brain regions responsible for learning and memory. Read Next: Specific gene linked to adult growth of brain cells, learning and memory Some cases of TLE are thought to be caused by a single, prolonged episode of seizures early in life. During the episode, glutamate, the same neurochemical involved in memory is released, but at much higher levels and for much longer times. McNamara's previous work shows that the TrkB receptor is critical for development of TLE, and last fall his group showed that inhibiting TrkB signaling briefly following the first seizure episode prevents the development of TLE in mice. McNamara's group is carrying out additional experiments to understand what happens after TrkB is activated in order for single spines to get bigger. In addition, other mechanisms are likely contributing to TrkB activation in both memory and epileptic episodes, and McNamara's group is exploring other potential mechanisms.

The study, published in the journal Cell, indicates that in yeast and possibly other organisms, including humans protein-based inheritance is more widespread than previously believed, and could play a role in evolution. See Also: New test detects toxic prions in blood ""In evolution there's a paradox,"" said Daniel Jarosz, PhD, assistant professor of chemical and systems biology and of developmental biology, who is lead author of the study. ""We know that there are an extraordinary number of mechanisms that exist to protect the integrity of the genetic code and to assure that it's faithfully passed on to future generations. But we also know that evolutionary success requires adaptability. How can you reconcile that need with the fact that the raw material for that innovation is really limited?"" Jarosz had a hunch that prions might be part of the answer. The new study suggests this could be the case. James Byers and Daniel Jarosz were part of a team that studied yeast to determine how they can pass down advantageous traits through prion proteins. Credit: Norbert von der Groeben  To understand his hunch, you need to know a bit about how prions work. Let's consider this scenario in a bottle of beer on a hot summer day: When some of the yeast cells floating in your beer get stressed, in this case by the blazing sun, they begin producing large quantities of proteins called molecular chaperones or proteins that help other proteins fold. These chaperones wrap around prions and fold them into a shape that kicks off a chain reaction of sorts. Other prions of its kind follow suit, using the original as a template. Related: Solving the next step in the mystery of prions ""I sometimes liken it to a spreading fashion trend among teenagers,"" said Jarosz. ""Once it catches on with a couple of kids it spreads rapidly to other teenagers. But only teenagers."" The upshot is that a single prion can quickly convert many others to assume the same shape and since a protein's shape dictates its behavior, that means the prion converts the other proteins' behavior as well. Furthermore, when a cell divides, both new cells are likely to carry prion proteins that will continue to spur conversions. That means the offspring will also display the new behavior, a result of inheritance perpetuated not through the standard means of DNA but instead by way of proteins. In the case of mad cow disease, a prion leads its normal brethren to fold in a way that leads to tissue damage in the brain and spinal cord of cattle. The human version of the disease (vCJD), can result from eating beef products from infected cattle. But Jarosz knew that not all prions are bad. He had learned about a few beneficial ones from his time as a postdoctoral scholar at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in the laboratory of Susan Lindquist, PhD, a co-author of the study who has pioneered investigations of prions as a driver of inheritance. When Jarosz came to Stanford as an assistant professor in 2013, he began what would become a nearly three-year project to systematically assess an organism for prion-based inheritance. He chose yeast, he said, because researchers around the world have established the organism's genetics and have developed comprehensive tools to analyze them. Don't Miss: Yeast are first cells known to cure themselves of prions ""I wanted to know the breadth of protein-based inheritance across the yeast genome. Is it really so rare?"" With the help of several robots, his team overexpressed nearly every yeast gene, one by one, for 48 hours triggering each gene to create 10 to 100 times more copies than usual of the protein designated by its code. Of the 5,300 genes they revved up, they found 46 made proteins that led to traits that remained heritable many generations after their expression had returned to normal. The traits were generally beneficial, such as resistance to temperature stress and anti-fungal drugs, or enhanced growth at high temperatures. When they analyzed the proteins' shapes, they discovered that few of them resembled what researchers had expected prions to look like. Most previously known prions fold in such a way that they pack tightly together and form long fibrils. The newly discovered prions lacked that trait, but many had others in common: They were strongly attracted to DNA molecules and they featured long, floppy ""arms"" able to fold in a wide variety of ways. Learn More: Prion trials and tribulations: Finding the right tools and experimental modelsDigging up unknown prions in yeast is less dangerous than you might think, said Jarosz. The efficiency of cross-species templating is very low for prion proteins. ""This is probably one of the major reasons that mad cow disease wasn't more widespread,"" he said. ""There is a safety concern with the human proteins. But luckily, simple procedures, like treating with bleach or soaking in sodium hydroxide, can render these protein conformations harmless."" The team also found that the traits followed prionlike inheritance patterns. For example, unlike traits resulting from most genetic mutations, prion traits are dominant, and they don't obey Mendel's laws. Rather than being passed to half of all progeny in genetic crosses as Mendel saw with his peas prion-based traits are transmitted to every cell. Additionally, when the researchers temporarily inhibited chaperone proteins, the prion-based traits were permanently eliminated. For the ultimate test, the researchers destroyed the DNA in the yeast cells carrying what they believed were prion-based traits, collected the remaining cell contents and introduced it into ordinary yeast cells. They found the traits were transmitted even though the cell's DNA had been destroyed indicating that proteins were transmitting the traits instead. Read Next: New type of prion may cause, transmit neurodegeneration The researchers also found several human genes that would make proteins with similar characteristics. ""These domains have been widely conserved across evolution, and several human homologs had the capacity to fuel protein-based inheritance,"" they wrote in the study. ""Our data thus establish a new and common type of protein-based molecular memory through which intrinsically disordered proteins can drive the emergence of new traits and adaptive opportunities.""

The disease starts by the aggregation of a common protein called amyloid beta. The Rice study is the first to model the energy landscape of the assembly of many copies of the pathogenic protein into its toxic form. See Also: Shedding new light on protein aggregates and the diseases they cause The research led by Professor Peter Wolynes of Rice's Center for Theoretical Biological Physics is detailed this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A team of Rice University researchers built computer simulations of amyloid beta proteins to see what their energy landscapes reveal about the formation of plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease. From left, Weihua Zheng, Min-Yeh Tsai, Peter Wolynes and Mingchen Chen. Credit: Jeff Fitlow/Rice University  Wolynes and his team are pioneers in the development of the energy landscape theory for proteins. All proteins start as chains of amino acids with their sequence determined by DNA, and each arrangement of the chain has a particular energy associated with it. The map of these energies and structures is called the energy landscape. For most proteins, the energy landscape guides the protein to fold into its useful functional shape. Wolynes and his colleagues, developed a computer program, called AWSEM (associative memory, water mediated, structure and energy model), that simulates the process and can predict the most important functional structures. A single molecule of the amyloid beta protein by itself does not fold into a definite structure and also appears to be harmless, Wolynes said. The disease starts when several molecules come together to form an oligomer. The structures of such oligomers, which are thought to be the toxic agents, has been unknown, he said. Learn More: Protein clusters targeted by medications for neurodegenerative diseases actually serve to protect brain cells At a later stage, the oligomers change into fibrillar plaques that appear to be less toxic. The Rice researchers used AWSEM to analyze oligomers of up to eight monomers in the prefibrillar form to see how they change into fibers. In the oligomer made of six monomers, for instance, they found that this transition takes place when self-recognizing sequences on separate protein molecules interacted with each other rather than with their prefibrillar partners. These structures, they wrote, then form the stable core of a propagating amyloid aggregate. ""A few years ago, there were experiments on the misfolding of a beta protein called titin, and we started to study its aggregation,"" Wolynes said. ""We discovered this interesting thing, that it wasn't the whole protein but only particular parts of the protein that were responsible for misfolding in amyloidogenic regions we found. ""It turned out there were very small lengths of about five amino acids that were extra sticky to each other,"" he said. ""The surprise was that while the overall molecule was foldable, there were five to 10 residues that, if you had another copy of the same molecule, would be able to stick together and cause aggregation."" Don't Miss: Observing brain diseases in real timeOne problem with previous studies was that the protein concentration changes as the aggregation process proceeds, Wolynes said. An important mathematical development using energy landscape theory allowed the Rice researchers to correct for that effect. With that correction, the simulation of oligomers of various complexity predicted solubilities that matched across the board what had been seen in experiments, said Weihua Zheng, a Rice research scientist and lead author of the study. ""One of the reasons you might get Alzheimer's is that you overproduce this protein,"" Zheng said. ""That's why solubility is a key number: You want amyloid beta to remain soluble."" The problem may lie in the production of enzymes that keep oligomer concentrations in check, Wolynes said. Inhibiting such enzymes is being explored as a route for treatment with drugs, he said. The simulations also demonstrated that the larger the oligomer, the greater the potential for forming fibrils, Wolynes said. Smaller oligomers of three or four monomers were predicted by the simulations to form cylindrins, barrel-shaped structures that other researchers have suggested could drill into and damage cell membranes. ""In future work, we want to look at whether these cylindrical structures actually could penetrate a membrane in simulations,"" he said. The researchers also noticed that just at the point of conversion, oligomers slightly unfold before going fibrillar. ""We call that backtracking,"" he said. ""It may explain a couple of things, like why these oligomers accumulate rather than all converting to the more benign fibrils."" Read Next: PET imaging for tau visualization in the brain In addition to enabling examination of the mechanism of amyloid beta aggregation, the simulations let the lab analyze the effects of point mutations -- including hereditary variants called Dutch and Arctic that are associated with early onset Alzheimer's. In both cases, the mutations seemed to make aggregation faster by exposing hydrophobic segments, though a third mutation, called Iowa, ""seems to be mildly protective,"" Wolynes said. The team will next simulate aggregation from amyloid beta proteins with 42 amino acids, for which structures of the fibers have recently been revealed. ""It's thought that these aggregate more readily than the 40s we studied here, and we hope to see why these are different or not,"" he said.

Not only that, the technique gives an estimate of how much unlabelled meat is illegally concealed in the product. The red colour of meat is due to a protein called myoglobin. But the myoglobin in beef, for example, differs from that of horse by 18 amino acids, the building blocks of all proteins. This means that if the beef and horse proteins are broken up in the same way, some of the matching fragments have different masses. This is the basis of the new test. Protein extracted from a meat sample is chemically chopped into fragments, called peptides, using an enzyme. The peptide soup is fed into a mass spectrometer that is tuned to measure the masses of only a handful of selected peptides. If a burger contains only beef then only beef peptides will appear. But if a little horse meat has been slipped in then some horse peptides will show up too. In this fraudulent case the relative hit rate of the horse and beef peptides give an estimate of how much horse has been added. The entire procedure takes around two hours. The IFR work, led by Dr Kate Kemsley, appears in the September issue of the Journal of Visualized Experiments as a free downloadable video clip showing how the experiment is done. JoVE is the world s first peer review scientific video journal. This research was described in more detail in a paper in journal Analytical Chemistry, and was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Though so far demonstrated using raw meat from just four species, the team have also shown that key marker peptides persist in supermarket products, including for lamb in ready-curry and for beef in canned corned beef. So the team is confident they can reveal meat adulteration in cooked retail products, of key interest to consumers and producers alike.

And although we all inherit a unique set of genes that help us respond to infections, recent studies have found that our history and environment like where and with whom we live are responsible for 60% to 80% of the differences between individual immune systems, while genetics account for the rest. In a Review published September 29 in Trends in Immunology, three immunologists discuss the emerging science of what shapes our immune systems and how it might be applied.  Just like it took a while to crack the genetic code, we re finally starting to crack the immune code, and we re shifting away from the simplistic idea that there is only one type of immune system,  says lead author Adrian Liston, head of the VIB-KU Leuven Translational Immunology Laboratory in Belgium.  Diversity isn t just programmed into our genes-- it emerges from how our genes respond to the environment.  Long-term infections are responsible for most of the differences between individual immune systems. For example, when a person has herpes or shingles, the virus has more opportunities to interact with the immune system. These interactions slowly change the cellular makeup of their immune system and make it more sensitive to that specific virus but also easier for other infections to slip past its defenses. People without these infections don t experience these cellular changes, and even with the occasional cold or fever, their immune systems stay relatively stable over time. The exception is when a person is elderly. Researchers haven t determined exactly why age plays a major role in making our individual immune systems more unique, but they have shown that aging changes how our immune system responds to threats. As we get older, an organ called the thymus gradually stops producing T cells, which are made to help to fight off infection. Without new T cells, older people are more likely to get sick and less likely to respond to vaccines.  Beyond T cells, ageing also seems to broadly change the way our immune systems react.  A lot of diseases that we associated with aging have an inflammatory component, which suggests there is likely immune involvement,  says Michelle Linterman, a researcher at the Babraham Institute and co-author of the review.  Understanding how the immune system changes with age is going to be hugely important for treating age-related diseases in the future.  Differences can be overcome, however; studies of people living together have shown that air quality, food, stress levels, sleep patterns, and lifestyle choices had a strong combined effect on our immune responses. For example, couples who cohabitate have more similar immune systems compared to the general public.  Liston and his collaborators, Linterman and Edward Carr of the Babraham Institute, would next like to explore how changing our environment could purposefully shape our immune system and potentially affect our health.  In order to tinker with the immune code, we first need to really understand the influences that shape the immune system,  says Liston.  That s why it s actually great that environment is more important than genetics, because we can play with environment. ","Published: October 3, 2016"

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been recognized as a feasible and effective procedure decades ago, however, the first randomized trial assessing the clinical efficacy of FMT by duodenal infusions, achieving sustained clinical cure in over 90% of patients with rCDI was not published until 2013. The success of this previously unpopular approach fueled various research efforts. In this context, other routes of application, i.e.As well as improvement of FMT product storage using cryopreservation were assessed with favorable results. While most of these studies were observational, limited to one interventional treatment arm or to a small number of patients, a milestone randomized double-blind trial assessing the clinical efficacy of frozen as opposed to fresh FMT enemas in 232 adults was recently published and confirmed non-inferiority of frozen preparations. Inspired by the clinical impact of FMT and its rapid technical improvement, the interest of physicians in integrating FMT into their clinical armamentarium against rCDI is growing. In this setting, physicians are likely to encounter difficulties when searching for reliable standards with respect to donor screening, microbiota preparation, and route of administration. At the same time, colleagues considering referral of patients for FMT have difficulties identifying qualified centers.

Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. However, currently available therapies for metastatic prostate cancer are only marginally effective. Hence, there is a need for more novel treatment alternatives and options. ""Although the diverse anti-cancer effects of nimbolide have been reported in different cancer types, its potential effects on prostate cancer initiation and progression have not been demonstrated in scientific studies. In this research, we have demonstrated that nimbolide can inhibit tumour cell viability - a cellular process that directly affects the ability of a cell to proliferate, grow, divide, or repair damaged cell components - and induce programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells,"" said Assoc Prof Sethi. Nimbolide: promising effects on prostate cancer Cell invasion and migration are key steps during tumour metastasis. The NUS-led study revealed that nimbolide can significantly suppress cell invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells, suggesting its ability to reduce tumour metastasis. The researchers observed that upon the 12 weeks of administering nimbolide, the size of prostate cancer tumour was reduced by as much as 70 per cent and its metastasis decreased by about 50 per cent, without exhibiting any significant adverse effects.  This is possible because a direct target of nimbolide in prostate cancer is glutathione reductase, an enzyme which is responsible for maintaining the antioxidant system that regulates the STAT3 gene in the body. The activation of the STAT3 gene has been reported to contribute to prostate tumour growth and metastasis,  explained Assoc Prof Sethi.  We have found that nimbolide can substantially inhibit STAT3 activation and thereby abrogating the growth and metastasis of prostate tumour,  he added.","Published: October 3, 2016"

Reported today in Nature Genetics, the research shows how large-scale genomic datasets can be used to help identify potential novel biological targets for studying cardiovascular and other diseases. Genetics have been implicated in cardiovascular and blood diseases for some time, however as these are complex diseases, it is extremely difficult to find specific genetic causes. In this study, scientists studied the genomes of almost 36,000 healthy people with European ancestry, looking for rare genetic links to 20 known risk factors for disease, such as raised levels of cholesterol or haemoglobin in the blood. Two previous large-scale projects provided the whole genome sequences needed: the UK10K project - a study of the genetic code of 10,000 people that aims to better understand links between rare genetic variations and disease; and the 1000 genome project. From this data, the scientists created a resource called a dense imputation panel, which is freely accessible to the scientific community. The panel holds so much detail that it can fill in the gaps or  impute  data missing from lower resolution genetic studies. The level of detail the imputation panel provides enabled the scientists to look at specific disease risk factors, and find 17 new genetic variants. Of these, 16 would have been extremely difficult to find without the imputation panel data.  The dense imputation panel used in this study allowed us to search for genetic variations that are much less frequent than ever before, but that individually explain a greater genetic risk.  As efforts continue to characterise the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases, the methods we have developed in this study are expected to enable the next wave of discoveries of what causes these diseases, and how we might develop new treatments.    Professor Nicole Soranzo, joint senior author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute  This is the first stage of a discovery process that is going to tell us more about the contribution genetics makes to complex human diseases. We looked at where in the genome these 17 new variants lie to see what that could tell us about biology; about the changes they make to the body and how that could make a person more or less susceptible to disease.    Dr Valentina Iotchkova, first author from the Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute The researchers then applied an analytical technique called fine-mapping to study hundreds of regions of the human genome that contain genetic risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. For 59 regions, they were able to narrow down the most likely genetic causes to small sets of genetic variants. Combining this fine mapping technique with biological data drilled it down even further and provided additional functional insight into the underlying biology.  Our study provides a refined method to use the panel alongside other analysis techniques to find rare variants that contribute to complex genetic conditions like heart disease or diabetes. We have also narrowed down the set of potentially causal variants to a small set of variants for further follow up. We focused on cardiometabolic traits but the panel covers the entire human genome so it could be used to glean a deeper understanding of genetic contributions to disease in any part of the human body.

""GE crops are also commonly presented as though there are only two sides to this debate: either you are for them or against them,"" he said. ""But new technologies bring both promises and perils; what seems promising to some might seem perilous to others. ""However, there is still insufficient research to make conclusive statements on the social and economic impacts of GE crop technologies. I hope that those who read and discuss this report do not shoehorn it into the existing paradigm but, instead, recognize the complexity and nuances of GE crops."" The researchers used data published during the last two decades from more than 900 research and other publications to evaluate the positive and negative effects of GE crops -- crops that have been engineered to resist insects or herbicides. The scientists also heard from 80 diverse speakers and read more than 700 comments from members of the public to expand their understanding of GE crop issues. Nearly 180 million hectares of GE crops were planted globally in 2015, roughly 12 percent of the worlds planted cropland that year. According to the report, Bt crops, those that contain an insect-resistant gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, comprise a large segment of GE cropland. The researchers found that from 1996 to 2015, the use of Bt maize and cotton contributed to a reduction in synthetic insecticide use and in crop losses. Some pest-insect populations dropped; however, insect biodiversity increased overall. Insect resistance to Bt proteins was slow to develop only when the crops produced a dose of Bt protein that was large enough to kill insects. Damaging levels of resistance did evolve in some species when resistance-management strategies were not followed. The team found that the use of herbicide-resistant (glyphosate-resistant) crops contributed to greater crop yield by reducing weed pressure. When such crops first were adopted, total kilograms of herbicide applied per hectare of crop per year declined, although the decreases generally have not been sustained. Some weed species have evolved resistance to glyphosate; however, the team noted that delaying such resistance is possible with integrated weed management. To examine the human health effects of GE crops and foods, the team examined animal experimental studies and found a lack of evidence that animals are harmed by eating foods derived from GE crops. ""Many people are concerned that consuming GE foods may cause cancer, obesity and disorders such as autism spectrum and allergies,"" Glenna said. ""However, the committee examined epidemiological datasets over time from the United States and Canada, where GE food has been consumed since the late 1990s, and similar datasets from the United Kingdom and western Europe, where GE food is not widely consumed. We found no differences among countries in specific health problems."" The team also found that economic outcomes of GE crops have been favourable for most producers who have adopted these crops. However, the cost of GE seed may limit the adoption of GE crops by smaller, resource-poor farm holders. Furthermore, economic benefits tend to accrue for early adopters. The team concluded that enduring and widespread use of GE crops will depend on institutional support and access to profitable local and global markets.","Published: October 3, 2016"

The AOPs are novel knowledge management tools in toxicology and are useful for supporting risk assessment to human health. They are also valuable for helping to avoid animal testing through the use of alternative methods. An adverse outcome pathway, or AOP, is a highly structured way of describing a toxicological process which can lead to an adverse health effect in humans or wildlife, caused by an unsafe exposure to a chemical substance. Essentially an AOP tells a toxicological story in terms of a logical sequence of causally-linked 'key events' that occur at different levels of biological organisation, from perturbations at the molecular scale up to effects occurring in a whole organism or a population. The AOPs developed by the JRC, now published by OECD, relate to chemical-induced liver fibrosis, aspects of neurotoxicity in adults, and certain neurotoxicological effects that can be caused during human development. AOP development process The AOP framework has been developed through an extensive international collaboration between scientists, regulators and policy-makers with the primary goal of making mechanistic toxicological knowledge more readily available to support safety assessment decisions. AOPs are essential in the process of shifting from traditional animal testing to new non-animal approaches that are based on the combination of in vitro methods and computational modelling. The AOPs are available in the new OECD Series on Adverse Outcome Pathways. The development process followed the relevant OECD guidance. At the OECD, the Extended Advisory Group for Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics (co-chaired by the JRC on behalf of the EU) manages the development of AOPs which undergo a series of expert reviews before being submitted for endorsement to the Working Group of National Coordinators for the Test Guidelines Programme (WNT) and the Task Force for Hazard Assessment. Although the AOPs developed until now have addressed chemical toxicity, the approach also lends itself to describing the mechanistic basis to potential adverse effects caused by nanomaterials, as demonstrated very recently by the JRC.     AOP Knowledge Base The JRC has also partnered with the OECD and the US Environmental Protection Agency to develop the publically accessible AOP Knowledge Base. This key resource facilitates the scientific crowdsourcing and on-line peer review foreseen in the AOP development process and allows an AOP to continue to evolve as understanding of the underlying science grows. Once an AOP reaches a certain level of maturity, it is versioned as a document and published in the new OECD series to encourage its utilisation in non-animal species-relevant approaches to regulatory safety assessment. This novel knowledge management framework, which is already transforming the world of toxicology, has the potential to penetrate other fields such as biomedical research, where effective translation of mechanistic understanding into application is central to innovation and progress.","Published: October 3, 2016"

KRAS-mutant cancers are among the most difficult to treat, with poor survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center used microRNAs   small pieces of genetic material   to systematically inhibit thousands of other genes to find combinations that are specifically lethal to cancer cells driven by a KRAS mutation. The study, published October 3 in Cancer Research, provides new information about KRAS-driven cancers and offers a potential therapeutic target for their eradication.  For decades researchers have tried to directly inhibit KRAS activity, but there are no well-defined binding pockets in the protein that we can target with small-molecule drugs,  said senior author Tariq Rana, PhD, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center.  Instead of trying to deter KRAS itself, we took the approach of looking for other molecules that, when inhibited, are lethal to cells only when KRAS is also mutated.  To do this, Rana and team used microRNAs, small pieces of genetic material similar to DNA. MicroRNAs don t encode proteins. Instead, microRNAs bind messenger RNAs that do encode proteins, inhibiting their translation or hastening their degradation. Normal cells use microRNAs to help control which genes are turned on or off at different times. MicroRNAs tend to be less active in cancer cells. In this study, the researchers created a library of more than a thousand human microRNA mimics, each with a different sequence and capable of binding different messenger RNA targets. First, they tested each microRNA on colorectal cells grown in the lab. Half the cells had a KRAS mutation that made the protein more active, as is the case in many cancers. The other half had normal KRAS. The microRNA sequences that killed only the KRAS-mutant cells were then tested again in a panel of lung cancer cell lines with and without KRAS mutations.  From this screen, one microRNA in particular stood out for its ability to suppress KRAS-dependent cell growth in both colorectal and lung cancer cells: miR-1298. MicroRNA-1298 inhibits two proteins in cancer cells, FAK and LAMB3. When the researchers silenced either of these proteins, they saw the same effect as adding miR-1298   KRAS-driven cancer cells stopped growing.  In human lung cancer tissue samples, Rana and team discovered that elevated LAMB3 levels were associated with poorer survival for patients with KRAS mutations. The researchers looked at data from a group of 259 lung cancer patients for whom KRAS status and survival outcome were known. Of those, 143 were KRAS-positive and 116 were KRAS-negative. After about 10 years, survival probability for KRAS-positive patients with high LAMB3 levels was approximately 20 percent, compared to approximately 60 percent for KRAS-positive patients with low LAMB3.  This clinical finding suggests LAMB3 could be used as a prognostic biomarker, and underscores LAMB3 s potential as a therapeutic target for KRAS-driven cancers,  Rana said.  What s more, it highlights miRNAs as important tools for probing complex biological processes, identifying new therapeutic targets and developing potential new RNA-based therapeutics.

But since white fat cells have very few nerves, how do beige fat cells get the message that it s cold outside? In research that has implications for diabetes and other metabolic diseases, an international study based at UT Southwestern Medical Center found that the protein connexin 43 (Cx43) forms cell-to-cell communication channels on the surface of emerging beige fat cells that amplify the signals from those few nerve fibers. The channels act like conduits that speed signals across the gaps between clusters of cells   similar to the way a group email reaches several people at once. The study, recently published in Cell Metabolism, also found that beige fat, unlike the better-known white and brown fat, has interesting anti-diabetic effects on blood sugar metabolism that seem independent of temperature regulation. Impaired glucose metabolism is a hallmark of diabetes.  The data here show how white fat cells can make maximal use of their limited number of nerves to allow a single nerve fiber to spread the  message  about cold temperatures amongst the connected cells,  explained Dr. Philipp Scherer, lead author of the study and Director of UT Southwestern s Touchstone Center for Diabetes Research.  To my knowledge, this is the first time that any fat s thermal regulatory (warming) and metabolic effects on blood sugar have been observed to work independently. Our findings suggest that activating Cx43 may cause the formation of more beige fat and thus increase the anti-diabetic effects seen in this study,  Dr. Scherer added. Fat, once considered merely a storage area for excess calories, is now appreciated as a dynamic tissue that comes in several forms with different functions that are still being identified. White fat is used mainly for energy storage. Brown fat, the classic heat-generating fat, helps regulate body temperature, especially in newborns. Some white fat cells are capable of transforming into a third kind of fat, beige. Both brown and beige fat get their color from increased mitochondria that are added in response to cold and other environmental stimuli, he said. To study the metabolic effects of beige fat, the researchers compared mice with Cx43 that are able to make beige fat normally to mice unable to make Cx43, meaning their white fat seldom got the message to change to beige in response to cold. After three weeks in cold temperatures, the mice were returned to normal temperatures and analyzed for glucose (blood sugar) metabolism. The mice that produced Cx43 showed greater improvement in glucose metabolism, Dr. Scherer said. Yet, both groups of animals were still able to regulate body temperature, apparently through their brown fat stores, he said.  This study reaches two conclusions: First, Cx43 is necessary for the propagation of nerve signals that lead to beiging of white fat tissue. Second, beige fat may be more interesting from an anti-diabetic, metabolic standpoint   a finding with significant clinical relevance   than from a body temperature, warming standpoint,  explained Dr. Scherer, who holds the Gifford O. Touchstone, Jr. and Randolph G. Touchstone Distinguished Chair in Diabetes Research.

The results suggest that another protein called lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) plays a role in transmitting  -synuclein aggregates from one brain cell to another and could provide a possible target to slow the progression of Parkinson s disease. The study, published in Science, was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  This study represents a significant advance in understanding the neurobiological changes underlying Parkinson s disease,  said Beth-Anne Sieber, Ph.D., a program director at NINDS.  The identification of LAG3 as a mediator in transmitting abnormal  -synuclein between neurons provides both insight into the disease mechanism and a potential therapeutic target for the disease.  Analogous to how a computer virus corrupts data, the presence of abnormal  -synuclein in neurons can damage healthy  -synuclein protein, which promotes the formation of additional aggregates. These aggregates then pass from one neuron to another just as computer viruses move to other computers on the same network.  In looking for ways to slow the progression of Parkinson s disease, we were interested to see how abnormal  -synuclein enters neurons. Therefore, we began by looking for proteins that would be involved in that process,  said Ted M. Dawson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Institute for Cell Engineering and the NINDS Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, and senior author of this study. Dr. Dawson and his colleagues used a synthetic form of abnormal  -synuclein, called pre-formed fibrils, to induce Parkinson s disease-like symptoms and ultimately focused on the protein LAG3 based on its role as a transmembrane protein and the fact that it binds to fibrils much more tightly than healthy  -synuclein protein. Transmembrane proteins are large molecules with components located both on the interior and the exterior of cells; some transmembrane proteins function as gatekeepers that allow specific molecules to enter or exit cells. To test the role of LAG3, Dr. Dawson s group compared normal mice with those that lacked the gene for LAG3 and were unable to make that specific protein. When normal mice were injected with  -synuclein fibrils, they quickly developed Parkinson s disease-like symptoms, including changes in movement, grip strength, and the eventual death of dopamine neurons, the type of brain cell most affected by the disease. However, the mice lacking LAG3 that received fibril injections appeared to have normal grip strength and movement and had no significant loss of dopamine neurons. Dr. Dawson s team also looked at neurons that had been removed from both types of mice and grown in culture dishes. When  -synuclein fibrils were added to normal neurons, they were quickly pulled into the cells and passed along to neighboring cells; however, this was seen only in very few neurons from the mice that lacked LAG3.  We knew from these experiments that LAG3 was important for the neurons  ability to take up  -synuclein fibrils,  said Dr. Dawson.  Antibodies that block the activity of LAG3 are being tested in clinical trials as a form of cancer immunotherapy. We were therefore curious to see whether we could use similar antibodies to block the function of LAG3.  Neurons treated with the LAG3 antibodies behaved similarly to the neurons that lacked LAG3. There was a considerable decrease in their ability to take up fibrils and to pass them on to neighboring neurons. These results suggested that LAG3 function could be blocked by antibodies, providing a possible means to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson s disease. Dr. Dawson and his colleagues are currently testing the LAG3 antibody in animal models of Parkinson s disease to further explore possible therapeutic and protective effects against the progression of disease symptoms. The study was supported by the NIH (NS38377) with additional funding provided by the JPB Foundation. The NINDS is the nation s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.","Published: October 1, 2016"

Pennsylvania State University researchers recently discovered adolescents begin to view faces differently as they prepare for the transition to adulthood. Suzy Scherf, assistant professor of psychology and head of the Laboratory of Developmental Neuroscience at Penn State, and Giorgia Picci, graduate student in developmental psychology, published their findings recently in the journal Psychological Science. ""We know that faces convey a lot of different social information, and the ability to perceive and interpret this information changes through development,"" Scherf explained. ""For the first time, we've been able to show how puberty, not age, shapes our ability to recognize faces as we grow into adults."" See Also: Computer maps 21 distinct emotional expressions, tripling the number of facial expressions that can be used for cognitive analysis According to Scherf, the ability of adolescents to retune their face processing system, from showing a bias toward adult female faces as children, to preferring peer faces that match their own developmental stage in puberty, is part of the social metamorphosis that prepares them to take on adult social roles. ""In other words, it literally changes the way people see faces. This has been shown previously in research published in animal literature, but not in humans."" The researchers developed an innovative experimental design that proves a bias to remember peer faces is reflected in the pubertal stage of the face, rather than the age of the face, which is how previous researchers investigated these biases. ""We were able to show that puberty shapes the subtle emergence of social behaviors that are important for adolescents' transition to adulthood. This likely happens due to hormones influencing the brain and the nervous system reorganization that occurs during this time,"" said Scherf. The researchers recruited 116 adolescents and young adults for the study and separated them into four pubertal groups depending on their stage of puberty. Importantly, the adolescents in the study were all the same age, but differed in their stage of puberty. Therefore, any differences in the way they responded to faces were related to their pubertal status, not their age. Scherf and Picci determined the adolescents' stage of development through self-assessments as well as parent-provided assessments. Learn More: ADHD: Brains not recognizing an angry expression The researchers presented participants with 120 gray-scale photographs of male and female faces. The pubertal status of the faces in the pictures matched that of the participants. ""In other words, there were images of pre-pubescent children, young adolescents in early puberty, young adolescents in later puberty, and sexually mature young adults,"" Scherf explained. Participants were asked to look at faces from all four pubertal groups, and the researchers measured their face-recognition ability using a computerized game. After studying 10 target faces with neutral expressions, participants were shown another set of 20 faces with happy expressions and had to identify whether they had seen each face previously or if they were new. Scherf and Picci found that the pre-pubescent children had a bias to remember adult faces, which they call the caregiver bias. ""This is interesting because these are school-age children who spend lots of time with other children, yet they are still biased to remember adult faces,"" said Scherf. In contrast, adolescents had a bias to remember other adolescent faces, exhibiting a peer bias. According to Scherf, the most surprising finding was that among adolescents who were the same age, those who were less mature in pubertal development had better recognition memory for other similarly less mature adolescents, while those who were more mature in pubertal development had better recognition memory for peers who were similar in their level of development. ""This shows that adolescents are very clued into each other's pubertal status. They can literally see it in each other's faces, perhaps implicitly, and this influences how they keep track of each other. This may explain a well-known finding that adolescents organize their peer groups according to pubertal status and is relevant for understanding how adolescents begin to think about each other as romantic partners for the first time."" Read Next: Face blindness predicted by structural differences in the brain This research will help scientists uncover how puberty impacts the developing human brain and help them understand the timetable of behavioral and brain changes during adolescence, which could guide mental health treatment and inform public health policy.

Their study in mice and cultured cells suggests that an immunotherapy already in clinical trials as a cancer therapy should also be tested as a way to slow the progress of Parkinson's disease, the researchers say. See Also: Tissue biomarker for dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease identified A report on the study appears in the journal Science. Ted Dawson, MD, PhD, director of the Institute for Cell Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and one of the study's leaders, says the new findings hinge on how aggregates of  -synuclein protein enter brain cells. Abnormal clumps of  -synuclein protein are often found in autopsies of people with Parkinson's disease and are thought to cause the death of dopamine-producing brain cells. A few years ago, Dawson says, a researcher at Goethe University in Germany published evidence for a novel theory that Parkinson's disease progresses as  -synuclein aggregates spread from brain cell to brain cell, inducing previously normal  -synuclein protein to aggregate, and gradually move from the ""lower"" brain structures responsible for movement and basic functions to ""higher"" areas associated with processes like memory and reasoning. ""There was a lot of skepticism, but then other labs showed  -synuclein might spread from cell to cell,"" Dawson says. Intrigued, his research group began working with those of Valina Dawson, PhD, professor of neurology, and Han Seok Ko, PhD, assistant professor of neurology, to investigate how the aggregates enter cells. The researchers knew they were looking for a certain kind of protein called a transmembrane receptor, which is found on the outside of a cell and works like a lock in a door, admitting only proteins with the right ""key."" They first found a type of cells  -synuclein aggregates could not enter: a line of human brain cancer cells grown in the laboratory. The next step was to add genes for transmembrane receptors one by one to the cells and see whether any of them allowed the aggregates in. Three of the proteins did, and one, LAG3, had a heavy preference for latching on to  -synuclein aggregates over nonclumped  -synuclein. Learn More: How Parkinson's disease alters brain activity over timeThe team next bred mice that lacked the gene for LAG3 and injected them with  -synuclein aggregates. ""Typical mice develop Parkinson's-like symptoms soon after they're injected, and within six months, half of their dopamine-making neurons die,"" Dawson says. ""But mice without LAG3 were almost completely protected from these effects."" Antibodies that blocked LAG3 had similar protective effects in cultured neurons, the researchers found. ""We were excited to find not only how  -synuclein aggregates spread through the brain, but also that their progress could be blocked by existing antibodies,"" says Xiaobo Mao, PhD, a research associate in Dawson's laboratory and first author on the study. Dawson notes that antibodies targeting LAG3 are already in clinical trials to test whether they can beef up the immune system during chemotherapy. If those trials demonstrate the drugs' safety, the process of testing them as therapeutics for Parkinsons' disease might be sped up, he says. For now, the research team is planning to continue testing LAG3 antibodies in mice and to further explore LAG3's function.

Menopause occurs when a woman's ovaries stop producing estrogen and other hormones, and her menstrual periods stop. The transition takes place gradually, usually over four or five years. Among women in the U.S., the average age for menopause to occur is 51 years old. The Hormone Health Network's interactive Menopause Map  helps women learn more about the stages of menopause and where they are in the journey. See Also: Study of firefighters finds potential pathway between insomnia and depressionUsing a medication to simulate the decline in a woman's estrogen levels during menopause, the researchers found both interruption of sleep and greater frequency of perceived nighttime hot flashes were associated with mood disturbance. ""When women were awake long enough to later recall nighttime hot flashes, that perception contributed to mood disturbance in women whose estrogen levels had fallen,"" said the study's first author, Hadine Joffe, MD, MSc, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA. ""The association was independent of sleep disruption that the women experienced."" Twenty-nine healthy, premenopausal women between the ages of 18 and 45 took part in the study. The women took a medication to suppress estrogen production in the ovaries for a four-week period, a treatment that mimics menopause and induces menopausal symptoms to varying degrees of intensity. Before and after the four-week timeframe, researchers monitored the participants' sleep and hormone levels. The participants completed mental health questionnaires at the beginning and end of the study. The study found that women who reported experiencing frequent nighttime hot flashes were more likely to experience mild symptoms of depression than those who reported fewer or no nighttime hot flashes. Although researchers also monitored the women for physiologic signs of nighttime hot flashes during the sleep study, they found only the women's perception of hot flash frequency not the measured number of hot flashes was linked to changes in mood. Related: Is sufficient sleep the key to successful antidepressant response?Women who experienced sleep interruption also were more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression than women who got more sleep.

In experiments with mice, these immune cells, called synNotch T cells, efficiently homed in on tumors and released a specialized antibody therapy, eradicating the cancer without attacking normal cells. As reported in the Sept. 29, 2016, online edition of Cell, in addition to delivering therapeutic agents, synNotch cells can be programmed to kill cancer cells in a variety of other ways. But synNotch cells can also carry out instructions that suppress the immune response, offering the possibility that these cells could be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes or to locally suppress immune system rejection of transplanted organs.  SynNotch is a universal molecular sensor that allows us to program immune cells as if they were microscopic robots,"" said Wendell Lim, PhD, chair and professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at UCSF, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and member of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.  They can be customized with different features and functions, and when they detect the appropriate signals in a diseased tissue, they can be triggered to deploy diverse therapeutic weapons.  Sidestepping Limitations of CAR T Therapy The new research broadens and deepens previous research on synNotch T cells in Lim s laboratory, which has shown, among other things, that the synNotch sensor platform can be used to create custom  logic gates  in T cells that allow them to recognize and kill cancer cells, while protecting closely related healthy cells. These cellular  AND gates  require two separate conditions to be met in target cells before the T cells take steps to eliminate the target. T cells are highly motile, and roam throughout the body seeking out diseased or infected cells. A form of T cell therapy known as CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) T therapy has been widely publicized for its unprecedented success in treating a form of blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. But because CAR T therapy largely relies on the  built-in  sensing and response properties of T cells, some of which can be deleterious, it can have serious side effects. Moreover, because T cells are often unable to overcome properties of tumors that suppress immunity, CAR T therapy has so far not been effective against the solid tumors that affect the breast, prostate, brain, lungs and other organs. Lim said that the synNotch technology developed at UCSF can be used on its own, but can also be added to CAR T cells to sidestep many of that therapy s current limitations. SynNotch is so called because it is the product of several synthetic alterations of Notch, a protein involved in cell-to-cell communication in diverse organisms that is especially crucial for normal development. First of all, the synNotch receptor acts as a  universal sensor    it has a component protruding from the T cell that can be swapped out to specifically recognize many different types of disease signals. And synNotch s other end, inside the cell, is an  effector  component that can be engineered to cause the cell to carry out diverse responses. Versatility of synNotch In the new Cell paper, a research team at the UCSF Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, led by postdoctoral fellow and first author Kole T. Roybal, PhD, demonstrated the versatility of synNotch T cells in several ways. When activated, conventional T cells, including CAR T cells, secrete a  native  suite of cytokines, chemical signals that summon other immune cells to the disease site and determine the overall immune response. But some native cytokines, when overproduced, can be also be highly toxic. Members of the Lim laboratory demonstrated that synNotch T cells can be directed to secrete single, predetermined cytokines or customized selections of cytokines that can be tailored to elicit a specific desired immune response. SynNotch cells can be outfitted with other receptors that cause the disease cells they target to  commit suicide  by triggering built-in cell-death pathways. When T cells reach a disease site and are activated, they may transform into particular T cell subtypes. As with cytokines, however, the T cell varieties that emerge from this differentiation process may not be the optimal combination. Lim and colleagues show that, with synNotch, this T cell differentiation process can be  skewed  so that the activated T cells emerge as a subtype of T cell optimized to combat cancer. The use of so-called  checkpoint inhibitor  drugs that unleash the immune response have achieved unprecedented remissions in metastatic melanoma and other forms of cancer that until recently were considered fatal. In the work published in Cell, synNotch cells were engineered to manufacture two effective checkpoint inhibitor drugs when the synNotch cells were in direct contact with cancer. Lim said that this on-site drug delivery may increase response among cancer patients while reducing side effects. SynNotch delivery of another therapy, known as a Bispecific T Cell Engager (BiTE; in this case, a BiTE known as Blincyto was delivered) eliminated tumors in mice without affecting normal cells. Intriguingly, the group showed that synNotch cells can produce immunosuppressive signals at disease sites, indicating that synNotch T cells could be used to tamp down the immune system attacks that occur in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Lim is scientific founder and advisory board member of Cell Design Labs, a San Francisco company devoted to advancing cell-based therapies to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions. Based on technology licensed from UCSF, Cell Design Labs is developing a portfolio of anticancer therapies and creating partnerships with leading oncology companies. To learn more about Cell Design Labs, please visit their website. In addition to Lim and Roybal, authors of the new study included graduate student Jasper Z. Williams; postdoctoral fellow Leonardo Morsut, PhD; former postdoctoral fellow Levi J. Rupp, now a scientist at Cell Design Labs; postdoctoral fellow Isabel Kolinko, PhD; graduate student Joseph H. Choe; junior specialist Whitney J. Walker; and associate specialist Krista A. McNally. The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health; a Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund postdoctoral fellowship to Roybal; a Human Frontiers of Science Program postdoctoral fellowship to Morsut; and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  Using synNotch cells to deliver powerful therapeutic molecules or to shape the immune response directly at the site of disease will not only be more effective, but will likely prevent the side effects that occur when drugs are delivered systemically, and indiscriminately affect every tissue in the body,  said Roybal.  The local production of molecular therapies by therapeutic immune cells is a radically new approach   one that could be both more effective and far safer than the systemic administration of therapeutics being used today.

Four of them are also related to social disorders in humans, for example, autism.  - Our findings are the first to reveal genes that can have caused the extreme change in social behaviour, which has occurred in dogs since they were domesticated, says Per Jensen, professor of ethology, who is the leader of the research group. The dog is the oldest domesticated animal and during thousands of years it has adapted to a life among humans. During this period dogs have developed unique abilities to communicate and cooperate with humans. In this respect, they are widely superior to their wild ancestors, the wolves. Facing a difficult task, most dogs seek contact with a human, apparently to solicit help. In similar situations, wolves generally attempt to solve the problem themselves. In the new study, published in the scientific journal  Scientific Reports , the researchers wanted to study the behaviour of the dogs by presenting them with an unsolvable problem. The task was to open a tight lid to obtain a treat. Almost 500 beagles with similar earlier experiences of human interactions were part of the behavioural studies. The scientists used video recordings to quantify the willingness of the dogs to seek physical contact with a person in the room when the problem turned out to be too difficult. For more than 200 of the dogs also the DNA was studied. By using a method called GWAS (genome-wide association study), the researchers examined a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome. GWAS can be used to find out if a particular genetic variant is more common among individuals with a particular trait, such as contact seeking behaviour in this case. It turned out that the contact seeking dogs more often carried certain genetic variants. - We found a clear association with DNA-regions containing five different interesting genes. Four of the genes are previously known from studies of social disorders in humans, for example, autism and ADHD, says Mia Persson, PhD-student and main author of the paper. ADHD, autism and similar neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with difficulties with social interactions with other humans. - If the associations we have found can be confirmed in other dog breeds it is possible that dog behaviour also can help us to better understand social disorders in humans, says Per Jensen. The research is funded by the European Research Council, ERC.","Published: September 30, 2016"

It also reveals how genetic differences provide an important link between an individual s early growth and their chances of developing conditions such as type 2 diabetes or heart disease in later life. The new study was jointly led by a team of researchers from six institutions including the universities of Exeter, Oxford, Bristol, Cambridge and Queensland, and the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. The research involved more than 160 international researchers from 17 countries who are members of the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium. The work was supported by more than 120 research funders: the major sources of funding for UK researchers were the Wellcome Trust, the Royal Society, the Medical Research Council, the National Institute for Health Research and the European Union. The research concluded that a substantial proportion (at least one-sixth) of the variation in birth weight is down to genetic differences between babies. This is seven to eight times more variation than can be explained by environmental factors already known to influence birthweight, such as the mother smoking during pregnancy or her body mass index (a measure of obesity) before pregnancy starts. Dr Rachel Freathy, a Sir Henry Dale Fellow at the University of Exeter Medical School, who was joint lead author on the study, said:  This study has revealed how the small genetic differences between individuals can collectively have quite large effects on birth weight, and how those same genetic differences are often linked to poor health in later life. Weight at birth is influenced by many factors, including the baby s genes and those of its parents, as well as by the nutrition made available and the environment provided by the mother. We now have a much more detailed view of the ways in which these genetic and environmental elements work together to influence early growth and later disease.  It has been known for some time that babies whose birthweight is well below, or well above, average have a markedly increased risk of diabetes many decades later. Until now, many researchers have assumed that this link reflects the long-term impact of the nutritional environment in which the fetus develops: in other words, that events in early life can  set up  an individual s body in ways that make them more prone to disease in later life. In this new study, the researchers uncovered a substantial overlap in the genetic regions linked to differences in birth weight and those that are connected to a higher risk of developing diabetes or heart disease. Most of this overlap involves the baby s genetic profile, but the team found that the mother s genes also played an important role in influencing her baby s birth weight, most likely through the ways in which they alter the baby s environment during pregnancy. Professor Mark McCarthy at the University of Oxford, and co-lead author, said:  These findings provide vital clues to the some of the processes that act over decades of life to influence an individual s chances of developing diabetes and heart disease. These should highlight new approaches to treatment and prevention. Understanding the contributions of all of these processes will also tell us how much we should expect the many, wonderful improvements in antenatal care to reduce the burden of future diabetes and heart disease . The researchers analysed genetic differences throughout the genomes of nearly 154,000 people from across the world. Around half of these came from the UK Biobank cohort. By matching the genetic profiles of these people to information on birth weight, the researchers could identify sixty regions of the genome that were clearly driving differences in birthweight. They then analysed data from previous studies on conditions including diabetes and heart disease, and found that many of the same genomic regions were implicated. Dr Momoko Horikoshi, from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford, co-lead author on the paper, continued,  Our results point to the key role played by genetic differences in connecting variation in early growth to future risk of disease. Our next steps will be to gather more pieces of the puzzle, including a better understanding of how the genetic profiles of mother and baby act together to modify the baby s weight and later disease risk.  Dr Rob Beaumont, at the University of Exeter Medical School, who worked on the study, said:  This study highlights the value of large-scale international research collaborations. It s really satisfying to bring together a wide range of experts to analyse largescale datasets to advance understanding in key areas of human health.

This collaboration announcement coincides with CIMMYT s 50th anniversary celebrations being held this week in El Bat n, Mexico.  Working together with CIMMYT will enable smallholder farmers to benefit from technology like CRISPR-Cas, helping them solve their challenges,  said DuPont Pioneer President Paul Schickler. Pioneer and CIMMYT collaborations span decades and have contributed significantly to the food security and livelihoods of farmers and consumers in developing countries.  In a world of rapid technology evolution, it s essential that new approaches such as CRISPR-Cas are applied widely to benefit both poorer and wealthier farmers,  said CIMMYT Director General Martin Kropff.  This collaboration with DuPont Pioneer will allow us to provide climate and disease resilient varieties more quickly to smallholder farmers in the developing world.  CRISPR-Cas is an efficient and targeted plant breeding method to develop healthy seeds by using the best native characteristics available within a crop. A range of potential product targets are under consideration by the newly formed Pioneer-CIMMYT Steering Committee. The first project will apply CRISPR-Cas to address maize lethal necrosis disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. First observed in Kenya in 2011, the disease spread to neighboring countries in less than five years and reduces maize production by an average 3 percent in dry areas and 32 percent in wetter environments, with up to 90 percent grain loss on some farms. In Kenya, maize lethal necrosis affects nearly a quarter of the total maize production, with annual losses representing approximately $110 million. Two out of three wheat varieties grown worldwide are either direct releases of CIMMYT lines or are derived from CIMMYT breeding materials by the national agricultural research programs. For maize, work in Sub-Saharan Africa since the mid-1990s by CIMMYT and partners, including local and global seed companies, has led to the development and release of more than 200 drought tolerant varieties that benefit over 5 million households on more than 2.5 million hectares each year.","Published: September 30, 2016"

The research, published today in Genome Biology, also provides further evidence of possible genetic influences on obesity, through heritable bacteria found in the faecal microbiome. Scientists found that participants with a more diverse community of bacteria in their faeces had generally lower levels of visceral fat. Visceral fat is body fat that is stored in the abdominal cavity near a number of important internal organs and is linked with higher risks of metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This type of fat has not previously been linked with the microbiome in humans. The study of 1,313 twins from the TwinsUK cohort used data from stool samples provided by participants as part of their annual sampling to extract DNA information about faecal microbes. Researchers compared this to six measures of obesity, including BMI and upper to lower body fat ratios, but found the strongest links with visceral fat. The findings were validated using BMI as a measure of obesity in a further two population based cohorts and an additional TwinsUK dataset. The study is one of the largest to look at links between the microbiome and obesity and adds to a body of evidence suggesting genetic influences on obesity. Whilst this research highlights genes that are relevant to the association between the microbiome and visceral fat, further research is needed to understand the specific influence of these genes and how this could be harnessed for potential future treatments and interventions. Dr Michelle Beaumont, lead author of the study from the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology at King s said:  This study has shown a clear link between bacterial diversity in faeces and markers of obesity and cardiovascular risk, particularly for visceral fat.  However, as this was an observational study we cannot say precisely how communities of bacteria in the gut might influence the storage of fat in the body, or whether a different mechanism is involved in weight gain.  Senior author, Dr Jordana Bell, from the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, said:  There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that gut bacteria may play a role in obesity, and a number of studies are now exploring this in more detail.  Further scientific investigation is needed to understand how precisely our gut microbes can influence human health, and if interventions such as faecal transplants can have safe, beneficial, and effective impacts on this process . Limitations of the study include the predominantly female TwinsUK cohort, which means that these findings may not be generalisable across genders and globally. The cross-sectional, observational study also did not look at the interaction of the diet with the microbiome and was unable to determine a causal relationship.","Published: September 30, 2016"

Olin Professor of Engineering   have shown they can do something even better: kill cancer cells without attaching a cytotoxic drug. A study led by Michelle Bradbury, director of intraoperative imaging at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and associate professor of radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, and Michael Overholtzer, cell biologist at MSKCC, in collaboration with Wiesner has thrown a surprising twist into the decadelong quest to bring C dots out of the lab and into use as a clinical therapy. Their paper,  Ultrasmall Nanoparticles Induce Ferroptosis of Nutrient-Deprived Cancer Cells and Suppress Tumor Growth,  was published Sept. 26 in Nature Nanotechnology. The work details how C dots, administered in large doses and with the tumors in a state of nutrient deprivation, trigger a type of cell death called ferroptosis.  If you had to design a nanoparticle for killing cancer, this would be exactly the way you would do it,  Wiesner said.  The particle is well tolerated in normally healthy tissue, but as soon as you have a tumor, and under very specific conditions, these particles become killers.   In fact,  Bradbury said,  this is the first time we have shown that the particle has intrinsic therapeutic properties.  Wiesner s fluorescent silica particles, as small as 5 nanometers in diameter, were originally designed to be used as diagnostic tools, attaching to cancer cells and lighting up to show a surgeon where the tumor cells are. Potential uses also included drug delivery and environmental sensing. A first-in-human clinical trial by the Food and Drug Administration, led by Bradbury, deemed the particles safe for humans. In further testing of the particles over the last five years   including the last 13 months as a member of the Centers of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence, a National Cancer Institute initiative established in August 2015   Bradbury, Overholtzer, Wiesner and their collaborators made this major, unexpected finding. When incubated with cancer cells at high doses   and, importantly, with cancer cells in a state of nutrient deprivation   Wiesner s peptide-coated C dots show the ability to adsorb iron from the environment and deliver this into cancer cells. The peptide, called alpha-MSH, was developed by Thomas Quinn, professor of biochemistry at the University of Missouri. This process triggers ferroptosis, a necrotic form of cell death involving plasma membrane rupture   different from the typical cell fragmentation found during a more commonly observed form of cell death called apoptosis.  The original purpose for studying the dots in cells was to see how well larger concentrations would be tolerated without altering cellular function,  Overholtzer said.  While high concentrations were well-tolerated under normal conditions, we wanted to also know how cancer cells under stress might respond.  To the group s surprise, in 24 to 48 hours after the cancer cells were exposed to the dots, there was a  wave of destruction  throughout the entire cell culture, Wiesner said. Tumors also shrank when mice were administered multiple high dose injections without any adverse reactions, said Bradbury, co-director with Wiesner of the MSKCC-Cornell Center for Translation of Cancer Nanomedicines. In the ongoing fight against a disease that kills millions worldwide annually   cancer has taken several in Wiesner s family, making this also a personal crusade for him. Having another weapon can only help, Wiesner said.  We ve found another tool that people have not thought about at all so far,  he said.  This has changed our way of thinking about nanoparticles and what they could potentially do.  Future work will focus on utilizing these particles in combination with other standard therapies for a given tumor type, Bradbury said, with the hope of further enhancing efficacy before testing in humans. Researchers will also look to tailor the particle to target specific cancers.  It s a matter of designing the particles with different attachments on them, so they ll bind to the particular cancer we re after,  Overholtzer said.","Published: September 30, 2016"

Working together with CIMMYT will enable smallholder farmers to benefit from technology like CRISPR-Cas, helping them solve their challenges,  said DuPont Pioneer President Paul Schickler. Pioneer and CIMMYT collaborations span decades and have contributed significantly to the food security and livelihoods of farmers and consumers in developing countries.  In a world of rapid technology evolution, it s essential that new approaches such as CRISPR-Cas are applied widely to benefit both poorer and wealthier farmers,  said CIMMYT Director General Martin Kropff.  This collaboration with DuPont Pioneer will allow us to provide climate and disease resilient varieties more quickly to smallholder farmers in the developing world.  CRISPR-Cas is an efficient and targeted plant breeding method to develop healthy seeds by using the best native characteristics available within a crop. A range of potential product targets are under consideration by the newly formed Pioneer-CIMMYT Steering Committee. The first project will apply CRISPR-Cas to address maize lethal necrosis disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. First observed in Kenya in 2011, the disease spread to neighboring countries in less than five years and reduces maize production by an average 3 percent in dry areas and 32 percent in wetter environments, with up to 90 percent grain loss on some farms. In Kenya, maize lethal necrosis affects nearly a quarter of the total maize production, with annual losses representing approximately $110 million. Two out of three wheat varieties grown worldwide are either direct releases of CIMMYT lines or are derived from CIMMYT breeding materials by the national agricultural research programs. For maize, work in Sub-Saharan Africa since the mid-1990s by CIMMYT and partners, including local and global seed companies, has led to the development and release of more than 200 drought tolerant varieties that benefit over 5 million households on more than 2.5 million hectares each year.","Published: September 30, 2016"

Medications have become an important tool for treating alcohol use disorders, but current medications are not effective for all people with AUDs,  noted NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D.  We re committed to developing new medications to provide effective therapy to a broader spectrum of people with AUDs.  As reported online in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, researchers led by Raye Litten, Ph.D., acting director of the NIAAA Division of Medications Development, conducted a randomized clinical trial of a new compound, called ABT-436, designed to block the effects of vasopressin, a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus of the brain.  Vasopressin helps to regulate the pituitary adrenal axis and other brain circuits involved in emotion,  explained Dr. Litten.  As such, it plays a role in regulating stress, anxiety, and their interaction with AUD.  Dr. Litten, first author Megan Ryan and their NIAAA colleagues worked with NIAAA s multi-center Clinical Investigations Group, to recruit 144 alcohol-dependent adult men and women for the 12-week study. During a 28-day baseline period, female participants consumed at least 28 drinks per week, while male participants consumed at least 35 drinks per week. Participants were then randomized to receive either placebo tablets or ones containing the ABT-436 compound. Researchers monitored participants  alcohol consumption, as well as their mood changes and smoking habits, as these are known to co-vary with alcohol consumption. Researchers found that participants receiving ABT-436 experienced more days of alcohol abstinence than those receiving the placebo. In particular, participants who reported high levels of stress appeared to respond better to ABT-436, in that both the frequency of their drinking and the number of heavy drinking days they experienced decreased.  Our findings suggest that potential future studies with drugs targeting vasopressin blockade should focus on populations of people with AUD who also report high levels of stress,  said first author Ryan, a clinical project manager in the NIAAA Division of Medications Development. Smokers may be another population that could benefit from ABT-436. In addition to its effects on alcohol consumption, study participants receiving the new compound experienced a reduction in smoking. The researchers suspect that ABT-436 might be targeting the same areas in the brain that relate to withdrawal and stress, and, in the process, influencing both tobacco and alcohol use disorders. Additional research is needed to determine if that is the case.","Published: September 30, 2016"

The study, published this week in Nature, describes how the drug Selinexor (KPT-330) killed lung cancer cells and shrank tumors in mice when used against cancers driven by the aggressive and difficult-to-treat KRAS cancer gene. Selinexor is already in clinical trials for treatment of other types of cancer, primarily leukemia and lymphoma but also gynecological, brain, prostate, and head and neck cancers. Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer in the U.S., responsible for more than 158,000 deaths a year, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the KRAS oncogene is believed to be responsible for about 25 percent of all lung cancer cases. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is below 18 percent. Cancers caused by the KRAS mutation have been a target for researchers since the mutation was discovered in humans in 1982. But, due in part to this oncogene s almost impervious spherical shape, no one was able to find an opening for attack, said Dr. Pier Scaglioni, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern and a contributing author to the study. Dr. Michael A. White, Adjunct Professor of Cell Biology and senior author of the study, assembled multiple research teams and used robotic machines to create and sift through trays with thousands of cancer cell/potential drug combinations to uncover the KRAS mutation s weakness. The scientists found that targeting and inactivating the protein XPO1, found in the cell nucleus and used to transport gene products from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, killed most of the KRAS mutant cancer cells.  We found that inhibiting the XPO1 gene kills lung cancer cells that are dependent on KRAS,  Dr. Scaglioni said.  The unexpected coincidence here is that there is an existing drug that will inhibit XPO1.   We know that this drug hits the XPO1 target in people,  added Dr. White, also a research executive at Pfizer Inc.  But we will not know whether the drug will be effective until clinical trials are done, which should be completed in about two years.  Based on the results of this study, Selinexor, developed by Karyopharm Therapeutics, will be the focus of a multicenter lung cancer clinical trial led by UT Southwestern s Dr. David Gerber, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine. That trial is expected to open for enrollment next year. In preclinical results from cancer cells and mouse models in the Nature study, 83 percent of the KRAS mutant lung cancers responded to Selinexor. The study found the remaining 17 percent of lung cancers could be killed by adding a second drug to inhibit YAP1, a gene known to be involved in the promotion of several other cancers. Here too, there was an existing drug, Verteporfin, which appeared to be effective in blocking YAP1. Verteporfin is currently used to treat blood vessel disorders in the eye. Dr. Jimi Kim, a former graduate student in Cancer Biology, was lead author of the study. Other UT Southwestern authors included: graduate student Elizabeth McMillan, research scientist Saurabh Mendiratta, and former researcher Gurbani Makkar, all in Cell Biology; Niranjan Venkateswaran, research associate in Internal Medicine; Shuguang Wei, senior research scientist in Biochemistry; Dr. Bruce Posner, Professor of Biochemistry; Dr. Michael Roth, Professor of Biochemistry and holder of the Diane and Hal Brierley Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Research; Dr. Robin Frink, postdoctoral researcher; Dr. Boning Gao, Assistant Professor in the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research and of Pharmacology; and Dr. John Minna, Professor in the Hamon Center and of Pharmacology and Internal Medicine, who holds the Sarah M. and Charles E.

The findings indicate that chemicals especially psychoactive drugs need to be assessed quite differently with waterborne exposure than, for example, when pharmaceutical substances are tested in mice. In particular, the uptake mechanisms and effects of cocaine in fish cannot simply be transferred to mammals or humans. See Also: Researchers find BPA and BPS affect embryonic brain development in zebrafishZebrafish larvae a few days old are frequently used in toxicology tests e.g. to study the behavioral effects of drugs in order to avoid experiments in mammals. Taking the example of cocaine, researchers at Eawag, together with colleagues at Zurich University, have now shown that the uptake and distribution patterns and the effects of the drug in zebrafish differ in many ways from those in mammals. In their study, a complex imaging method (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging, or MALDI MSI was used for the first time to determine where cocaine accumulates in zebrafish. After being exposed to a defined concentration of the drug for eight hours, the larvae were euthanized and frozen. Tissue samples a few micrometres thick were then imaged by laser scanning. Learn More: New evidence in mice that cocaine makes brain cells cannibalize themselvesThe images show that the greatest accumulation of cocaine is to be found, not in the brain, but in the eyes, where concentrations over 1500 mg/kg were measured compared to around 300-400 mg/kg in the trunk and brain. This finding is striking: while increased concentrations have been observed in the head region in other fish studies, the highest concentrations were assumed (without more precise measurements) to occur in the brain. In addition, compared to mammals, these levels are very high: in mice, concentrations 100 times lower are generally lethal, and in humans, 1000 times lower. Environmental toxicologist Kristin Schirmer, who co-led the project with Thomas Kraemer of the Zurich Institute of Forensic Medicine, cannot yet fully explain their findings. It is, however, clear that cocaine is taken up rapidly and continuously by zebrafish larvae, which at this early stage have not yet a fully developed blood-brain barrier. Schirmer and her team found other major differences between the fish tests and the patterns observed in mammals: while cocaine has a stimulatory action and causes hyperactivity in mammals, it suppresses locomotor activity in zebrafish. The effects of cocaine on peripheral nerves due to rapid uptake through the skin and gills thus appear to override any potential effects on the brain. In contrast to mammals, the elimination process is delayed as a result of the accumulation of cocaine in zebrafish eyes: 50% of the cocaine was eliminated after eight hours in clean water, and 30% still remained after 48 hours. Read Next: Protective strategy against pesticide-linked Parkinson's disease discovered According to Kristin Schirmer, the study shows that fish tests need to be further refined if the results are to be transferable to mammals, or if they are to be used for water quality assessment: ""If we want to have a better knowledge of the effects of such chemicals on the ecosystem, we need a more detailed understanding of the processes of uptake through water they're quite different from when drugs are inhaled or injected.""

Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect for women on antidepressants, but a new article by the Women's Health Clinic and Department of Psychiatry and Psychology at Mayo Clinic, in collaboration with Tierney Lorenz, PhD, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, shows promise for targeting and treating antidepressant-induced female sexual dysfunction. See Also: Is sufficient sleep the key to successful antidepressant response?The paper, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, discusses treatment options and the research backing them for women who face sexual dysfunction while on antidepressants. Stephanie Faubion, MD, director of the Office of Women's Health, of Mayo Clinic, and Jordan Rullo, PhD, LP, report that the onset of sexual side effects develops within one to three weeks of beginning an antidepressant regimen. However, the benefits of the antidepressants themselves do not appear until approximately two to four weeks into treatment, which may cause women to lose interest in a medication that may seem to do more harm than good. The change in neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, introduced by antidepressants may be the most likely reason behind female sexual dysfunction, according to the paper, but symptoms of sexual dysfunction prior to beginning antidepressants may signal another culprit. ""Depression is a significant risk factor for sexual dysfunction and vice versa,"" says Dr. Rullo. ""It is critical as a provider to assess a patient's sexual function before and after she starts an antidepressant. This will help you determine if her sexual function concerns are due to depression or due to the side effect of the antidepressant, or perhaps both. The simplest assessment question is, 'Do you have any sexual health concerns?' and that should be asked during each subsequent visit."" One study included in the article found that 15 percent of women stopped taking their prescribed antidepressant after experiencing sexual dysfunction, and half of those women did not discuss the concern with their doctor. ""There are several approaches that make sexual dysfunction fairly treatable,"" says Dr. Rullo. ""By communicating with your provider about your symptoms and discussing treatment options, you lessen that chance of disrupting your antidepressant regimen due to unpleasant side effects."" Read Next: A fast-acting antidepressant appears within reach The paper includes treatment options from behavioral and pharmacologic approaches, including exercise, scheduling sexual activity and adjustment of medication dosage. The first step in selecting the appropriate treatment protocol, according to the article, is to identify the domain in which the sexual dysfunction falls, which can include low desire, low arousal and orgasm dysfunction.

Although we know that adult hypertension can affect the brain, little research has been done on the cognitive effects of childhood hypertension. In a new study in The Journal of Pediatrics, researchers found that hypertension is associated with cognitive issues in children and adolescents.

Children who had other factors that are known to affect cognitive skills were excluded from the study (e.g., ADHD, learning disabilities, sleep disorders). According to Dr. Lande, ""We wanted to make sure that if we found differences between children with and without hypertension, it was likely associated with the hypertension itself, not any of these other factors."" The researchers found that the children with hypertension performed worse on the cognitive tests that measured visual and verbal memory, processing speed, and verbal skills. Additionally, more children with sleep issues had hypertension, which intensified the effect of poor sleep on cognition and executive function. It is important to note that the differences between groups were small and that the average cognitive test scores of both groups were largely within normal ranges. The children with hypertension were not cognitively impaired, but rather performing less well than children without hypertension. Don't Miss: Blood pressure medicine may improve conversational skills of individuals with autism Overall, this study provides evidence that hypertension in children is associated with a subtle pattern of decreased performance on cognitive testing.

And the reason may be its knack for sleuthing. Researchers at the University of Iowa (UI) have found that the gut may be key to preventing Parkinson's disease. Cells located in the intestine spark an immune response that protects neurons against damage connected with Parkinson's disease. Acting like detectives, the immune intestinal cells identify damaged machinery within neurons and discard the defective parts. That action ultimately preserves neurons whose impairment or death is known to cause Parkinson's. See Also: Antioxidant molecule could improve Parkinson's""We think somehow the gut is protecting neurons,"" says Veena Prahlad, assistant professor in biology at UI and corresponding author on the paper published in the journal Cell Reports. Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that erodes motor control and balance over time. It affects some 500,000 people in the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The disease occurs when neurons in the brain that control movement become impaired or die. Normally, these neurons produce dopamine, and when they are damaged or killed, the resulting dopamine shortage causes the motor-control problems associated with the disease. Scientists have previously linked Parkinson's to defects in mitochondria, the energy-producing machinery found in every human cell. Why and how mitochondrial defects effect neurons remain a mystery. Some think the impaired mitochondria starve neurons of energy; others believe they produce a neuron-harming molecule. Whatever the answer, damaged mitochondria have been linked to other nervous disorders as well, including ALS and Alzheimer's, and researchers want to understand why. Learn More: Mobilizing mitochondria may be key to regenerating damaged neuronsPrahlad's team exposed roundworms to a poison called rotenone, which researchers know kills neurons whose death is linked to Parkinson's. As expected, the rotenone began damaging the mitochondria in the worms' neurons. To the researchers' surprise, though, the damaged mitochondria did not kill all of the worms' dopamine-producing neurons; in fact, over a series of trials, an average of only seven percent of the worms, roughly 210 out of 3,000, lost dopamine-producing neurons when given the poison. ""That seemed intriguing, and we wondered whether there was some innate mechanism to protect the animal from the rotenone,"" Prahlad says. It turns out there was. The roundworms' immune defenses, activated when the rotenone was introduced, discarded many of the defected mitochondria, halting a sequence that would've led to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Importantly, the immune response originated in the intestine, not the nervous system. ""If we can understand how this is done in the roundworm, we can understand how this may happen in mammals,"" Prahlad says. The researchers plan to con duct more experiments, but they've got some interesting hypotheses. One is the intestinal immune cells are, according to Prahlad, ""constantly surveilling mitochondria for defects."". Read Next: Getting rid of old mitochondria: Some neurons turn to neighbors to help take out the trash Even more, those cellular watchdogs may be keeping their eyes on the mitochondria ""because they don't trust them,"" Prahlad suggests. The reason has to do with the prevailing theory that mitochondria originated independently as a type of bacterium and were only later incorporated into the cells of animal, plants, and fungi as an energy producer. If that theory is correct, the intestinal immune responders may be especially sensitive to changes in mitochondrial function not only for its potential damaging effects, but because of the mitochondria's ancient and foreign past as well. ""How it's happening is suggestive of the possibility that the innate immune response is constantly checking its mitochondria,"" Prahlad says, ""perhaps because of the bacterial origin of the mitochondria.""

The study, recently published in Frontiers in Psychiatry, found that smoking a nicotine cigarette but believing that it lacked nicotine failed to satisfy cravings related to nicotine addiction.

Brown adipose tissue: more than burning calories in the body Brown adipose tissue (BAT) helps  burning more calories  and making body heat out of fat. According to the new study, this special kind of fat  the motor of thermogenesis- has an endocrine function able to activate the lipid and glucidic metabolism in the body, which has a profile for a future therapeutic target to treat pathologies like obesity.  Traditionally, brown adipose tissue was just seen as an organ to burn calories, but we have seen it has an endocrine biological role , said Professor Francesc Villarroya, member of the Institute of Biomedicine of the University of Barcelona (IBUB) and head of the Research Group in Genetics and Molecular Biology of Mitochondrial Proteins and Associated Diseases.  New perspectives in the physiology of brown adipose tissue This new vision on the brown adipose tissue means a revolution similar to the one from years ago with white adipose tissue (WAT), the most known fat.  Until the eighties  says Villarroya- people believed WAT was a mere fat storage. From the nineties on, after discovering leptin as a hormonal factor released by WAT, other adipokines were found (active factors synthesized by this organ) . Therefore, WAT is now understood as an endocrine organ and now, with BAT, the same process is going on. According to the experts, when there is a situation of BAT activation and there is a high oxidation in metabolism products to generate heat, this organ would also send a series of biochemical signals to the entire organism to activate the global oxidizing metabolism. Identifying the released factors  called batokines- is the main challenge of the researchers, apart from discovering how the target organs act, or if there are other secretory tissues, etc. The most known factors are FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21), neuregulin 4 and IL-6, among other compounds that are the focus of an intense research activity.  White adipose tissue, liver, heart, and probably pancreas and brain (counting the regulation points of feelings of hunger and thirst) are some of the target organs of the batokines , says Villarroya.  We also know that some of the factors released by WAT, such as FGF21, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and act on brain areas  he said. From basic research to human physiology BAT secretory function as an endocrine organ has been studied through laboratory animal models and in vitro cell culture. In studies with animal models, there were improvements in the diabetes course  and even obesity- in mice transferred with small samples of brown adipose tissue. According to the experts, the transferred BAT would release factors that promote glucose consume and sensitivity to insulin (in general, a healthier metabolic profile).  In human physiology  says Villarroya- it is essential to define if all batokines that are identified in animal models are also present in human BAT and behave the same way. In a future, these batokines could be considered as potential candidates in drug design to treat these diseases. In the case of obese patients with few active BAT  and probably less released batokines- a first therapeutic strategy could be to give them these molecules as drugs . However, moving this basic research to the clinical field is a hard challenge, for several reasons but also for the hard availability of samples through human biopsies. For this reason, among other strategies, the team of Dr. Villarroya is developing in vitro human cells of brown adipose humans in population that allow verifying in human physiology the obtained results in mice.","Published: September 29, 2016"

A new international study suggests that the answer lies in our DNA. UCLA geneticist Steve Horvath led a team of 65 scientists in seven countries to record age-related changes to human DNA, calculate the biological age of blood and estimate a person s lifespan. A higher biological age   regardless of chronological age   consistently predicted an earlier death. The findings are published in today s edition of the journal Aging.  Our research reveals valuable clues into what causes human aging, marking a first step toward developing targeted methods to slow the process,  said Horvath, the principal investigator and a professor of human genetics and biostatistics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and Fielding School of Public Health. Drawing on 13 sets of data, including the landmark Framingham Heart Study and Women s Health Initiative, a consortium of 25 institutions analyzed the DNA in blood samples collected from more than 13,000 people in the United States and Europe. Applying a variety of molecular methods, including an epigenetic clock developed by Horvath in 2013, the scientists measured the aging rates of each individual. The clock calculates the aging of blood and other tissues by tracking methylation, a natural process that chemically alters DNA over time. By comparing chronological age to the blood s biological age, the scientists used the clock to predict each person s life expectancy.  Our findings show that the epigenetic clock was able to predict the lifespans of Caucasians, Hispanics and African-Americans in these cohorts, even after adjusting for traditional risk factors like age, gender, smoking, body-mass index and disease history,  said Brian Chen, the study s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Aging.  The group s findings don t bode well for everyone.  We discovered that 5 percent of the population ages at a faster biological rate, resulting in a shorter life expectancy,  Horvath said.  Accelerated aging increases these adults  risk of death by 50 percent at any age.  For example, two 60-year-old men both smoke to deal with high stress. The first man s epigenetic aging rate ranks in the top 5 percent, while the second s aging rate is average. The likelihood of the first man dying within the next 10 years is 75 percent compared to 60 percent for the second. The preliminary finding may explain why some individuals die young   even when they follow a nutritious diet, exercise regularly, drink in moderation and don t smoke.  While a healthful lifestyle may help extend life expectancy, our innate aging process prevents us from cheating death forever,  Horvath emphasized.  Yet risk factors like smoking, diabetes and high blood pressure still predict mortality more strongly than one s epigenetic aging rate.  Scientists have long searched to identify biomarkers for biological age, according to coauthor Dr. Douglas Kiel, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a senior scientist for the Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife.  In geriatric medicine, we are always struck by the difference between our patients  chronological age and how old they appear physiologically,  Kiel said.  This study validates the use of DNA methylation as a biomarker for biological age. And if we can prove that DNA methylation accelerates aging, we can devise strategies to slow the rate and maximize a person s years of good health.  The precise role of epigenetic changes in aging and death, however, remains unknown, said coauthor Dr. Themistocles Assimes, an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.  Do the epigenetic changes associated with chronological aging directly cause death in older people?  Assimes said.  Perhaps they merely enhance the development of certain diseases   or cripple one s ability to resist the progression of disease after it has taken root. Future research is needed to address these questions.  Larger studies focused only on cases with well-documented causes of death will help scientists tease out the relationship between epigenetic age and specific diseases, he added. By 2017, according to the World Health Organization, the number of people worldwide over age 65 will outnumber those under age 5 for the first time in recorded history. By 2050, the proportion of the global population over 60 will double from 11 to 22 percent. Many countries will be ill-prepared to keep pace with the high costs associated with disease and disability as more people live longer, Horvath said.  We must find interventions that prolong healthy living by five to 20 years. We don t have time, however, to follow a person for decades to test whether a new drug works.  Horvath said.  The epigenetic clock would allow scientists to quickly evaluate the effect of anti-aging therapies in only three years. ","Published: September 29, 2016"

This hyperelastic  bone  material, whose shape can be easily customized, one day could be especially useful for the treatment of bone defects in children. Bone implantation surgery is never an easy process, but it is particularly painful and complicated for children. With both adults and children, often times bone is harvested from elsewhere in the body to replace the missing bone, which can lead to other complications and pain. Metallic implants are sometimes used, but this is not a permanent fix for growing children.  Adults have more options when it comes to implants,  said Ramille N. Shah, who led the research.  Pediatric patients do not. If you give them a permanent implant, you have to do more surgeries in the future as they grow. They might face years of difficulty.  Shah and her team aim to change the nature of bone implants, and they particularly want to help pediatric patients. Shah is an assistant professor of materials science and engineering in Northwestern s McCormick School of Engineering and of surgery in the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  The new study, evaluating the material with human stem cells and within animal models, was published online September 28 by the journal Science Translational Medicine. Adam E. Jakus, a postdoctoral fellow in Shah s laboratory, is the paper s first author. Shah s 3-D printed biomaterial is a mix of hydroxyapatite (a calcium mineral found naturally in human bone) and a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer that is used in many medical applications, including sutures. Shah s hyperelastic  bone  material shows great promise in in vivo animal models; this success lies in the printed structure s unique properties. It s majority hydroxyapatite yet hyperelastic, robust and porous at the nano, micro and macro levels.  Porosity is huge when it comes to tissue regeneration, because you want cells and blood vessels to infiltrate the scaffold,  Shah said.  Our 3-D structure has different levels of porosity that is advantageous for its physical and biological properties.  While hydroxyapatite has been proven to induce bone regeneration, it is also notoriously tricky to work with. Clinical products that use hydroxyapatite or other calcium phosphate ceramics are hard and brittle. To compensate for that, previous researchers created structures composed mostly of polymers, but this shields the activity of the bioceramic. Shah s bone biomaterial, however, is 90 percent by weight percent hydroxyapatite and just 10 percent by weight percent polymer and still maintains its elasticity because of the way its structure is designed and printed. The high concentration of hydroxyapatite creates an environment that induces rapid bone regeneration.  Cells can sense the hydroxyapatite and respond to its bioactivity,  Shah said.  When you put stem cells on our scaffolds, they turn into bone cells and start to up-regulate their expression of bone specific genes. This is in the absence of any other osteo-inducing substances. It s just the interaction between the cells and the material itself.  That s not to say that other substances couldn t be combined into the ink. Because the 3-D printing process is performed at room temperature, Shah s team was able to incorporate other elements, such as antibiotics, into the ink.  We can incorporate antibiotics to reduce the possibility of infection after surgery,  Shah said.  We also can combine the ink with different types of growth factors, if needed, to further enhance regeneration. It s really a multi-functional material.  One of the biggest advantages, however, is that the end product can be customized to the patient. In traditional bone transplant surgeries, the bone -- after it s taken from another part of the body -- has to be shaped and molded to exactly fit the area where it is needed. Physicians would be able to scan the patient s body and 3-D print a personalized product using Shah s synthetic material. Alternatively, due to its mechanical properties, the biomaterial can also be easily trimmed and cut to size and shape during a procedure. Not only is this faster, but also less painful compared to using autograft material. Shah imagines that hospitals may one day have 3-D printers, where they can print customized implants while the patient waits.  The turnaround time for an implant that s specialized for a customer could be within 24 hours,  Shah said.  That could change the world of craniofacial and orthopaedic surgery, and, I hope, will improve patient outcomes. ","Published: September 29, 2016"

Human hormones include testosterone, insulin and the aptly named growth hormone. Plant hormones are an entirely different set of chemical messengers, which modulate activities such as stem growth, leaf and flower production, root patterning and coping with environmental disruption. These are just the sorts of tasks that plant biologists seek to understand with precision as the pressure increases to feed a growing population amid unchecked climate change. But hormones in plants affect such a wide variety of genes and plant activities that the fine details of hormone responses are   at best   murky. Researchers at the University of Washington have developed a novel toolkit based on modified yeast cells to tease out how plant genes and proteins respond to auxin, the most ubiquitous plant hormone. Their system, described in a paper published Sept. 19 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, allowed them to decode auxin s basic effects on the diverse family of genes that plants utilize to detect and interpret auxin-driven messages.  Auxin has different messages in different contexts,  said senior author and UW biology professor Jennifer Nemhauser.  One cell responds to auxin one way, while its neighbor does the exact opposite   two different responses from the same chemical. What inside these cells is happening to deliver opposite messages?  As the most widespread plant hormone, auxin affects nearly every aspect of plant biology, including growth, development and stress response. Biologists have long known that auxin acts on stretches of DNA, called promoters, to turn nearby genes on or off. But auxin doesn t simply turn all nearby genes on or off. With auxin, some genes turn on, others are switched off and even more nuanced responses are possible. Plant proteins mediate these varied responses by binding to auxin and then to promoters. Some proteins decrease gene expression, while others do the opposite.  There is a large amount of cross-communication between proteins, and plants have a huge number of genes that are targets for auxin,  said Nemhauser.  That makes it incredibly difficult to decipher the basic auxin  code  in plant cells.  So Nemhauser s team switched from plant cells to budding yeast   a single-celled fungus and popular laboratory tool. The researchers engineered yeast cells to express proteins that responded to auxin, so they could measure how auxin modified the on/off state of key plant genes that they also inserted into the cells. In essence, they jury-rigged yeast to respond to auxin. To Nemhauser, this was a simple shift in approach with a potentially huge payoff.  We changed the perspective of this problem,  said Nemhauser.  By taking the question of auxin response out of plants and reconstructing it   piece by piece   in yeast, we were able to find out the parts that matter most.  Nemhauser s team could introduce different auxin-response proteins into the modified yeast cells, each time measuring how they modified gene expression in the presence of auxin. Their experiments revealed the basic  code  of auxin signaling   how specific combinations of repressing or activating proteins can bind to auxin, DNA and one another to affect cellular behavior. For example, their yeast experiments show that the gene-activating protein ARF19 must bind to an identical protein to fully switch on genes. On the other hand, many gene-silencing proteins don t need a partner to switch off genes. These and other simple rules were only shown clearly in the yeast system developed by Nemhauser s team. They shed light on the complex interplay within cells that produces clear auxin-mediated messages.  These are a complicated combination of factors within cells that, when interpreted through this interplay, yield sophisticated output signals   like  Should this plant invest energy into making leaves or roots?'  said Nemhauser.  And it all begins with this complex dance between auxin and auxin-responding proteins.  Nemhauser hopes this yeast-based tool, which she developed with UW electrical engineering professor Eric Klavins, will reveal more details of auxin s actions in plant cells. And she hopes that knowledge will empower both farmers and plant geneticists in their quest to increase crop yields and resilience in the face of droughts and climate change.  These tools could do so much, because biological systems are more complex than anything we could engineer,  said Nemhauser.  And with the right tools and knowledge of these hormone-signaling pathways, we will know exactly which changes   minimal and targeted   will produce desired traits in crops.

The results, described September 22 in Cell, open the door to the development of new medicines.  Not only does this compound efficiently inhibit the growth of yeast cells, it does so through a unique mechanism. No drug currently on the market interferes with ribosomal assembly,  says senior author Tarun Kapoor, Pels Family Professor and head of the Selma and Lawrence Ruben Laboratory of Chemistry and Cell Biology.  We believe this compound may be a catalyst for the development of new fungi-fighting medications. This is an exciting prospect: No antifungals with new mechanisms of action have been approved for the past several years,  he added. Every minute, a growing cell can generate about 2,000 nano-scale factories whose job is to translate genetic sequence into protein. Made of protein as well as RNA, the ribosome is put together by more than 200 worker proteins. Scientists still don t fully understand how this carefully orchestrated construction takes place. The new compound, Rbin-1, emerged from a project undertaken by co-first author Shigehiro A. Kawashima, then a postdoc in the lab and now a researcher at The University of Tokyo. Using a sophisticated chemical and genetic screening process that tested more than 10,000 compounds, Kawashima found one, Rbin-1, that appeared to selectively target an enzyme known to be involved in ribosome assembly. To figure out how Rbin-1 achieved its effect in yeast, Zhen Chen, the other co-first author and a graduate student in the lab, purified the enzyme, called Mdn1. It was a challenging endeavor partly because of the sheer size of the enzyme, which is one of the largest proteins yeast make. Rbin-1 is not the first compound discovered that can be used to thwart ribosomal assembly, but it s the first molecule of its kind that might provide a starting point to develop a drug. Unlike other ribosome assembly inhibitors, it is potent, affects only a particular target, and has drug-like chemical properties. Rbin-1 will also be a valuable tool to decipher the fundamental cellular process by which ribosomes are assembled, the researchers say.","Published: September 29, 2016"

A team led by researchers from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and Tufts University School of Medicine found that between 1991 and 2006, more than 617,000 hospitalizations related to three common plumbing pathogens resulted in around $9 billion in Medicare payments an average of $600 million a year. The costs may now exceed $2 billion for 80,000 cases per year, write the study authors. Antibiotic resistance, which can be exacerbated by aging public water infrastructure, was present in between one and two percent of hospitalizations and increased the cost per case by between 10 to 40 percent.  Premise plumbing pathogens can be found in drinking water, showers, hot tubs, medical instruments, kitchens, swimming pools almost any premise where people use public water. The observed upward trend in associated infections is likely to continue, and aging water distribution systems might soon be an additional reservoir of costly multidrug resistance,  said lead study author Elena Naumova, Ph.D., professor at the Friedman School and Director of the Initiative for the Forecasting and Modeling of Infectious Disease at Tufts University.  This is a clear call for deepened dialogue between researchers, government agencies, citizens, and policy makers, so that we can improve data sharing and find sustainable solutions to reduce the public health risks posed by these bacteria.  The study was published online in the Journal of Public Health Policy on Sept. 12. State and federal oversight has ensured generally safe and good quality public drinking water in the U.S. However, premise plumbing systems the pipes and fixtures in homes and buildings that transport water after delivery by public water utilities are largely unregulated, which can lead to inconsistent monitoring and reporting of potentially harmful deficiencies. This is highlighted by the ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan, where a water source change, aging pipes, and lack of corrosion control not only exposed thousands of children to elevated lead levels in drinking water, but is also thought to have triggered an outbreak of Legionnaire s disease that led to 10 deaths. Opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens, such as the bacteria that causes Legionnaire s disease, Legionella pneumophila, can thrive in low-nutrient conditions and grow as biofilms on the inner surfaces of pipes. Biofilms allow these pathogens to resist disinfectants and environmental stressors, and aid in the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulent genes. As water distribution systems age, their susceptibility to contamination increases. However, few large-scale studies have examined the economic and public health burden of these bacteria. To investigate, Naumova and her colleagues analyzed 100 million medical claims from 1991 through 2006 from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which provides exhaustive coverage of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. The team focused on hospitalizations related to three opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens: Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can cause a range of serious respiratory, systemic, or localized infections, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly or immunocompromised individuals.  Based on clinical diagnostic codes, reported cases for all three infections totaled 617,291, with the majority due to pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas and related bacteria (560,504). Legionnaire s disease and Mycobacteria infections accounted for 7,933 and 48,854 cases respectively. On average, each hospitalization represented $45,840 in Medicare charges and $14,920 in payments. Antibiotic resistance, recorded in a little fewer than two percent of cases, increased the average costs to $60,870 in Medicare charges and $16,690 in payments per case. Over the past decade, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a substantial increase in incidence of opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens, with Pseudomonas alone accounting for 51,000 hospitalizations per year with more than 6,000 multi-drug resistant infections in 2011. The annual costs for these pathogens may now exceed a total of $2 billion for more than 80,000 cases per year, as increased antibiotic resistance leads to greater hospital charges, longer lengths of stay, and increased risk of complications. Antibiotic resistance is likely underreported, and this number is a conservative estimate for the Medicare population based on the study findings and reported data on hospitalization costs per case, says Naumova.  While public drinking water is safe, it is clearly more safe if you are healthy than if you have medical conditions that enhance your vulnerability to infections. The risk of becoming ill from drinking water is much less than the risk of becoming ill from food, but it is not zero,  said last author Jeffrey K. Griffiths, M.D., professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. Griffiths is also former chair of the Drinking Water Committee for the US Environmental Protection Agency s Science Advisory Board.  These infections can cause a lot of illness and cost us a lot of money, and targeted disinfection of premise piping could save us from these consequences.  The authors caution that their data cannot draw conclusions about the percentage of infections directly caused by contaminated water. The link between aging water distribution systems and drug resistance is highly plausible, but has yet to be firmly established, say the authors. However, this study highlights the need for improved surveillance systems and targeted investigations of water-related outbreaks in order to determine the direct link between water contamination and drug-resistant infection. A 2010 report from the national Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System, a partnership between the Centers for Disease Control, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, urged serious attention to be paid to the growing proportion of outbreaks associated with premise plumbing deficiencies in public water systems. However, budgets for state and federal water regulators have decreased. In 2013, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported that ""federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,"" with ""serious implications for states  ability to protect public health.   The Flint Water Crisis revealed many unsolved social, environmental, and public health problems for US drinking water,  Naumova said.  Unfortunately, water testing for pathogens is not done routinely; furthermore, most water tests are not accessible, are too complicated, or are too costly. Well-controlled, experimental studies of the influence of microbial ecology, disinfectant type, pipe materials, and water age, on opportunistic pathogen occurrence and persistence are needed in order to establish their relationships to drug resistance.

The system is based on levels of enzymes called proteases, which cancer cells use to remodel their surroundings. Once adapted for humans, this type of sensor could be used to determine how aggressive a tumor is and help doctors choose the best treatment, says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.  This approach is exciting because people are developing therapies that are protease-activated,  Bhatia says.  Ideally you d like to be able to stratify patients based on their protease activity and identify which ones would be good candidates for these therapies.  Once injected into the tumor site, the nanosensors are activated by a magnetic field that is harmless to healthy tissue. After interacting with and being modified by the target tumor proteins, the sensors are secreted in the urine, where they can be easily detected in less than an hour. Bhatia and Polina Anikeeva, the Class of 1942 Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, are the senior authors of the paper, which appears in the journal Nano Letters. The paper s lead authors are Koch Institute postdoc Simone Schurle and graduate student Jaideep Dudani. Heat and release Tumors, especially aggressive ones, often have elevated protease levels. These enzymes help tumors spread by cleaving proteins that compose the extracellular matrix, which normally surrounds cells and holds them in place. In 2014, Bhatia and colleagues reported using nanoparticles that interact with a type of protease known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to diagnose cancer. In that study, the researchers delivered nanoparticles carrying peptides, or short protein fragments, designed to be cleaved by the MMPs. If MMPs were present, hundreds of cleaved peptides would be excreted in the urine, where they could be detected with a simple paper test similar to a pregnancy test. In the new study, the researchers wanted to adapt the sensors so that they could report on the traits of tumors in a known location. To do that, they needed to ensure that the sensors were only producing a signal from the target organ, unaffected by background signals that might be produced in the bloodstream. They first designed sensors that could be activated with light once they reached their target. That required the use of ultraviolet light, however, which doesn t penetrate very far into tissue.  We started thinking about what kinds of energy we might use that could penetrate further into the body,  says Bhatia, who is also a member of MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. To achieve that, Bhatia teamed up with Anikeeva, who specializes in using magnetic fields to remotely activate materials. The researchers decided to encapsulate Bhatia s protease-sensing nanoparticles along with magnetic particles that heat up when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. The field is produced by a small magnetic coil that changes polarity some half million times per second. The heat-sensitive material that encapsulates the particles disintegrates as the magnetic particles heat up, allowing the protease sensors to be released. However, the particles do not produce enough heat to damage nearby tissue. Choosing treatments In a study of mice, the researchers showed that they could use these particles to correctly profile different types of colon tumors based on how much protease they produce. Cancer treatments based on proteases, now in clinical trials, consist of antibodies that target a tumor protein but have  veils  that prevent them from being activated before reaching the tumor. The veils are cleaved by proteases, so this therapy would be most effective for patients with high protease levels. The MIT team is also exploring using this type of sensor to image cancerous lesions that spread to the liver from other organs. Surgically removing such lesions works best if there are fewer than four, so measuring them could help doctors choose the best treatment. Bhatia says this type of sensor could be adapted to other tumors as well, because the magnetic field can penetrate deep into the body. This approach could also be expanded to make diagnoses based on detecting other kinds of enzymes, including those that cut sugar chains or lipids.","Published: September 29, 2016"

ViraTherapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic virus therapies, has developed its novel technology with joint support from its lead investors EMBL Ventures and Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund (BIVF) and will now be responsible for preclinical and clinical testing of VSV-GP in Phase I trials. Under the terms of the collaboration, Boehringer Ingelheim receives the right to acquire ViraTherapeutics after conclusion of Phase I clinical development.   We are very excited about this new collaboration with ViraTherapeutics, a company for which the Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund is a core investor,  said Dr. Michel Pairet, member of Boehringer Ingelheim s Board of Managing Directors responsible for Innovation.  Oncolytic viruses are among the most promising new therapy approaches in cancer research and the technology developed by ViraTherapeutics may offer significant advantages compared to others currently under development. The new collaboration is an example of Boehringer Ingelheim s increasing focus on partnering and further complements the company s growing immune-oncology pipeline that includes among others, a therapeutic cancer vaccine and next generation checkpoint inhibitors.  Oncolytic virus therapy is a cancer treatment approach that uses a virus that infects and breaks down cancer cells. Tumor antigens that are normally hidden from the immune system inside the cells are released, triggering an immune response to fight the tumor. VSV-GP has a shorter replication time than other oncolytic virus platforms currently under development. This oncolytic virus does not integrate in the DNA and has been modified to avoid neural inflammation associated with wild type viruses. In VSV-GP the glycoprotein of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus has been replaced by the glycoprotein of the Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) to conceal the virus from the immune system. In preclinical models it did not induce virus neutralizing antibodies, potentially enabling repeated administration.   This is an important milestone for the development of ViraTherapeutics. The team has worked hard on our technology platform and lead candidate. In addition to its oncolytic activity, VSV-GP has demonstrated the ability to prime and boost an anti-cancer immune response and does not appear to prompt effective antiviral immune responses. These properties are expected to allow ground-breaking applications of this novel treatment approach. In the collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim we can now fully explore the platform and therapeutic potential of our VSV-GP oncolytic virus,  said Prof. Dr. Dorothee von Laer, scientific founder 2 and CEO of ViraTherapeutics.  We will also continue to investigate VSV-GPs potential to be armed with therapeutic genes as well as antigens for its use as a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine vector.  Boehringer Ingelheim is combining a focus on cutting-edge science with a long-term view enabling the company to create a stable environment for the development of the next generation of medical breakthroughs. This new project adds another building block in this long-term strategy to improve the lives of patients with high unmet medical needs.  ","Published: September 29, 2016"

Under-expression of a few of them stunted brain development in model systems in this largest study of its kind. The study is the first from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), a public-private psychiatric research data source co-founded and co-funded by NIMH.  The collaboration involving pharmaceutical companies, brain banks, a foundation, and universities brought to bear the largest collection of schizophrenia postmortem brain tissue ever assembled to boost statistical power and the odds of detecting weak genetic signals. Schizophrenia, which affects nearly one percent of the population, is known to be as much as 80-90 percent heritable, but little is known about its underlying illness processes. Genome-wide studies based on blood samples have linked genetic variation at more than 100 chromosomal sites to the illness, yet each of these confers only a small effect on risk, leaving much of schizophrenia still a mystery.  As we move from gene discovery - which for risk genes can be done in any tissue   to the human brain, we are able to explore changes in the molecular machinery of the cell, such as gene expression and epigenetic mechanisms, that are impacted by these genetic risk factors,  explained Thomas Lehner, Ph.D., director of the NIMH Office of Genomics Research Coordination, which helped to build the Consortium and fund the project. A team of 56 researchers, supported by 15 NIMH grants, report on their findings September 26, 2016 in the journal Nature Neuroscience. Their study characterized genome-wide genetic variation and sequenced an indicator of gene expression, RNA , from a schizophrenia-implicated area of the brain s executive hub, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in postmortem tissue from 258 people who had schizophrenia and 279 controls. This sample dwarfed those of earlier such studies based on postmortem tissue. Out of 108 genome sites earlier linked to the illness   schizophrenia s  skyline  of risk loci   genetic variation at 20 sites was found to potentially regulate the expression of genes.  Of those 20, five gene variants were each found to alter expression of only one gene. Experimental manipulation of three of those five genes altered brain development in model systems. For example, depleting a protein called furin stunted head growth in zebrafish by nearly a fourth. Knocking down the FURIN gene decreased migration of human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells in culture   perhaps suggesting a possible mechanism by which schizophrenia might disrupt the developing brain. The study also found  subtle but broad disruption in transcription  of genes in schizophrenia, which the researchers say is consistent with the prevailing model of many genes contributing to risk. They also identified a sub-network of about 1,400 genes   including many in genomic sites linked to the illness   coding for components involved in communications between neurons that are  significantly perturbed  in schizophrenia. Since its sample size was about 10-fold larger than any previous study of its kind, the new study s much higher statistical power raises questions about some earlier findings. It suggests that some earlier studies based on small samples over-estimated the differential expression of schizophrenia risk genes. Models based on the new data estimate that to ensure enough statistical power to confidently discern differential expression of a suspect schizophrenia risk gene between cases and controls would require, on average, a huge, currently unattainable, sample size of about 28,500.  This need for more statistical power underscores the importance of expanding resources for collections and public education about the importance of making tissue donations,  noted Lehner.","Published: September 29, 2016"

Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir   a tablet taken once daily   works by blocking the virus from multiplying and infecting new cells. Trials of the drug showed cure rates of 89% and above for all genotypes. People who have genotype 3 are currently treated with either an older injectable type of anti-viral drug, which can cause unwanted side effects, or with a daclastavir-based regimen depending on the patient's stage of liver disease. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir will be another drug that offers effective treatment to this group of patients   who make up 44% of the patient population with chronic hepatitis C. The NICE appraisal committee concluded that sofosbuvir-velpatasvir was clinically and cost-effective, and should be routinely available on the NHS. Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE centre for health technology evaluation, said:  The decision by the independent NICE appraisal committee to recommend sofosbuvir-velpatasvir is great news. The drug provides considerable health benefits to patients with hepatitis C, in particular, those with genotype 3 who can become very ill, very quickly.  Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, a newer type of direct acting anti-viral medicine, can be used to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C. Other drugs currently available treat only certain genotypes or can cause unwanted side effects if they have to be taken in combination with earlier anti-viral treatments.   Our positive recommendation of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir means that more tolerable treatment options will become available to all patients with hepatitis C.  Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir costs  38,980 for a 12 week treatment course. The drug may also be taken in combination with ribavirin costing around  40,000   also for a 12 week course of treatment. But the NHS will pay less than these prices because a confidential discount has been agreed with the company. The draft guidance recommends that decisions to treat patients with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir are made by multidisciplinary teams in the operational delivery networks put in place by NHS England, and to prioritise treatment for people with the highest unmet clinical need.

One of those vaccines is being evaluated in a Phase 1 human trial now under way in three U.S. locations to evaluate the vaccine s safety and ability to generate immune responses in people. Most Zika infections are asymptomatic or cause a mild illness lasting about a week. In addition, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can affect the fetus and lead to serious birth defects, especially those involving the developing brain. There are no vaccines or specific therapeutics to prevent or treat Zika virus disease. Scientists from the Vaccine Research Center within NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) developed the experimental vaccines using circular DNA engineered to produce a particle mimicking the shape of the Zika virus. The experimental vaccines, which do not contain infectious material and thus cannot cause Zika infection, are similar to a vaccine the researchers have tested against West Nile virus--part of the same virus family as Zika. In their study, the researchers vaccinated groups of rhesus macaques using the two different experimental Zika DNA vaccines in different doses. They then exposed the monkeys to an infectious dose of Zika virus. Both experimental vaccines were highly effective when given in two doses. One of the vaccines (VRC5288) is being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial under way in volunteers in Bethesda, Maryland, Baltimore and Atlanta. If the Phase 1 results are favorable, NIAID plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in Zika-endemic countries in early 2017.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antiinflammatory-drugs-could-strengthen-airway-immunity-186690,Anti Inflammatory Drugs Could Strengthen Airway Immunity  Mold toxins can weaken the airways  clearing mechanisms and immunity  but PKC inhibitors showed promise as a treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Toxins from mold found growing on nuts or corn can weaken the airways  self-clearing mechanisms and immunity, opening the door for respiratory diseases and exacerbating existing ones, suggests a study in Nature Scientific Reports published this month from otolaryngology researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  Poisonous and cancer-causing, aflatoxins are a type of mycotoxins produced by certain fungi (Aspergillus flavus, for example) growing on and in certain foods. Overall, 25 percent of the world s food crops are contaminated with these molds, though exposure often occurs via contaminated dust inhaled during food processing. They are known to cause allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, two infections that can be treated with antifungal medications and surgery, if needed. However, the downstream effects of aflatoxins on the airway passage is less studied and understood. In laboratory imaging experiments with human upper airway cells, researchers showed that acute exposure to aflatoxins slowed down and impaired key defense mechanisms in the airways, including mucosal ciliary clearance (MCC) and ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways and clean out dust and dirt.  The results suggest that aflatoxins enhance the pathogenicity of the fungi and possibly other co-infecting pathogens, such as bacteria.  With these defenses impaired, it may create a window of opportunity for the infection, and potentially a domino effect,  said lead author Robert J. Lee, PhD an assistant professor in the departments of Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery and Physiology at Penn.   Added senior author Noam A. Cohen, MD, PhD, an associate professor of Otorhinolaryngology at Penn:  Patients may become more susceptible to upper respiratory infections and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that can  seed  lower respiratory infections, especially in those with a compromised immune system. It can also exacerbate the more severe lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  In immunocompromised individuals (chemotherapy patients, for example) or poorly controlled diabetics, upper airway Aspergillus infections can invade the mucosa and underlying tissue and become lethal, so it is particularly critical to understand its interactions with the airway epithelium.  A better understanding of the complex pathogenesis of the fungal infection could lead to novel therapies and improve outcomes for these airway diseases, the authors wrote.   The Penn researchers found that the fungal toxins activate protein kinase C (PKC), which decreases ciliary beat frequency and thus decreases MCC. That increased kinase activity presents a potential treatment opportunity, they said. PKC inhibitors are anti-inflammatory drugs that have been shown to be efficacious in cardiovascular disease and some mental health disorders.  In the study, the team found that CBF reductions were blocked by the PKC inhibitors G 6983 and calphostin C, suggesting that drugs with similar activity could potentially be used to treat the fungal infection and prevent further co-infections. Importantly, the use of such drugs to treat the infections may lessen the need for patients as well as livestock and pets to be on antibiotics, which are often necessary to treat the ensuing bacterial infections that can occur after the airways have been contaminated. A significant amount of aflatoxin contamination occurs in grain-based livestock and pet foods, as well. What s more, upper respiratory infections often result in CRS, which causes $8 billion in yearly direct healthcare costs in the United States alone and accounts for about 20 percent of adult antibiotic prescriptions, making it a driver of antibiotic resistance.  Antibiotic use in animals is another driver for the emergence of resistant pathogenic microorganisms.  PKC inhibitors may decrease fungal respiratory disease and ultimately help alleviate some of those consequences,  Cohen said.  The affects observed in this study are in response to acute aflatoxin exposure.  Longer-term studies of the effects of aflatoxins will help to shed light on situations of chronic exposure and effects on airways,  they wrote. ","Published: September 29, 2016"

The study, published in the journal eLife, suggests that survival of protein fragments in the ancient eggshell could provide genetic information almost 50 times older than any DNA record.  The findings shed new light on how animals and humans lived and interacted in the past, how some species became extinct, and why some evolved and continue to thrive today. Crucially, the research provides archaeologists with the ability to be more targeted in which fossils they submit for deeper analysis.  The team at the Universities of York, Sheffield and Copenhagen analysed and tracked egg fossils from well-dated sites in Tanzania and South Africa, where it is expected DNA and proteins would not survive the extreme environmental conditions.  Unusual result Professor Matthew Collins, from the University of York s Department of Archaeology, who led the team, said:  To date, DNA analysis from frozen sediments has been able to reach back to about 700,000 years ago, but human evolution left most of its traces in Africa and the higher temperature there takes its toll on DNA preservation.   We had known for many years that proteins could give more clues into the past, but when we looked at protein decay in eggshells, it gave us unusual results when compared to other fossil materials and, until now, we have not really known why.  The researchers speculated that proteins might survive better if they were stuck onto solid surfaces, and so they tested the theory with the support of computational scientists at the University of Sheffield, who modelled the bindings of proteins in ostrich eggshells.  Intense heat Dr Beatrice Demarchi, from the University of York s Department of Archaeology, said  Evidence suggested that it was the more fluid, unstable, region of the protein that promoted and regulated mineral growth in the shell, but it was also less likely to survive over time and the intense heat of the African climate.   As we examined older and older eggshells, we could see that this assumption was surprisingly wrong, as it was in fact the unstable regions that survived the best. They were able to bind more strongly to the eggshell, allowing it be preserved in time.  Fragments of ancient ostrich eggshells are abundant in Africa, and often found at archaeological and palaeontological sites. They were exploited by the earliest modern humans as raw materials to make art, and jewellery and, or for carrying water. The shell is very thick and hardwearing and therefore survives under many different environmental conditions.  Laetoli site Dr Colin Freeman, from the University of Sheffield, said:  Remarkably, the oldest eggshell in the study - from the famous 3.8 million year-old site of Laetoli in Tanzania   a region of the protein was still there, giving us a unique insight into what to look for when analysing fossils of this kind.   Now that we know minerals can trap and preserve proteins in this way, we can be much more targeted in our study of ancient remains. ","Published: September 29, 2016"

The MMRF, located in Norwalk, Connecticut, is the first non-profit to donate information to the GDC, which will include data on more than 30,000 patients who have many other types of cancers by the end of the year. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer, but large amounts of genomic data about this disease and other cancers have not been readily accessible to the research community. At a meeting in Boston today, the Health Care Forum: War on Cancer hosted by The Economist, leaders in the healthcare field discussed the benefits of this new partnership.  Data sharing is essential to advancing cancer research, and I cannot overstate the value of the data that MMRF is providing   not only genomic data but also full clinical data as well,  said Doug Lowy, M.D., NCI acting director.  Combining genomic and clinical information will create an invaluable resource for all researchers worldwide studying this disease who are working toward new, more effective treatments.   The MMRF is a research and advocacy organization conducting clinical studies that incorporate whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing into their study analyses,"" said Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., director of NCI's Center for Cancer Genomics.  The GDC gains power with each new submission; and the contribution of MMRF data will enable the discovery of potentially actionable and life-changing insights into multiple myeloma and its response to therapy that could be used by cancer researchers, doctors, and patients.  Launched earlier this year, the GDC allows researchers to submit genetic and clinical data, such as cancer imaging and histological data, and integrate these data with information on the molecular profiles of tumors as well as treatment responses. Importantly, all patient information in the GDC has been de-identified, meaning that personal information, such as addresses, Social Security numbers, and other possible identifiers, are not present   only crucial genetic data and key demographic information are available. An important contribution to the GDC will be information from MMRF s newest genomic study, Relating Clinical Outcomes in MM to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile (CoMMpass, NCT01454297). The trial has enrolled more than 1,150 patients to date and is currently the largest genomic and clinical study of this disease. African-Americans represent about 18 percent of the patients enrolled CoMMpass, based on an interim analysis. The participation of African-Americans in this study is significant given that multiple myeloma occurs about twice as often in African-Americans than in whites. Over the next eight years or longer, patients in CoMMpass will get a repeat biopsy and a new genomic analysis at each six-month checkup and/or at disease progression. Tumor samples are being collected and analyzed when possible at the time of any relapse. The genomic data from these analyses will be immediately deposited in the GDC, with an anticipated sample size of near 1,000 cases by the spring of 2017. New data will be deposited every six months at a minimum. The MMRF will also share data from the 204-patient Towards a Genomic Understanding of Myeloma study, also known as the MMRF Multiple Myeloma Genomics Initiative. Through this initiative, whole genome sequencing of the myeloma genome was completed for the first time. ""GDC s visualization tools and browsing capabilities will make the MMRF myeloma data more accessible and could help jumpstart research into this cancer,"" noted Staudt.","Published: September 29, 2016"

A case study from Lund University in Sweden now confirms that tau PET images correspond to a higher degree to actual changes in the brain. According to the researchers behind the study, this increases opportunities for developing effective drugs.  There are several different methods of producing images showing the changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer s disease. The tau PET method reveals the presence of a protein in the brain, tau, with the help of a gamma camera and a specially selected radioactive molecule (F-AV-1451). Tau has an important function in assisting the transport of various substances within the brain s nerve cells. People with Alzheimer s disease have raised levels of tau, leading to accumulation of the protein in the brain cells and gradually to cell death. Lund University and Sk ne University Hospital are among other institutions studying patients with the tau PET method for research purposes. Until now, no one has had precise knowledge of how well the new imaging method reproduces the actual changes in a brain affected by Alzheimer s disease. The current case study, however, shows that image and reality match up well. The study has enabled researchers to compare tau PET images and brain tissue from the same person for the first time. The brain tissue came from a person who died having recently undergone examination with the new imaging method.  Tau PET can improve diagnostics, but above all, the imaging method can be of great significance in the development of new drugs to combat Alzheimer s disease , explains Ruben Smith, researcher at Lund University and physician at Sk ne University Hospital. He continues:  There are new candidate drugs which aim to reduce the accumulation of tau. The imaging method opens up opportunities to investigate the development of the disease at a detailed level, and to observe how tau aggregates are affected by the drugs.   The person who was examined had a mutation which led to the same type of accumulation of tau in the brain as in Alzheimer s disease. A single case study might seem insignificant, but since there are areas with a lot of tau stored and others with less tau in the same brain, it is sufficient to examine one person in order to verify whether the imaging method works , explains Oskar Hansson, professor at Lund University and consultant at Sk ne University Hospital. Interest from the research community in imaging methods focusing on tau is strong and growing. A reliable reproduction of tau protein in the brain is considered a more relevant marker and a better diagnostic tool than competing methods which are already in use.  The researchers behind the study are now focusing on tracking aggregation of tau in the brain over time and connections with diagnostics using spinal fluid samples.","Published: September 29, 2016"

Memristive devices are electrical resistance switches that can alter their resistance based on the history of applied voltage and current. These devices can store and process information and offer several key performance characteristics that exceed conventional integrated circuit technology. ""Memristors have become a leading candidate to enable neuromorphic computing by reproducing the functions in biological synapses and neurons in a neural network system, while providing advantages in energy and size,"" the researchers say.

The new paper, published in the journal Nature Genetics, was led by the Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille, collaborating with The University of Manchester, and it describes the effects of mutations of Teashirt in people and mice. See Also: Interactions between cortical and subcortical regions important in hypersensitivity in ASDThe gene, formally named Tshz3, had already been implicated by the joint research team in 2008 as being essential for development of smooth muscle in the wall of the ureter. Mutant mice were born with 'blown-up' kidneys because their ureters failed to actively propel urine down to the bladder. Professor Adrian Woolf from The University of Manchester, then working as a children's consultant in London, discovered that one of his patients born with abnormal kidneys had a deleted Tshz3 gene and also displayed characteristics of autistic spectrum disorder. The French team also realized that mice with Tshz3 mutation not only had kidney problems but also displayed learning difficulties. The findings sparked a global search of other kidney clinics, which returned ten more patients with similar symptoms. After genetic testing, it was confirmed that the same gene was missing in all of them findings which are published in the new paper. Professor Woolf said: ""The mutant mouse kidney looks just like 'hydronephrosis', the distended kidney seen in about 1 in 1,000 individuals when they are screened by sonar scans as unborn babies. It now appears that this gene is linked to at least some of these cases and that it also has implications for how our brains work in childhood.""

By figuring out the three-dimensional structures of protein molecules, he tries to obtain crucial information about their role in the cell and the mechanisms which underlie various disorders. In earlier research involving fruit flies, Verstreken had already demonstrated that a protein known as 'Skywalker' plays a crucial role in maintaining communication between brain cells. An almost identical protein operates in the human brain under the name 'TBC1D24'.

Alongside deafness, deformed nails, brittle bones and mental retardation, this serious genetic disorder is characterized by neurodegeneration, movement disorders and epilepsy."" By joining forces with Vers es at the VIB research center for structural biology, the scientists were able to figure out the three-dimensional structure of Skywalker, making it possible to study the protein in microscopic detail. ""Looking at Skywalker in this way gave us completely new insights into the precise function of this protein, and therefore also the function of the human protein TBC1D24,"" notes Vers es. ""Among other things, we discovered that it connects with specific brain fats. And more importantly, this connection is impaired in over 70% of patients with a TBC1D24 mutation."" On the basis of this discovery, the scientists increased the concentration of specific brain fats in fruit flies with a Skywalker mutation. What happened? The epileptic seizures in the sick fruit flies were completely suppressed.

In a cascade of a so far poorly understood signaling pathway, researchers from the Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research CECAD at the University of Cologne identified a protein called UFD-2, which plays a key role in this well-balanced process. The results have been published in the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. The genetic information of every cell is encoded in the sequence of the DNA double helix. Double strand breaks in the DNA, which can be induced by radiation, are a dangerous threat to the cells, and if not properly repaired can lead to cancer. Damaged cells need to decide whether the breaks can be fixed or whether they should be removed by a cellular suicide program called  apoptosis  before initiating cancer.  Bj rn Schumacher, one of the senior authors, explains:  Within seconds after an harmful incident, different mechanisms start. In a schizophrenic way, the cell starts repairing as well as preparing for apoptosis. We identified an uncharacterized mechanism that integrates signals from the ongoing repair process and the cell death machinery. A protein called UFD-2 forms large complexes at the breaks and verifies whether to proceed with the repair or whether it s time to die.  In the process, UFD-2 is a point of intersection that both receives and gives signals.  The experiments were performed with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  For our research we used different strains of C. elegans, including wild type and genetically modified ones. They were exposed to ionizing radiation to induce double strand breaks and then examined,  says Leena Ackermann, lead author of the study. Schumacher adds:  The results are important to further understand how and why a cell decides to repair or to die. Is the repair still ongoing and successful or is apoptosis necessary? Cells lacking UFD-2 fail to undergo apoptosis. In humans such a situation could lead to a higher risk of a damaged cell becoming a cancer cell.  All the proteins that play a part in this mechanism can be found in humans as well, and the findings could be highly relevant to better understanding how DNA damage leads to cancer. DNA damage is also an important driver of the aging process. Although apoptosis protects from cancer, excessive cell death can lead to tissue degeneration and aging. The senior author Thorsten Hoppe originally identified UFD-2 as a key regulator of protein degradation. Here, UFD-2 forms regulatory centers that coordinate DNA repair and cell death.  Hoppe hopes for resulting advances in tumor therapy:  The knowledge we gained from this study provides new perspectives for fighting cancer pharmaceutically. It might be possible to manipulate the well-balanced process of apoptosis and protein degradation to make clearance of tumor cells more efficient. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

Antibiotics have effectively treated bacterial diseases for years, but somebacteria have developed resistance to the antibiotics that once killed them. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researchers are investigatingagriculture-related antibiotic resistance and developing solutions to addressfood safety, animal production and protection, and the environment. Part oftheir efforts involves looking at antibiotic resistance in soils. Microbiologist LisaDurso and her colleagues at the ARS AgroecosystemManagement Research Unit in Lincoln, Nebraska, recently demonstrated thatungrazed prairie soils have measurable amounts of bacteria with antibioticresistance. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes found in soilswhere manure was deposited by animals can provide valuable information aboutwhat is currently present in a sample site, such as a feedlot. However, theconcern is that even if bacteria in manure are dead, their genes can persist insoils. A tool for measuring resistance is needed to identify the source ofantibiotic resistance on farms and in the environment, according to Durso.Establishing baseline levels of antibiotic resistance will allow scientists todifferentiate resistance caused by human antibiotic use from resistance thatoccurs naturally. Durso and her team examined native prairie soils that had little humanimpact and no animal grazing during the past 20 years. They collected soilsamples from the sites and screened them for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.They found that all prairies contained bacteria that were resistant totetracycline and cefotaxime two commonly prescribed antibiotics that treat a widevariety of infections and nearly half of the samples contained bacteriaresistant to two or more antibiotics.According to Durso, data from the study can provide a baseline for whatoccurs naturally in soil giving scientists a starting point for figuring outhow best to manage antibiotic resistance in agricultural productions","Published: September 28, 2016"

Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is the most deadly infectious disease in the world. Standard TB therapy takes at least six months and patients infected with multi-drug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains undergo treatments that are even longer (up to 24 months). Treatment is often associated with severe side effects. Studies indicate that the cost of developing a new drug has soared to $2.6 billion. The in vitro study indicates cephalosporins work well on their own against bacteria that cause TB. But they are even more active when used in synergistic combinations with traditional and new TB therapies.  Cephalosporins can be taken orally and have a good long-term safety record, but were never explored as a TB therapy,  says University of British Columbia (UBC) microbiologist Santiago Ram n-Garc a, who led the study.  While these are in vitro results, their potent anti-mycobacterial properties suggest cephalosporins could be used as part of new combinatorial TB therapies.   Because cephalosporins are already clinically approved drugs, they could be readily tested in the clinic,  says Prof. Charles Thompson from UBC who also led the work.  New treatments are urgently needed to shorten the duration of the standard treatment and for MDR and XDR-TB therapy. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

An ear infection entails inflammation and buildup of fluid in the middle ear, located just behind the eardrum. Anyone can get an ear infection, but children get them more often than adults. Ear infections are commonly caused by bacteria. They re often treated with a 7 10 day course of oral antibiotics. But getting young children to take the medication can be difficult. Stopping the medicine too soon can allow the infection to come back and cause bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. A research team led by Dr. Daniel Kohane at Boston Children s Hospital investigated an easier way to deliver ear infection medication. They engineered an antibiotic-containing gel that can be inserted directly inside the ear canal. They then tested if the gel could treat ear infections in chinchillas, the gold-standard animal model for studying ear infection. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD). Results were published in Science Translational Medicine on September 14, 2016. The scientists evaluated different chemical formulations to create a polymer solution that could be injected into the ear canal as a liquid, harden into a gel upon contacting the warm ear drum, and slowly degrade over time. They tested 2 of the gel solutions as a potential drug-delivery system. The solutions had a copolymer called P407 or a modified copolymer called P407-PBP. Both contained the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and chemical permeation enhancers, which help the drug get across the eardrum into the middle ear.  Chinchillas with an ear infection caused by Haemophilus influenza received antibiotics through one of the gels or via liquid drops placed directly onto the eardrum. All 10 of the animals treated with the gel containing P407-PBP cleared the infection after 24 hours. Only 62% of animals that received liquid drops and 60% treated with P407 gel cleared the infection after 7 days. The P407-PBP gel continued releasing antibiotics into the middle ear throughout the week, whereas the other treatments stopped by day 3. The chinchillas had no detectable antibiotics in their bloodstream, suggesting that the approach could help avoid side effects and antibiotic resistance caused by oral medications. Animals that were given the gel treatment showed a minor hearing deficit comparable to the effects of ear wax. However, the authors suggest this could resolve once the gel fully dissolved.  With oral antibiotics, you have to treat the entire body repeatedly just to get to the middle ear,  says first author Dr. Rong Yang at Boston Children s Hospital.  With the gel, a pediatrician could administer the entire antibiotic course all at once, and only where it s needed.  More studies are needed to optimize the gel s design and determine whether it would be safe and effective for people.","Published: September 28, 2016"

The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS 22.3 months for KMP versus 22.1 months for VMP, HR = 0.91, 95 percent CI, 0.75 - 1.10). While the data for overall survival, a secondary endpoint, are not yet mature, the observed hazard ratio (KMP versus VMP) was 1.21 (95 percent CI, 0.90 - 1.64). Neither result was statistically significant.  Overall, the adverse events in the KMP arm were consistent with the known safety profile of KYPROLIS. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse events was 74.7 percent in the KMP arm and 76.2 percent in the VMP arm. Fatal treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 6.5 percent of KMP patients and 4.3 percent of VMP patients.

Researchers at the University of British Columbia successfully prevented drug-resistant bacteria from forming abscesses, or painful pus-filled lesions, using a peptide, or mini-protein. The peptide worked by disrupting the bacteria s stress response. Abscesses are bacterial-induced lesions that are responsible for 3.2 million emergency room visits every year in the United States. Because antibiotics seldom work on them, standard treatment for abscesses involves cutting out the infected tissue or draining it.  Abscesses can occur almost anywhere in the body, and antibiotics aren t usually effective on them,  said senior author Bob Hancock, a professor in UBC s department of microbiology, and senior author of the study published in EBioMedicine.  Our peptide offers a new strategy, because its mechanism is completely different from every known antibiotic.  Hancock and his colleagues discovered that bacteria in abscesses are in a stress-triggered growth state. Using a synthetic peptide known as DJK-5, they were able to interfere with the bacteria s stress response and heal abscesses in mice. The peptide was effective against two classes of bacteria, known as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whose different cell-wall structures make them susceptible to different antibiotics.  We ve shown that all of the superbugs are susceptible to this peptide when under stress,  said Hancock.  We also showed that it actually works even better in the presence of antibiotics. By combining antibiotics with the peptide there is a much lower chance of getting resistance, because you ve got two agents that act in different ways. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

A study by Plymouth University examined the mass, abundance and size of fibres present in waste effluent following washes of synthetic fabrics at standard temperatures of 30 C and 40 C. It found hundreds of thousands of tiny synthetic particles could be released in each wash, confirming earlier work at Plymouth University that the washing of clothes is a major source of microscopic fibres within the aquatic environment. The research, published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, was led by PhD student Imogen Napper in conjunction with Professor Richard Thompson, who is a leading international expert on microplastics and marine debris having worked in the field for more than 20 years. In the paper, the authors say: The quantity of microplastic in the environment is expected to increase over the next few decades, and there are concerns about the potential for it to have harmful effects if ingested. But while the release of tiny fibres as a result of washing textiles has been widely suggested as a potential source, there has been little quantitative research on its relevant importance, or on the factors that might influence such discharges. That was the focus of our research.  For the study, a series of polyester, acrylic and polyester-cotton items were washed at 30 C and 40 C using various combinations of detergent and fabric conditioner. Fibres were then extracted from the waste effluent and examined using an electron microscope to determine the typical size and any differences in mass and abundance among treatments. The research found that laundering an average washing load of 6kg could release an estimated 137,951 fibres from polyester-cotton blend fabric, 496,030 fibres from polyester and 728,789 from acrylic. The polyester-cotton blend was consistently found to shed fewer fibres than both the other fabric types, regardless of the differing treatments, however the addition of bio-detergents or conditioners tended to release more fibres. Professor Thompson, who leads the International Marine Litter Research Unit at Plymouth University, recently gave both written and oral evidence to the microplastics inquiry held by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, which led to recommendations for a ban on the use of microbeads in cosmetics. He said:  Clearly, what we are not advocating that this research should trigger something similar to the recently announced ban on microbeads. In that case, one of the considerations guiding policy intervention was the lack of clear societal benefit from incorporating microplastic particles into the cosmetics, coupled with concerns about environmental impacts. The societal benefits of textiles are without question and so any voluntary or policy intervention should be directed toward reducing emissions either via changes in textile design or filtration of effluent, or both.

The interaction helps a cell respond to DNA damage and may play a role in cancer development and premature aging. Knowing when to hold them, and when to fold them, is a critical skill in professional gambling. But it s also pertinent for cells assessing DNA damage. It s essential for the cells to quickly ascertain whether it s possible to repair mistakes or to self-destruct for the good of the organism. That s because cells with a damaged genome often begin to flout the standard rules of growth and become cancerous. Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered a new player in this high-stakes molecular game in the form of a novel regulatory RNA they ve named DINO. This RNA molecule binds to and stabilizes a well-known tumour suppressor protein called p53 that mobilizes a cell s response to DNA damage. When mutated, p53 is one of the most infamous bad guys in the cancer world.  It s so important for a cell to keep track of potentially dangerous changes to its genome,  said professor of dermatology Howard Chang, MD, PhD.  But if cells reacted to every little ding, they would find themselves responding inappropriately   they would stop growing and maybe even self-destruct unnecessarily. You don t want to do this unless the DNA damage is severe. We ve discovered that DINO is an integral part of this decision-making circuit.  A paper describing the research was published online Sept. 26 in Nature Genetics. Chang is the senior author. Lead authorship is shared by former radiation oncology resident Adam Schmitt, MD, graduate student Julia Garcia and former graduate student Tiffany Hung. When DNA gets damaged DNA damage is a natural by-product of cell division because it is impossible to faithfully copy each of the 3 billion nucleotides that make up our genomes without making at least a few errors. Damage can also be caused by exposure to certain chemical agents, ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation. Most of the time, these problems are recognized and quickly repaired by the cell. That s where p53 comes in. When it is doing its job, p53 recognizes and responds to DNA damage by increasing the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and cell division. In this way it functions as a tumour suppressor. When mutated, however, p53 loses its ability to modulate the cell s response to DNA damage. Mutations in p53 are among the most common causes of many types of cancer. Chang and his collaborators found that p53 also increases the expression of DINO. DINO, in turn, binds to and stabilizes p53 in a kind of positive feedback loop, amplifying its signal throughout the nucleus.  Until now, most studies have focused only on proteins in this pathway,  said Chang. Fine-tuning the damage response DINO is a member of a group of RNA molecules known as long noncoding RNAs, or lncRNAs. These molecules have been implicated in a growing number of critical regulatory roles throughout the cell. This is the first time that a lncRNA has been shown to be involved in this critical DNA damage-response pathway in living animals. Chang and his colleagues found that when DINO expression is artificially increased, cells respond as if their DNA has been damaged even in the absence of any genome changes. In contrast, when DINO expression is inhibited, the cell responds less robustly to signals from p53.  DINO expression allows the cell to fine-tune its response to DNA damage and respond appropriately,  said Chang. Because, as an RNA, DINO is made in the cell s nucleus where p53 is active, the researchers believe it may provide a more rapid and precise response to DNA damage than would a regulatory protein, which would be synthesized in the cytoplasm.  Positive feedback loops are used in many applications, including engineering, to increase the sensitivity of systems and apply thresholds for action,  said Chang.  We believe DINO may play role in cancer development and possibly premature aging by modulating how a cell responds to DNA damage. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

Thus, Immunic is well positioned to soon become a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with two innovative development programs.  Program IMU-366: Highly potent and selective cytokine inhibitors The IMU-366 program comprises one lead compound and a family of orally available small molecule inhibitors of RORgt, a nuclear receptor known to influence the production of a wide range of cytokines (messenger molecules) involved in various immune or autoimmune diseases.  RORgt is crucial for the development of the TH17 T cell subset (specialized immune cells) and for these cells to release their specific cytokines after activation , explains Dr. Andreas M hler, Immunic s co-founder and Chief Medical Officer.  Unfortunately, an overreaction of TH17 immune cells often is an underlying mechanism of various diseases. In pre-clinical experiments the lead compound of the IMU-366 program demonstrated efficacy in various models of immune and autoimmune diseases. These data will allow Immunic to develop drug candidates with activity in a variety of diseases such as psoriasis.  Program IMU-838: A new oral treatment option for Crohn s disease IMU-838 is an orally available, next-generation immune modulator. IMU-838 inhibits an enzyme called  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase  (DHODH) which plays a key role in the metabolism of activated T and B cells while leaving other immune cells largely unaffected and allows the immune system to stay functioning, e.g. in fighting infections.  Despite the recent availability of new biologics to be injected intravenously or subcutaneously for the subset of patients with moderate to severe Crohn s disease, there is still a large unmet medical need to find safe oral therapies for all types and forms of Crohn s disease , states Dr. Andreas M hler.

The quest for a vaccine against rhinoviruses may have seemed quixotic, because there are more than 100 varieties circulating around the world. Even so, the immune system can handle the challenge, researchers from Emory University School of Medicine and Children s Healthcare of Atlanta say. Vaccines that combine dozens of varieties of rhinovirus at once are effective in stimulating antiviral antibodies in mice and monkeys, the researchers report in Nature Communications. The paper was also posted on Biorxiv before publication.  We think that creating a vaccine for the common cold can be reduced to technical challenges related to manufacturing,  says Martin Moore, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and adenoviruses can cause them too. Rhinoviruses also exacerbate asthma attacks. Although they come in many varieties, rhinoviruses do not drift to the same degree that influenza viruses do, Moore says. Researchers showed in the 1960s that it was possible to vaccinate people against one variety of rhinovirus and prevent them from getting sick when challenged with samples of the same virus. The trouble was the sheer diversity of rhinoviruses   or that s how it appeared at the time.  It s surprising that nobody tried such a simple solution over the last 50 years. We just took 50 types of rhinovirus and mixed them together into our vaccine, and made sure we had enough of each one,  Moore says.  If we make a vaccine with 50 or 100 variants, it's the same amount of total protein in a single dose of vaccine. The variants are like a bunch of slightly different Christmas ornaments, not really like 50 totally different vaccines mixed.  A mixture of 25 types of inactivated rhinovirus can stimulate neutralizing antibodies against all 25 in mice, and a mixture of 50 types can do the same thing in rhesus macaques. In this paper, antibodies generated in response to the vaccine were tested for their ability to prevent the virus from infecting human cells in culture. However, the vaccines were not tested for their ability to stop animals from getting sick.  There are no good animal models of rhinovirus replication,  Moore says.  The next step would be human challenge models with volunteers, which are feasible because the virus is not very pathogenic. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

As a proof of concept for this approach, the research team from Emory, Children s Healthcare of Atlanta and Georgia Tech showed how ""ancestral sequence reconstruction"" or ASR can guide engineering of the blood clotting protein known as factor VIII, which is deficient in the inherited disorder hemophilia A. Other common protein-based drugs include monoclonal antibodies, insulin, human growth hormone and white blood cell stimulating factors given to cancer patients. The authors say that ASR-based engineering could be applied to other recombinant proteins produced outside the human body, as well as gene therapy. It has been possible to produce human factor VIII in recombinant form since the early 1990s. However, current factor VIII products still have problems: they don t last long in the blood, they frequently stimulate immune responses in the recipient, and they are difficult and costly to manufacture. Experimental hematologist and gene therapist Chris Doering, PhD and his colleagues already had some success in addressing these challenges by filling in some of the sequence of human factor VIII with the same protein from pigs. ""We hypothesized that human factor VIII has evolved to be short lived in the blood to reduce the risk of thrombosis,"" Doering says. ""And we reasoned that by going even farther back in evolutionary history, it should be possible to find more stable, potent relatives."" Doering is associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children s Healthcare of Atlanta. The first author of the paper is former Molecular and Systems Pharmacology graduate student Philip Zakas, PhD. Doering s lab teamed up with, Trent Spencer, PhD, director of cell and gene therapy for the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, and Eric Gaucher, PhD, associate professor of biological sciences at Georgia Tech, who specializes in ASR. ASR involves reaping the recent harvest of genome sequences from animals as varied as mice, cows, goats, whales, dogs, cats, horses, bats and elephants. Using this information, scientists reconstruct a plausible ancestral sequence for a protein in early mammals. They then tweak the human protein, one amino acid building block at a time, toward the ancestral sequence to see what kinds of effects the changes could have. The research team showed that amino acid changes toward ancestral sequences could make human factor VIII more stable and less likely to be inhibited by recipient antibodies.  This exemplifies how understanding the evolutionary history of a protein can help engineer better versions of the protein for therapeutic use,"" Gaucher says. ""ASR is a widely accessible strategy that utilizes both known and unknown natural protein diversity to rapidly probe a protein design space that has already been refined by natural selection for beneficial properties,"" the authors conclude.","Published: September 28, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/protein-studies-discover-molecular-secrets-206315,Protein Studies Discover Molecular Secrets Two protein studies have mapped proteins that reveal the secrets to recycling carbon and healing cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy s (DOE's) Argonne National Laboratory have mapped out two very different types of protein. One helps soil bacteria digest carbon compounds; the other protects cells from the effects of harmful molecules. In order to uncover the structure of these proteins, researchers used a technique called protein crystallography. Like a mosquito trapped in amber, compounds that are crystallized are placed in array in identical positions and ordered so that scientists can target them with X-ray beams and work backwards from the scattering patterns produced to recreate their three-dimensional structures atom by atom. Bacterial breakdown In the first study, a group of researchers from the Structural Biology Center, which is funded by DOE s Office of Science, mapped out a protein responsible for breaking down organic compounds in soil bacteria, an important process for recycling carbon in the ecosystem. The bacteria used, called Acinetobacter, is located mostly in soil and water habitats, where it helps to change aromatic compounds (named for their ring shape) into forms that can be used as food. One of the sources of aromatic compounds found in soil is lignin, a tough polymer that is an essential part of all plants and that s hard for many organisms to digest.  But Acinetobacter can utilize these aromatic compounds as their sole source of carbon,  said Andrzej Joachimiak, who co-authored both studies and is the director of the Structural Biology Center and the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics at Argonne. In order for Acinetobacter to break down the aromatic compounds, it needs to produce catabolic enzymes, molecular machines built from an organism s DNA that break down molecules into smaller parts that can be digested. Whether or not membrane transporters and catabolic enzymes are produced falls to the HcaR regulator, a sort of molecular policeman that controls when the genes that code for these enzymes can be activated. Joachimiak and his colleagues found that the regulator works in a cycle, activating genes when aromatic compounds are present and shutting genes down when the compounds are used up.  By nature it is very efficient,  Joachimiak said.  If you don t have aromatic compounds inside a cell, the operon is shut down.  The research team didn t stop at mapping out the regulator itself; to discover how the cycle worked, they crystalized the HcaR regulator during interactions with its two major inputs: the aromatic compounds and DNA. The group found that when aromatic compounds are not present in the cell, two wings found on either side of the HcaR regulator wrap around the DNA. This action is mirrored on both sides of the regulator, covering the DNA regulatory site and preventing genes from being activated.  This is something that has never been seen before,  Joachimiak said. When the aromatic compounds are present, however, they attach themselves to the HcaR regulator, making it so stiff that it can no longer grapple with the DNA. Joachimiak said that this knowledge could help outside of the lab, with applications such as a sensor for harmful pesticides and as a template for converting more carbon in soil.  If we can train bacteria to better degrade lignin and other polymers produced by plants during photosynthesis, more natural carbon sources can be utilized for example for production of biofuels and bioproducts,  Joachimiak said. The paper was published earlier this year by the Journal of Biological Chemistry under the title  How Aromatic Compounds Block DNA Binding of HcaR Catabolite Regulator.  It was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Biological and Environmental Research). Protective proteins A second paper focuses on a family of proteins identified as DUF89, which stands for  domain unknown function.  This family is conserved across all three branches of the phylogenetic tree, which means that it is likely essential to many life forms. DUF89 has been identified as a type of enzyme called a phosphatase, which strips molecules of their phosphate groups. The paper s authors hypothesized that DUF89 proteins use this ability to save useful proteins in a cell from rogue molecules which could alter their structure, making them useless or destructive. The study found that DUF89 proteins use a metal ion, probably manganese, to lure in potentially harmful molecules and a water molecule to break off their phosphate group. DUF89 proteins could have an important role in breaking down a specific type of disruptive molecule: sugar. When the concentration of sugar in blood reaches high levels, simple sugars can have unwanted side reactions with proteins and DNA through a process called glycation.  We always have to deal with these side reactions that happen in our cells, and when we get older, we have an accumulation of these errors in our cells,  Joachimiak said. Joachimiak said that this research could help scientists develop DUF89 treatments from non-human sources as a way to combat glycation in the bloodstream. The paper was published on the Nature Chemical Biology website on June 20 under the title  A family of metal-dependent phosphatases implicated in metabolite damage-control.  Other authors on the paper were from the University of Florida, the University of Toronto, the University of California-Davis and Brookhaven National Laboratory. It was supported by the National Science Foundation, Genome Canada, the Ontario Genomics Institution, the Ontario Research Fund, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the National Institutes of Health, the C.V. Griffin Sr. Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Basic Energy Sciences and Office of Biological and Environmental Research). Both studies used X-rays from the Advanced Photon Source, a DOE Office of Science User Facility, using beamlines 19-ID and 19-BM. Both also stem from the goal of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics, which is to discover the structure and function of proteins potentially important to biomedicine. Joachimiak said that despite the new findings from these studies, when it comes to understanding what proteins do, we still have a long way to go.  When we sequence genomes, we can predict proteins, but when we predict those sequences we can only say something about function for about half of them,  Joachimiak said.

""Quidel has a long history of innovation, driven by a passionate belief that no child or his grandmother should die unnecessarily of influenza or from complications that arise from an untreated influenza infection. And once again, we're pleased to introduce another innovative testing solution, Solana Influenza A+B, which will address many of the limitations that have hampered the growth of current molecular methods,"" said Douglas Bryant, president and chief executive officer of Quidel Corporation. ""A single Solana instrument system performs up to twelve Solana Influenza A+B assays on almost any sample type or brand of viral transport media in under an hour, and up to 96 patient samples during an 8 hour shift, which is critical during an influenza epidemic when testing volumes are at their highest, and samples are coming from several different locations and often collected in a variety of different transported media."" The Solana  Influenza A+B assay received CE Mark in August, and is Quidel's third molecular diagnostic test to receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA in the scalable and versatile Solana format. Solana  Group A Strep assay for the diagnosis of Group A Strep infections received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in June 2015, and Solana  Trichomonas assay received 510(k) clearance in August.","Published: September 28, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/designing-drugs-with-a-whole-new-toolbox-192206,Designing Drugs with a Whole New Toolbox Researchers develop methods to design small  targeted proteins with shapes not found in nature  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Over billions of years of evolution, nature has created its vast tapestry of life out of a surprisingly small toolbox: just four DNA  letters  that, in combination, code for only 20 common amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Researchers have successfully mined nature for substances created with this defined palette to treat some diseases   but imagine the possibilities if they could build on the lessons they ve learned from nature using a whole new toolbox. For the first time, a team led by scientists at the University of Washington has designed certain peptides, or small proteins, that have chemical properties that would make them ideal starting points for new drugs. Another first was their designs  use of amino acids not typically found in nature.  What we haven t been able to do is come up with a way of saying,  Okay, here s a new problem where no natural peptide that we know of exists. We want to make a new peptide drug and solve this problem.  We didn t have design tools that allowed that,  said the UW s Dr. Vikram Mulligan, one of the first authors on the paper describing their methods for opening up this new toolbox, which was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The team created new algorithms to design these molecules, called constrained peptides because the peptides  shapes are bound tightly in place with chemical bonds. Constrained peptides are found throughout the natural world, often as toxins or defensive compounds. With their small size and precisely shaped, rigid structures, such proteins are highly specific for their targets and chemically stable   desirable qualities in a drug that must have as few side effects as possible and withstand the tough environment inside the human body long enough to do its job.  Constrained peptides hold incredible potential for development into therapeutics to hit targets that traditional drugs cannot, said study author Dr. Colin Correnti of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Correnti is a member of the Project Violet team at the Hutch, led by Dr. Jim Olson, which is creating drug candidates based on natural constrained peptides.  This is the very early stages in this space, but that is the promise: That we may be able to do things that [other drugs such as] small molecules can t, that antibodies can t,  Correnti said. And thanks to their new methodology that allowed them to expand their design repertoire outside of the standard toolbox of 20 amino acids, the UW-led group was able to create computer-designed molecules with shapes that nature would find impossible.   Because structure determines function, [those new shapes] open access to functions that don t exist in any natural proteins,  Mulligan said. The peptides in this paper were created to prove the method works, but the team is using their designs and the algorithms they built to create small-protein drug candidates with a variety of different applications for human disease. Mulligan s co-first authors Drs. Gaurav Bhardwaj and Christopher Bahl, all postdoctoral fellows in the lab of senior author Dr. David Baker of UW, are exploring potential peptide drugs that could help overcome antibiotic resistance and neutralize bacterial toxins implicated in food poisoning, for example.  That s the fun stuff   making stuff that has function,  Bahl said.  The next step is to change those shapes so it gives function to the molecule.  Overcoming a problem in drug design Drug design has a Goldilocks problem. In general, most existing drugs fall into one of two classes: First are small molecules like aspirin that can slip easily throughout the body s small spaces, but whose small surface area means they often can t be very specific in the way they bind to disease-related molecules   their targets. Second are drugs based on antibodies   disease-targeting proteins of the immune system   that can be stable and highly specific to their targets but tough to produce and too large to find their way to some targets.  Small-molecule drugs have their place and antibody drugs have their place, but between that you run into all of these targets that we often refer to in drug discovery as undruggable targets,  Correnti said. The undruggable space is huge, Correnti estimates: Maybe 80 percent of all potential targets are ones that  you really don t have the drug toolbox to address.  That s where constrained peptides come in. Like the little bear s porridge in the fairy tale, this class of small proteins could be just right, with small sizes that allow them to slip through barriers that block larger molecules and structures designed to be specific for a target, stabilized by multiple, crisscrossing chemical bonds. While there are some drugs that have been created based on naturally occurring constrained peptides, and it s possible to synthesize such peptides in the lab, designing a new peptide from scratch to solve a particular problem is another beast entirely, the researchers said.  The challenge has been that we can t design them. We can make them if we know what to make,  Mulligan said. The forte of the Baker group at UW is the use of computational and experimental methods to tackle problems in protein science, including the design of novel proteins with particular functions. Before this project, however, they weren t able to design such small, constrained proteins, nor proteins that incorporated unnatural amino acids that are mirror images of their naturally occurring cousins. Besides making it possible to create new peptide shapes and, thus, functions, unusually shaped peptides like those the group designed could prove to be highly stable drugs, the investigators said. The human body s protein-breakdown enzymes  don t work very well on mirror-image amino acids, meaning these peptides will persist much longer,  Mulligan said. Some of the peptides the group designed are also circular, a form that exists in nature but was undesignable before this project.  From a drug perspective the reason this helps is that some of these enzymes start digesting from the ends,  Bhardwaj said. But a circle doesn t have ends, he pointed out.  The design process worked like this: First, the team created rough blueprints for their peptides that specified the shapes they would contain   say, two spirals of amino acids followed by a series of amino acids that folded into sheets   without dictating the particular sequences of the 15-50 amino acids that would create those shapes. Then, the team s software began to zoom in on ways to create these shapes, starting with the rough backbone and then the specific sequences of amino acids, whether natural or unnatural, that would flesh out the backbone. The software, dubbed Rosetta and first developed by Baker, generated numerous possible amino acid sequences that could possibly form the shapes in each blueprint. Next, it found the handful that were most plausible to form the specified shape when the amino acid sequence folded up into its final 3-D conformation.  The advantage of having a design tool is in the absence of a tool, the number of possible proteins that exist, or possible peptides that exists, is astronomical. It s far too large to experimentally just blindly test all of them,  Mulligan said.  Our software makes predictions that aren t always right but are likely to be right, so we just have to do a small number of experiments to find a hit.  The team synthesized the peptides designed with the new algorithms in their labs at the UW and Fred Hutch. They tested the peptides in tough conditions of high temperature and corrosive chemical baths to check their stability. Then came the nail-biter: proving that what they d made in the lab was actually what they d designed. Correnti remembers the moment he and his collaborators at Fred Hutch solved the very first structure of any of the designed peptides that the group had manufactured (called gEHEE_06 and illustrated above). They had used crystallography, a method in which a protein is coaxed into crystal form then bombarded with X-rays that interact with the atoms of the crystal in telltale patterns. This type of protein is tough to crystallize and very few had ever been solved with crystallization before, said Correnti, who is director of protein design for the Hutch s Molecular Design and Therapeutics core. (That specialized facility, sprung from Project Violet, has high-throughput equipment and expertise to help investigators create proteins for research.)  There s nothing quite like it in science. You are the first person in the world to see the three-dimensional structure of this protein,  Correnti said of the  beautiful diffraction  image that appears when a crystallography attempt is successful.  Nobody else has ever seen it and you re the first person to see it. That s a special feeling.  The structure that showed their new design algorithms worked as intended was critical, Bahl said.  It really demonstrated that it was possible to do any of this.  A productive collaboration The UW team is taking two approaches toward transforming their early-stage, constrained peptides into potential drugs. The first is reengineering the peptides they ve already created to bind to a specific target. The other is using their new algorithms to design from scratch new peptides that will target a particular molecule involved in disease. Meanwhile, Correnti and the other members of Olson s Project Violet effort continue to develop drug candidates based on constrained peptides starting from the opposite direction: modifying the function of peptides that already exist in nature. Project Violet s best-known such drug is BLZ-100 Tumor Paint, which is built from a peptide from scorpion venom linked to a fluorescent molecule. Tumor Paint, now being tested in clinical trials, is designed to light up tumors so surgeons can see exactly where to cut to excise only diseased tissue and leave healthy tissue intact. The collaboration between the two groups is really special, Olson said. Baker s group at UW  and I are approaching the same question from two different angles,  Olson said.  Rather than competing, we re collaborating   to make both of our work go faster. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

Researchers from the University of Zurich and University Hospital Zurich now reveal which factors are responsible for the human body forming such broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies, thereby opening new avenues for the development of an HIV vaccine.  We know from HIV research that around one percent of people infected with HIV form antibodies that combat different virus strains. These broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bnAbs) bind to structures on the surface of the virus which barely change and are identical in different viral strains. Dubbed  spikes , these sugar and protein complexes are the only surface structures that stem from the HIV virus itself and can be attacked by the immune system via antibodies. Due to their broad impact, these antibodies constitute a promising cornerstone for the development of an effective vaccine against HIV. Virus load, virus diversity and duration of infection encourage antibody formation A Switzerland-wide team of researchers headed by the University of Zurich and University Hospital Zurich conducted an extensive study on the factors responsible for the formation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. They examined around 4,500 people infected with HIV who are recorded in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Study, and identified 239 people who form such antibodies. Firstly, three disease-specific characteristics are important: the number of viruses present in the body, the diversity of the virus types found and the duration of an untreated HIV infection.  Our study enabled us to show for the first time that each of these three parameters   virus load, virus diversity and infection duration   influences the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies independently of each other,  explains Huldrych G nthard, professor of clinical infectious diseases at UZH.  So we don t necessarily have to consider all three parameters in designing an HIV vaccine. This is especially important with regard to the length of vaccine administration   it wouldn t be possible to imitate a longer untreated HIV infection with a vaccine.  Black people form broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies more frequently A second factor concerns ethnicity: Black HIV patients form broadly neutralizing antibodies more frequently than white people   irrespective of the other factors analyzed in the study. For Alexandra Trkola, a professor of medical virology at UZH, this surprising discovery needs to be studied more closely:  First of all, we need to understand more precisely what significance and impact the genetic, geographical and socio-economic factors of people from different ethnicities have on the formation of these antibodies.  Different virus sub-types influence the antibodies  binding site The third factor involves the influence of the virus sub-type on antibody formation. While the frequency of the antibody production remains unaffected, the researchers showed that the virus sub-type has a strong influence on the antibody type formed. Sub-type B HIV viruses are more likely to lead to the production of antibodies directed against the region of the virus surface through which it binds to human immune cells (CD4 binding site). By contrast, non sub-type B virus favor the production of antibodies which bind to a sugar element of the virus spikes (V2 glycan). Specific structural features on the virus shell thus affect the antibodies  binding specificity depending on the virus sub-type.  Our results show how different factors boost the formation of antibodies that broadly combat different viral strains,  concludes Trkola.  This will pave the way for us to systematically push ahead with the development of an effective vaccine against HIV. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

Their discovery may also point the way toward a natural treatment to thwart the pathogen in other important crops grown worldwide including corn and wheat, said plant agriculture professor Manish Raizada. He s senior author of a paper published today in Nature Microbiology. He worked with lead author and former PhD student Walaa Mousa, current graduate student Charles Shearer, Ridgetown Campus scientist Victor Limay-Rios and researchers in California. The paper describes a novel defence mechanism allowing crop plants to work with bacteria called endophytes living in their roots to ward off Fusarium graminearum. This fungus makes a toxin that can sicken livestock and people. The M6 microbe lives in the roots of finger millet, a cereal crop grown by subsistence farmers in Africa and South Asia. Millions of people rely on the crop, first domesticated in East Africa in about 5,000 BC. The crop has long been known to be resistant to fungal disease. Through microscope observations, Mousa learned how the mechanism works. Sensing the pathogen near the plant roots, the microbe enters the soil and multiplies to millions of cells that form a protective barrier on the root surface. Even more striking, Raizada said, the plant s root hairs grow to many times their normal length. Like layers in lasagna, the root hairs and the bacterial cells form a dense mat that traps the fungus. Mousa found that natural products of these endophytic bacteria then kill the fungus.  This appears to be a new defence mechanism for plants,  said Raizada. He likens it to the human immune system, with immobile plant cells  recruiting  mobile microbes to seek out and destroy pathogens. The researchers believe this defence evolved in a kind of evolutionary arms race in the African ancestors of finger millet and Fusarium. The fungus can make an antibiotic against M6 for which the bacterium has developed resistance in turn, Raizada said.  We think subsistence farmers in East Africa over generations may have selected for this special microbe through breeding.  He said the findings may help agricultural companies develop seed treatments using M6 to protect more susceptible and widely grown crops such as corn and wheat against the fungus. Farmers spend tens of millions of dollars fighting crop diseases such as Fusarium. U of G has licensed the lab s results to an agricultural startup company for potential use in those crops. The microbe is now being tested in Canadian corn and wheat. The team found that M6 also protects against other fungi. He said the study shows the importance of indigenous farming knowledge and practices.  These crops should be explored and valued. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

But in species such as zebrafish these cells, known as Muller glial cells (MGs), do serve as retinal stem cells that are capable of generating new cells. In a new study, a research team led by Associate Professor of Ophthalmology Bo Chen investigated whether the regenerative power of cells in zebrafish could be recreated in mammals, specifically mice. The research team transferred genes into MGs to activate the stem cell properties of these normally dormant cells, causing them to reproduce and make other types of retinal cells. The strategy could be developed into a therapeutic tool, Chen said.  In the future we are hoping to manipulate these cells to replenish any lost retinal neurons, either in diseased or physically damaged retinas,  he noted.  Potentially, it s a therapy to treat many different retinal degenerative diseases. ","Published: September 28, 2016"

The trial will assess the efficacy of Raxone in slowing the rate of respiratory function decline in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoids.  We first observed the efficacy of Raxone in slowing the rate of respiratory function decline in DMDpatients in both glucocorticoid-using and non-using patients in the phase II DELPHI study,  commented Thomas Meier, PhD, CEO of Santhera.  The successful Phase III DELOS trial which enrolled glucocorticoid non-using patients then confirmed a clinically relevant and statistically significant benefit of Raxone treatment on pulmonary function. The now initiated Phase III SIDEROS trial is designed to confirm the efficacy of Raxone in patients experiencing respiratory function decline that are currently taking glucocorticoids. If successful, this study will provide data that support use of Raxone in all DMD patients experiencing respiratory decline irrespective of their glucocorticoid use. The high level of interest from investigators and the patient community should allow us to recruit this study quickly.   We are hopeful that this phase III trial is the final step in the development program with Raxone inDMD,  said Gunnar Buyse, MD, PhD, Professor of Child Neurology at the University HospitalsLeuven (Belgium) and SIDEROS PI and Lead Investigator for Europe.  Following the exploratoryphase II program and the successful phase III DELOS trial, I am grateful that Santhera is committedin exploring the full therapeutic potential of Raxone for patients with DMD.   Maintaining pulmonary function in patients with DMD has only recently become a prominent therapeutic objective in DMD, particularly in non-ambulatory patients,  added Oscar Henry Mayer, MD, Medical Director of the Pulmonary Function Testing Laboratory at the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and Lead Investigator for US.

The team studied a lung cancer drug called erlotinib which can be used to treat between 10 and 30 per cent of lung cancer patients. Unfortunately, the drug usually stops working within a few months, due to cancer cells developing resistance to the treatment. In the current study the team showed that the resistance could be reversed using a simple and cheap diuretic, or  water pill , called ethacrynic acid. Professor Michael Seckl, lead author from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial said:  Although these are very early-stage results, and are yet to be applied to patients in trials, they suggest the addition of a very cheap diuretic may extend the amount of time we can use the cancer drug erlotinib. This could potentially provide patients with more treatment options and save money in financially challenged health services.  Almost 2 million people are diagnosed with lung cancer every year worldwide and it is the top international cancer killer. The drug erlotinib is prescribed to between 10 - 30 per cent of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for 85 per cent of all lung cancer cases. Among patients who have this type of lung cancer, nearly one in three will carry a particular genetic mutation on their cancer cells. This mutation is on a particular receptor, or docking site, on the cancer cells that is crucial to the cell s growth and survival. Patients found to have this mutation are prescribed erlotinib, which blocks this mutated receptor and halts cell growth. However, the cancer cells quickly evolve resistance to the drug s deadly effects. Although alternative drugs are available once erlotinib stops working, these are much more expensive   and they can also stop working due to cancer cells developing resistance. Previous studies have found that, in at least half of cases, the cancer cells become resistant to erlotinib by developing a second mutation. But until now scientists only partially understood how this second mutation allowed the cancer cells to protect themselves against erlotinib. In the latest study, the international team revealed new insights into how this additional mutation leads to resistance, opening avenues for new treatments. The scientists found this second mutation lowers levels of a naturally-occurring antioxidant called glutathione. The team found that if they raised glutathione levels in cancer cells in the lab, they reversed resistance to the drug erlotinib, and the treatment was once again able to kill cancer cells. Spurred on by their finding, the team then looked for any other medicines that have been shown to raise glutathione levels. They found the  water pill  ethacrynic acid, a diuretic used for 30 years to treat swelling, fluid retention and high blood pressure, raised glutathione levels. Ethacrynic acid works by triggering the kidneys to remove more water from the body but also blocks the breakdown of glutathione. Mouse studies then confirmed that using the diuretic alongside the cancer drug erlotinib reversed resistance to the drug, and enabled it to kill lung cancer cells. The team are now considering the possibility of translating their findings to human trials, explained Professor Seckl.  We urgently need new treatments for lung cancer patients, and this research suggests we can boost the effectiveness of an existing drug, rather than switch to another new expensive treatment. We are now seeking funding to enable patient trials within the next three years.  The research was supported by the European Commission, Cancer Research UK, Worldwide Cancer Research, Cancer Treatment and Research Trust and the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre.","Published: September 28, 2016"

But how do these sensory pathways emerge during development? Do they share a common structure, or, on the contrary, do they emerge independently, each with its specific features? See Also: Study shows how judgment of sensory simultaneity may develop in the brain By identifying gene expression signatures common to sight, touch and hearing, neuroscientists at the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, discovered a sensory 'lingua franca' which facilitates the brain's interpretation and integration of sensory input. These results, published in Nature, pave the way toward a better understanding of perception and communication disorders. The ability to detect and sort various kinds of stimuli is essential to interact with surrounding objects and people, and to communicate correctly. Indeed, social interaction deficits in people living with autism appear to be partly due difficulties in detecting and interpreting sensory signals. But how does the brain interpret and integrate the stimuli sent by our five senses? This is this very question which Denis Jabaudon, Professor at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and his team have addressed. ""We studied the genetic structure of tactile, visual and auditory pathways in mice,"" explains Laura Frangeul, the study first author. ""By observing neuronal gene expression in these distinct pathways during development, we detected common patterns, as if an underlying genetic language was bringing them together."" Learn More: 3D reconstruction of neuronal networks provides unprecedented insight into organizational principles of sensory cortex The Geneva neuroscientists' results thus reveal that during development, the various sensory pathways initially share a common gene expression structure, which then adapts to the activity of the organ attached to each sense. ""This process only takes a few days in mice but could take up to several months in human beings, whose development is much longer and very sensitive to the environment,"" underlines Denis Jabaudon. This genetic 'lingua franca' therefore allows the various sensory pathways to be built according to a similar architecture regardless of their very different functions. It is this shared language that allows the brain to accurately interpret stimuli coming from different sources, and to compose a coherent representation of their combined meaning. Sharing the same building plan also explains how various pathways can mutually balance out, for example when touch or hearing become highly over-developed in people born blind. This discovery also explains why sensory interferences, including synesthesias and hallucinations, can occur in people suffering from neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or schizophrenia.

Mount Sinai researchers used an experimental imaging agent called [18F]-T807 (or Avid 1451) with PET to examine the brain of a living, 39-year-old retired National Football League (NFL) player who had experienced 22 concussions and exhibited clinical symptoms consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative brain disease that has been associated with repetitive blows to the head in athletes and soldiers. T807 is designed to latch onto a protein called tau that accumulates in the brain as a result of repetitive traumatic brain injury. When the new imaging agent (or ligand) lights up a PET scan of the brain of a patient showing buildup of tau in a characteristic pattern, the scan result is interpreted as being consistent with CTE. Until now, evidence for CTE pathology has only been possible by examining brain tissue after death. See Also: CTE is confirmed as a unique disease that can be definitively diagnosed CTE has a distinctive pattern of tau deposition that was described in 2015 by an expert panel commissioned by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS, US). That panel laid out diagnostic criteria for CTE based on samples of postmortem brain tissue. The surface of the brain is highly wrinkled. The tau accumulation in CTE appears to trace the highly folded surface of the brain and is especially concentrated at the deepest points in the wrinkles and folds. The NINDS panel used the word ""pathognomonic"" to describe the CTE tau pathology pattern. This is a technical term that indicates that whenever you see this pattern of tau pathology, the diagnosis can be nothing other than CTE. There can be no confusion with other tau diseases. ""Our study participant's scan is the first to reveal during life a pattern of tau imaging that outlines the wrinkles and folds of the living brain, just like the 'pathognomonic pattern' described by the NINDS panel as diagnostic of a brain with CTE,"" says Sam Gandy, MD, Director of the Center for Cognitive Health and NFL Neurological Care Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and last author of the study. ""When fully validated, this new ligand has the potential to be used as a diagnostic biomarker and represents an exciting development in the detection and tracking of CTE."" Don't Miss: Scientists discover unique pattern of hidden brain damage in soldiers exposed to high explosive blastsA link between brain injury and long-term health has gained greater attention in recent years, helped along by evidence of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, or tauopathy, that has been clinically confirmed in the postmortem brain tissue of former athletes and soldiers with histories of multiple head traumas. In addition to symptoms such as irritability and extreme mood swings, CTE is associated with the symptoms of various other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's diseases. ""This research is in its infancy,"" says Dara L. Dickstein, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience, and Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and first author of the study. ""Whether or not the pathology can be reversed or halted is something we have yet to determine and these new tauopathy PET scans may be able to help in this endeavor."" Under the leadership of Drs. Gandy and Dickstein, and with primary funding support from the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), Mount Sinai is one of the few medical centers researching the use of the new ligand in living patients who are believed to have CTE. The Mount Sinai team is currently studying 24 patients and plans to establish a clinical trial early next year that will employ the new ligand to identify CTE patients who might respond to an anti-tauopathy medicine that is currently being studied at other medical centers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can't make sufficient thyroid hormone causing individuals to suffer from mood swings, weight gain, hair loss, fatigue, constipation and irregular menstrual cycles. See Also: Study shows association between migraine and carpal tunnel syndrome The study is published in Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain. ""Our study is one of the largest studies published to date suggesting that headache disorders are a risk factor for the future development of hypothyroidism,"" explains Andrew Martin, lead author and a fourth-year medical student at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Andrew Martin, his father, Vincent Martin, MD, and colleagues at the UC College of Medicine, looked at data from 8,412 people enrolled in the Fernald Medical Monitoring Program (FMMP), a 20-year medical monitoring project designed to examine health outcomes of residents living near a former uranium processing plant in Crosby Township, Ohio, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati. They found that residents living near Fernald with pre-existing headache disorders had a 21 percent increased risk of developing new onset hypothyroidism while those with possible migraine showed an increased risk of 41 percent, says Vincent Martin, who is co-director of the Headache and Facial Pain Center at the UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute and professor of medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine. The data showed that those with migraine had the highest likelihood of developing hypothyroidism, which could suggest that persons with migraine are particularly susceptible to this disorder, explains Vincent Martin. Migraine affects about 12 percent of the U.S. population and hypothyroidism typically impacts about 2 percent of Americans, he says. Though rarely life-threatening, migraine and hypothyroidism both lead to decreased quality of life if not treated adequately. Learn More: Large-scale genetic study provides new insight into the causes of migraineOur results may most apply to those with ""more frequent"" headaches as a large percentage of those with headache affirmed that they had ""frequent headaches"" on a screening questionnaire, states Vincent Martin, who is the study's corresponding author and a UC Health physician. The Fernald study results are consistent with past studies showing hypothyroidism to be more common in those with migraine or other headache disorders, but there are differences in how this study was designed compared to previous ones, says Andrew Martin. ""We have a very large sample size and we have measurements of thyroid hormones at different time points throughout the study. We identified people with headache disorders and we followed them forward in time. It is a much stronger study than studies just looking at the association at one point in time,"" says Andrew Martin. ""We also followed these persons for 12 years on average."" The researchers found that female gender, increasing age, obesity and hypothyroid-inducing medications were associated with new onset hypothyroidism, says Susan Pinney, PhD, co-investigator and professor in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati. The findings from the Fernald study are consistent with previous studies. ""One of our study's strengths was our ability to use various forms of data to identify those persons with hypothyroidism,"" says Pinney, who is also research director of the Fernald Community Cohort. ""We also looked at extensive medication logs for certain medications known to cause hypothyroidism. We had yearly information on smoking status and analyzed gender as women are more likely to have both hypothyroidism and migraine."" Researchers found smoking was actually protective against hypothyroidism which has been shown in past studies. ""However, I don't recommend smoking to prevent hypothyroidism as the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers far outweigh any benefit,"" explains Vincent Martin. ""Our study also corroborated past research which suggested certain medications increase the risk of hypothyroidism."" Radiation is a known risk factor for developing hypothyroidism, but no association of uranium exposure and thyroid disease was found in the Fernald study, says Pinney. ""Most of the radiation exposure to the community around Fernald came from radon gas, which would not cause thyroid cancer. Radiation exposure from the types of uranium dust released by the plant was relatively small,"" she says. Andrew Martin says there are several proposed mechanisms that might explain the association between headache disorders and hypothyroidism. Headache disorders activate the immune system, which could predispose to the future development of hypothyroidism. In addition, stress induced by headache disorders could increase its likelihood. Other environmental or genetic factors could be at play as well, explains Andrew Martin.

Monitoring neuronal cell activity is fundamental to neuroscience and the development of neuroprosthetics biomedically engineered devices that are driven by neural activity. However, a persistent problem is the device being able to process the neural data in real-time, which imposes restrictive requirements on bandwidth, energy and computation capacity. See Also: Super-small needle technology for the brainIn a new study, published in Nature Communications, the researchers showed that memristors could provide real-time processing of neuronal signals (spiking events) leading to efficient data compression and the potential to develop more precise and affordable neuroprosthetics and bioelectronic medicines. Memristors are electrical components that limit or regulate the flow of electrical current in a circuit and can remember the amount of charge that was flowing through it and retain the data, even when the power is turned off. Lead author Isha Gupta, Postgraduate Research Student at the University of Southampton, said: ""Our work can significantly contribute towards further enhancing the understanding of neuroscience, developing neuroprosthetics and bio-electronic medicines by building tools essential for interpreting the big data in a more effective way."" The research team developed a nanoscale memristive integrating sensor (MIS) into which they fed a series of voltage-time samples, which replicated neuronal electrical activity. Acting like synapses in the brain, the metal-oxide MIS was able to encode and compress (up to 200 times) neuronal spiking activity recorded by multi-electrode arrays. Besides addressing the bandwidth constraints, this approach was also very power efficient the power needed per recording channel was up to 100 times less when compared to current best practice.

That is the finding of a study from New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center published in EBioMedicine, along with a corresponding commentary. The study found that injections of hyaluronidase reduced muscle stiffness in patients with neurological injury without causing muscle weakness like conventional treatments such as botulinum toxin. See Also: Spinal stimulation helps four patients with paraplegia regain voluntary movement ""These findings fill a critical gap in the understanding of muscle stiffness, and present a promising treatment for spasticity, a vexing problem that affects millions of people worldwide,"" says lead study author Preeti Raghavan, MD, assistant professor in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine and director of Motor Recovery Research at Rusk Rehabilitation at NYU Langone. Spasticity refers to hyperactive reflexes after neurological injury, but a major problem occurs when the spastic muscles become stiff or rigid and impede joint movement, causing pain, muscle contracture, and disability. Along with stroke, common causes of spasticity include traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, brain tumors, and multiple sclerosis. Although a well-established symptom of neurological injury, the factors that worsen spasticity remain poorly understood. Current treatments include central nervous system depressants taken orally, and injectable medications like botulinum toxin, but both cause muscle weakness, which can further impede movement without addressing the stiffness patients feel. Raghavan and colleagues developed an alternative theory for the cause of muscle stiffness following a central nervous system injury they call the ""Hyaluronan Hypothesis."" It postulates that the accumulation of hyaluronan a sugar molecule and common lubricant in joints and muscles promotes the development of muscle stiffness. When a brain injury limits a person's mobility, hyaluronan thickens like honey, which can lead to abnormal sliding of muscle fibers and result in stiffness. Therefore, the researchers believed that an enzyme that breaks down such molecular sugar chains, called hyaluronidase, may reduce their concentration in muscles to reduce stiffness and increase joint movement. Learn More: Case study: Repeated stimulation treatment restores movement to paralyzed musclesTo test this theory, researchers enrolled 20 patients between 10 and 77 years of age, who experienced moderate to severe upper limb stiffness in more than one joint following a neurological injury and had exhausted all available conventional treatments with limited benefits. Each received injections of hyaluronidase at NYU Langone's outpatient hand clinic located at the Hospital for Joint Diseases. Patients underwent video-recorded neurological and musculoskeletal assessments to document their movement restriction and muscle stiffness at four points: prior to injection, 2 weeks post-injection, 4 to 6 weeks after injection, and within 3 to 5 months of injection. Unbiased nurses not involved in the study documented any complaints in medical records. Prior to the injections, 50.6 percent of the joints tested showed moderate stiffness and 44.4 percent of the joints tested showed severe stiffness, as captured by the Modified Ashworth Scale, a standard measure of stiffness. This number dropped to 15.3 percent with moderate stiffness and 5.8 percent with severe stiffness within 2 weeks of the injections. Hyaluronidase took effect within days to two weeks, with effects that lasted for at least three months. The treatment did not produce muscle weakness or clinically significant side effects in the reported case series. Hyaluronidase may provide a relatively less expensive option for patients with spasticity, according to Raghavan. One vial of hyaluronidase typically costs $50, and a single treatment may require 4 to 8 vials, while one vial of botulinum toxin may cost at least $500, and treatment may require up to 4 or more vials. Raghavan plans to begin a clinical trial to further study the effects of hyaluronidase in a greater number of patients, and adds that more research is needed to determine the effects of repeated hyaluronidase administrations overtime, although 15 of the 20 patients returned for additional injections. Read Next: Researchers more accurately define role of dopamine neurons in movement ""This case series provides preliminary evidence for the safety and potential efficacy of hyaluronidase injections as a treatment for muscle stiffness that may enhance recovery in the spastic upper limb.

Hyaluronidase treatment for muscle spasticity is considered off-label. No pharmaceutical funding was received, and NYU Langone has filed a patent for hyaluronidase for muscle stiffness.

The Soviet Union produced anthrax spores on an industrial scale but repeatedly denied the existence of their biological weapons program. This study, to be published in the September issue of the journal mBio, represents a precise and detailed examination of the anthrax strain used in their weapons development, and includes an anthrax genetic database that puts the weapons strain into a global context. ""I have been studying this anthrax outbreak and these specimens for more than 20 years. Finally, using genomic technology, we could comprehensively characterize this pathogen genome,"" said Dr. Paul Keim, a Regents Professor of Biology and the Cowden Endowed Chair of Microbiology at NAU, Director of TGen's Pathogen Genomics Division, and the study's lead author. ""This is the signature agent of the world's largest biological weapons program and now we have it in our genetic databases. Anywhere this strain shows up again, we will be able to identify it and track it back to its source. This is now an essential part of our forensic arsenal,"" said Dr. Keim, who also is Director of NAU's Microbial Genetics & Genomics Center (MGGen). The anthrax bacterium produces small capsules, or spores, that can lie dormant for decades. After settling inside the human lung, for example, it can cause a severe disease that, if not treated with antibiotics, kills 90 percent of those it infects. Anthrax is found in many parts of the globe and dispersed through the human movement of animal parts contaminated with spores. Wool and hair from goats and sheep are moved globally as textiles or their precursors. When these originate in anthrax endemic regions, they can carry the spores, which are long-lived. While this bacterium has little variation from strain to strain, whole genome sequencing has identified DNA fingerprints that enable molecular epidemiology, tracing it to its source. When anthrax outbreaks occur, their whole genome profile are now routinely compared to the genetic database to identify possible sources and exclude others. This type of analysis was used by the FBI to track the spores in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks, which infected 22 people and killed five. The Soviet Union had signed the Biological Weapons convention that prohibited the use of biological agents, including anthrax, as weapons. The United States' biological weapons program was eliminated in a decree by President Richard Nixon in 1969, but the Soviet program was maintained and expanded in a covert fashion for decades. In 1992, an investigative team from the United States led by noted Harvard biologist Dr. Matt Meselson characterized the 1979 Sverdlovsk outbreak by interviewing local physicians, visiting cemeteries and examining autopsy specimens. This investigation, along with accounts by Ken Alibek, a former Soviet scientist, revealed that the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak was due to an industrial accident.  A faulty filter at a Soviet spore production facility allowed anthrax spores, in a silent plume, to drift with the wind over the city and into the nearby countryside. Nearly 70 Sverdlovsk inhabitants died as far as three miles downwind from the facility, but more anthrax-susceptible farm animals died over 25 miles away. It remains the world's deadliest human outbreak of inhalation anthrax. The bacterial genomes were generated from autopsy tissue specimens of two Sverdlovsk anthrax victims. These tissues were moved to the United States with permission of Sverdlovsk pathologists to continue the investigation into the disease outbreak. From these, it was established that the anthrax pathogen was detected within their tissues and the victims died from inhaling the spores. The Sverdlovsk anthrax genome was compared to the global genome database maintained by NAU to identify its close relatives and to look for evidence of genetic engineering. The Flagstaff research team found that this strain was closely related to other Asian isolates with very few differences to naturally occurring anthrax. There were no signs of genetic engineering. Dr. Keim notes that the Soviets had to be very meticulous to avoid mutant variants from dominating their production stock. Invariably when wild anthrax strains are grown extensively in the laboratory, they adapt to those conditions and lose the killing power. ""The Sverdlovsk strain's genome looked very much like those of wild strains we see across Asia,"" Dr. Keim said. Dr. Meselson, who was not part of the current paper, notes: ""If this strain had been grown repeated in the laboratory, it would have mutated to a form that had less virulence and less capacity to cause anthrax. The Soviet scientists must been very meticulous in their maintenance of the natural form."" Dr. Meselson, who is the Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences at Harvard, is known for his 1961 discovery of messenger RNA. This study was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.","Published: September 27, 2016"
