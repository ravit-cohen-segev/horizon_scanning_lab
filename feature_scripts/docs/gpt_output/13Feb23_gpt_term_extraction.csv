As soon as they enter ‘Change Game', players are put in control of the world and their destiny. They have to decide how to use resources to advance their civilisation while dealing with the consequences of their decisions. They can invest in research, education and entertainment, and have to be mindful of the health, happiness and prosperity of their community. The higher the level of emissions players generate, the greater the challenges they will face, as all game scenarios are based on real climate data and scientific research. Just like in the real world, their cities may then encounter heatwaves, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and/or the spread of new diseases. Every action taken has consequences, positive or negative, on the planet: everything is governed by the climate emergency. Change Game allows people to learn, while playing, about many aspects of climate change, even if they are not very familiar with its impacts or with strategies to reduce emissions. Players do so by managing the production and consumption of energy, water and food, while coping with natural disasters. They also have the"

With the increased efforts towards decarbonisation set by the EU Green Deal and the knowledge that technological progress will lead to progressive electrification, the EIT Community has now the requirement to immediately prioritise battery research, with a holistic approach across the entire battery value chain.4. Following the Platform's prerogative, the agenda identifies topics across the value chain and the relative urgency in which they need to be tackled in order to foster the energy transition.5. Batteries Europe is the one-stop-shop for battery research in Europe, coordinating the efforts of research centres and industry in making Europe a competitive, sustainable and self-sufficient actor in the global battery scene."

other news sites45," Share When it rains, it pours. A paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds that it’s raining harder in most of the United States. The study, written by researchers at Northwestern University, tied the results to climate change and to warmer air’s ability to hold more water.

ArrowRight Record rain is hitting drought-stricken areas. That’s not good news. The findings echo the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics, as well as the evidence from decades of research, and highlight the real-time effect that humans are having on the weather and climate. The research offers confirmation of what atmospheric scientists have been warning of for years: a warmer world is, on balance, a wetter world. And as global temperatures continue to rise, an uptick in precipitation extremes is expected. Climate change is causing heavier rains What the study finds is consistent with a basic tenet of atmospheric physics: For every degree Fahrenheit that air temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold 4 percent more water; this is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.
