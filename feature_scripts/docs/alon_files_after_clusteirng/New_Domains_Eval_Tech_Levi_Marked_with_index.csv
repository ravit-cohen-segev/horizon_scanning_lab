Peak load conditions, taking place when multiple users are accessing a website application concurrently, can be a nightmare for IT departments: crashes and slowdowns in these situations, are far too common and even a limited 2-hour crash can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost revenues. Typically, such issues are linked to a new product release, breaking news or a sales opening which causes a significant and sudden increase in traffic. A resilient and scalable system, in these circumstances, can make all the difference between failure and success. Some successful companies have measured the exact impact of performances on their business:Amazon estimatesthat only 100 ms latency equals -1% in sales, whereas theBBCsaw a 10% decrease in users because of a 1-second latency. Gatlings load-test-as-code approach and its interoperability make it possible to perform load tests very early in the development lifecycle and to automate them. Moreover,Gatlingpromotes a collaborative approach of load testing within organizations, involving all their departments, from IT to Marketing. Today, everyone talks about scalability. But you cant scale your business if your app is not scalable. Dont let your app become a victim of its own success: test it! Paul-Henri Pillet, Gatling co-founder and CEO Gatling brought major changes in the load testing industry since it was created in mid-2015. Today, it has customers on 5 continents and doubles its revenues each year. 'Gatling has an impressive proposition: a superior technology bundled with a disruptive approach. They are enabling developers to test as they code, making it suddenly possible to fit with Agile and Continuous Delivery models which are so critical for those websites and apps facing massive numbers of visitors such as e-retail, media and banks,' said EIT Digitals business developer Gilles Allain. The scaleups R&D efforts target the latest trends in the tech world, including HTTP/2 support, load tests for Internet of Things, integrations with most of the cloud providers of the market (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack-based providers), integrations with Kubernetes and with most of the developers tools (source repositories, build tools, continuous integration solutions). 'We have become the reference solution for load testing, thanks to our investments in R&D over the years. EIT Digital will now help us strengthen our position in our existing markets and open new markets in Europe and beyond! This shall confirm our position as a tech leader in the following years,' saidPaul-Henri Pillet. TheEIT Digital Acceleratorprovides tailor-made growth support for European tech scale-ups by helping secure international customers and raise capital. In 2019, the programme was recognised by UBI Global as a World Top Public Business Accelerator in the World Benchmark Study 2019-2020, and ranked Top 4 Accelerator Brand in the Startup Heatmap Report Europe.",14_digital_eit_eur_accelerator,Diffusion among early adopters,

However, the potential of digital transformation needs to be translated into the successful implementation of these new technologies in the raw materials industry. On 11 February 2020, thekickoff meetingof the EIT RawMaterials-supported project AMICOS was held in Trento, Italy, at the premises of the research centre Fondazione Bruno Kessler, leader of the project. AMICOS (Autonomous monitoring and control system for Mining Plants) is a new project awarded almost EUR 2.5 million over three years by EIT RawMaterials. The main projects objective is to support the digital transformation of the raw materials industry with an innovative asset management solution that will increase the market adoption of digital technology in mines. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter AMICOS end-to-end solution is composed of three main concepts: Digital mines use technologies developed by the so-called Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) for more efficient, sustainable and safer operations. Most of these innovative and emerging technologies are included in AMICOS. The project's main objective is to offer an end-to-end solution that enhances the monitoring of mining operations. Special focus is placed on improving tailings dams and pipeline monitoring, as well as on the predictive maintenance of mining equipment, such as conveyor belts. We are going to be working with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, drones, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, advanced data analytics, and decision-making tools based on Artificial Intelligence, to name a few. The use of these advanced technologies will mean key benefits for the mining operators: improve workforce safety, reduce maintenance and monitoring costs, and create more sustainable mines. We are tackling the issues raised by the mining industry itself. Denis Guilhot, Senior EU Project Manager at Worldsensing AMICOS is built upon a strong team of experts that includes research organisations, technology providers and mining companies. In AMICOS the direct involvement of mining groups, like ArcelorMittal, Atlantic Copper and KGHM, as project partners ensure the relevance of the project outputs. Nowadays mining groups are very ambitious with their technological aspirations to manage risk in operations. We are very excited about this new EIT RawMaterials project and look forward to contributing to sustainable mining and environment protection with our technology.

Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected todouble in the next 20 years to 8.2 billion air travellersthe emissions of the travel industry alonewill exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people dont realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the targeta 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levelsis still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Along with these reforms, EIT Community also needs bold, technological innovation to get off fossil jet fuel. EIT Climate-KIC has invested in a number of exponential technologies, such as electric helicopter taxiVolocopterand five-seater electric jetLilium, which are paving the way towards the aviation industrys dream: Electric flight. It will be a while before full-sized commercial aircraft go electric. Battery technology is not yet advanced enough to power planes for the distances they cover and weight they carry. Fuel is still 40 to 50 times more power-dense. With the average plane 100 times heavier than a mid-sized car, batteries need to become much more compact and more powerful per kilogram.

But that technology is not yet ready to be scaled up Maarten van Dijk, SkyNRGs managing director Creating and supplying sustainable biofuels, such as the one SkyNRG has developed from waste oils, takes 8-10 years from the lab stage to production and hundreds of millions of euros. But van Dijk is not deterred by detractors who say alternative fuel development is too slow, or that it distracts attention and investment from electric flight. We need it all. First we have to reduce the amount of fossil fuel needed with everything we can do. Reduction of demand, smarter flying, better taxing. Then, electric! The more electric, the better.

Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected todouble in the next 20 years to 8.2 billion air travellersthe emissions of the travel industry alonewill exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people dont realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the targeta 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levelsis still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Along with these reforms, EIT Community also needs bold, technological innovation to get off fossil jet fuel. EIT Climate-KIC has invested in a number of exponential technologies, such as electric helicopter taxiVolocopterand five-seater electric jetLilium, which are paving the way towards the aviation industrys dream: Electric flight. It will be a while before full-sized commercial aircraft go electric. Battery technology is not yet advanced enough to power planes for the distances they cover and weight they carry. Fuel is still 40 to 50 times more power-dense. With the average plane 100 times heavier than a mid-sized car, batteries need to become much more compact and more powerful per kilogram.

Amgen, whose status was upgraded from an EIT Health Associate Partner to a Core Partner at the beginning of 2020, ran the EIT Health #ProtectUrLife project in 2018 and 2019. Other EIT Health partners involved were Technical University of Munich and the University of Barcelona. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter #ProtectUrLife raises awareness and alerts individuals with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.Cardiovascular disease is a significant health challenge and isthe main cause of death in Europe, while osteoporosis, which is characterised by low bone density, leads to fractures and other life-altering health problems. Both of these conditions are often preventable if people know how to protect their health through lifestyle measures such as healthy eating and physical activity #ProtectUrLife aims to improve the prevention, assessment and treatment of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, two currently underdiagnosed and undertreated health conditions in Europe. Amgen advocates for a predict-and-prevent approach to healthcare, one that will intervene early in appropriate patients to improve outcomes and quality of life. Educational activities such as public screenings play a key role in advancing this vision. Isma Benattia, M.D., Medical Vice President for Amgen in Europe To help citizens understand and manage the risks, #ProtectUrLife visits busy locations in cities around Europe to provide free screenings for bone density and heart health by using innovative digital systems. People were also able to speak to healthcare professionals and receive additional information on bone and heart health during the awareness days. Last year, the initiative visited Lucerne, Malaga, Munich, Paris and Rimini. In 2018, ProtectUrLife visited Barcelona, Brussels, Munich, Nice, Rimini and Zurich.

The event was held by EIT Climate-KIC in partnership with the Crowther Lab, ETH Zurich. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter The first-place cities project from Penang focused on improving social resilience, as well as nature-based solutions to reduce the heat island effect. The winning citizen project from Estonia, Woola, tackled waste by replacing e-commerce packaging with sheep wool. Both winners will receive a cash prize to invest in their project and ongoing technical support from the EIT Climate-KIC network. Its incredibly exciting and an honour for Penang to be the first city winner of the Global Climathon Awards. There are places in the world where the climate in 2050 will be vastly different from what it is today. Penang is one of these citiesthis is the challenge. We believe that our nature-based approach can make a real difference to the lives of Penangites, who are already regularly suffering the impacts of extreme weather, including flooding, heat stroke and heat stress. Our research will begin with climate-resilient species of trees that can help cool our communities and prevent flooding, and we also hope to raise awareness and increase understanding that climate change impacts have to be tackled in the hearts of our cities. Sofia Castelo, Think City The real value of winning this award is in the recognition. It gives us a lot of credibility and a capital boost to test out our solution. We know that the planets resources are finite, and we have to rethink how we approach materials and waste. Businesses are using the wrong kind of materials, 96 per cent of it isnt recycled and it takes a huge amount of energy to produce. We think sheeps wool is an ideal solutionour project is shock proof, heat proof and totally compostable. When were talking about climate change, raising awareness is always good, but a practical solution is always better. Anna-Liisa Palatu, Woola Global Climathon Day took place in October 2019. A record-breaking 6 500 participants took part, with 24-hour hackathons taking place in 56 countries spanning four continents. This years Climathon will take place in November during COP26, offering citizens from all over the world a pathway to positive action, and through that mobilisation the possibility to spark systemic change.

The system was developed by the team behindStockholm3andOncoWatch, two projects supported by EIT Health. Find out more about Stockholm3 The study, involving the same team and led by Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, showed that the AI system had considerable accuracy in determining whether a sample contained cancer, and in estimating the length of the cancer tumour in the biopsy. Furthermore, the AI system was comparable with 23 international, leading uropathologists in determining the Gleason score, the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer. Our AI tool has the potential to reduce the workload of uropathologists, allowing them to focus on the most difficult cases and at the same time act as a safety net to improve quality. It also has the potential to speed up diagnostics and reduce costs for healthcare services. Martin Eklund, Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet The Karolinksa team launched the blood-based prostate cancer diagnostic test called Stockholm3 in 2017.Stockholm3 doubles the number of aggressive cancers that are identified, whilst also reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice with PSA.Stockholm3 is currently used in clinical practice in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3 and the new AI system, OncoWatch through network and financial support. As part of the development of OncoWatch, the AI system will be validated in 2020 in a nine-country multicentre study to assess its performance across different labs and in a wider range of digital pathology scanners. A first CE-marked product is expected to launch by the end of the year. There is a high demand for improved tools in prostate cancer diagnostics and we have proven that we can take new innovative tests to the market. The Stockholm3 test was used in more than 20,000 men in the Nordics alone in 2019, and I believe that our new AI system, OncoWatch, will also have strong uptake Martin Steinberg, Project leader for EIT Health-backed OncoWatch Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in Europe, withapproximately 450000 new cases each year.Early diagnosis and treatment of aggressive prostate cancer is crucial to survival. Prostate cancer blights the lives of a large number of men in Europe each year, and despite the advent of new and innovative diagnostics and treatments, we still see too many men die from the condition. Prostate cancer is often treatable with early diagnosis and effective treatment, and AI represents a large opportunity to complement existing medical expertise within the diagnostic process. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health 'The results of the study demonstrate the exciting developments that are happening in the field of AI, and how the technology can be applied to medical practice to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe. EIT Health is proud to support both the Stockholm3 and OncoWatch projects in the development of improved diagnostic tools to tackle prostate cancer,' added Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health.",12_cancer_cell_cells_influenza,,Cancer risk assessment based on genetic test
