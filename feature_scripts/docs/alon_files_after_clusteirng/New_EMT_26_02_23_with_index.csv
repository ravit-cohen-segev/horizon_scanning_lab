Peak load conditions, taking place when multiple users are accessing a website application concurrently, can be a nightmare for IT departments: crashes and slowdowns in these situations, are far too common and even a limited 2-hour crash can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost revenues. Typically, such issues are linked to a new product release, breaking news or a sales opening which causes a significant and sudden increase in traffic. A resilient and scalable system, in these circumstances, can make all the difference between failure and success. Some successful companies have measured the exact impact of performances on their business:Amazon estimatesthat only 100 ms latency equals -1% in sales, whereas theBBCsaw a 10% decrease in users because of a 1-second latency. Gatlings load-test-as-code approach and its interoperability make it possible to perform load tests very early in the development lifecycle and to automate them. Moreover,Gatlingpromotes a collaborative approach of load testing within organizations, involving all their departments, from IT to Marketing. Today, everyone talks about scalability. But you cant scale your business if your app is not scalable. Dont let your app become a victim of its own success: test it! Paul-Henri Pillet, Gatling co-founder and CEO Gatling brought major changes in the load testing industry since it was created in mid-2015. Today, it has customers on 5 continents and doubles its revenues each year. 'Gatling has an impressive proposition: a superior technology bundled with a disruptive approach. They are enabling developers to test as they code, making it suddenly possible to fit with Agile and Continuous Delivery models which are so critical for those websites and apps facing massive numbers of visitors such as e-retail, media and banks,' said EIT Digitals business developer Gilles Allain. The scaleups R&D efforts target the latest trends in the tech world, including HTTP/2 support, load tests for Internet of Things, integrations with most of the cloud providers of the market (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack-based providers), integrations with Kubernetes and with most of the developers tools (source repositories, build tools, continuous integration solutions). 'We have become the reference solution for load testing, thanks to our investments in R&D over the years. EIT Digital will now help us strengthen our position in our existing markets and open new markets in Europe and beyond! This shall confirm our position as a tech leader in the following years,' saidPaul-Henri Pillet. TheEIT Digital Acceleratorprovides tailor-made growth support for European tech scale-ups by helping secure international customers and raise capital.

However, the potential of digital transformation needs to be translated into the successful implementation of these new technologies in the raw materials industry. On 11 February 2020, thekickoff meetingof the EIT RawMaterials-supported project AMICOS was held in Trento, Italy, at the premises of the research centre Fondazione Bruno Kessler, leader of the project. AMICOS (Autonomous monitoring and control system for Mining Plants) is a new project awarded almost EUR 2.5 million over three years by EIT RawMaterials. The main projects objective is to support the digital transformation of the raw materials industry with an innovative asset management solution that will increase the market adoption of digital technology in mines. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter AMICOS end-to-end solution is composed of three main concepts: Digital mines use technologies developed by the so-called Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) for more efficient, sustainable and safer operations. Most of these innovative and emerging technologies are included in AMICOS. The project's main objective is to offer an end-to-end solution that enhances the monitoring of mining operations. Special focus is placed on improving tailings dams and pipeline monitoring, as well as on the predictive maintenance of mining equipment, such as conveyor belts. We are going to be working with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, drones, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, advanced data analytics, and decision-making tools based on Artificial Intelligence, to name a few. The use of these advanced technologies will mean key benefits for the mining operators: improve workforce safety, reduce maintenance and monitoring costs, and create more sustainable mines. We are tackling the issues raised by the mining industry itself. Denis Guilhot, Senior EU Project Manager at Worldsensing AMICOS is built upon a strong team of experts that includes research organisations, technology providers and mining companies. In AMICOS the direct involvement of mining groups, like ArcelorMittal, Atlantic Copper and KGHM, as project partners ensure the relevance of the project outputs. Nowadays mining groups are very ambitious with their technological aspirations to manage risk in operations. We are very excited about this new EIT RawMaterials project and look forward to contributing to sustainable mining and environment protection with our technology.

Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected todouble in the next 20 years to 8.2 billion air travellersthe emissions of the travel industry alonewill exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people dont realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the targeta 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levelsis still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Along with these reforms, EIT Community also needs bold, technological innovation to get off fossil jet fuel.

Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected todouble in the next 20 years to 8.2 billion air travellersthe emissions of the travel industry alonewill exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people dont realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the targeta 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levelsis still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport.

Its incredibly exciting and an honour for Penang to be the first city winner of the Global Climathon Awards. There are places in the world where the climate in 2050 will be vastly different from what it is today. Penang is one of these citiesthis is the challenge. We believe that our nature-based approach can make a real difference to the lives of Penangites, who are already regularly suffering the impacts of extreme weather, including flooding, heat stroke and heat stress. Our research will begin with climate-resilient species of trees that can help cool our communities and prevent flooding, and we also hope to raise awareness and increase understanding that climate change impacts have to be tackled in the hearts of our cities. Sofia Castelo, Think City The real value of winning this award is in the recognition. It gives us a lot of credibility and a capital boost to test out our solution. We know that the planets resources are finite, and we have to rethink how we approach materials and waste. Businesses are using the wrong kind of materials, 96 per cent of it isnt recycled and it takes a huge amount of energy to produce.

The system was developed by the team behindStockholm3andOncoWatch, two projects supported by EIT Health. Find out more about Stockholm3 The study, involving the same team and led by Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, showed that the AI system had considerable accuracy in determining whether a sample contained cancer, and in estimating the length of the cancer tumour in the biopsy. Furthermore, the AI system was comparable with 23 international, leading uropathologists in determining the Gleason score, the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer. Our AI tool has the potential to reduce the workload of uropathologists, allowing them to focus on the most difficult cases and at the same time act as a safety net to improve quality. It also has the potential to speed up diagnostics and reduce costs for healthcare services. Martin Eklund, Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet The Karolinksa team launched the blood-based prostate cancer diagnostic test called Stockholm3 in 2017.Stockholm3 doubles the number of aggressive cancers that are identified, whilst also reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice with PSA.Stockholm3 is currently used in clinical practice in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3 and the new AI system, OncoWatch through network and financial support. As part of the development of OncoWatch, the AI system will be validated in 2020 in a nine-country multicentre study to assess its performance across different labs and in a wider range of digital pathology scanners. A first CE-marked product is expected to launch by the end of the year. There is a high demand for improved tools in prostate cancer diagnostics and we have proven that we can take new innovative tests to the market. The Stockholm3 test was used in more than 20,000 men in the Nordics alone in 2019, and I believe that our new AI system, OncoWatch, will also have strong uptake Martin Steinberg, Project leader for EIT Health-backed OncoWatch Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in Europe, withapproximately 450000 new cases each year.Early diagnosis and treatment of aggressive prostate cancer is crucial to survival. Prostate cancer blights the lives of a large number of men in Europe each year, and despite the advent of new and innovative diagnostics and treatments, we still see too many men die from the condition. Prostate cancer is often treatable with early diagnosis and effective treatment, and AI represents a large opportunity to complement existing medical expertise within the diagnostic process. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health 'The results of the study demonstrate the exciting developments that are happening in the field of AI, and how the technology can be applied to medical practice to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe.

She is also a member of the EIT Health Supervisory Board, a member of the Board of Trustees of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region and shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board of ABB AG. EIT Community hasa fairly segmented approach to the provision of healthcare today. As patients, EIT Community sees doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and many other healthcare professionals helping us to maintain or regain good health. They must plan together, treat patients together, and talk to one another, a dynamic that often needs to be continued in the long term, particularly for chronic diseases. This becomes a challenge when processes, regulation and mindsetare not all focused on integration of care. The growth in medical knowledge necessitates increased specialisation, which is valuable but results in fragmentation that requires a challenging level of governing infrastructure and reimbursement principles. Integrating healthcare to provide seamless end-to-end care will reduce costs by optimising interfaces, reducing redundancies and avoiding communication breaks and information gaps. It will improve outcomes by making information easily available and providing constant feedback loops for all involved in care. It will enable truly personalised care. And it will help to shift the focus from treating disease to maintaining health, thereby promising both better healthcare and reduced costs. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member Some of the main challenges that I believe EIT Community must address in order to develop, nurture and scale integrated care models across Europe include: Tackling all of these challenges is, of course, no small task. WhileEIT Community may still be some years away from total reform, EIT Community isseeing pilots testing integrated healthcare on a regional level or focused on a disease. One example is the 'Gesundes Kinzigtal' model (GK) in Germany, where healthcare within a local community has been organised as an innovative integrated care system.The GK model focuses on three key principles:better population health, improved experience of care, and reduced per-capita costs. The results of the GK model clearly demonstrated that patient satisfaction and population health can be improved while decreasing the overuse of health services and medicines. In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation projectiPDM-GOis improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation projectiPDM-GOis improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform that integrates diagnostic results with relevant medication and personal information  to help patients and their doctors achieve better short- and long-term outcomes. Controlling blood glucose levels is a highly complex process and a major task for patients. Although monitoring and treatment are readily available, staying within the required blood-sugar range remains a challenge. Providing individual feedback loops and continuous information for patients and doctors can help avoid long-term complications and associated pain and cost.  Another EIT Health project, calledSeizeIT, is addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection. Currently, seizures are being reported with a patient diary, or are measured during hospital stays. This provides a lot of room for seizures to be underreported, but accuracy is relevant to establishing optimal care. By providing a discreet device that patients can wear at home, SeizeIT is working towards a reality where all seizures can be detected. This will improve patient lives and help medical professionals understand more about the condition, and improve treatments available. The variety of healthcare systems across Europe share some common challenges. Integrated healthcare is one of those. EIT Health offers an opportunity to explore pilots and innovative approaches to achieve this vision.

Designed with insights from established pioneers in the field and laid out in a practical handbook, the framework describes key steps healthcare providers can take to fully realise the opportunity presented by VBHC. Unlike traditional volume-based healthcare provision, modelled on fees for-products or services, VBHC provides a methodology for measurable healthcare outcomes that make the biggest difference to patients, while driving cost efficiencies within health services. The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that around 30% of resources currently spent on healthcare are wasted on avoidable complications, unnecessary treatments or administrative inefficiencies. Tackling this waste head on, the publication from EIT Health aims to kick-start change towards measurable value, in order to support more sustainable models for healthcare. The new EIT Health publication Implementing Value-Based Health Care: Handbook for Pioneers, includes an Implementation Matrix with a clear and structured framework for healthcare providers to follow. The Matrix details five key steps to help healthcare providers activate and accelerate VBHC: 1)recording; 2)comparing; 3)rewarding; 4)improving; and 5)partnering. It outlines how to measure and maximise the outcomes that matter to patients, and addresses the main challenges, such as lack of standardised outcome data and resistance to change. Read the handbook Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health, explains the need for this work: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in VBHC in the health community in Europe; however the focus has been on why it is the way forward, rather than how we effectively implement such a change. This is why we created this framework, to provide an in-depth guide on how health care managers and practitioners can orient efforts and resources towards necessary transformation. Currently, many of Europes health care systems measure the wrong things, which can lead to inefficiencies in cost, time and resources, not to mention the impact on the patient. Metrics focus on volume rather than patient outcomes, and this is simply unsustainable for health care systems. At EIT Health, we are uniquely placed to connect successful pioneers in the field with those just starting out, and to share tools and best practices to help measure outcomes to drive this cultural shift within Europes health care systems. Development of this EIT Health handbook has been directed by Professor Gregory Katz of the University Paris School of Medicine and achieved in collaboration with esteemed experts from across leading European organisations. The new framework is based on several VBHC case studies from some of Europes leading healthcare providers, including: Uppsala Academic Hospital, which reduced the number of unnecessary ambulance dispatches by 17%; Basel University Hospital, which improved the median time from stoke symptom to treatment onset by 14%; and NHS Wales, which identified that in 19% of cases, high-cost cataract surgery had no real impact on a patients activity limitations in daily life. According to Professor Gregory Katz: Today in Europe, VBHC pioneers are choosing to take bold action to measure, compare and improve patient outcomes. This momentum is mainly building from the bottom up, through entrepreneurial initiatives. As care results vary tremendously between therapeutic approaches and medical teams, transparent outcome benchmarks enable the detection of medical innovations and the reduction of inappropriate care. There are good reasons to be impatient for improving health care through VBHC, but there are also reasons to be humble. VBHC is still in its infancy, and successful implementation takes time. Becoming a VBHC early adopter opens the opportunity to learn proactively and spearhead high-value care. The handbook was commissioned by EIT Health under its Think Tank thought leadership forum, which explores the most pressing topics for the health of Europe and its citizens. The EIT Health Think Tank brings healthcare leaders together, across disciplines and borders, to prepare the ground for life-changing innovation and identify the next opportunity for a transformation in how healthcare is delivered. The launch of the handbook marks the first in a series of activities being launched by EIT Health that are designed to support a step-change in the provision of healthcare and to integrate VBHC as the new norm across Europe.

All of us who have grandparents or elderly relatives have had some experience with pressure ulcers - a medical condition caused by long-term bed rest. In truth, it is a health problem that could be avoided, according to Mohammad Amini. And he does not just talk about it but leads a team that has invented a product to predict the risks. Both my grandparents died while suffering from pressure ulcers, saysMohammad Amini, the Team Leader ofSensoMatt. That was the point when he first started thinking about a solution. Since pressure ulcers affect not just the elderly, but also disabled people and other patients lying in hospitals, it is a common medical problem that needs treatment. ""My grandparents were old, but the pressure ulcer phenomena and the pain caused by the wounds made me think about why there is no reliable solution to alert and forecast,"" he says. Last year, Amini and his uncle started to develop their solution. It contains hardware and an AI-based structure for prediction. ""After I talked with a friend of mine about AI development, we started to produce our MVP[minimum viable product], and then enrolled in the EIT Digital Venture Program due to a friends recommendation. The scope of EIT Digital's Venture Program is nothing other than helping ideas like SensoMatts reach markets and customers. The team had the first ideas and a basic prototype in 2019.
