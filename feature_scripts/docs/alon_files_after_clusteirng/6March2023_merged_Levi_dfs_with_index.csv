other news sites765,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/12/1059266/us-trial-cancer-blood-tests-early-detection/,The US is launching a trial for blood tests that promise to catch cancers earlier,"Questions remain about how to interpret MCED test results. Only some blood tests can pinpoint which organ the cancer is actually in. Lab tests must be run on potentially cancerous tissue to confirm a diagnosis, but you canât biopsy someoneâs entire body. False positives remain an issue for the entire field of cancer screening, which, by design, involves sifting through mounds of healthy tests to find cancer. Galleriâthe MCED furthest along the path to widespread useâincorrectly flagged 57 healthy blood samples as cancerous in the aforementioned study.Thereâs also a risk of jumping the gunâsome cancers never become invasive or life-threatening, but early detection could prompt harsh treatment like chemotherapy. Some data suggests that less worrisome cancers actually show up in the bloodstream less, which could minimize that problem.The NIC trial will help determine how blood test results for cancer should be interpreted, and it should provide a standard approach to launching cancer screening studies as companies flood the field with new tests.âI don't think most companies tend to want to compare their tests head to head,â says Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard. âIt's expensive and difficult. So somebody else, a neutral party like the NCI, needs to.âRebbeck thinks the blood tests the new trial will vet will prove most helpful in the cases of pancreatic, liver, and ovarian cancer, which kill often and have no other form of screening. Still, longer trials are needed to confirm whether the time bought by these blood tests saves lives.But Rebbeck is optimistic about the Cancer Moonshotâs ultimate goal: âIt seems very realistic to me to think that we could reduce death by half,â he says.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,bloodtest for multiple cancers,,2.0,Cancer biomarker,Commercial R&D

techcrunch801,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/07/flyfeed-angel-round/,FlyFeed flies in the face of the global food crisis,"FlyFeed claims it signed more than $10 million worth of contracts and closed a $3 million round of investment to launch its first insect farm in Vietnam, in its push to produce low-cost, high-nutrient protein for human consumption.The company was founded less than a year ago and is targeting the three billion people who are facing food insecurity due to climate and global financial shifts. The production process uses organic leftovers as food for the black soldier fly (BSF) insects, which significantly reduces the final price of manufactured protein. As a bonus, it also helps reduce local food waste issues.âFive billion dollars invested in agtech in 2021 shows that the fragile global food chain, relying on exhaustible natural resources, faces new challenges and needs a change. In this case, insect proteins are an effective solution that can transform inedible resources into nutritious proteins. Supported by laboratory tests and approved by local authorities, we will open 10 farms in Asia and Africa by 2026 and contribute to solving the global food shortage crisis,â says Arseniy Olkhovskiy, CEO and founder of FlyFeed, in an interview with TechCrunch. âThere are many things I find wrong with the world, but the fact that global hunger still exists is the most absurd. There are more than three billion people who cannot afford healthy food, and almost one billion live in food insecurity. The worst part is that this number continues to rise. Until we rethink our food chain, this wonât change because conservative agriculture isnât designed to feed a growing population.âIn the first instance, the insects will be used for animal feed and pet food, with future plans to include turning the insects into flour that can be used for human food in five years or so. The plan is for the first farm in Vietnam to produce 17.5+ thousand tons of insect products per year, including insect fat, protein flour and fertilizers, and process 40+ thousand tons of organic leftovers for BSF feed, gathered and processed for free by a partnership with local authorities.The $3 million angel round will be used to establish operations, further develop technological solutions and construct the first industrial-sized farm in Vietnam in 2023, producing affordable proteins, oils and fertilizers from insects.âWith personal money invested and this seed round, weâve been able to build an infrastructure that unlocks our scale. Our production technology was developed by our specialists and world-class engineering teams, we secured resources in Vietnam for construction and operations, we signed over $10 million in pre-contracts to verify demand and validate our product development strategy, and we built an A-class team and advisory board to support the company,â says Olkhovskiy. âFlyFeedâs goal is to feed 250 million people annually, providing nutritious and wholesome food to those who donât have access to it or canât afford it. This means 250 million more people can live healthier and happier lives and focus on what matters to them. And all of these while helping nature instead of harming it and providing other companies producing food with sustainable nutrients and fertilizers.â",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,insects as food,insect farm,0.0,already in list,Diffusion within early adopters

techcrunch772,https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/scanbo-non-invasive-blood-glucose/,How sweet is your bloodScanbo gives an answer without poking holes in you,"If you have diabetes, or ever suspected that you might, you will have done the poke-your-finger-and-drop-blood-on-a-stick thing until your finger goes numb. Finger-prick blood glucose monitoring is the de facto standard, but AI company Scanbo wants to put an end to all that, replacing the droplet with some off-the-shelf diagnostic tools and a big helping of data analysis.The company has developed a prototype device that combines a three-lead ECG measurement and a Photoplethysmogram (PPG). The 60-second measurement is fed to a set of algorithms that can give you some very promising measurements. For starters, the device is doing non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, but the companyâs founder claims that it can also do blood pressure measurements.I spoke to the companyâs founder and CEO, Ashissh Raichura, as part of TechCrunchâs virtual CES coverage, where he told me a bit more about the technology. He also gave me a demonstration, first testing his own blood with a conventional, off-the-shelf fingerprick blood glucose monitor, and then with the companyâs own prototype. The measurements were 6.2 and 6.3 mmol/L, respectively, which puts the two devices within a couple of percent accuracy of each other.âWe use the three electrodes for ECG data, and an additional measurement for PPG. We measure for 60 seconds, and then take the raw data and analyze that using the machine learning convolutional neural network, and the deep neural network. We combine all of that data, take the three machine learning algorithms, see what comes as a result, and then analyze the glucose,â Raichura told me, as he was preparing to demo the device for me. âWe want to commercialize our product, and will be looking looking for US FDA in Health Canada approval.âI was surprised to learn that it is possible to do non-invasive blood glucose measuring â most of the so-called non-invasive methods do use an implant or a filament sensor wire to get readings, but the method that Scanbo uses has been studied and covered in medical journals. It doesnât look like the FDA has approved any products that take this approach yet, so the company is certainly facing a lengthy medical approval process in order to bring its products to market.The company also claims it is able to do blood pressure measurements, the kind that you might do at home or in the doctorâs office with a blood pressure cuff.âWhen we take your EKG data, we convert that into what is called a short wave transmission length,â Raichura summarizes in how the company is able to pull off blood pressure metrics. âBased on that, we calculate your non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure too. That is another piece of algorithm that we have patent pending.âWith all of this tech in its back pocket, the company has an interesting choice to make; is it going to start manufacturing its own hardware devices, or is there an opportunity to license the algorithms and technology to other manufacturers that already have devices with PPG and ECG capabilities on the market.âWe have two patents pending, purely on the hardware, how we designed it, how we amalgamated electrodes and all the sensors in a way where we can take all the parameters in one time,â explains Raichura, hinting at how the company is trying to measure all the things at once. âIf you look at the traditionally available all the devices, you measure one thing at a time, not everything at once. You do blood pressure one time, your EKG at another time. One after another, all in sequential processes. In our case, we are asking you to put four fingers on the device, so we can capture all the data, and use algorithms to report different aspects of your health.âScanbo sees its technology as an at-home alternative to some of the currently existing clinical techniques and technology.âAs a company, we are a combination of AI and med-tech,â Raichura says, and mentions that the market is starting to take notice. âWith this product, we are just getting started now. Medtronic, Samsung, LG, and others are already talking to us and see can we collaborate with them, and we are exploring a couple of strategic partnerships that could help us in taking us to different markets globally. We see the needs from 400 million people in the world with type two diabetes, and most of the populations canât afford glucometers â never mind continuous glucose meters. We are very, very cost-effective, and we can bring the cost down to as low as $20 a month. There is no biowaste, you donât need any disposables, you donât need strips or anything, just purely the machine learning algorithm and a device with a chargeable battery.âThe company is about to take its prototype and clinical results as leverage to go raise a seed round and kick off the process toward regulatory approval and, eventually, make a product available to the public.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,bloodless glucose level test,"a three-leadÊECG measurementÊand aÊPhotoplethysmogramÊ(PPG) measurement are run for 60 seconds, the run through 3 machine learning algorithms to find glucose level in blood",2.0,,Diffusion within early adopters

Above, members of the Anderson lab at work. Credit: John Zich/University of ChicagoScientists with the University of Chicago have discovered a way to create a material that can be made like a plastic, but conducts electricity more like a metal.The research, published Oct. 26 in Nature, shows how to make a kind of material in which the molecular fragments are jumbled and disordered, but can still conduct electricity extremely well.This goes against all of the rules we know about for conductivityâto a scientist, it's kind of like seeing a car driving on water and still going 70 mph. But the finding could also be extraordinarily useful; if you want to invent something revolutionary, the process often first starts with discovering a completely new material.""In principle, this opens up the design of a whole new class of materials that conduct electricity, are easy to shape, and are very robust in everyday conditions,"" said John Anderson, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and the senior author on the study. ""Essentially, it suggests new possibilities for an extremely important technological group of materials,"" said Jiaze Xie (Ph.D. '22, now at Princeton), the first author on the paper.'There isn't a solid theory to explain this'Conductive materials are absolutely essential if you're making any kind of electronic device, whether it be an iPhone, a solar panel, or a television. By far the oldest and largest group of conductors is the metals: copper, gold, aluminum. Then, about 50 years ago, scientists were able to create conductors made out of organic materials, using a chemical treatment known as ""doping,"" which sprinkles in different atoms or electrons through the material.This is advantageous because these materials are more flexible and easier to process than traditional metals, but the trouble is they aren't very stable; they can lose their conductivity if exposed to moisture or if the temperature gets too high.But fundamentally, both of these organic and traditional metallic conductors share a common characteristic. They are made up of straight, closely packed rows of atoms or molecules. This means that electrons can easily flow through the material, much like cars on a highway. In fact, scientists thought a material had to have these straight, orderly rows in order to conduct electricity efficiently.Then Xie began experimenting with some materials discovered years ago, but largely ignored. He strung nickel atoms like pearls into a string of of molecular beads made of carbon and sulfur, and began testing.To the scientists' astonishment, the material easily and strongly conducted electricity. What's more, it was very stable. ""We heated it, chilled it, exposed it to air and humidity, and even dripped acid and base on it, and nothing happened,"" said Xie. That is enormously helpful for a device that has to function in the real world.But to the scientists, the most striking thing was that the molecular structure of the material was disordered. ""From a fundamental picture, that should not be able to be a metal,"" said Anderson. ""There isn't a solid theory to explain this.""Xie, Anderson, and their lab worked with other scientists around the university to try to understand how the material can conduct electricity. After tests, simulations, and theoretical work, they think that the material forms layers, like sheets in a lasagna. Even if the sheets rotate sideways, no longer forming a neat lasagna stack, electrons can still move horizontally or verticallyâas long as the pieces touch.The end result is unprecedented for a conductive material. ""It's almost like conductive Play-Dohâyou can smush it into place and it conducts electricity,"" Anderson said.The scientists are excited because the discovery suggests a fundamentally new design principle for electronics technology. Conductors are so important that virtually any new development opens up new lines for technology, they explained.One of the material's attractive characteristics is new options for processing. For example, metals usually have to be melted in order to be made into the right shape for a chip or device, which limits what you can make with them, since other components of the device have to be able to withstand the heat needed to process these materials.The new material has no such restriction because it can be made at room temperatures. It can also be used where the need for a device or pieces of the device to withstand heat, acid or alkalinity, or humidity has previously limited engineers' options to develop new technology.The team is also exploring the different forms and functions the material might make. ""We think we can make it 2D or 3D, make it porous, or even introduce other functions by adding different linkers or nodes,"" said Xie.More information: John Anderson, Intrinsic glassy-metallic transport in an amorphous coordination polymer, Nature (2022).

other news sites773,https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/new-mrna-vaccine-universal-flu-shot,Scientists use mRNA technology to create a potent flu vaccine that could last for years,"In the spring of 1933 , three scientists at the U.K.âs Medical Research Council received a treasure trove of vials containing human mucus from sick hospital patients. It was gross, yes, but not unwarranted: The culprit behind what had caused the 1918 influenza pandemic was still at large.Months later, the trio of scientists published a paper that found that a virus, not a novel strain of bacteria like some within the scientific community originally thought, was to blame. Over the following decades, other scientists unfurled the gnarly branches of the large influenza family tree, gathering enough information to formulate a vaccine, which (hopefully) most of us get before every flu season.But hereâs the catch: Influenza is a master shapeshifter. Every year, strains of the virus that infect humans â influenza type A and B â evolve in ways that evade vaccines and, subsequently, our immune systems. This results in uneven vaccine effectiveness from year to year and also undermines efforts to pack a flu shot with a broad, long-lasting immune punch.But we may have an ace in the hole thanks to mRNA, the same technology used for our Covid-19 vaccines. In a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and other institutions have cooked up an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that targets four viral proteins that tend to remain the same across different strains of influenza.â[Itâs] a nice study with significant clinical implications that uses the same strategy as for Covid vaccination to create a better flu vaccine with broader capabilities by targeting multiple conserved flu [viral proteins] antigens instead of the way we do it now, which is to grow candidate strains in eggs and then inactivate them,â Anne Davidson, a researcher at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York, who was not involved in the study, told Inverse in an email.Artistic rendering of a molecule of hemagglutinin. ShutterstockHereâs the background â Flu vaccines are updated every year based on influenza patterns most recently seen in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia; its flu season runs from April to October.Scientists pay close attention to one sugar-covered protein called hemagglutinin that dots the surface of the influenza virus, Norbert Pardi, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who co-led the study, tells Inverse.âHemagglutinin has two major parts: the head domain, which is variable and immunodominant, [and a stalk domain],â explains Pardi. âThe current seasonal vaccines that use three or four inactivated [influenza] viruses primarily target the immunodominant head domainâ¦ but the problem is that the virus can change that pretty easily and escape from protective immunity.âA better option would be to target viral proteins that donât switch up and stay pretty much the same regardless of which strain of influenza youâre infected with, says Pardi and Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who also co-led the study.Those proteins include neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein 2, all of which help the virus make copies of itself.Krammer says while there have been efforts over the years to include conserved influenza proteins, such studies have run up against failure and a whole host of hurdles. For example, to measure a potential shotâs effectiveness, scientists look to see whether it triggers an immune response, indicated via the presence of antibodies.âThe vaccines that weâre testing these proteins with, they donât induce those types of antibodies that are used as correlates,â explains Krammer. âSo thereâs not a lot of confidence during clinical development.âOf the four different types of influenza, A and B primarily infect humans. ShutterstockHow they did it â What has really made the dream of a potent flu shot come alive, says Pardi and Krammer, is messenger RNA (or mRNA) technology, the same used for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTechâs Covid-19 vaccines. It involves taking a piece of genetic code that isnât capable of altering anyoneâs DNA and instructing it to make a particular type of protein that the immune system can then learn to recognize and target.For their influenza vaccine, the researchers created an mRNA cocktail encoding the four influenza proteins neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 2, and the stalk portion of hemagglutinin (which is conserved compared to its head domain).The vaccine was then injected into a group of twenty or so naive mice who had never experienced influenza before. They either got a quadrivalent jab (meaning all four mRNA segments for each protein was present) or monovalent (the conventional flu vaccine or vaccines containing an individual mRNA for any one of the proteins). Some animals received one shot, while others lucked out with one shot plus a booster four weeks later. The mice were then challenged with an assortment of different influenza strains, both that infect humans and other animals like dogs.What they found â There were two important phenomena the researchers noticed. First, while both the quadrivalent and monovalent jabs encouraged antibody production, only the quadrivalent shot protected the mice against the viral challenge, with exception of the monovalent vaccine containing nucleoprotein, which seemed to protect vaxxed mice from death.While antibodies tend to hog the vaccine limelight, immune cells called T cells, which roam the body and kill infected cells, are also crucial in the fight against viruses. Pardi, Krammer, and their colleagues found that the nucleoprotein-specific jab encouraged a class of cytotoxic T cells that studies have found play an important role in protection against severe influenza infection in humans and animal models.On average around five to 20 percent of Americans will get the flu every year. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp drop in the number of flu cases reported. bluecinema/E+/Getty ImagesKrammer says this motley of immune responses to the four different influenza viral proteins suggests it's more powerful to have a colorful vaccine cocktail rather than a drab monotone.âWhen we mix all of them together, we get the broadest immune response,â he says. âYou get the engagement of T cells against the nucleoprotein, you get antibodies, and we get a pretty strong neuraminidase response. Thatâs kind of the beauty here that youâre flexible in what types of [viral proteins] you useâ¦ and you have a lot of possibilities to try [out].âThe researchers also expect it wouldnât need to undergo annual updates as our current ones do. Instead, they might last for a few years.Whatâs next â While mice studies are the launch point for future studies into other organisms like monkeys and eventually humans, Pardi and Krammer say itâs not clear whether what we see in mice will necessarily translate to us. For one, humans donât have a naive immune system like the mice used in the study. Our pre-existing immunity against the flu may impact the quality of any potential vaccineâs antibody response, according to some studies.âClinical trials will be necessary to see how vaccines can overcome the issue with the shortfall from previous immunity,â says Pardi. âPretty much all adults have antibodies against the flu, and we need to see how our vaccine can overcome this issue.âIt may take several years of research and clinical trials before their mRNA influenza vaccine sees the light of day, say Pardi and Krammer. In the meanwhile, thereâs no point waiting: Go get your flu shot, dear reader.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,mRNA-based influenza vaccine,,2.0,,Scientific research

other news sites849,https://news.nus.edu.sg/novel-technique-to-grow-meat-in-the-lab-using-magnetic-field/,NUS scientists develop novel technique to grow meat in the lab using magnetic field,"Scientist from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have found a novel way of growing cell-based meat by zapping animal cells with a magnet. This new technique simplifies the production process of cell-based meat by reducing reliance on animal products, and it is also greener, cleaner, safer and more cost-effective.Cultured meat is an alternative to animal farming with advantages such as reducing carbon footprint and the risk of transmitting diseases in animals. However, the current method of producing cultured meat involves using other animal products, which largely defeats the purpose, or drugs to stimulate the growth of the meat.To cultivate cell-based meat, animal cells are fed animal serum â usually foetal bovine serum (FBS), which is a mixture harvested from the blood of foetuses excised from pregnant cows slaughtered in the dairy or meat industries â to help them grow and proliferate. This is a critical, yet cruel and expensive, step in the current cell-based meat production process. Ironically, many of these molecules come from the muscles within the slaughtered animal, but scientists did not know how to stimulate their release in production scale bioreactors. Other methods to promote cell growth are using drugs or relying on genetic engineering.The complex production process for cell-based meat increases cost, limits the manufacturing scale and undermines the commercial viability of cell-based meat.To help address this challenge, a multidisciplinary research team led by Associate Professor Alfredo Franco-ObregÃ³n, who is from the NUS Institute for Health Innovation & Technology and the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, came up with an unconventional method of using magnetic pulses to stimulate the growth of cell-based meat.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,magnetically-stimulated secretome release,replacement for Fetal bovine serum for cultured meat and tool for regenerative medicine speeding healing,3.0,,Scientific research

A new technology demonstrated for the first time by Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Greg Lowry and his team reverses that â causing a plant to absorb molecules with up to 99% efficiency, meaning only 1% is wasted.There are efficiency improvements, and then there are technology demonstrations that could completely upend current methods of doing things â like this one. Lowryâs research, which has been demonstrated as outlined in a peer-review publication now available in Nanoscale Communications, makes use of nanoparticles to coat molecular substances that you would want to be absorbed by a plant. These could include nutrients designed to optimize growth and crop yields, for instance, or pesticides that could protect them from destructive bugs and infestations.We covered this work last year, when it was still just at the pre-demonstration stage â now, Lowryâs team has shown that you can indeed engineer nanoparticles specifically to target pores on the surface of a leaf. Essentially, itâs like custom-creating Lego blocks for receptors on the leafâs surface and then tying the nutrients you want to deliver to those custom Lego blocks for a perfect fit.This demonstration bears out the teamâs hypothesis, which sets the stage for potential further development and, eventually, commercial application. The biggest potential commercial use of this technology could be in pesticides, as itâs estimated that as much as 40% of potential crop yield is still lost to plant disease thatâs preventable with effective use of pesticides that can block them from entering through pores on leaves. They could also improve absorption of plant food and fertilizer designed to stimulate growth, and potentially these two uses could be combined into a single âdoseâ of nanoparticles that can do double duty, with great potential to increase plant and crop output.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,nanoparticle coating,nutrient & persiticide coating that increases uptake and minimizes pollution,3.0,,Scientific research

That demand could be lowered with a window coating that could block the sun's ultraviolet and near-infrared lightâthe parts of the solar spectrum that typically pass through glass to heat an enclosed room. Energy use could be reduced even further if the coating radiates heat from the window's surface at a wavelength that passes through the atmosphere into outer space. However, it's difficult to design materials that can meet these criteria simultaneously and can also transmit visible light, meaning they don't interfere with the view. Eungkyu Lee, Tengfei Luo and colleagues set out to design a ""transparent radiative cooler"" (TRC) that could do just that.The team constructed computer models of TRCs consisting of alternating thin layers of common materials like silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide or titanium dioxide on a glass base, topped with a film of polydimethylsiloxane. They optimized the type, order and combination of layers using an iterative approach guided by machine learning and quantum computing, which stores data using subatomic particles. This computing method carries out optimization faster and better than conventional computers because it can efficiently test all possible combinations in a fraction of a second. This produced a coating design that, when fabricated, beat the performance of conventionally designed TRCs in addition to one of the best commercial heat-reduction glasses on the market.In hot, dry cities, the researchers say, the optimized TRC could potentially reduce cooling energy consumption by 31% compared with conventional windows. They note their findings could be applied to other applications, since TRCs could also be used on car and truck windows. In addition, the group's quantum computing-enabled optimization technique could be used to design other types of composite materials.More information: High-Performance Transparent Radiative Cooler Designed by Quantum Computing, ACS Energy Letters (2022).

The vaccine is based on a spherical protein ânanoparticleâ that was created by researchers nearly a decade ago, through a labour-intensive trial-and error-process1.Now, thanks to gargantuan advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a team led by David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, reports in Science2,3 that it can design such molecules in seconds instead of months.âThe entire protein universeâ: AI predicts shape of nearly every known proteinSuch efforts are a part of a scientific sea change, as AI tools such as DeepMindâs protein-structure-prediction software AlphaFold are embraced by life scientists. In July, DeepMind revealed that the latest version of AlphaFold had predicted structures for every protein known to science. And recent months have seen an explosive growth in AI tools â some based on AlphaFold â that can quickly dream up completely new proteins. Previously, this had been a painstaking pursuit with high failure rates.âSince AlphaFold, thereâs been a shift in the way we work with protein design,â says Noelia Ferruz, a computational biologist at the University of Girona, Spain. âWe are witnessing very exciting times.âMost efforts are focused on tools that can help to make original proteins, shaped unlike anything in nature, without much focus on what these molecules can do. But researchers â and a growing number of companies that are applying AI to protein design â would like to design proteins that can do useful things, from cleaning up toxic waste to treating diseases. Among the companies that are working towards this goal are DeepMind in London and Meta (formerly Facebook) in Menlo Park, California.âThe methods are already really powerful. Theyâre going to get more powerful,â says Baker. âThe question is what problems are you going to solve with them.âFrom scratchBakerâs laboratory has spent the past three decades making new proteins. Software called Rosetta, which his lab started developing in the 1990s, splits the process into steps. Initially, researchers conceived a shape for a novel protein â often by cobbling together bits of other proteins â and the software deduced a sequence of amino acids that corresponded to this shape.But these âfirst draftâ proteins rarely folded into the desired shape when made in the lab, and instead ended up stuck in different confirmations. So another step was needed to tweak the protein sequence such that it folded only into a single desired structure. This step, which involved simulating all the ways in which different sequences might fold, was computationally expensive, says Sergey Ovchinnikov, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who used to work in Bakerâs lab. âYou would literally have, like, 10,000 computers running for weeks doing this.âWhat's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolutionBy tweaking AlphaFold and other AI programmes, that time-consuming step has become instantaneous, says Ovchinnikov. In one approach developed by Bakerâs team, called hallucination, researchers feed random amino-acid sequences into a structure-prediction network; this alters the structure so that it becomes ever-more protein-like, as judged by the networkâs predictions. In a 2021 paper, Bakerâs team created more than 100 small, âhallucinatedâ proteins in the lab and found signs that about one-fifth resembled the predicted shape4.AlphaFold, and a similar tool developed by Bakerâs lab called RoseTTAFold, were trained to predict the structure of individual protein chains. But researchers soon discovered that such networks could also model assemblies of multiple interacting proteins. On this basis, Baker and his team were confident they could hallucinate proteins that would self-assemble into nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes; these would be made up of numerous copies of a single protein and would be similar to those on which the COVID-19 vaccine is based.Nik Spencer/Nature; Source: Adapted from N. Ferruz et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.31.505981 (2022); and J. Wang et al. Science 377, 387â394 (2022).But when they instructed microorganisms to make their creations in the labs, none of the 150 designs worked. âThey didnât fold at all: they were just gunk at the bottom of the test tube,â says Baker.Around the same time, another researcher in the lab, machine-learning scientist Justas Dauparas, was developing a deep-learning tool to address what is known as the inverse folding problem â determining a protein sequence that corresponds to a given proteinâs overall shape3. The network, called ProteinMPNN, can act as a âspellcheckâ for designer proteins created using AlphaFold and other tools, says Ovchinnikov, by tweaking sequences while maintaining the moleculesâ overall shape.When Baker and his team applied this second network to their hallucinated protein nanoparticles, it had much greater success making the molecules experimentally. The researchers checked 30 of their new proteins using cryo-electron microscopy and other experimental techniques, and 27 of them matched the AI-led designs2. The teamâs creations included giant rings with complex symmetries, unlike anything found in nature. In theory, the approach could be used to design nanoparticles corresponding to almost any symmetric shape, says Lukas Milles, a biophysicist who co-led the effort. âIt is electrifying to see what these networks can do.âDeep-learning revolutionDeep-learning tools such as proteinMPNN have been a game changer in protein design, says Arne Elofsson, a computational biologist at Stockholm University. âYou draw your protein, push a button, and you get something that one in ten times works.â Even higher success rates can be achieved by combining multiple neural networks to tackle different parts of the design process, as Bakerâs team did in designing the nanoparticles. âNow we have full control over the shape of the protein,â says Ovchinnikov.Bakerâs isnât the only lab applying AI to protein design. In a review paper posted to the bioRxiv this month, Ferruz and her colleagues counted more than 40 AI protein-design tools that have been developed in recent years, using various approaches5 (see âHow to design a proteinâ).Many of these tools, including proteinMPNN, tackle the inverse folding problem: they specify a sequence that corresponds to a particular structure, often using approaches borrowed from image-recognition tools. Some others are based on an architecture similar to that of language neural networks such as GPT-3, which produces human-like text; but, instead, the tools are capable of producing novel protein sequences. âThese networks are able to âspeakâ proteins,â says Ferruz, who has co-developed one such network6.With so many protein-design tools available, itâs not always clear how best to compare them, says Chloe Hsu, a machine-learning researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who developed an inverse folding network with researchers from Meta7.Four examples of protein âhallucinationâ. In each case, AlphaFold is presented with a random amino-acid sequence, predicts the structure, and changes the sequence until the software confidently predicts that it will fold into a protein with a well-defined 3D shape. Colours show prediction confidence (from red for very low confidence, through yellow and light blue to dark blue for very high confidence). Initial frames have been slowed down for clarity. Credit: Sergey OvchinnikovMany teams gauge their networkâs ability to accurately determine the sequence of an existing protein from its structure. But this doesnât apply for all methods, and itâs not clear how this metric, known as recovery rate, applies to the design of novel proteins, say scientists. Ferruz would like to see a protein-design competition, analogous to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, in which AlphaFold first demonstrated its superiority over other networks. âItâs a dream. Something like CASP would really move the field forward,â she says.To the wet labBaker and his colleagues are adamant that making a novel protein in the lab is the ultimate test of their methods. Their initial failure to make hallucinated protein assemblies shows this. âAlphaFold thought they were fantastic proteins, but they clearly didnât work in the wet lab,â says Basile Wicky, a biophysicist in Bakerâs lab who co-led the effort, along with Baker, Milles and UW biochemist Alexis Courbet.But not all scientists developing AI tools for protein design have easy access to experimental set-ups, notes Jinbo Xu, a computational biologist at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in Illinois. Finding a lab to collaborate with can take time, so Xu is establishing his own wet lab to put his teamâs creations to the test.Experiments will also be essential when it comes to designing proteins with specific tasks in mind, says Baker. In July, his team described a pair of AI methods that allow researchers to embed a specific sequence or structure in a novel protein8. They used these approaches to design enzymes that catalyse particular reactions; proteins capable of binding to other molecules; and a protein that could be used in a vaccine against a respiratory virus that is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations.Last year, DeepMind launched a spin-off company called Isomorphic Labs in London that intends to apply AI tools such as AlphaFold to drug discovery. DeepMindâs chief executive, Demis Hassabis, says that he sees protein design as an obvious and promising application for deep-learning technology, and for AlphaFold in particular. âWeâre working quite a lot in the protein design space. Itâs pretty early days.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,fast protein design,better version of AlphaFold,2.0,Protein Structure Prediction,Diffusion within innovators

The SRBAL can only support a patient for up to two weeks, making it more suitable for keeping someone alive until a donor can be located rather than as a permanent, pacemaker-like solution.The bioprinting and implantation of replacement livers has also shown promise, though they too are still in early development and largely not near ready for widespread adoption.

Pig kidneys and livers have similarly been transplanted into human recipients, often with less drastic side effects than death.No matter where the transplanted organ comes from, getting it into the patient is invariably going to involve a significant surgical procedure. However, the Lygenesis company recently unveiled its non-invasive solution: tricking the patientâs body into growing a series of miniature, ectopic liver âorganoidsâ in its own lymphatic system like a crop of blood-scrubbing potatoes.For those of you who dozed through high school bio, a quick recap of terms. The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system that serves to circulate some 20 liters of lymph throughout your body, absorb excess interstitial fluids back into the bloodstream, and incubate critical lymphocytes like T-cells . Organoids, on the other hand, are biological masses artificially grown from stem cells that perform the same functions as natural organs , but do so ectopically, in that they function in a different part of the body as a regular liver. Blood-scrubbing potatoes are self-explanatory.âFundamentally, Lygenesis uses the lymph node, your body's natural bio reactors typically used for T-cells,â company CEO and co-founder Michael Hufford, told Engadget. âWe hijacked that same biology, we engraft our therapies into the lymph nodes to grow functioning ectopic organs.ââWe use an outpatient endoscopic ultrasound procedure where we're going down through the mouth of the patient using standard endoscopic equipment,â Hufford continued. âWe engraft ourselves there in minutes under light sedation, so it's very low medical risk and also is really quite inexpensive.â He notes that the average cost for a proper, in-hospital liver transplant will set you back around a million dollars. Lygenesisâ outpatient procedure âis billed at a couple of thousand or so,â he said.More importantly, the Lygenesis technique doesnât require a full donated liver, or even a large fraction of one. In fact, each donated organ can be split among several dozen recipients. âUsing our technology a single donated liver can reach 75 or more patients,â Hofford said. The process of converting a single donated liver into all those engraftable samples takes a team of three technicians more than six hours and 70 steps to complete. The process does not involve any gene manipulation, such as CRISPR editing.This process is quite necessary as patients cannot donate culturable liver cells to themselves. âOnce you have end-stage liver disease, you typically have a very fibrotic liver ,â Hofford noted. âIt will bleed at the slightest sort of intervention.â Even the simple act of collecting cellular samples can quickly turn deadly if the wrong bit of organ is bisected.And itâs not only the transplant recipients themselves who are unable to donate.

However, the Lygenesis company recently unveiled its non-invasive solution: tricking the patientâs body into growing a series of miniature, ectopic liver âorganoidsâ in its own lymphatic system like a crop of blood-scrubbing potatoes.For those of you who dozed through high school bio, a quick recap of terms. The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system that serves to circulate some 20 liters of lymph throughout your body, absorb excess interstitial fluids back into the bloodstream, and incubate critical lymphocytes like T-cells . Organoids, on the other hand, are biological masses artificially grown from stem cells that perform the same functions as natural organs , but do so ectopically, in that they function in a different part of the body as a regular liver. Blood-scrubbing potatoes are self-explanatory.âFundamentally, Lygenesis uses the lymph node, your body's natural bio reactors typically used for T-cells,â company CEO and co-founder Michael Hufford, told Engadget. âWe hijacked that same biology, we engraft our therapies into the lymph nodes to grow functioning ectopic organs.ââWe use an outpatient endoscopic ultrasound procedure where we're going down through the mouth of the patient using standard endoscopic equipment,â Hufford continued. âWe engraft ourselves there in minutes under light sedation, so it's very low medical risk and also is really quite inexpensive.â He notes that the average cost for a proper, in-hospital liver transplant will set you back around a million dollars. Lygenesisâ outpatient procedure âis billed at a couple of thousand or so,â he said.More importantly, the Lygenesis technique doesnât require a full donated liver, or even a large fraction of one. In fact, each donated organ can be split among several dozen recipients. âUsing our technology a single donated liver can reach 75 or more patients,â Hofford said. The process of converting a single donated liver into all those engraftable samples takes a team of three technicians more than six hours and 70 steps to complete. The process does not involve any gene manipulation, such as CRISPR editing.This process is quite necessary as patients cannot donate culturable liver cells to themselves. âOnce you have end-stage liver disease, you typically have a very fibrotic liver ,â Hofford noted. âIt will bleed at the slightest sort of intervention.â Even the simple act of collecting cellular samples can quickly turn deadly if the wrong bit of organ is bisected.And itâs not only the transplant recipients themselves who are unable to donate. Hofford estimates between 30 and 40 percent of donated livers are too worn to be successfully transplanted. âOne of the benefits of our technology is we're using organs that have been donated but will otherwise be discarded,â he said.Once engrafted into a lymph node, the liver organoid will grow and vascularize over the course of two to three months, until it is large enough to begin supporting the existing liver. Hufford points out that even with end-stage disease, a liver can retain up to 30 percent of its original functionality, so these organoids are designed to augment and support the existing organ rather than replace it outright.Lygenesis is currently in Phase 2A of the FDA approval process , meaning that a small group of four patients have each received a single engraftment in a lymph node located in their central body cavity near the liver itself (the body has more than 500 lymph nodes and apparently this treatment can technically target any of them). Should this initial test prove successful subsequent study groups will receive increasing numbers of engraftment, up to a half dozen, to help the company and federal regulators figure out the optimal number of organoids to treat the disease.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,ectopic organoid,transplant alternatives,3.0,,Diffusion within innovators

On Wednesday at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN, Taylor showed the audience the scaffolding of a pigâs heart infused with human stem cells â creating a viable, beating human heart the body will not reject. Why? Because itâs made from that personâs own tissues.âNow we can truly imagine building a personalized human heart, taking heart transplants from an emergency procedure where youâre so sick, to a planned procedure,â Taylor told the audience.âThat reduces your risk by eliminating the need for (antirejection) drugs, by using your own cells to build that heart it reduces the cost â¦ and you arenât in the hospital as often so it improves your quality of life,â she said.Debuting on stage with her was BAB, a robot Taylor painstakingly taught to inject stem cells into the chambers of ghost hearts inside a sterile environment. As the audience at Life Itself watched BAB functioning in a sterile environment, Taylor showed videos of the pearly white mass called a âghost heartâ begin to pinken.Video Ad Feedback Can we grow a personalized human heart? 24:16 - Source: CNNâItâs the first shot at truly curing the number one killer of men, women and children worldwide â heart disease. And then I want to make it available to everyone,â said Taylor to audience applause.âShe never gave up,â said Michael Golway, lead inventor of BAB and president and CEO of Advanced Solutions, which designs and creates platforms for building human tissues.âAt any point, Dr. Taylor could have easily said âIâm done, this just isnât going to work. But she persisted for years, fighting setbacks to find the right type of cells in the right quantities and right conditions to enable those cells to be happy and grow.âGiving birth to a heartTaylorâs fascination with growing hearts began in 1998, when she was part of a team at Duke University that injected cells into a rabbitâs failed heart, creating new heart muscle. As trials began in humans, however, the process was hit or miss.âWe were putting cells into damaged or scarred regions of the heart and hoping that would overcome the existing damage,â she told CNN. âI started thinking: What if we could get rid of that bad environment and rebuild the house?âTaylorâs first success came in 2008 when she and a team at the University of Minnesota washed the cells out of a ratâs heart and began to work with the translucent skeleton left behind.Soon, she graduated to using pigâs hearts, due to their anatomical similarity to human hearts.âWe took a pigâs heart, and we washed out all the cells with a gentle baby shampoo,â she said. âWhat was left was an extracellular matrix, a transparent framework we called the âghost heart.ââThen we infused blood vessel cells and let them grow on the matrix for a couple of weeks,â Taylor said. âThat built a way to feed the cells we were going to add because weâd reestablished the blood vessels to the heart.âThe next step was to begin injecting the immature stem cells into the different regions of the scaffold, âand then we had to teach the cells how to grow up.ââWe must electrically stimulate them, like a pacemaker, but very gently at first, until they get stronger and stronger. First, cells in one spot will twitch, then cells in another spot twitch, but they arenât together,â Taylor said. âOver time they start connecting to each other in the matrix and by about a month, they start beating together as a heart. And let me tell you, itâs a âwowâ moment!âThis ""ghost heart,"" created by using the scaffolding of a pig's heart and injected it with human stem cells, may soon be ready for human clinical trials. Advanced Solutions Life SciencesBut thatâs not the end of the âmotheringâ Taylor and her team had to do. Now she must nurture the emerging heart by giving it a blood pressure and teaching it to pump.âWe fill the heart chambers with artificial blood and let the heart cells squeeze against it. But we must help them with electrical pumps, or they will die,â she explained.The cells are also fed oxygen from artificial lungs. In the early days all of these steps had to be monitored and coordinated by hand 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Taylor said.âThe heart has to eat every day, and until we built the pieces that made it possible to electronically monitor the hearts someone had to do it person â and it didnât matter if it was Christmas or New Yearâs Day or your birthday,â she said. âItâs taken extraordinary groups of people who have worked with me over the years to make this happen.âBut once Taylor and her team saw the results of their parenting, any sacrifices they made became insignificant, âbecause then the beauty happens, the magic,â she said.âWeâve injected the same type of cells everywhere in the heart, so they all started off alike,â Taylor said. âBut now when we look in the left ventricle, we find left ventricle heart cells. If we look in the atrium, they look like atrial heart cells, and if we look in the right ventricle, they are right ventricle heart cells,â she said.âSo over time theyâve developed based on where they find themselves and grown up to work together and become a heart. Nature is amazing, isnât she?âBillions and billions of stem cellsAs her creation came to life, Taylor began to dream about a day when her prototypical hearts could be mass produced for the thousands of people on transplant lists, many of whom die while waiting. But how do you scale a heart?âI realized that for every gram of heart tissue we built, we needed a billion heart cells,â Taylor said. âThat meant for an adult-sized human heart we would need up to 400 billion individual cells. Now, most labs work with a million or so cells, and heart cells donât divide, which left us with the dilemma: Where will these cells come from?âThe answer arrived when Japanese biomedical researcher Dr. Shinya Yamanaka discovered human adult skin cells could be reprogrammed to behave like embryonic or âpluripotentâ stem cells, capable of developing into any cell in the body. The 2007 discovery won the scientist a Nobel Prize, and his âinduced pluripotent stem cells (iPS),â soon became known as âYamanaka factors.ââNow for the first time we could take blood, bone marrow or skin from a person and grow cells from that individual that could turn into heart cells,â Taylor said. âBut the scale was still huge: We needed tens of billions of cells. It took us another 10 years to develop the techniques to do that.âThe solution? A bee-like honeycomb of fiber, with thousands of microscopic holes where the cells could attach and be nourished.âThe fiber soaks up the nutrients just like a coffee filter, the cells have access to food all around them and that lets them grow in much larger numbers. We can go from about 50 million cells to a billion cells in a week,â Taylor said. âBut we need 40 billion or 50 billion or 100 billion, so part of our science over the last few years has been scaling up the number of cells we can grow.âAnother issue: Each heart needed a pristine environment free of contaminants for each step of the process. Every time an intervention had to be done, she and her team ran the risk of opening the heart up to infection â and death.âDo you know how long it takes to inject 350 billion cells by hand?â Taylor asked the Life Itself audience. âWhat if you touch something? You just contaminated the whole heart.âOnce her lab suffered an electrical malfunction and all of the hearts died. Taylor and her team were nearly inconsolable.âWhen something happens to one of these hearts, itâs devastating to all of us,â Taylor said. âAnd this is going to sound weird coming from a scientist, but I had to learn to bolster my own heart emotionally, mentally, spiritually and physically to get through this process.âDr. Doris Taylor (left) is teaching BAB the robot how to properly inject stem cells into a ghost heart. Advanced Solutions Life SciencesEnter BAB, short for BioAssemblyBot, and an âuber-sterileâ cradle created by Advance Solutions that could hold the heart and transport it between each step of the process while preserving a germ-free environment. Taylor has now taught BAB the specific process of injecting the cells she has painstakingly developed over the last decade.âWhen Dr. Taylor is injecting cells, it has taken her years to figure out where to inject, how much pressure to put on the syringe, and the best speed and pace to add the cells,â said BABâs creator Golway.âA robot can do that quickly and precisely. And as we know, no two hearts are the same, so BAB can use ultrasound to see inside the vascular pathway of that specific heart, where Dr. Taylor is working blind, so to speak,â Golway added. âItâs exhilarating to watch â there are times where the hair on the back of my neck literally stands up.âTaylor left academia in 2020 and is currently working with private investors to bring her creation to the masses. If transplants into humans in upcoming clinical trials are successful, Taylorâs personalized hybrid hearts could be used to save thousands of lives around the world.In the US alone, some 3,500 people were on the heart transplant waiting list in 2021.âThatâs not counting the people who never make it on the list, due to their age or heath,â Taylor said. âIf youâre a small woman, if youâre an underrepresented minority, if youâre a child, the chances of getting an organ that matches your body are low.If you do get a heart, many people get sick or otherwise lose their new heart within a decade. We can reduce cost, we can increase access, and we can decrease side effects. Itâs a win-win-win.âTaylor can even envision a day when people bank their own stem cells at a young age, taking them out of storage when needed to grow a heart â and one day even a lung, liver or kidney.âSay they have heart disease in their family,â she said. âWe can plan ahead: Grow their cells to the numbers we need and freeze them, then when they are diagnosed with heart failure pull a scaffold off the shelf and build the heart within two months.âIâm just humbled and privileged to do this work, and proud of where we are,â she added. âThe technology is ready. I hope everyone is going to be along with us for the ride because this is game-changing.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,ghost heart,porcine scaffolding with patient cells grown onto it to make a non-rejected heart,3.0,"was a candidate in the past, but there has been significat progress",Prototype
techcrunch792,https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/zeits-early-warning-wearable-for-sleep-strokes-could-save-hours-and-lives/,Zeit s early warning wearable for sleep strokes could save hours and lives,"Those at risk are always vigilant for the signs of a stroke in progress, but no one can be vigilant when theyâre sleeping, meaning thousands of people suffer âwake-up strokesâ that are only identified hours after the fact. Zeit Medicalâs brain-monitoring wearable could help raise the alarm and get people to the hospital fast enough to mitigate the strokeâs damage and potentially save lives.A few decades ago, there wasnât much anyone could do to help a stroke victim. But an effective medication entered use in the â90s, and a little later a surgical procedure was also pioneered â but both need to be administered within a few hours of the strokeâs onset.Orestis Vardoulis and Urs Naber started Zeit (âtimeâ) after seeing the resources being put toward reducing the delay between a 911 call regarding a stroke and the victim getting the therapy needed. The company is part of Y Combinatorâs Summer 2021 cohort.âIt used to be that you couldnât do anything, but suddenly it really mattered how fast you got to the hospital,â said Naber. âAs soon as the stroke hits you, your brain starts dying, so time is the most crucial thing. People have spent millions shrinking the time between the 911 call and transport, and from the hospital door to treatment. but no one is addressing those hours that happen before the 911 call â so we realized thatâs where we need to innovate.âIf only the stroke could be identified before the person even realizes itâs happening, they and others could be alerted and off to the hospital long before an ambulance would normally be called. As it turns out, thereâs another situation where this needs to happen: in the OR.Surgeons and nurses performing operations obviously monitor the patientâs vitals closely and have learned to identify the signs of an impending stroke from the EEG monitoring their brainwaves.âThere are specific patterns that people are trained to catch with their eyes. We learned from the best neurologists out there how they process this data visually, and we built a tool to detect that automatically,â said Vardoulis. âThis clinical experience really helped, because they assisted in defining features within the signal that helped us accelerate the process of deciding what is important and what is not.âThe team created a soft, wearable headband with a compact EEG built in that monitors the relevant signals from the brain. This data is sent to a smartphone app for analysis by a machine learning model trained on the aforementioned patterns, and if anything is detected, an alarm is sent to the user and pre-specified caregivers. It can also be set to automatically call 911.âThe vast majority of the data we have analyzed comes out of the OR,â said Vardoulis, where it can immediately be checked against the ground truth. âWe saw that we have an algorithm that can robustly capture the onset of events in the OR with zero false positives.âThat should translate well to the home, they say, where there are actually fewer complicating variables. To test that, theyâre working with a group of high-risk people who have already had one stroke; the months immediately following a stroke or related event (there are various clinically differentiated categories) is a dangerous one when second events are common.âRight now we have a research kit that weâre shipping to individuals involved in our studies that has the headband and phone. Users are wearing it every night,â said Vardoulis. âWeâre preparing for a path that will allow us to go commercial at some point in 2023. Weâre working with he FDA to define the clinical proof needed to get this clear.âTheyâve earned a âBreakthrough Deviceâ classification, which (like stroke rehabilitation company BrainQ) puts them in position to move forward quickly with testing and certification.âWeâre going to start in the U.S., but we see a need globally,â said Naber. âThere are countries where aging is even more prevalent and the support structure for disability care is even less.â The device could significantly lower the risk and cost of at-home and disability care for many people who might otherwise have to regularly visit the hospital.The plan for now is to continue to gather data and partners until they can set up a large-scale study, which will almost certainly be required to move the device from direct-to-consumer to reimbursable (i.e., covered by insurance). And although they are totally focused on strokes for the present, the method could be adapted to watching for other neurological conditions.âWe hope to see a future where everyone with a stroke risk is issued this device,â said Vardoulis. âWe really do see this as the missing puzzle piece in the stroke care continuum.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,early warning wearable,sleep stroke alert,1.0,,Commercial R&D

The new approach will allow researchers to build better soft robots that can navigate hard-to-reach places, complicated terrain, and potentially areas within the human body.The paper is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), a peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary, high-impact scientific journal.âThis is the first time these concepts have been fundamentally demonstrated,â said Chris Ellison, a lead author of the paper and professor in the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. âDeveloping new ways of manufacturing are paramount for the competitiveness of our country and for bringing new products to people. On the robotic side, robots are being used more and more in dangerous, remote environments, and these are the kinds of areas where this work could have an impact.âSoft robotics is an emerging field where robots are made of soft, pliable materials as opposed to rigid ones. Soft growing robots can create new material and âgrowâ as they move. These machines could be used for operations in remote areas where humans canât go, such as inspecting or installing tubes underground or navigating inside the human body for biomedical applications.Current soft growing robots drag a trail of solid material behind them and can use heat and/or pressure to transform that material into a more permanent structure, much like how a 3D printer is fed solid filament to produce its shaped product. However, the trail of solid material gets more difficult to pull around bends and turns, making it hard for the robots to navigate terrain with obstacles or winding paths.The University of Minnesota team solved this problem by developing a new means of extrusion, a process where material is pushed through an opening to create a specific shape. Using this new process allows the robot to create its synthetic material from a liquid instead of a solid.âWe were really inspired by how plants and fungi grow,â said Matthew Hausladen, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. student in the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. âWe took the idea that plants and fungi add material at the end of their bodies, either at their root tips or at their new shoots, and we translated that to an engineering system.âPlants use water to transport the building blocks that get transformed into solid roots as the plant grows outward. The researchers were able to mimic this process with synthetic material using a technique called photopolymerization, which uses light to transform liquid monomers into a solid material. Using this technology, the soft robot can more easily navigate obstacles and winding paths without having to drag any solid material behind it.This new process also has applications in manufacturing. Since the researchersâ technique only uses liquid and light, operations that use heat, pressure, and expensive machinery to create and shape materials might not be needed.âA very important part of this project is that we have material scientists, chemical engineers, and robotic engineers all involved,â Ellison said. âBy putting all of our different expertise together, we really brought something unique to this project, and Iâm confident that not one of us could have done this alone. This is a great example of how collaboration enables scientists to address really hard fundamental problems while also having a technological impact.âThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation.In addition to Ellison and Hausladen, the research team included University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science researchers Boran Zhao (postdoctoral researcher) and Lorraine Francis (College of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor); and University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering researchers Tim Kowalewski (associate professor) and Matthew Kubala (graduate student).Watch a video of a soft growing robot navigating a tortuous path.Watch a video explaining the idea behind the plant-inspired research.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,process for synthetic material growth,method for creation of soft robots,3.0,,Scientific research

Currently, when crops are sprayed with stuff thatâs supposed to help them grow faster or better, the vast majority of that (up to 95 percent, according to CMUâs engineering blog) will just end up either as concentrated deposits in the surrounding soil, or dissolving into ground water. In both cases, accumulation over time can have negative knock-on effects, in addition to being terribly inefficient at their primary task.This method, described by researchers in detail in a new academic paper, would manage to improve efficiency to nearly 100% absorption of nutrients and pesticides delivered as nanoparticles (particles smaller than 50 nanometers across â a human hair is about 75,000 nanometers wide, for context) sprayed onto the leaves of plants, which then make their way through the plantâs internal vascular system all the way down into the root system.Using this method, agricultural professionals could also greatly improve delivery of plant antibiotics, making it easier and more cost-effective to treat plant diseases affecting crop yields. It would be cheaper to delivery all nutrients and pesticides, too, because the big bump in efficiency of uptake by the plants means you can use much less of anything you want to deliver to achieve your desired effect.This research could have huge impact in terms of addressing growing global food supply needs while making the most existing agricultural land footprint and decreasing the need for potentially damaging expansion of the same.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,nanoparticle coating,nutrient & pesticide coating that increases uptake and minimizes pollution,0.0,duplicate in this list,Scientific research

This type of long-range optical wireless power transfer system could enable real-time power transmission to fixed and mobile receivers. Credit: Jinyong Ha, Sejong UniversityImagine walking into an airport or grocery store and your smartphone automatically starts charging. This could be a reality one day, thanks to a new wireless laser charging system that overcomes some of the challenges that have hindered previous attempts to develop safe and convenient on-the-go charging systems.""The ability to power devices wirelessly could eliminate the need to carry around power cables for our phones or tablets,"" said research team leader Jinyong Ha from Sejong University in South Korea. ""It could also power various sensors such as those in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors used for monitoring processes in manufacturing plants.""In Optics Express, the researchers describe their new system, which uses infrared light to safely transfer high levels of power. Laboratory tests showed that it could transfer 400 mW light power over distances of up to 30 meters. This power is sufficient for charging sensors, and with further development, it could be increased to levels necessary to charge mobile devices.Several techniques have been studied for long-range wireless power transfer. However, it has been difficult to safely send enough power over meter-level distances. To overcome this challenge, the researchers optimized a method called distributed laser charging, which has recently gained more attention for this application because it provides safe high-power illumination with less light loss.""While most other approaches require the receiving device to be in a special charging cradle or to be stationary, distributed laser charging enables self-alignment without tracking processes as long as the transmitter and receiver are in the line of sight of each other,"" said Ha. ""It also automatically shifts to a safe low power delivery mode if an object or a person blocks the line of sight.""Going the distanceDistributed laser charging works somewhat like a traditional laser but instead of the optical components of the laser cavity being integrated into one device, they are separated into a transmitter and receiver. When the transmitter and receiver are within a line of sight, a laser cavity is formed between them over the airâor free spaceâwhich allows the system to deliver light-based power. If an obstacle cuts the transmitter-receiver line of sight, the system automatically switches to a power-safe mode, achieving hazard-free power delivery in the air.In the new system, the researchers used an erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical power source with a central wavelength of 1550 nm. This wavelength range is in the safest region of the spectrum and poses no danger to human eyes or skin at the power used. Another key component was a wavelength division multiplexing filter that created a narrowband beam with optical power within the safety limits for free space propagation.""In the receiver unit, we incorporated a spherical ball lens retroreflector to facilitate 360-degree transmitter-receiver alignment, which maximized the power transfer efficiency,"" said Ha. ""We experimentally observed that the system's overall performance depended on the refractive index of the ball lens, with a 2.003 refractive index being the most effective.""Laboratory testingTo demonstrate the system, the researchers set up a 30-meter separation between a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter was made of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical source, and the receiver unit included a retroreflector, a photovoltaic cell that converts the optical signal to electrical power and an LED that illuminates when power is being delivered. This receiver, which is about 10 by 10 millimeters, could easily be integrated into devices and sensors.The experimental results showed that a single-channel wireless optical power transfer system could provide an optical power of 400 mW with a channel linewidth of 1 nm over a distance of 30 meters. The photovoltaic converted this to an electrical power of 85 mW. The researchers also showed that the system automatically shifted to a safe power transfer mode when the line of sight was interrupted by a human hand. In this mode, the transmitter produced an incredibly low intensity light that did not pose any risk to people.""Using the laser charging system to replace power cords in factories could save on maintenance and replacement costs,"" said Ha. ""This could be particularly useful in harsh environments where electrical connections can cause interference or pose a fire hazard.""Now that they have demonstrated the system, the researchers are working to make it more practical. For example, the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell could be increased to better convert light into electrical power. They also plan to develop a way to use the system to charge multiple receivers simultaneously.More information: Nadeem Javed et al, Long-range wireless optical power transfer system using an EDFA, Optics Express (2022).

other news sites682,https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/battery-tech-breakthrough-paves-way-mass-adoption-affordable-electric-car/,Battery tech breakthrough paves way for mass adoption of affordable electric car,"UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. â A breakthrough in electric vehicle battery design has enabled a 10-minute charge time for a typical EV battery. The record-breaking combination of a shorter charge time and more energy acquired for longer travel range was announced today (Oct. 12) in the journal Nature.âThe need for smaller, faster-charging batteries is greater than ever,â said Chao-Yang Wang, the William E. Diefenderfer Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State and lead author on the study. âThere are simply not enough batteries and critical raw materials, especially those produced domestically, to meet anticipated demand.âIn August, Californiaâs Air Resources Board passed an extensive plan to restrict and ultimately ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars within the state. By 2035, the largest auto market in the United States will effectively retire the internal combustion engine.If new car sales are going to shift to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), Wang explained, theyâll need to overcome two major drawbacks: they are too slow to recharge and too large to be efficient and affordable. Instead of taking a few minutes at the gas pump, depending on the battery, some EVs can take all day to recharge.âOur fast-charging technology works for most energy-dense batteries and will open a new possibility to downsize electric vehicle batteries from 150 to 50 kWh without causing drivers to feel range anxiety,â said Wang, whose lab partnered with State College-based startup EC Power to develop the technology. âThe smaller, faster-charging batteries will dramatically cut down battery cost and usage of critical raw materials such as cobalt, graphite and lithium, enabling mass adoption of affordable electric cars.âThe technology relies on internal thermal modulation, an active method of temperature control to demand the best performance possible from the battery, Wang explained. Batteries operate most efficiently when they are hot, but not too hot. Keeping batteries consistently at just the right temperature has been major challenge for battery engineers. Historically, they have relied on external, bulky heating and cooling systems to regulate battery temperature, which respond slowly and waste a lot of energy, Wang said.Wang and his team decided to instead regulate the temperature from inside the battery. The researchers developed a new battery structure that adds an ultrathin nickel foil as the fourth component besides anode, electrolyte and cathode. Acting as a stimulus, the nickel foil self-regulates the batteryâs temperature and reactivity which allows for 10-minute fast charging on just about any EV battery, Wang explained.âTrue fast-charging batteries would have immediate impact,â the researchers write. âSince there are not enough raw minerals for every internal combustion engine car to be replaced by a 150 kWh-equipped EV, fast charging is imperative for EVs to go mainstream.âThe studyâs partner, EC Power, is working to manufacture and commercialize the fast-charging battery for an affordable and sustainable future of vehicle electrification, Wang said.The other coauthors on the study are Teng Liu, Xiao-Guang Yang, Shanhai Ge and Yongjun Leng of Penn State and Nathaniel Stanley, Eric Rountree and Brian McCarthy of EC Power.The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force and the William E.

other news sites695,https://newatlas.com/energy/aeromine-rooftop-wind/,Rooftop wind system deliversthe energy of solar per dollar,"Aeromine says its unique ""motionless"" rooftop wind generators deliver up to 50% more energy than a solar array of the same price, while taking up just 10% of the roof space and operating more or less silently. In independent tests, they seem legit.Distributed energy generation stands to play a growing part in the world's energy markets. Most of this currently comes in the form of rooftop solar, but in certain areas, wind could definitely play a bigger part. Not every spot is appropriate for a bladed wind turbine, though, and in this regard, University of Houston spinoff Aeromine Technologies has designed a very different, very tidy form of rooftop wind energy capture that looks like it could be a real game-changer.As with traditional wind turbines, size is key. So while Aeromine's wind energy boxes take up a relatively small footprint on your roof, they're still pretty bulky. The wings themselves are maybe 10 feet (3 m) high, at a rough guess, and looking at the latest imagery they're now sitting on top of boxes that might add another 6 ft (1.8 m) or more to their height â so they're no shrinking violets. On the other hand, they don't create the noise, or the constantly moving visual distraction of a regular, bladed turbine, so they may prove to be less unwelcome in populated areas.They work differently too â kind of like a set of race-car spoiler wings sandwiched together facing each other, with a round pole in between them. Angled into the wind, these stationary wings generate a low pressure vacuum in the center of the device, which sucks air through perforations either in the wings themselves or in the round pole, which also aids in accelerating the ambient airflow over the wings.(rendered image) the design places a couple of racecar spolier-like wings in a sandwich orientation, to create a low-pressure vacuum that sucks air through from below. The turbine is thus kept out of harm's way AeromineSo where's the turbine? Depending on the installation, it can either be at the bottom of that central pole, surrounded by a duct, or in more compact designs that sit right down on the roof instead of up on top of a box, the fan can be down in the roof of the building itself, in a pipe connecting either to that central pole or to hollow chambers in the perforated wings. Either way, the wings create a low-pressure zone, air is sucked through a tube to fill that low-pressure zone, and Aeromine places a relatively small, cheap internal propeller (perhaps 36 inches/91 cm in diameter) in that tube to run a generator.It's very quiet, very safe and very cheap to build; you don't need any fancy materials like carbon fiber, there's nothing special about the fan itself, and the whole thing comes apart for transport and a relatively simple construction process on site.Aeromine hasn't yet nominated a standard capacity for its devices in their latest iteration â indeed, we had to go digging to find much information at all about the device. But in a solution presented to the AFWERX Reimagining Energy challenge in January 2021, these units were each rated for 5 kW â pretty close to the output of a typical 21-panel, household rooftop solar system. Multiple units can of course be run along the leading edge of a building, spaced around 15 ft (4.6 m) apart, and each unit in this (now outdated) AFWERX challenge promised to generate around 14.3 MWh annually. Just for perspective, my 6.5-kW home rooftop solar system makes somewhere around 9 MWh a year.Aeromine Wind-Harvesting Unit, installed as a pilot trial on top of BASF's manufacturing facilities in Wyandotte, Michigan. We expect the large box at the bottom will disappear in commercial applications, with the air intake and turbine running below the roof line AeromineThe potential here is pretty clear; solar and wind work well in a complementary fashion. Solar's only generating during the sunniest hours, wind can be 24 hours but is totally dependent on conditions. The small rooftop footprint of an Aeromine system makes it possible to cover the rest of the roof in solar panels, then get some on-site battery storage happening and run a decent-sized business more or less off the grid.So what are the downsides? Well, these things need to be installed in spots where the wind direction is pretty constant, because they don't angle themselves to catch a breeze â and they probably never will, since they're designed to be such a cost-conscious machine. Their height might make them a visual or civic planning issue in some areas, and what's more, they'll cast shadows, which will block the sun from reaching rooftop PV panels unless the building is oriented such that the sun comes from one side and the wind from the other. So there's certainly going to be a limited number of places where they'll work optimally in a hybrid system.But that's about it at first glance. They're certainly cheaper, hardier, safer and less intrusive than windmill-style designs, and they offer a highly-accessible way to introduce reliable wind energy into a distributed power system.(Rendered image) Many Aeromine units can be run together, with proper spacing, and there's plenty of rooftop left for solar panels to run a hybrid system AeromineBefore getting too excited about any strange new wind energy tech, it's always worth revisiting Mike Barnard's excellent checklist to weed out dodgy wind power claims. Written in 2013, it's as relevant as ever today as more and more money flows into clean energy tech.Aeromine fares well against the Barnard test. With the University of Houston behind it, it has also submitted its gear to the gold-standard Sandia National Laboratories for testing â indeed Sandia has been involved directly in the development. It claims to harvest no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of the Betz limit of potential wind energy.A technical performance analysis prepared in partnership with Sandia, using wind tunnels at Texas Tech University, states that ""by sweeping a large area of wind with a reliable design, AeroMINEs overcome the challenges that have plagued other distributed wind solutions and have hindered distributed wind from playing a significant role in energy markets."" The report also notes a boost in energy extraction, coupled with some aerodynamic instability, when the airflow reaches the device from higher angles of attack.Aeromine motionless wind unitAeromine says that BASF is testing the system at its manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan â although it doesn't say how many units have been installed, or of what capacity. Hunting through the satellite overlays in Google Maps, it seems that the pilot test unit in the video above is situated right here, judging by the unique markings on the roof â but the satellite image isn't recent enough to show the wind power system, so we can't figure out much more.We expect this extra-tall unit sitting on a box is simply a temporary prototype designed to be super-easy to add and remove, where the final product will sit flush against the roof and have its piping and turbine installed under the surface. We wish Aeromine would be more forthcoming in its marketing.Either way, despite the limited information the company is willing to release at this point, this looks like it could be an impressive step forward for distributed rooftop wind energy. We hope Aeromine proves capable of scaling this tech up and making a serious contribution in the race to zero carbon.Check out a short video from Sandia below.R&D 100 Winner 2021: AeroMINE â Stationary Harvesting of Distributed Wind EnergySource: Aeromine via PR Newswire",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"""motionless"" rooftop wind generator",windpower generator that creates vacuum from wind powering a fan that drives a genrator,3.0,,Diffusion within innovators

In preliminary data from a Phase I trial, a genetically modified version of the herpes virus has shown promise in treating difficult-to-eradicate tumors, with one patient having experienced a complete remission for 15 months so far. Much more research will be needed to confirm the treatmentâs early success, however.The viral treatment is known as RP2 and is a genetically engineered strain of herpes simplex 1, the virus responsible for most cases of oral herpes in humans, as well as some cases of genital herpes. Developed by the company Replimune, RP2 is designed to work on two fronts. Injected directly into the tumor, the virus is supposed to selectively infect and kill certain cancer cells. But it also blocks the expression of a protein known as CTLA-4 produced by these cells, and it hijacks their machinery to produce another molecule called GM-CSF. The net result of these cellular changes is to weaken the cancerâs ability to hide from and fend off the immune system.In a Phase I trial conducted by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in the UK, RP2 was given as the only treatment to nine patients with advanced cancers that failed to respond to other therapies; it was also given in combination with another immunotherapy drug to 30 patients. Three patients on RP2 alone appeared to respond to the treatment, meaning their cancers shrank or stopped growing, and seven patients on the combination therapy responded as well. One patient in particular, with a form of carcinoma along his salivary gland, has shown no signs of cancer for at least 15 months after treatment with RP2 alone. There were no life-threatening adverse events reported in the trial, with the most common symptoms post-treatment being fever, chills, and other flu-like illness.AdvertisementThe findings, presented this week at the 2022 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress (ESMO), are preliminary, since theyâve yet to be vetted through the formal peer review process. Theyâre also based on a very small sample size, meaning that any results should be taken with caution. But Phase I trials arenât intended to show that a treatment is effective, only that itâs safe enough for humans to take. So the fact that some people with seemingly incurable cancers already appear to be responding to RP2, the team argues, is a very good sign that it can live up to its potential.âOur study shows that a genetically engineered, cancer-killing virus can deliver a one-two punch against tumorsâdirectly destroying cancer cells from within while also calling in the immune system against them,â said lead author Kevin Harrington, professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, in a statement from the organization.Scientists have been hopeful about cancer-fighting viruses for a long time. But itâs only recently that this hope has finally been starting to pay off. In 2015, the first viral therapy was approved in the U.S. for certain advanced cases of melanoma. This May, scientists in California launched a Phase I clinical trial of their anticancer virus, called Vaxinia. Other companies are developing their own candidates, either alone or in combination with other treatments. And Replimune is developing two other candidates based on their modified herpes virus.While many experimental therapies ultimately fail to cross the finish line and reach the public, itâs possible at least some of these viruses could one day become a new standard cancer treatment.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,RP2Ê,type of virotherapy,2.0,Virotherapy,Prototype

Uncontrolled hemorrhaging accounts for more than 30% of trauma deaths. To stop the bleeding, doctors often apply pressure to the wound and seal the site with medical glue. But what happens when applying pressure is difficult or could make things worse? Or the surface of the wound is too bloody for glue? Drawing inspiration from nature, researchers from McGill University have developed a medical adhesive that could save lives, modeled after structures found in marine animals like mussels and flatworms.âWhen applied to the bleeding site, the new adhesive uses suction to absorb blood, clear the surface for adhesion, and bond to the tissue providing a physical seal. The entire application process is quick and pressure-free, which is suitable for non-compressible hemorrhage situations, which are often life-threatening,â says lead author Guangyu Bao, a recently graduated PhD student under the supervision of Professor Jianyu Li of Department of Mechanical Engineering.In putting the new technology to the test, the researchers found that the adhesive promotes blood coagulation. The adhesive can also be removed without causing re-bleeding or even left inside the body to be absorbed. âOur material showed much better-improved safety and bleeding control efficiency than other commercial products. Beyond bleeding control, our material could one day replace wound sutures or deliver drugs to provide therapeutic effects,â says senior author Professor Jianyu Li.About this studyâLiquid-infused microstructured bioadhesives halt non-compressible hemorrhageâ by Guangyu Bao et al. was published in Nature Communications.About McGill UniversityFounded in Montreal, Quebec, in 1821, McGill University is Canadaâs top ranked medical doctoral university.

Itâs a big category thatâs going to require a number of solutions to various problems, though lately itâs been hit by a number of false starts. Abundant Robotics, for instance, went under, only to be resurrected by a new brand currently exploring the equity crowdfunding route. Meanwhile, strawberry-picking Traptic quite literally took itself out of the field, getting snapped up by Bowery for vertical farming applications.Founded in 2018, East Bay-based Verdant Robotics has raised $21.5 million to date, including an $11.5 million Series A, back in 2019. The firm appears to be casting its net fairly wide, though itâs starting specifically with carrot crops, offering up its system through a RaaS (robotics as a service) model to select farmers.The model seems to make the most sense for these systems â at least during the early stages. Likely most important to a company like Verdant is getting as many of its robotic systems as possible out to farms for real-world testing and data collection. Rental is a much easier way to do that, versus selling them outright â especially for an as of yet early technology, which likely requires technicians to implement (or at least monitor) these systems.The âautonomous farm-robotâ does dual-duty â spraying and laser weeding â while building AI-based crop modeling, designed to give farmers a better picture of what their plants crave.âFarmers told us not to give them more data, but to figure out what to do with the mountains of data they already have, or better yet just go do it,â Verdant co-founder and CEO Gabe Sibley says. âThey want a complete solution that takes action in real time and keeps farmers in control â all while improving profitability and automating dangerous, back-breaking field work.âThe company says it logged âthousandsâ of hours over the course of 2021 and plans to fully commercialize a âprecision multi-action machine for orchardâ next year.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,carrot picking robot,type of agricultural robot,2.0,Agricultural robot,Diffusion within innovators

The DART mission launched on Nov. 23, 2021 on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and is now hurtling through deep space toward the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos.The mission, which is managed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL), is humanity's first attempt to determine if we could alter the course of an asteroid, a feat that might one day be required to save human civilization. While changing the orbit of an asteroid 7 million miles away sounds daunting, DART team members from NASA and JHUAPL said during a media briefing on Thursday (Sept. 22) that they are confident that the years of planning that have gone into the mission will lead to success.Related: NASA's DART asteroid-impact mission will be a key test of planetary defenseTraveling at speeds of 4.1 miles per second (6.6 km/s), or 14,760 mph (23,760 kph), the DART spacecraft will impact the 560-foot-wide (170 meters) Dimorphos, a moonlet that orbits the other member of its binary system, the 2,600-foot-wide (780 m) asteroid Didymos.Doing so, NASA believes, will shift Dimorphos' orbital period enough to alter its gravitational effects on the larger Didymos, changing the trajectory of the pair.DART will crash into Dimorphos, causing a change to the moonlet's orbit. (Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL)Katherine Calvin, chief scientist and senior climate advisor at NASA, said that while DART will be a key test of this ""kinetic impactor"" planetary defense strategy, the mission will also produce valuable science that will allow astronomers to peer back into the deep history of the solar system.""We're looking at asteroids to make sure that we don't find ourselves in their path. We also study asteroids to learn more about the formation and history of our solar system. Every time we see an asteroid, we're catching a glimpse of a fossil of the early solar system,"" Calvin said.""These remnants capture a time when planets like Earth were forming,"" she added. ""Asteroids and other small bodies also delivered water, other ingredients of life to Earth as it was maturing. We're studying these to learn more about the history of our solar system.""Lindley Johnson, planetary defense officer at NASA, said that DART marks a turning point in the history of the human species.""This is an exciting time, not only for the agency, but for space history and the history of humankind,"" Johnson said during Thursday's briefing. ""It's quite frankly the first time that we are able to demonstrate that we have not only the knowledge of the hazards posed by these asteroids and comets that are left over from the formation of the solar system, but also have the technology that we could deflect one from a course inbound to impact the Earth. So this demonstration is extremely important to our future.""That sentiment was echoed by Tom Statler, a DART program scientist at NASA. ""The first test is a test of our ability to build an autonomously guided spacecraft that will actually achieve the kinetic impact on the asteroid. The second test is a test of how the actual asteroid responds to the kinetic impact,"" Statler said. ""Because, at the end of the day, the real question is: How effectively did we move the asteroid, and can this technique of kinetic impact be used in the future if we ever needed to?""Read more: DART asteroid mission: NASA's first planetary defense spacecraftThe asteroid Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos are shown in a composite image taken by DART's DRACO instrument on July 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA JPL DART Navigation Team)The outcome of the DART mission on Monday (Sept. 26) will certainly help answer that question, and many of the DART team members shared their confidence in the mission during the briefing. Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at JHUAPL, said the spacecraft is ready to smash itself to pieces on the surface of Dimorphos when the time comes.""What we can say at this point is that all subsystems on the spacecraft are green, they're healthy, they're performing very well. We have plenty of propellant and we have plenty of power,"" Reynolds said. ""We've been doing a bunch of rehearsals, and some of the rehearsals are very nominal.""""At this point, I can say that the team is ready,"" Reynolds added. ""The ground systems are ready, and the spacecraft is healthy and on track for an impact on Monday.""Engineers on the DART team are watching the spacecraft's trajectory carefully over the coming days leading up to the impact, which should occur at 7:14 p.m. EDT (2314 GMT) on Monday (Sept. 26). Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at JHUAPL, said that the team is still making sure the impactor spacecraft is on course.""Over the next couple of days, we're actually still performing some trajectory correction maneuvers to make sure that we are on the right path to hit the asteroid,"" Adams said. ""We rehearsed a lot. But as we go through the cruise phase, we update parameters in the spacecraft to make sure that we can actually hit the asteroid. And so in the last couple of days, we'll update those parameters; we'll do checks like streaming images back to Earth.""""So in the next few days, we'll take more images of the Didymos system, we'll do trajectory correction maneuvers, and then at 24 hours prior to impact, it's all hands on deck,"" she added.Adams said the team has 21 contingencies in place in case DART's Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real Time Navigation (Smart Nav) system determines that the spacecraft is off course. ""We've planned for all the things, and we're ready to intervene. And we have been rehearsing this for quite some time.""NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, is moved into a shipping container for its trip to the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for a launch on Nov. 24, 2021. (Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ed Whitman)The 21st contingency the team has planned for is DART's survival. In the event that DART misses Dimorphos, Adams says the team will immediately begin processing the data the spacecraft collected and plan for a possible impact with other objects.""We're going to sit down back into our seats and we're going to start preserving all the data on board if it misses. And we'll have time with our Deep Space Network right afterwards to be able to actually get all that data down,"" Adams said. ""And then we'll start conserving propellant and we'll start looking for [other] objects to come back to.""In response to a question from Space.com concerning any flight testing the team has conducted, Adams mentioned a recent set of images the DART spacecraft's DRACO camera took of Jupiter and its four big Galilean moons . The DART team captured the images in order to ""fool"" the DART spacecraft's SMART Nav system so that its tracking capabilities could be tested.""We actually watched Europa exit from behind Jupiter. And we fooled our Smart Nav that Jupiter was Didymos and Europa was Dimorphos, and we actually watched the separation happen,"" Adams said.That's important, she added, ""because in the last four hours during our terminal phase, when the spacecraft is completely autonomous, we're going to watch Dimorphos emerge from behind Didymos. So, we already trained the system to do this in flight. So we're looking forward to it. I think we can do it.""Statler reiterated that confidence, adding that, while this type of mission was once the stuff of fantasy, the DART team believes we now have the tools and the knowledge to carry out a successful planetary defense mission.""We're moving an asteroid. We are changing the motion of a natural celestial body in space,"" Statler said. ""Humanity has never done that before. And this is the stuff of science fiction books, and really corny episodes of 'Star Trek' from when I was a kid. And now it's real. And that's kind of astonishing that we are actually doing that and what that bodes for the future: What we can do, as well as our discussions of what humanity should do.""It opens up an amazing frontier,"" he added.

How about several?"" has successfully collided with the Dimorphos asteroid. Results and data from the collision are still coming in but NASA ground control confirms that the DART impact vehicle has intercepted the target asteroid. Yes, granted, Dimorphos is roughly the size of an American football stadium but space is both very large and very dark, and both asteroid and spacecraft were moving quite fast at the time.NASA""It's been a successful completion of the first part of the world's first planetary defense test,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said after the impact. ""I believe it's going to teach us how one day to protect our own planet from an incoming asteroid. We are showing that planetary defense is a global endeavor and it is very possible to save our planet.""NASA launched the DART mission in November, 2021 in an effort to explore the use of defensive satellites as a means of planetary defense against Near Earth Objects. The vending machine-sized DART impactor vehicle was travelling at roughly 14,000 MPH when it fatally crossed Dimorphos' path nearly 68 million miles away from Earth.Whether future iterations of a planetary defense system brimming with satellites willing to go all June Bug vs Chrysler Windshield against true planet-killer asteroids remains to be seen. Dimorphos itself is the smaller of a pair of gravitationally-entangled asteroids â its parent rock is more than five times as large â but both are dwarfed by the space rock that hit Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out 75 percent of multicellular life on the planet while gouging out the Gulf of Mexico.NASAThe DART team will likely be poring over the data generated by both the impactor and cameras released before the spacecraft made its final approach for days to come. However the team will consider shortening the orbital track of Dimorphos around Didymos by 10 minutes an ideal outcome, though any change of at least 73 seconds will still be hailed as a rousing success. The team will have to observe Dimorphos' orbit for half a day to confirm their success, as the moonlet needs nearly 12 hours to complete an circuit around Didymos.ATLAS observations of the DART spacecraft impact at Didymos! pic.twitter.com/26IKwB9VSo â ATLAS Project (@fallingstarIfA) September 27, 2022Update 9/27/2022 2:29 AM ET: The NASA funded ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) managed to record video of the impact (above).

But NASA officials hailed the immediate outcome of Monday's test, saying the spacecraft achieved its purpose.""NASA works for the benefit of humanity, so for us itâs the ultimate fulfillment of our mission to do something like this - a technology demonstration that, who knows, some day could save our home,"" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, a retired astronaut, said minutes after the impact.DART, launched by a SpaceX rocket in November 2021, made most of its voyage under the guidance of NASA's flight directors, with control handed over to an autonomous on-board navigation system in the final hours of the journey.Monday evening's bullseye impact was monitored in near real time from the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.Cheers erupted from the control room as second-by-second images of the target asteroid, captured by DART's onboard camera, grew larger and ultimately filled the TV screen of NASA's live webcast just before the signal was lost, confirming the spacecraft had crashed into Dimorphos.DART's celestial target was an oblong asteroid ""moonlet"" about 560 feet (170 meters) in diameter that orbits a parent asteroid five times larger called Didymos as part of a binary pair with the same name, the Greek word for twin.Neither object presents any actual threat to Earth, and NASA scientists said their DART test could not create a new hazard by mistake.Dimorphos and Didymos are both tiny compared with the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out about three-quarters of the world's plant and animal species including the dinosaurs.[1/4] The last complete image of asteroid moonlet Dimorphos, taken by the DRACO imager on NASA's DART mission 12 kilometers from the asteroid and 2 seconds before impact, showing a patch of the asteroid that is 31 meters across, released September 26, 2022. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Handout via REUTERS 1 2 3 4Smaller asteroids are far more common and present a greater theoretical concern in the near term, making the Didymos pair suitable test subjects for their size, according to NASA scientists and planetary defense experts. A Dimorphos-sized asteroid, while not capable of posing a planet-wide threat, could level a major city with a direct hit.Also, the two asteroids' relative proximity to Earth and dual configuration make them ideal for the first proof-of-concept mission of DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test.ROBOTIC SUICIDE MISSIONThe mission represented a rare instance in which a NASA spacecraft had to crash to succeed. DART flew directly into Dimorphos at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph), creating the force scientists hope will be enough to shift its orbital track closer to the parent asteroid.APL engineers said the spacecraft was presumably smashed to bits and left a small impact crater in the boulder-strewn surface of the asteroid.The DART team said it expects to shorten the orbital path of Dimorphos by 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success, proving the exercise as a viable technique to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth - if one were ever discovered.A nudge to an asteroid millions of miles away years in advance could be sufficient to safely reroute it.Earlier calculations of the starting location and orbital period of Dimorphos were made during a six-day observation period in July and will be compared with post-impact measurements made in October to determine whether the asteroid budged and by how much.Monday's test also was observed by a camera mounted on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART days in advance, as well as by ground-based observatories and the Hubble and Webb space telescopes, but images from those were not immediately available.DART is the latest of several NASA missions in recent years to explore and interact with asteroids, primordial rocky remnants from the solar system's formation more than 4.5 billion years ago.Last year, NASA launched a probe on a voyage to the Trojan asteroid clusters orbiting near Jupiter, while the grab-and-go spacecraft OSIRIS-REx is on its way back to Earth with a sample collected in October 2020 from the asteroid Bennu.The Dimorphos moonlet is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name and is one of 27,500 known near-Earth asteroids of all sizes tracked by NASA. Although none are known to pose a foreseeable hazard to humankind, NASA estimates that many more asteroids remain undetected in the near-Earth vicinity.(This story corrects name in paragraph 6 to Pam from Palm)Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Joey Roulette in Los Angeles; Editing by Sandra Maler and Stephen CoatesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Asteroid redirection,,0.0,duplicate in this list,Diffusion within innovators

techcrunch789,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/10/mawi-patch/,Mawi launches a patch to track your heart health faster and in real time,"If youâve ever had the misfortune of needing continuous EKG monitoring, youâve probably used a Holter monitor. Itâs like carrying a 1980s walkman made of metal with a bunch of wires going from it to your chest. If that sounds uncomfortable, and as if you wonât sleep or enjoy showers much for the two weeks you need to carry it around, youâve neatly stumbled across the use case for the Mawi Heart Patch. The company just released its product, a two-lead cardiac monitor that can be read in real time.There are consumer-grade products that can do EKG readings, including the Withings ScanWatch (and its fancier-looking sibling, the ScanWatch Horizon), and there are other patches on the market, such as the Zio patch, but Mawi claims to have done something unique, and suggests that its Heart Patch is the first ever single-use, two-lead cardiac monitor to reach the market.The company describes it as âa stick-and-go, wireless solutionâ and further suggests that the disposable nature of the device is a benefit; it means that cardiologists can run tests on as many patients as they need to without having to wait for reusable Holter monitors to come back from other patients and get sanitized and maintained between uses.âHolter monitors arenât great,â Andrew Klymenko, the CEO of Mawi, says drily in an interview we did last week, and explains that the existing solutions are prone to dislodging, peeling and causing allergic reactions, thus restricting monitoring time. As a result, Mawi claims that more than 50% of arrhythmias go undetected. Equally bad: patients have to wait up to a month to receive the results.Mawi Heart Patch, the company claims, can be applied in under a minute, and you can live like normal as you wear it.âPatients can shower, sleep, work out,â says Klymenko, and highlights that itâs possible to wear the patch and live all aspects of life as normal. âSex is a big and important part of life, and patients can have sex as normal when wearing the Mawi patch.ââCardiovascular diseases pose the greatest risk to our long-term health and are the leading cause of death globally. With a lack of or ineffective monitoring often proving critical, many of these deaths can be avoided with the right preventative measures,â Klymenko said. âToo often, sufferers do not realize the severity of their symptoms before itâs too late. Many patients that use the Mawi Heart Patch look healthy, exercise daily and show no signs of disease, yet have a potentially lethal heart condition. Weâre on a mission to prevent the heartâs âsilent killers,â and weâre already working with like-minded clinics that are seeing amazing results.âThe patch connects to a smartphone device in the doctorâs office. That device pipes the data through to the cloud, where an AI analyzes the results and highlights anything unusual for the cardiologists to take a closer look at. The process is very quick indeed, meaning that patients can have feedback and next steps for their treatment.âIn less than 24 hours [the doctors] have a very detailed, precise and actionable report,â says Klymenko, suggesting that doctors can focus on treatment, rather than having to spend a lot of time analyzing data. âIt takes just two seconds to manage.âThe company currently has around 30 staff, primarily concentrated in Europe. Klymenko himself is from Ukraine, and his team is spread across the world, including teams in Thailand and in the U.S. To date, the company has been bootstrapped.Mawi wonât share exactly how many devices it has in the field, but Klymenko admits they are shipping âthousands of devicesâ every month, to customers across the U.S., the EU, and the Middle East.The devices need to be prescribed by a doctor, and pricing is heavily dependent on whatever medical insurance and what medical care system you are operating on, but Klymenko says that the devices typically cost âunder $250 per study.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Mawi Heart Patch,realtime wire-free cardiac monitoring,2.0,,Diffusion within innovators

However, when that is available, NASA's technology could provide temperature controls that those charging systems would require.As NASA explains, a five-minute charge requires a charging system that provides a current at 1,400 amps. But, as Purdue points out, Tesla's V3 Supercharger â which is the apex of today's EV chargers â doesn't exceed 600 amps. Purdue's prototype last year demonstrated 2,400 amps.Hence the eventual need for a cooling system beyond today's capabilities that can handle 1,400 amps. Using NASA's FBCE, Purdue researchers, led by Dr. Issam Mudawar, pumped non-electrically conducting liquid coolant through a charging cable to capture heat from the current-carrying conductor.""Subcooled flow boiling allows Mudawar's team to deliver 4.6 times the current of the fastest available electric vehicle chargers on the market today by removing up to 24.22 kilowatts of heat,"" NASA explains.""Application of this new technology resulted in unprecedented reduction of the time required to charge a vehicle and may remove one of the key barriers to worldwide adoption of electric vehicles,"" it said.Faster charging times ought to drive higher adoption of EVs, which are part of the world's answer to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. A recent report from the International Energy Agency said sales of EVs reached 6.6 million in 2021, up from 120,000 in 2012, and accounted for 9% of all vehicle sales.Chinese consumers bought 3.3 million new EVs, many of which were two- and three-wheelers, while Europeans bought 2.3 million EVs, and US consumers bought 630,000. Still, in the US, EV sales doubled their share in 2021 year-on-year to 4.5%. China was also rolling out charging faster than most regions.Source: Purdue University",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,sub-cooled flow boiling,,0.0,duplicate in this list,Commercial R&D

Theoretically, the price/performance ratio is also good enough to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation.The first commercial applications are already being realised, with dye-sensitized solar windows installed in the SwissTech Convention Center, however their capacity for generating electricity has so far been restricted by their lack of efficiency compared to traditional solar cells.The latest development pushes the power conversion efficiency to between 28.4-30.2 per cent, while still maintaining long-term operational stability over 500 hours of testing.âOur findings pave the way for facile access to high performance DSCs and offer promising prospects for applications as power supply and battery replacement for low-power electronic devices that use ambient light as their energy source,â wrote the authors of a study detailing the technology.The study, titled âHydroxamic acid preadsorption raises efficiency of cosensitized solar cellsâ, was published in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,dye-sensitizedÊsolar cells,transparent solar panels,2.0,Dye-sensitized solar cell,Commercial R&D

Since then a group of scientists in the U.K. has been working with Milne to pinpoint the molecules that give Parkinsonâs its distinct olfactory signature. The team has now zeroed in on a set of molecules specific to the diseaseâand has created a simple skin-swab-based test to detect them.Milne, a 72-year-old retired nurse from Perth, Scotland, has hereditary hyperosmia, a condition that endows people with a hypersensitivity to smell. She discovered that she could sense Parkinsonâs with her nose after noticing her late husband, Les, was emitting a musky odor that she had not detected before. Eventually, she linked this change in scent to Parkinsonâs when he was diagnosed with the disease many years later. Les passed away in 2015.In 2012 Milne met Tilo Kunath, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, at an event organized by the research and support charity Parkinsonâs UK. Although skeptical at first, Kunath and his colleagues decided to put Milneâs claims to the test. They gave her 12 T-shirts, six from people with Parkinsonâs and six from healthy individuals. She correctly identified the disease in all six casesâand the one T-shirt from a healthy person she categorized as having Parkinsonâs belonged to someone who went on to be diagnosed with the disease less than a year later.Subsequently, Kunath, along with chemist Perdita Barran of the University of Manchester in England and her colleagues, has been searching for the molecules responsible for the change in smell that Milne can detect. The researchers used mass spectrometry to identify types and quantities of molecules in a sample of sebum, an oily substance found on the skinâs surface. They discovered changes to fatty molecules known as lipids in people with Parkinsonâs.In their latest study, published on September 7 in the American Chemical Society journal JACS Au, the researchers revealed the results of using a simple skin-swab-based test to detect the lipid signature that is indicative of Parkinsonâs. By comparing sebum samples from 79 people with Parkinsonâs and 71 people without the illness, the team zeroed in on a set of large lipids that could be detected in a matter of minutes using a special type of mass spectrometry in which substances are rapidly transferred from a swab to an analyzer using just a piece of paper.âI think itâs a very promising set of biomarkers,â says Blaine Roberts, a biochemist at Emory University, who wasnât involved in the work. He adds that one of the big open questions that remains is how exacting this test can be. While the authors of the September 7 study reported the detailed chemical profile of the unique Parkinsonâs signature, they did not include an assessment of its accuracy. According to Barran, based on not-yet-published data, their test appears to be able to determine whether an individual has Parkinsonâs with more than 90 percent accuracy.Tiago Outeiro, a neuroscientist at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany, who was not involved with the research, says the sebum-based swab test is novel and has clear advantages, such as the ease of sample collection. Outeiro wonders whether people with diseases that share symptoms and pathologies with Parkinsonâs disease, such as multiple system atrophy, also have similar chemical markers.The team is now working with local hospitals to determine whether this sebum-based test can also be conducted in clinical labsâa key step toward determining whether it can be used as a diagnostic tool. Ultimately, Barran says, the hope is to use the test to help identify individuals who have been referred to their neurologists by their general practitioner for suspected Parkinsonâs so they can receive a faster diagnosis. Currently, there are thousands of people waiting to see a neurologist in the U.K.âs National Health Service, and it will take an estimated two years to clear that list, Barran says. A skin-swab test could enable those patients to mail in skin swabs to be analyzed in the hospital laboratory and pinpoint those who need help most urgently. Barranâs research team is approaching people on the waiting list to see if they are willing to take part in a trial to see whether such skin-swab tests could prove effective in helping to speed up the triage process.Barran and her colleagues are also collaborating with a group at Harvard University to determine whether sebum-based biomarkers are detectable in people who have constipation, a reduced sense of smell or other early signs of Parkinsonâs but have not yet received a diagnosis.Milne has inspired groups elsewhere to search for biomarkers based on the diseaseâs olfactory signature. This year researchers in China published a paper describing an electronic noseâan artificial-intelligence-based sensor modeled after the olfactory systemâthat sniffs out molecules present in the sebum of patients with Parkinsonâs disease. Other groups in China, the U.K. and elsewhere have also been training dogs to sniff out the disease.Parkinsonâs may not be the only disease Milne has a nose for. Sheâs also reported noticing a unique smell in people with Alzheimerâs, cancer, and tuberculosis and is working with scientists to see whether a specific olfactory signature of those diseases can be deduced.For Milne, the hope is that this work will ultimately benefit patients with these conditions. âMy husband suffered from [Parkinsonâs] for 21 years after his diagnosis, but he had it many years before that,â Milne told Scientific American in 2015. âI would like to see that people donât suffer the way he suffered.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,skin-swab-based parkinson's test,biomarker identification,2.0,Cancer biomarker,Diffusion within innovators

other news sites797,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/non-invasive-blood-glucose-measurement-wearables-breakthrough/,Sensor breakthrough brings us closer to blood glucose monitoring on wearables,"Blood glucose monitoring is touted to be the next big breakthrough for wearable devices like the Apple Watch. However, the hardware is yet to be seen on a commercially available, mass-market device. That might change soon.A team from Georgiaâs Kennesaw State University claims to have developed a noninvasive system of blood glucose level measurement, thanks to a device called GlucoCheck. It follows the same fundamental approach as the oxygen-level analysis sensor on smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 5.Team lead Maria Valero, an assistant professor at the institutionâs College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE), notes that the device delivers 90% accuracy in analyzing glucose concentration in blood samples. The biosensor works in tandem with a phone application, but the team is already at work on integrating Amazonâs Alexa virtual assistant.GlucoCheck shines light across the human skin, and then a camera captures the view from the other side. The goal is to study the varying level of light absorption by blood flowing in the vessels to determine the glucose concentration.The team has already filed a patent for the tech and now aims to test it on more body types to diversify the test data. This step is of critical importance, because commercially available wearables like those made by Fitbit and even Apple are known to be inaccurate at reading data from people with dark or tattoed skin types.The latest development is remarkable because it achieves the holy grail of glucose-level monitoring, which is to develop a noninvasive method that can be miniaturized and connected to devices such as phones. Currently, people with diabetes need to prick their fingers to obtain a blood sample to analyze their sugar levels.Commercial players are also at itThis is not the first research of its kind. In July 2020, Samsung showcased a noninvasive method for blood glucose monitoring in partnership with experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The same year, Movano revealed a wearable device that can measure blood sugar levels using a light diffusion method. But it didnât do much else.A year later, a Japanese company named Quantum Operation showcased a wearable-mounted sensor at CES 2021 that was capable of noninvasive blood glucose analysis. According to multiple reports that have surfaced over the past couple of years, both Apple and Samsung are interested in the promising tech for their smartwatches.Quantum Operation Non-Invasive Blood GlucometerU.K.-based Rockley Photonics is also working toward the same objective, but instead of LEDs, the company is focused more on laser-based analysis. Regarding the in-house tech, CEO Dr. Andrew Rickman told Digital Trends that it âcollects incredibly rich data that we extract to measure, amongst other things, hydration, lactate, and blood pressure.âNotably, Apple is said to be one of the biggest clients of Rockley Photonics and is rumored to include the noninvasive blood glucose monitoring tech on the Apple Watch portfolio in the near future.Editors' Recommendations",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,glucose measurement through light absorption,non-invasive blood glucose analysis,2.0,Transdermal optical imaging,Commercial R&D

techcrunch852,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/19/labby-product-launch/,Labby wants to make milk healthier and cows happier with better sensors,"For most dairy farmers, milk flowing from their cows is tested by a traveling technician once per month. But in a world where bovine mastitis can appear from one day to the next, it is udderly ridiculous to test milk flowing from cows once per month. Today at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield, Labby offered a different solution, with an inline optical sensor that can test cows every time they are milked. For now, the product detects potential issues early, but over time, the company believes it can start predicting issues before they occur.The companyâs product is called MilKey and comes in two variants: a hand-held product that can be used anywhere, or an inline product that can be hooked into the milking machines, which enables daily farmers to test continuously.The main difference between the two products is also their strengths. The handheld device can be used by any technician out in the (literal) field; you select the cow youâre testing on a smartphone app, and the test results show up with the right animal. Thatâs great when a cow is wandering about or if you have suspicions about a particular animal having an illness. The inline device is fully automatic and works over Wi-Fi. For this device, the results need to be assigned to the right cow manually, but it makes it feasible to test every cow, every milking.Labby tells TechCrunch that the device takes spectral measurements of milk samples and uploads them to the cloud. From there, the company uses machine-learning models to take spectral readings as inputs. It can estimate the content of the milk, broken down into fats, proteins and somatic cell counts. Once the measurements are taken and assigned to an animal, the farmers can use an app or any web browser to see the full testing history of any animal, to ensure they are going a-bovine and beyond in terms of milk production.âAnimal health records are like human records; they give critical indications about animal health and feed efficiency. It turns out that milk is the best biomarker for everything. Currently, the industry only tests once a month for each animal. We think this is a systemic failure for the farmers and for the animals,â says Julia Somerdin, CEO and founder of Labby, in an interview with TechCrunch. âOne complication for animal health is mastitis. It one of the most common yet expensive diseases, and it can change from day to day. So when they do 30-day testing, the test will tell you everything is fine, but the next day the animal could develop a case, which can be subclinical with no symptoms. So for farmers, between testing days, they have no idea how the animal is doing.âYou may be wondering âwho cares,â but dairy farming is a hell of an industry. There are 9 million cows across 40,000 farms in the U.S. Worldwide, there are 250 million cows across 115 million farms; it all adds up.âWith our solution, we can provide on-farm real-time testing to help provide the farmer with daily, weekly and monthly health records,â says Somerdin. âAnimal health is the critical indicator thatâs missing from todayâs industry practices.âFrom the numbers and the impact, youâll be unsurprised that there are big sums of money involved. The best milk gets farmers the best price, which means that milk quality is directly linked to revenue, the Labby team tells me. The benefit is two-fold: Healthier cows need less veterinary attention, and higher-quality milk nets the milk producers more money per gallon of milk delivered.âWe can insert Labby in the value chain. Dairy is a very input-intensive industry so we have all kinds of suppliers that help farmers produce more and better milk, and then the dairy farmers sell their milk to dairy processors. With our service, the big battle, besides the money-saving aspect, is we create all this real-time data,â says Somerdin. âAnimal genetics companies can use that data, helping them refine their algorithms. We can also bridge the gap between dairy producers and veterinarians, enabling telehealth for cows.âApart from the fact that when I hear âtelehealth for cows,â I giggle at the thought of a cow staring into a Zoom screen and talking about its feelings and its four upset stomachs, itâs easy to understand how Labby adds significant value and the ability to be an early warning system for animal health.âThe most important thing is that you donât need a technician to sample the milk anymore. The cleaning can also be integrated with the current system,â says Somerdin, explaining how the company has designed a set-it-and-forget-it approach to continuous testing.Labby was part of Techstars, and raised a total of $1.3 million from them and a number of other investors, including MIT Media labâs E14 fund.The company officially started selling its products in early October, and has only just started shipping its products to customers. In the short term, itâs a hardware+SaaS business, but after that, itâs time to start milking the data itself for wisdom.âOur business model has three revenue streams. For the dairy farmers, they pay once for the hardware equipment, then monthly for us to provide the testing in the cloud. The farmer pays per cow per day,â says Somerdin. âIn addition, weâre looking at data. We believe we are generating significant value for the industry, such as for genetic companies. We will have a data licensing fee, but we will wait to offer that until we have half a million cows on the platform.âOver time, the company hopes to be able to use big data to catch a glimpse of the future, too.âThe data will help us develop a reliable benchmark for each animal,â says Somerdin, and suggests that deviations from the benchmark could tell you something about whatâs going on for the cows, health-wise. âBased on that, we can look at pattern recognition for disease onset among the herd. We could also predict patterns for milk production, which currently relies only on historical data, which limits their accuracy.âAll in all, the company seems eager to (milk)shake up the industry, and bring all the farmers to the yard. And theyâre like, itâs better than yours. They will teach you, but theyâll have to charge.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,data collection on individual dairy cows to assess changes and locate disease,included in precision farming,2.0,Precision livestock farming,Diffusion within innovators

Breaking the 30% barrier is therefore a big step in accelerating the energy transition and improving energy security by reducing the dependency on fossil fuels.The best of both worldsTandem devices can reach higher efficiencies than single junction solar cells because of a better utilization of the solar spectrum. The currently emerging tandems combine commercial silicon technology for the bottom device with perovskite technology: the latter featuring highly efficient conversion of ultraviolet and visible light and excellent transparency to near infrared light. In four-terminal (4T) tandem devices the top and bottom cells operate independently of each other which makes it possible to apply different bottom cells in this kind of devices. Commercial PERC technology as well as premium technologies like heterojunction or TOPCon or thin-film technology such as CIGS can be implemented in a 4T tandem device with hardly any modifications to the solar cells. Furthermore, the four-terminal architecture makes it straight forward to implement bifacial tandems to further boost the energy yield.Researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium have successfully improved the efficiency of the semi-transparent perovskite cells up to 19.7% with an area of 3x3 mm2 as certified by ESTI (Italy). âThis type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93% of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device. This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.â says Dr Mehrdad Najafi of TNO. âThe silicon device is a 20x20-mm2 wide, heterojunction solar cell featuring optimized surface passivation, transparent conductive oxides and Cu-plated front contacts for state-of-the-art carrier extractionâ says Yifeng Zhao, PhD student at TU Delft, whose results have been recently peer-reviewed. The silicon device optically stacked under the perovskite contributes with 10.4% efficiency points to the total solar energy conversion.Combined, 30.1% is the conversion efficiency of this non-area matched 4T tandem devices operating independently.

The wheel-track is just one of a handful of designs meant to improve survivability of combat vehicles beyond just up-armoring them.As you can see in the video, the reconfigurable wheel-track demonstrates a seamless transition between a round wheel shape and a triangular track in about two seconds, and the shift between its two modes can be executed while the vehicle is in motion without cutting speed. Round wheels are optimal for hard terrain while track-style treads allow an armored vehicle to move freely on softer ground.According to Ground X-Vehicle Program Manager Major Amber Walker, the tech offers âinstant improvements to tactical mobility and maneuverability on diverse terrainsâ â an advantage you can see on display in the GIF below.While wheel technology doesnât sound that exciting, the result is visually impressive and smooth enough to prompt a double-take.The other designs featured in the video are noteworthy as well, with one offering a windowless navigation technology called Virtual Perspectives Augmenting Natural Experiences (V-PANE) that integrates video from an array of mounted LIDAR and video cameras to recreate a real-time model of a windowless vehicleâs surroundings. Another windowless cockpit design creates âvirtual windowsâ for a driver, with 3D goggles for depth enhancement, head-tracking and wraparound window display screens displaying data outside the all-terrain vehicle in real time.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,tiretrack that can convert according to terrain,,3.0,,Commercial R&D
techcrunch845,https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/source-seed-funding/,Source makes greenhouses smarter to secure the future of food supply,"Agtech startup Source.ag today announced it harvested a $10 million investment to make greenhouses smarter. The founders have set their eyes on a horizon where, driven by climate change and a rapid increase in global food demand as population continues to increase, more crops are being forced indoors to secure greater crop yields. You wouldnât believe the amount of restraint it takes to not make a pun about seed funding in a piece about greenhouses. I have no such restraint, so letâs report on this, ahem, growth industry.The $10 million funding round was led by Acre Venture Partners, with participation from the E14 fund and food-focused venture firm Astanor ventures. The company also raised from industry insiders, including the international association of (mostly) salad growers Harvest House, tomato specialists Agrocare and bell pepper specialists Rainbow Growers.The company is developing software to empower greenhouses to get smarter. The company argues that greenhouse agriculture is a safer, more reliable and more climate-resilient mode of food production, producing up to 15 times higher yields, using a twentieth as much water as traditional agriculture. What Source adds to the mix is the ability to use data and AI to help greenhouses operate at even higher levels of efficiency and repeatability of high-yield harvests.âClimate change is driving substantial scarcity and strains in our global food supply. As this accelerates in the coming years, we must find ways to scale efficient growing solutions that lighten the footprint of agriculture,â said Lucas Mann, managing partner at Acre. âGreenhouse agriculture is a proven and viable solution, but without innovation, demand will be impossible to meet. We believe Source.ag can play a vital role in driving its global scalability.âThe funding will be used to accelerate product development and expand commercial collaborations.âGreenhouses come in all shapes and forms â both more and less technically advanced. On the higher-tech side, want to have control over every dimension you can imagine, including humidity, irrigation and nutrition. Tomatoes, for example, donât grow in soil. They go in substrate slabs. That means that these operations are arable land independent,â explains Rien Kamman, co-founder ad CEO at Source. âBecause you have more control, youâll have to make more decisions every day. Growers are making decisions on 60-70 parameters every day, which influences how this crop will grow for the rest of the season. You need to get the decision right every day. This might include what to feed the plant, plant-specific parameters, pruning, etc. Itâs really a craft and this is why itâs still so hard. You need decades of experience to be doing well at it.âThe complexity of the farming operation itself isnât in doubt, and Sourceâs pitch is to take all of these growth parameters, combine that with historical crop yield data and market pricing etc., to create a better experience for the growers.âOur system is comprised of two aspects. One is a recommendation system that assesses the current state of the plant. It looks at forward-looking predictors like resource prices, weather, etc. And then gives very concrete recommendations to the grower. What should you do today and tomorrow, both on the plant (i.e. how should you trim it, prune it, etc.) and on the indoor climate around the plants to maximize sustainability and production. The second part is what happens when something doesnât go to plan? This is where the algorithms come in,â Kamman says. âThey collaborate with the different control systems to take that strategy and actually make sure to do so implemented in the most efficient way possible.âIndoor farming still requires a fair chunk of manual labor, especially for big-vine crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, etc.; but Source suggests that it can be helpful there, too â by choosing how and where to prune or how many crops to leave to ripen on the vine, you can affect various aspects of the plantsâ growth. The interesting thing is overlaying real-time pricing data here â by speeding up or slowing down ripening, I can imagine that could potentially time the harvest time around when your competitors have ripe products, potentially even trading lower yields for better prices, or working with temperatures and weather conditions to reduce production costs, for example.The company is running on a SaaS model, charging growers on a sliding scale depending on the amount of space they are using for growing.âOur belief is that agriculture is at an inflection point in history. [Farming] that brought us to where we are today wonât bring us to 10 billion people with a more changing extreme climate. This is a massive market â the need for climate-resilient food systems is going to increase. And then we havenât even talked about what other traditional agriculture crops could be moved indoors in the next decades,â says Kamman. âI think that what unites our investors and our team is that weâre not so much looking at these advantages short term, but we can build knowledge that is scalable globally.âThe company declined to share screenshots of its product, stating it was âcompetitively sensitiveâ.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Smart greenhouse,Precision agriculture,1.0,Closed ecological system,Commercial R&D

The 72-year-old from Perth, Scotland, has a rare condition that gives her a heightened sense of smell.She noticed that her late husband, Les, developed a different odour when he was 33 â 12 years before he was diagnosed with the disease, which leads to parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years.Milne, nicknamed âthe woman who can smell Parkinsonâsâ, described a musky aroma, different from his normal scent.Her observation piqued the interest of scientists who decided to research what she could smell, and whether this could be harnessed to help identify people with the neurological condition.Years later, academics at the University of Manchester have made a breakthrough by developing a test that can identify people with Parkinsonâs disease using a simple cotton bud run along the back of the neck.Researchers can examine the sample to identify molecules linked to the disease to help diagnose if someone has it.Though still in the early phases of research, scientists are excited about the prospect of the NHS being able to deploy a simple test for the disease.There is no definitive test for Parkinsonâs and diagnosis is based on a patientâs symptoms and medical history.If the skin swab is successful outside laboratory conditions it could be rolled out to achieve faster diagnosis.Milne said it was not acceptable that people with Parkinsonâs had such high degrees of neurological damage at the time of diagnosis, adding: âI think it has to be detected far earlier â the same as cancer and diabetes, earlier diagnosis means far more efficient treatment and a better lifestyle for people.âIt has been found that exercise and change of diet can make a phenomenal difference.âShe said her husband, a former doctor, was determined to find the right researcher to examine the link between odour and Parkinsonâs and they sought out Dr Tilo Kunath at the University of Edinburgh in 2012.Kunath paired up with Prof Perdita Barran to examine Milneâs sense of smell.The scientists believed that the scent may be caused by a chemical change in skin oil, known as sebum, that is triggered by the disease.In their preliminary work they asked Milne to smell T-shirts worn by people who had Parkinsonâs and those who did not. She correctly identified the T-shirts worn by Parkinsonâs patients but also said that one from the group of people without Parkinsonâs smelled like the disease â eight months later that individual was diagnosed with the disease.Researchers hoped the finding could lead to a test being developed to detect Parkinsonâs, working under the assumption that if they were able to identify a unique chemical signature in the skin linked to the disease, they may eventually be able to diagnose it from simple skin swabs.In 2019, researchers at the University of Manchester, led by Barran, announced they had identified molecules linked to the disease found in skin swabs. The scientists have now developed a test using this information.The tests have been successfully conducted in research labs and scientists are assessing whether they can be used in hospital settings. If successful, the test could potentially be used in the NHS so GPs can refer patients for Parkinsonâs tests.Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some molecules are present only in people who have Parkinsonâs.Researchers compared swabs from 79 people with Parkinsonâs with a healthy control group of 71 people.Barran said: âAt the moment, there are no cures for Parkinsonâs but a confirmatory diagnostic would allow them to get the right treatment and get the drugs that will help to alleviate their symptoms.âThere would also be non-pharmaceutical interventions, including movement and also nutritional classes, which can really help. And I think most critically, it will allow them to have a confirmed diagnosis to actually know whatâs wrong with them.âShe added: âWhat we are now doing is seeing if (hospital laboratories) can do what weâve done in a research lab in a hospital lab. Once thatâs happened then we want to see if we can make this a confirmatory diagnostic that could be used along with the referral process from a GP to a consultant.âAt the moment in Greater Manchester there are about 18,000 people waiting for a neurological consult and just to clear that list, without any new people joining it, will take up to two years. Of those 10-15% are suspect Parkinsonâs.âOur test would be able to tell them whether they did or whether they didnât (have Parkinsonâs) and allow them to be referred to the right specialist. So at the moment, weâre talking about being able to refer people in a timely manner to the right specialism and that will be transformative.âMilne is working with scientists around the world to see if she can smell other diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis (TB).âI have to go shopping very early or very late because of peopleâs perfumes, I canât go into the chemical aisle in the supermarket,â she said.âSo yes, a curse sometimes but I have also been out to Tanzania and have done research on TB and research on cancer in the US â just preliminary work. So it is a curse and a benefit.âShe said she can sometimes smell people who have Parkinsonâs while in the supermarket or walking down the street but has been told by medical ethicists she cannot tell them.âWhich GP would accept a man or a woman walking in saying âthe woman who smells Parkinsonâs has told me I have itâ?

other news sites844,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/sep/18/leading-the-whey-the-synthetic-milk-startups-shaking-up-the-dairy-industry,Leading the wheythe synthetic milk startups shaking up the dairy industry,"In 1931, Winston Churchill predicted the rise of animal-free food. Then an opposition MP in his wilderness years, Churchill wrote an essay that imagined life in 50 yearsâ time. âSynthetic food will, of course, be used in the future,â he wrote.The artificial stuff would âbe practically indistinguishable from the natural products, and any changes will be so gradual as to escape observation,â Churchill wrote. âMicrobes, which at present convert the nitrogen of the air into proteins by which animals live, will be fostered and made to work under controlled conditions just as yeast is now.âThough several decades later than envisaged, Churchillâs prediction has been borne out by the development of lab-grown meat and, more recently, animal-free dairy products.Synthetic milk has emerged as a new potential alternative to cowâs milk, one that â unlike plant-based oat, nut and soy milks â purports to replicate its taste, appearance and mouthfeel. Described by experts as the future of milk, it has been touted as an environmentally friendly option that may shake up the dairy industry â and leave small-scale farmers in the lurch.âLab-grown milk is considered the next food frontier,â says Dr Diana Bogueva, of Curtin Universityâs Sustainability Policy Institute, citing the growing popularity of dairy alternatives. Compared with dairy production, synthetic milk is likely to have a smaller carbon footprint and cause less pollution, and obviously eliminates animal welfare concerns, she says.The industry is expanding rapidly. In the US, cow-free dairy proteins produced by the firm Perfect Day are now widely used in products including ice-cream, cream cheese, chocolate and protein powders. Another American startup, New Culture, is commercialising a synthetic milk-based mozzarella, while the Israeli firm Remilk has set up a giant facility in Denmark to produce cheese, yoghurt and ice-cream.It will be some time before cow-free milk arrives in Australian supermarkets, but startups such as All G Foods and the CSIRO spin-off company Eden Brew are racing to bring products to market within the next two years.Yeast of EdenChemically, milk is mostly water â about 87%, to be precise. Milk solids comprise the rest: fats, proteins, sugars â primarily lactose â and minerals. By Australian law, at least 3.2% of the liquid in full-cream milk must be fat and another 3% protein.Most synthetic dairy companies are focusing on producing milk proteins using a process known as precision fermentation. It involves genetically programming yeast or other microorganisms using synthetic DNA to produce a specific protein. Jim Fader, the co-founder of Eden Brew, compares the process to beer brewing.âWe use yeast to make a protein to make a drink. They use yeast to make alcohol to make a drink,â he says.There are at least 20 proteins in cowâs milk, about 80% of which are casein proteins, found in the curds; the rest are whey proteins, perhaps most familiar as a component of powdered protein shakes.Aggregates of casein, known as micelles, give milk its characteristic appearance and heat stability.âThe micelle plays a fundamental role in many parts of milk,â Fader says. âFor example, when it binds with calcium, it makes the milk look white. If you want to froth your milk and put it in your cappuccino, the ability for the milk to withstand that heat and the bubbles to be able to form â¦ is also down to the micelle.âSynthetic milk technology is âless about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairyâ but âaugmenting supplyâ, Jim Fader says. Photograph: ReutersEden Brew is producing six proteins that are most abundant in milk. Once brewed, these will be purified and dried.A key investor in the firm is the New South Wales dairy cooperative Norco, which will be responsible for rehydrating and blending the proteins. At this stage, other components such as minerals and coconut-based fat will be added. The end product will be lactose-free, with a small quantity of table sugar used to approximate the sweetness of cowâs milk.Fader says the firm will launch an ice-cream â simpler than milk because it can be made with just two proteins â around December next year. Milk will follow, likely in August 2024.All G Foods is focusing its efforts on whey proteins. The firmâs plant-based meat products are already served in commercial burger chains and sold in some supermarkets.The companyâs chief scientific officer, Jared Raynes, says the ultimate goal is to produce yoghurts, cheese and fresh milk. But the firmâs focus for now is on beta-lactoglobulin, the main protein in whey.âWe are going to be applying for regulatory approval with our protein powder,â he says.Parallels with synthetic fabricsMilena Bojovic, who is completing a PhD at Macquarie University, says while the promise of cow-free fresh milk has been widely trumpeted, the impact of synthetic dairy is likely to be greater on products such as milk powder.âFresh milk consumption is on the decline,â she says and consumers may be wary of drinking a synthetic version of a natural product. She points out that traditional dairy production is also âvery much technologically mitigated, from conception to the birth of calves to the milking processâ.âIf synthetic milk really takes off, the biggest disruption I think will be if it can be powdered and used in the ingredients space â¦ as an additive like milk solids, which is in a lot of processed foods,â Bojovic says. âI donât think most consumers are questioning where the milk solids in their KitKat came from.ââIf and possibly when that happens, that will be one of the major disruptions for dairy industries that are producing exclusively for export in the form of powdered milk.âBojovic, who has analysed global dairy trends as part of her research, is concerned that technological advances may leave farmers behind. Large dairy players such as Norco and Fonterra, a New Zealand multinational cooperative, have begun to invest in synthetic protein production.âSmall-scale operations are really going to struggle in the context of global dairy consolidation,â she says. âThereâs more pressure on farmers to innovate and also to invest in technology to make sure that theyâre at the standard that bigger corporates are at.âBojovic sees parallels with the rise of synthetic fabrics. âWhen synthetic fibres hit the market, that decimated the wool industry in a lot of regions,â she says. âItâs not the first time that farmers have been faced with the threat of synthetics, but theyâve adapted, theyâve innovated.âMelissa Cameron, Dairy Australiaâs human health and nutrition policy manager, says it is yet to be seen how consumers will respond to a synthetic product. She points to statistics suggesting that 58% of Australian households exclusively buy fresh and long-life cowâs milk.âPeople are not abandoning dairy,â she says. âThe commercialisation of synthetic proteins and products to a scale that makes these products available widely to consumers is yet quite a while off. As our populations grow around the world, synthetic products will deliver complementary protein and products. There will be room for all.âDairy demand worldwide grew by 36% between 2007 and 2017 and is expected to keep rising as the worldâs population increases and per-capita consumption grows.Fader says the technology that companies such as Eden Brew are developing is âless about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairyâ. Rather, âitâs about augmenting the current supply because demand is forecast to go up by so muchâ.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,synthetic milk,,3.0,,Diffusion within innovators
techcrunch846,https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/solar-foods-solein/,Solar Foods wants to replace industrial animal farming with a high tech protein harvest,"Fermentation has a long, rich history in food production, from beer and wine to yogurt and cheese, leavened bread and coffee, miso and tempeh, sauerkraut and kimchi, to name just a few of the tasty things we can consume thanks to a chemical process thought to date back to the Neolithic period. But if this 2017-founded Finnish startup, Solar Foods, has its way, fermentation could have a very special place in the future of human food too.The industrial biotech startup is working on bringing a novel protein to market â one it says will offer a nutritious, sustainable alternative to animal-derived proteins. The product, a single-cell protein itâs branding Solein, is essentially an edible bacteria; a single-cell microbe grown using gas fermentation. Or, put another way, theyâre harvesting edible calories from hydrogen-oxyidizing microbes.âTechnically itâs like a brewery,â explains CEO and co-founder Dr. Pasi Vainikka in an interview with TechCrunch. âLike fermentation technologies are. Itâs not that strange [a process] â there is this one difference, which is the feedstock.âThe production of Solein requires just a handful of âingredientsâ: Air, water and energy (electricity) â which means thereâs no need for vast tracts of agricultural land to be given out to making this future foodstuff. It could be produced in factories located in remote areas or inside cities and urban centers.Nor indeed are other foods needed to feed it to create an adequate yield, as is the case with rearing livestock for human consumption. So the promise looks immense. (As Vainikka argues: âLand use and energy use are the two main problems of human kind â and the rest follows from these two.)Nutritionally speaking, Solein resembles some existing foodstuffs â sitting between dried meat, dried carrot or dried soy in terms of the blend of vitamins, amino acids, proteins (overall, itâs 65% protein), per Vainikka. âSo itâs very familiar but itâs a bit [of a] new combination,â he suggests, adding: âThe taste is very mild, very neutral.â (A mild taste may not sound especially scintillating for the tastebuds but it means itâs easy to include as an ingredient in a wide range of foods without the need for a strong flavor to be masked.)While Solar Foods has essentially discovered a new species through its fermentation process, the microbe itself obviously hasnât just appeared on planet Earth â and is likely very ancient; perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. So thereâs a fascinating blend of old and new coming together in the startupâs bioreactor.Why is finding new forms of protein important? The problem Solar Foods is aiming to tackle is that the environmental costs of livestock-based meat production are indisputably massive â whether youâre talking unsustainable land and water use; climate-heating emissions and pollution; or animal welfare concerns. But what if you could produce billions of nutritious meals without the need to deforest huge swathes of land and slaughter masses of livestock to produce the food? What if humanity could feed itself and stop consuming the planet in the process?Thatâs the promise and the core differentiator that Solar Foods claims vs. animal-derived proteins.If you compare Solein to the growing gaggle of plant-based meat alternatives, they do still rely upon land being farmed to produce the necessary plants â whether soy or pea or oat, etc. â that form the basis of their products. Although they need far less land than meat production requires so the environment upside is still very real. But Solar Foods sees itself blending into this competitive mix â selling Solein to companies producing plant-based foods as another ingredient they can use to cook up nutritious, environmentally friendly meals.âCereals, vegetables, fruits, herbs arenât going anywhere,â says Vainikka, discussing how Solein might fit into an evolved food production system. âSo if we go back to the original problem â 80% of all the problems that have to do with food, whether itâs loss of natural habitat or forest loss or whatever, has to do with the industrialized animal production â¦ So actually Solein could solve 80% of the problem but 20% of the calories because mostly we are, on a calorie basis, eating carbohydrates.âAnd if youâre excited about the promise of lab-grown meat â which is also seeking to delink protein production from land use â Vainikka says the startup is supportive of such efforts since, once again, itâs spying potential customers as he says cultivated/lab-grown meat producers could use Solein to feed the cell cultures theyâre using to grow slaughter-free steaks.So use cases for Solar Foodsâ edible bacteria look broad, provided people are willing to eat it (or have it fed to something in their food chain). Conceivably it could even be used as a feedstock for livestock â although the startupâs messaging is focused on the need to transform a broken food system and enter âthe era of sustainable food production,â as its website puts it.It is also working on developing a closed-loop system in which the sole byproduct of its production process â water containing bits of the Solein protein â would be continuously recycled back into production of more of the foodstuff. And if it can pull that off, the edible bacteria could potentially function as a life support system for humans on space missions where the timescales are too long for astronauts to rely on food supplies brought with them from Earth (such as, for example, a mission to Mars).âThe specific thing that we think is different in what weâre doing â compared to anything else on the market today â is that we donât use any agriculture in the foods,â Vainikka tells TechCrunch. âElectricity and carbon dioxide are the main ingredients â instead of sunlight and carbohydrates or oils. So thatâs the fundamental point where the disconnection of food production from agriculture happens.âThatâs our thing. And the reason to do that is once you can delink the connection between use of land and land-use impacts and food production then basically all the environmental benefits fall on your lap that there can be in relation to food production.âDown here on Earth, being able to unhitch food production from the vagaries of seasonal weather and other factors that can have major impacts on agricultural yields â such as pests, natural disasters, issues with supply chains specific to farming and so on â is another touted advantage for Solar Foodsâ approach. âSecurity of supply â¦ consistency and quality,â says Vainikka, checking off some of the added advantages he says the edible protein offers vs. traditional farming, i.e., on top of the massive heap of land-delinking-based environmental gains which could â for example â support a mass reforestation of farm land, promoting biodiversity and fighting global warming since trees suck up CO2.Europeâs energy crisis bitesSolein looks like a no-brainer on the environmental front. But one key component of its production â energy, i.e., electricity â is facing supply issues of its own in Europe at present in the wake of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. (Russia being a major but unreliable supplier of gas to Europe.)Solar Foodsâ long-term bet is on energy production costs being brought down (or, well, stabilized) by widespread access to cheap renewables â such as wind and hydro energy in the north of Europe and solar in the sunny south. Thing is, for now, the European energy markets are typically structured so that the wholesale price of energy is linked to the cost of the most expensive type of energy (fossil fuel derived) despite there already being a fair amount of renewable energy available which is far cheaper to produce. (Hence why if the price of gas goes up the wholesale price of energy rises, and the bill payer must pay more even if their energy supplier sources their energy from cheaper to produce renewable sources.)Since the Ukraine war started, Europe has been facing an exacerbated supply vs. demand issue. And over the past several months itâs been hard for Europeans to escape energy price spikes as their governments have sought to reduce reliance on Russian gas imports â shrinking energy supply options and helping keep war-spiked wholesale prices high.The coming winter looks very grim, with Russia recently electing to entirely shutter gas exports via its Nord Stream pipeline to Germany in what looks like an attempt to weaken Western support for the pro-Ukraine sanctions. So energy supply in Europe has become a weapon of economic war.Itâs an incredibly volatile situation but one thing is clear: Europeâs âcompetitiveâ marginal-cost-based energy markets are in desperate need of structural reform â to reflect the cheaper production costs of renewables and ensure consumers and businesses arenât at the mercy of fossil fuel volatility and cripplingly high prices linked to Russian aggression.But, in the meanwhile, with electricity being a key component of Solar Foodsâ process, the startup is having to manage what Vainikka â who has a background in energy economics that he says allows him to understand where the markets are headed â refers to with classic Nordic understatement as âturbulence.âHe suggests Solar Foods may therefore need to wait out the current energy crisis before itâs able to scale commercial production of Solein in a way thatâs economically viable â though itâs banking on Europe being able to find a way through to more stable electricity prices in the not too distant future. (In recent days, the Commission has said it will be coming with an emergency reform plan to curb energy prices â both in the short term and over the longer run, to ensure prices reflect cheaper renewables.)âAt the moment we shouldnât make electricity supply agreements for our factory. We canât be on the market today to make those agreements,â confirms Vainikka. âBecause of this [energy price volatility] â itâs a fact. The second [thing] is we are quite happy that we are not fermenting natural gas â we are fermenting electricity. So we have an opportunity to make a good deal after turbulence.ââWe need to replace fossil fuels with electricity so we need a lot of new generation capacity which is also a problem in the market but weâre confident that this works,â he adds. âUnfortunately there is this turbulence now.âSolar Foods is pressing on regardless of the current energy crisis.Itâs in the process of building its first factory â actually a demo facility, as a step on the road to future commercial scaling up of Solein production â at a cost of around â¬40 million, drawing on backing from a number of VC funds since 2017, over seed and Series A rounds, as well as raising debt financing (such as â¬15 million from Danske Bank Growth earlier this year).The demo facility at least wonât have major energy requirements to run. (Although he says itâs still holding off on signing an energy supply contract for now.)âWeâll manage the turbulence but of course it would be better for it not to continue too long,â says Vainikka. âWeâre using this demo [facility] operated by one wind turbine to prove that this scales â but the real factories would be 100x larger in terms of energy use, 50x larger â and it would need rather 50 turbines to run a huge facility that will produce half a billion meals. Then you must get a good [energy supply] contract and if we were investing into that factory now it might be postponed because of the turbulence.âGood food and food for good?With the demo factory set to come on stream in 2023, Solar Foodsâ hope is the first consumer product containing Solein will be on the market by the end of next year (or, failing that, in early 2024). Which global market will get the first commercial taste of the novel protein will depend on regulatory clearances.Solar Foods has applied for clearance in multiple jurisdictions but canât predict whether regulators in Europe or the U.S. or Asia will be first with approval, given variances in this process. (But Vainikka says itâs possible the first clearance could happen this year.)What the first product for sale to consumers that contains Solein will be also isnât yet clear.Vainikka suggests a few possibilities â such as that it could be added to existing foods like breakfast cereals or vegan meals for fortification purposes (owing to its vitamin and mineral content, such as iron and B vitamins); or as a main ingredient in plant-based meat replacement products, replacing stuff like pea protein. Or he says it could be used as an egg replacement in pasta or pastry production. Or as a principle ingredient in ice cream or yogurt (or even to make a spreadable faux cheese).âWe leave the final formulation and product development for our customers so that we can empower them to renew categories,â he suggests. âAnd make having a food an act for good.ââFrankly as a company we think that it might be a good idea to focus on what we master â which is this conversion-fermentation; producing this ingredient and so that it would have the functionalities needed for food products,â he continues, expanding on Solar Foodsâ decision to stay in its biotech lane. âThere are so many, so huge, or so experienced or so old [food] companies on the market who have already access to the consumer, all the experience regarding textures, product development regarding all kinds of plant-based ingredients and so on. So when we introduce Solein into the market you would not only need to get everything right, what we are doing and mastering now, but also the final product â of course taste and texture is decisive.ââSo thatâs a heavy investment program that weâve dived into,â he adds, emphasizing the still extensive range of requirements for developing a product thatâs designed even to be an ingredient in processed foods that people eat.âNutrition must be there â¦ then second is safety, then functionality, of course â how it works and forms texture â and then scaling and production technology; who has it, how does it work, is it scalable, and how does the supply chain work â so whoâs really the gatekeeper? So this we are in the middle of now â¦ A lot will happen in the next 12-16 months.âWhile Solar Foods wonât be a food product maker itself it does have an R&D lab where it carries out culinary experiments with its product â and images on its website show a selection of demo foodstuffs, from chicken-style chunks served with pasta to soup, bread and a breakfast smoothies, all with a distinctive rich yellow hue.In its refined form â i.e., after itâs passed through Solar Foodsâ electrolyzing and fermenting bioreactors and been dried â Solein takes the form of a yellow powder (the hue is down to betacarotene it naturally contains).The strong color makes it looks a bit like a custom blend of turmeric and cumin. But tastewise itâs nothing like that strong. Per Vainikka, one expert taster who sampled it suggested it was akin to dried carrot. But whether youâre a fan of carrots is beside the point; he emphasizes that the taste is mild enough that it can be easily masked in whatever food product it was being incorporated into â just without the added nutrients going anywhere.For example, in the sample case of adding Solein to pasta, Vainikka says it would â nutritionally speaking â be akin to eating, say, a plate of spaghetti bolognese with all the nourishment derived from an animal-based ingredient but without the need to have any minced meat on the plate. Which, well, might take some swallowing for those used to consuming traditional (and oftentimes culturally significant) recipes. (An Italian I described this meatless but nutritionally meat-like pasta dish to at a dinner party I attended recently was visibly shocked at the prospect and a second Italian she started to explain the concept to responded by suggesting we should focus on having fun eating the actual food on our plates instead of talking about, er, such high-concept stuff, so, well, there may be some acceptance humps in the short term.)But as plant-based faux meats advance in taste and texture itâs easy to envisage creative food producers being able to whip up something that has a meat-like taste and texture and â thanks to the addition of Solein â is also imbued with similar levels of protein, iron and vitamins as actual meat. And that could be a strong selling point for consumers, especially with the current food fad for high-protein eating.Other food ideas Solar Foods has been experimenting with in its labs are âcheeseâ ball lollypops, mayonnaises and dressings, pancakes and plenty more besides.Vainikka says he hopes the first commercial food to contain the ingredient wonât be a burger â since there are so many meat-alternative patty options out there already. But he suggests it could be a âmeat-like biteâ â something akin to a nugget â such as might be be served in an Asian hot pot or similar. âThen yogurt, ice cream, soup, bakery pastry application is something that might go first,â he postulates.âYou could imagine it could be a frozen food, fresh or even on the street kitchen of an Asian city,â he also suggests, saying the startup is keen to branch out and âappreciate different food cultures on the planetâ â so it can âtry to explain how Solein could be an ingredient in different kinds of dishes from the Asian hot pots to burger patties to soups or pastries or whatever.âFood is of course not only cultural but individual tastes can be hugely personal â and/or political. So once Solein leaves Solar Foodsâ factories and arrives in customersâ commercial kitchens thatâs where all these localizing product and branding challenges will really kick in â as buyers will have to work on figuring out how best to blend it in with other taste and cultural considerations or indeed make its presence stick out loudly (at least on the packet) where shouting about sustainability benefits might be the best way to reap big sales in their particular target market.One thing looks clear: The future of food wonât be dull â or even uniformly yellow hued. A full rainbow of possibilities for alternative eats are coming down the pipe â and the environmental challenges we face, as a species, demand we find the appetite to consume them.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,protein from bacteria,Solein.

other news sites853,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/17/business-food/purple-tomato-gmo-scn-trnd/index.html,A newgenetically modified purple tomato may hit the grocery market stands,"CNN âIt tastes like a tomato, smells like a tomato, and even looks (mostly) like a tomato. Thereâs just one catch: Itâs purple.The USDA has approved a genetically modified purple tomato, clearing the path for the unique fruit to be sold in American stores next year.âFrom a plant pest risk perspective, this plant may be safely grown and used in breeding,â the agency said in a September 7 news release.The approval moves the purple tomato one step closer to widespread distribution. In addition to its unique color, the purple tomato also has health benefits and a longer shelf life than garden variety red tomatoes, scientists say.The tomato was developed by a team of scientists, including British biochemist Cathie Martin, who is a professor at the University of East Anglia and a project leader at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, England.Martin worked on pigment production in flowers for over 20 years, she told CNN. âI wanted to start projects where we could look and see whether there were health benefits for this particular group of pigments,â she said.The pigments that drew Martinâs interest are anthocyanins, which give blueberries, blackberries and eggplants their rich blue-purple hues. With funding from a German consortium, she decided to engineer tomatoes that were rich in anthocyanins, hoping to âincrease the antioxidant capacityâ of the fruits.By comparing regular tomatoes to the engineered purple tomatoes, she would be able to easily identify whether the anthocyanins were linked to any specific health benefits.To engineer the purple tomatoes, the scientists used transcription factors from snapdragons to trigger the tomatoes to produce more anthocyanin, creating a vibrant purple color.Martin and her colleagues published the first results of their research in 2008 in an article in Nature Biotechnology.The results were âstunning,â she said. Cancer-prone mice that ate the purple tomatoes lived around 30% longer than those that ate normal tomatoes, according to the study.Martin said there are âmany explanationsâ as to why anthocyanin-rich tomatoes may have health benefits. There are âprobably multiple mechanisms involved,â she said. âItâs not like a drug, where thereâs a single target. Itâs about them having antioxidant capacity. It also may influence the composition of the microbiome, so itâs better able to deal with digestion of other nutrients.âAnd in 2013, Martin and colleagues released a study that found the purple tomatoes had double the shelf life of their red cousins.Martin established a spinout company, Norfolk Plant Sciences, to bring the purple tomatoes to market. Nathan Pumplin, the CEO of Norfolkâs US-based commercial business, told CNN that the purple tomato âstrikes a cord with people in this very basic way.âThe distinctive purple color means that âit takes no imagination to see that itâs different,â Pumplin said. âIt really allows people to make a choice.âFDA approval and commercialization are next stepsIn the past, forays into genetically modified foods have often focused on engineering crops that are more sustainable to produce, he added. But for consumers, the benefits of eating a genetically modified food are murky.âItâs very abstract, hard to understand,â Pumplin said. âBut a purple tomato â you either choose or choose not to consume.â The difference between the GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) product and the non-modified tomato are stark â and the possible health benefits for consumers are also clear.Pumplin says that consumers are âwarming upâ to genetically modified foods across the world.âWe look at the problems facing our society as far as sustainability, climate change, health tied to diet and nutrition, and whatâs clear from the response from our announcement is that itâs a really important topic to a lot of people,â he said. âIâm encouraged that a lot of people are starting to relook at biotechnology in light of the important challenges.âAt the same time, âGMOs are not a silver bullet,â he said. âItâs one tool in our toolbox as plant scientists, as scientists, agronomists, to improve the food production system.âThe next steps for the purple tomato are FDA approval and commercialization, Pumplin said. âWe need to breed excellent, delicious purple tomatoes. We need to work with producers to produce them and distribute them.âNorfolk will begin to launch limited test markets in 2023 to identify which consumers are most interested in purple tomatoes.As for the taste? The purple tomato is indistinguishable from your standard red tomato, Pumplin said.âIt tastes like a great tomato,â he said.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Purple tomatoes,Genetically modified tomatoes are healthier for mice and have longer shelf life,1.0,Genetically modified food,Commercial R&D

Companies use GPS to track trucks and keep them on time and their cargo secure.Little wonder, then, that criminals are turning to cheap GPS jamming devices to ransack the cargo on roads and at sea, a problem that's getting worse but may be ameliorated with a new generation of safety technology designed to overcome threats from jamming.In case you aren't a master criminal or a secret agent, here's some background. The core problem for any system using GPS is that the signals are extremely weak, an inevitable byproduct of the vast distances those signals need to travel. Jammers work by overpowering GPS signals by emitting a signal at the same frequency, just a bit more powerful than the original. The typical jammers used for cargo hijackings are able to jam frequencies from up to 5 miles away rendering GPS tracking and security apparatuses, such as those used by trucking syndicates, totally useless.In Mexico, jammers are used in some 85% of cargo truck thefts. Statistics are harder to come by in the United States, but there can be little doubt the devices are prevalent and widely used. Russia is currently availing itself of the technology to jam commercial planes in Ukraine.As we've covered, the proliferating commercial drone sector is also prey to attack. Drones often rely on GPS for navigation as well as security tracking, making them especially vulnerable. Drones equipped with back-up methods still often rely on GPS for positioning, navigation, and stabilization, making jammers a way to take a drone down and potentially cause harm to life and property. During a light show in Hong Kong in 2018, a jamming device caused 46 drones to fall out of the sky, raising public awareness of the issue.Technologies are emerging to counter this problem. A company called infiniDome has developed an anti-jamming solution that is compatible with almost any GPS-based telematics unit, a catch-all term for the technologies trucking companies use to track and monitor their assets on the road. InfiniDome's ""OtoSphere"" is a small add-on device created for commercial GNSS receivers, providing protection and increasing the resiliency of GPS devices against jamming attacks. By identifying and preventing instances of jamming, fleet operators are able to prevent cargo theft.Other companies, such as Sepentrio, are also taking GPS jamming in drone applications seriously with integrated sensor solutions.In the meantime, governments are hoping to fight back through regulation, although that may be a losing battle. Mexico passed an anti-jamming law in late 2020, allowing for penalties of 12-15 years in prison for persons caught using such devices while committing crimes.Nevertheless, jammers remain widely available online, where they can be purchased for as little as $50.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,anti-GPS jamming,,3.0,,Diffusion within innovators

After months of opposing major climate legislation, citing inflation risks, he suddenly changed his tune. Last night, climate legislation was back on the table, and the odds of it passing had gone up considerably.While not as large, in terms of dollars, as President Joe Bidenâs Build Back Better plan, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 still stands as one of the most significant pieces of climate legislation proposed in the U.S. It would put $369 billion toward clean energy, electric vehicles and a range of other climate programs.Senate Democrats say that the bill could cut emissions by 40% (most likely below 2005 levels, a benchmark the Biden administration has used in the past). Thatâs not enough to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the globally agreed upon level that would limit most catastrophic outcomes, but itâs close. According to Climate Action Tracker, the bill would bring the U.S. from âinsufficientâ to âalmost sufficient,â increasing the chances that the world can keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius.The bill, at 725 pages, goes into great detail outlining how the hundreds of billions of dollars should be spent.

So, if anything, itâs trendy.But when the seed-stage VC â a backer of e-bike maker Zoomo and solar data firm PVcase â debuted with a $13.6 million fund in 2017, its focus was âobviously contrarian,â founding partner Rokas Peciulaitis told TechCrunch, as the âindustries in vogue at the time were AI and Fintech.âThe launch also marked an unexpected pivot for Peciulaitis, who says he dove into the scene with âliterally zero climate tech sector experience.â Heâd recently left an inflation-trading job at Bank of America, where the work was ânot fulfilling in the slightest,â Peciulaitis said in a nod to the bankâs reputation as a major funder of fossil fuels.In 2017, PitchBook recorded 578 climate tech deals globally, altogether worth $12.5 billion. The sector has since tripled in size, as climate changeâdriven extreme weather events occupy evermore space in our collective consciousness. To that point: PitchBook tracked 1,130 climate tech deals globally in 2021, topping $44.8 billion in value. Climate tech is cool now, but Peciulaitisâs Lithuania-based venture firm is sticking with its name anyways.Like any venture capital firm, Contrarian says that it stands out through its emphasis on âdeveloping excellent relationships with founders.â Materially, the firm invests in tech that could help decarbonize transportation, industrial processes, energy and buildings.Contrarian has completed 21 deals to date, and this year it expanded beyond Lithuania with new partners in Berlin and London. The firm backs emerging startups in Europe as well as Israel, but nowhere else in the Middle East. Currently, the firm does not invest in agriculture-related tech, though the category has a significant carbon footprint of its own.In an email, Contrarian said it counts London-based tech VC Molten Ventures among its limited partners.

Total market deal value, down year over year, was up significantly in Q2, and the average value per deal has held steady at $23.6 million, more than triple what it was five years ago.In some ways, those modest numbers could be interpreted as a slight cooldown. But the sector is probably just taking a breather given its near-term potential. Just five years from now, PitchBook estimates the climate tech market will near $1.4 trillion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%.With that kind of growth coming down the pike, there are a lot of different bets to place in the climate tech sector, but a few stand out for their early-stage potential and favorable tailwinds.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Funding,,,

The material forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools. This offers the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, resulting in a material with magnetic properties similar to those of rare earth magnets.One of the most promising alternatives for permanent magnets is tetrataenite, an iron-nickel alloy with an ordered atomic structure. The material forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools. This offers the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, resulting in a material with magnetic properties similar to those of rare earth magnets.In the 1960s, tetrataenite was artificially formed by blasting iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, which allowed the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking. However, this technique is unsuitable for mass production. âSince then, scientists have been fascinated with getting that ordered structure, but itâs always felt like something that was very far away,â Greer says.In the 1960s, tetrataenite was artificially formed by blasting iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, which allowed the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking.

But when Ivanov looked closer, he identified the tetrataenite.Initially, the diffraction pattern of tetrataenite looks like the structure expected for iron-nickel alloys, namely a disordered crystal not of interest as a high-performance magnet. But when Ivanov looked closer, he identified the tetrataenite.According to the team, phosphorus allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years. They were able to accelerate tetrataenite formation by between 11 and 15 orders of magnitude by mixing iron, nickel, and phosphorus in the right quantities. This meant the material was able to form over a few seconds in a simple casting.According to the team, phosphorus allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years.

We just melted the alloy, poured it into a mold, and we had tetrataenite,â says Greer. âThe previous view in the field was that you couldnât get tetrataenite unless you did something extreme, because otherwise, youâd have to wait millions of years for it to form. This result represents a total change in how we think about this material.ââWhat was so astonishing was that no special treatment was needed.

other news sites800,https://www.freethink.com/technology/minimally-invasive-surgery,Robotic surgery is a game changer for minimally invasive surgery,"Once the stuff of science fiction, robotic surgery is now used in hospitals across the world for a wide variety of procedures. Across several common procedures, some research has found that robotic surgery can improve outcomes in areas such as blood loss, complications, and recovery times, compared to open and some laparoscopic surgeries.Robotic procedures have been game changers in minimally invasive care, and innovative surgical systems have been crucial. Robotic surgery isnât performed by a machine; a specially trained surgeon uses advanced medical technology to streamline the surgical process. The end goal is to increase safety, reduce complications, and improve patient outcomes. By reducing surgical trauma and increasing precision, robotic surgery can help pave the way for predictable, reproducible results.Although robotic surgery has made impressive advances over the past two decades, there is much more to be done. As minimally invasive care continues to advance, researchers are finding new ways to help surgeons do more for patients.How robotic surgery worksThe first commercially viable robotic surgical system was developed in the late 1990s by Intuitive. Intuitiveâs systems have gone on to become the most advanced and widely used in the world. Four generations of its pioneering da Vinci system have so far been used in more than 10 million procedures.Intuitiveâs robotic surgical systems enable surgeons to use a console, precisely guiding surgical instruments inside the patientâs body. The surgeonâs hand movements are translated in real time to the instruments, which are situated on a cart beside the patient. The instruments are small, nimble, and have a greater range of motion than the human wrist and hand, helping to enable surgical precision in moments that matter.In contrast to open surgery, which typically requires a large incision, robotic surgery involves one or more very small incisions to insert the robotic arms. One of the arms has a camera that feeds high-quality 3D video to the surgeonâs console.âI remember distinctly when I first sat at the console,â says Tanuja Damani, a general surgeon at New York University who first began using the da Vinci system in 2011. âI realized right away that this was the future of surgery. But there was tremendous skepticism early on.âDr. Damani and other early adopters saw the potential of this approach. Their vision, perseverance, and mentoring have smoothed the way for those who have followed.Take Amanda Pysher, a young bariatric and general surgeon with Surgical Consultants of Northern Virginia, who was first introduced to robotics during her residency and fellowship. Unlike Dr. Damani, Dr. Pysher has benefited from a robust network of mentors, whoâve helped her as sheâs learned the ropes of using the da Vinci system. Sheâs become so comfortable with the system that three years ago she focused her practice on robotic surgery. She now mentors other surgeons who are in the process of learning robotic surgery.âI think it has been easier for me to transition to robotics than the first adopters years ago,â she says. âItâs one of the reasons I feel so strongly about mentoring. I want to be able to give back and help others the way that the mentors above me helped me. Weâre helping people live longer for their families and their friends. I just canât think of any other surgery which has a bigger impact than that.âRobotic surgeryâs impact on patientsFor both Dr. Pysher and Dr. Damani, the goal is to do more for their patients. One such patient is Jennifer Luebke. Last year, after struggling with her weight for decades, Luebke decided to have a robotic bariatric surgery with Dr. Pysher.That decision stemmed largely from her sense that her weight increased her long-term health risks. âI want to be able to grow old and be a grandmother, and I really didnât see that in my future,â Luebke says. âI really was concerned. This is the one thing that has completely changed my life.âAs an emergency room nurse, Luebke was reluctant to undergo traditional open bariatric surgery â sheâd seen patients whoâd had to deal with complications. But as her weight increased and her health problems grew, she decided that robotic surgery might reduce the risk of complications.Her decision paid off. After the procedure, she spent the night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning.As the technology continues to advance, more and more surgeons and hospitals are coming on board.The number of worldwide robotic procedures more than doubled between 2012 to 2020. A study published two years ago in JAMA Network Open analyzed records from 73 hospitals in Michigan, finding that 8.7 percent of surgeons performed robotic general surgery in 2012; by 2018, that number had jumped to over 35 percent.âWe are turning the skeptics into believers,â Dr. Damani says. âThe shared sense of purpose of the robotics surgery community now is something that is so refreshing.âTotal da Vinci Practice**Total da Vinci Practice refers to the transferable value of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci system across procedures in a surgeonâs minimally invasive practice. It is at the surgeonâs discretion to determine when a patient is a candidate for minimally invasive surgery and whether robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci system is an option.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,robotic surgery,,,,

The companyâs technology can sort waste streams in ways that traditional systems never could and at a cost thatâs far lower than most waste-handling facilities.As TechCrunch reported earlier, the tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups â the robots can even identify the brands on packaging.AMPâs robots already have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.At the beginning of the year, AMP Robotics worked with its investor, Sidewalk Labs, on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits. Sidewalk Labs is transporting the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics.Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how theyâre doing in their recycling efforts.It was only last November that the Denver-based AMP Robotics raised a $16 million round from Sequoia Capital and others to finance the early commercialization of its technology.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,trash sorting robot,,,,

Luckily there is no shortage of sustainable packaging startups in Europe. Just take a look: Circleback (Germany), Recup (Germany), Sourceful (U.K.), one â¢ five (Germany), Shellworks (U.K.), Woola (Estonia), Papkot (France), Biotic (Israel), FunCell (France) and Traceless (Germany).The latest to join the ranks is Magical Mushroom Company (MMC). Itâs now raised a Â£3 million seed round led by Ecovative Design LLC with participation by Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity (a green energy company in the U.K.); Robert Del Naja (activist); and Marcus Watson, co-founder of Adoreum Partners, who brought 30 other investors.The investment will be used to fund the opening of its first raw material production plant.MMCâs solution is a direct replacement for plastic-based packaging such as polystyrene and cardboard. It does this by combining agricultural waste with mycelium â the root structure of a mushroom. The result, claims the company, is biodegradable (in 45 days), durable and comparable in price to traditional packaging derived from fossil fuels like polystyrene.Launched in 2019, MMCâs clients include Raymarine, BA Components, Castrads, Ffern, Selfridges, Lush, Seedlip and ID Watch, among many others.Paul Gilligan, CEO and founder at Magical Mushroom Company, said in a statement: âWe have just eight years to meet the UNâs Sustainable Development Goals and businesses have a crucial role to play â but they need viable and cost-effective solutions that significantly reduce the carbon footprint across their entire supply chain.

In total, AgriWebb has raised $27 million in Series B and about $29.3 million since its inception in 2014. It did not disclose its valuation when asked.Its app allows users to visualize their operations and give insights on animals and grazing, including the best grass location and which animals gain weight. On top of that, it lets ranchers improve their sustainable land management for better profits and leverage the on-farm data theyâre recording to make more intelligent business decisions, according to the company.AgriWebb claims more than 16,000 farmers and ranchers globally are using its cloud-based platform and managing approximately 19 million animals on over 136 million acres of grazing land across the globe, including Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.The global beef market is estimated at $500 billion, but the pure farm management software market in its core geographies is estimated at around $3.5 billion, the company executive chairman Justin Webb told TechCrunch. AgriWebbâs key markets include Australia â where more than 15% of the national herd is managed using its platform â the U.K. and the U.S. Additionally, AgriWebb has partnerships in Brazil and South Africa, Webb said.Unlike most competitors who act as a point solution focused on one or two areas of farm management, AgriWebbâs platform brings together animal management, grazing management and team communication; task and compliance management; and daily record-keeping in one place, Webb explained. âIts grazing insights enable ranchers to maximize productivity, eliminate waste, and validate grazing and animal management decisions in a way that other record-keeping systems canât touch,â Webb pointed out.Webb founded AgriWebb with John Fargher (chief revenue officer) and Kevin Baum (chief executive officer) in 2014. In Australia, the three founders discovered that farmers were not only interested in the advantages of technology but were also desperately cobbling their own solutions with scrappy spreadsheets and notebooks.âLivestock producers deserve better technology to help them maximize their business and consumers need more reliable provenance for the animal and environmental welfare of their food,â Webb said. âAgriWebb has always been about serving the farmers, and this round of funding doesnât change our mission; it simply magnifies it.âThe latest funding will be used for the international expansion of AgriWebb to ranchers and farmers in the U.S., the U.K., and Latin America, both directly and via partnerships. AgriWebb has secured customers in 28 of the 50 states since its U.S. launch in 2021 and plans to continue rapidly expanding. In addition, the latest funding will enable the company to establish its database.Apart from the funding, AgriWebb recently joined two project proposals to the USDA CSC program, one led by American Farmland Trust and the other by Farm Journalâs Trust in Food initiative, Webb said. Both aim to improve the U.S. beef supply chainâs climate footprint and scale regenerative agriculture practices, Webb continued. One project is focused on improving transparency in the beef supply chain and understanding the GHG impact of different practices; the second aims to scale the adoption of practices through payments for practice changes.âThereâs a misconception that agriculture is at odds with climate, but the importance of sustainability and implementing sustainable practices is far from lost on farmers and producers,â Webb said. âIn fact, the long-term sustainability and viability of their land are of utmost importance. Talk to any landholder and youâll understand their long-term goal is to pass on their land in better condition to the next generation. Sustainable and regenerative practices can and do exist in tandem with productive and profitable farms, and we remain steadfast in our endeavor to support producers now and in the future through data that measures, manages and improves the sustainability of the food supply chain from farm to plate.âThe company raised its first Series B from investors, including Telus Ventures, Grosvenor Food & AgTech and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in January 2021.âAgriWebb fits with Germin8âs thesis to invest in the full-stack enterprise software companies within AgTech that bring essential enterprise value to farmers in alignment with practices that are sustainable,â said managing partner at Germin8 Ventures Michael Lavin. âThere are very few software offerings capable of accelerating the regenerative agriculture practices our climate stands to benefit from, and even fewer that target livestock production rather than being at odds with it.â",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,farm management software,cloud based app for cattle management,,,

techcrunch847,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/05/7-investors-discuss-how-agtech-can-solve-agricultures-biggest-problems/,investors discuss how agtech can solve agriculture s biggest problems,"Climate change and geopolitical instability are wreaking havoc on agriculture. To gauge how VCs are responding to these issues, we spoke with seven investors.For starters, rising greenhouse gas emissions are driving punishing droughts and storms, which are harming crops, exacerbating food insecurity and threatening countless livelihoods. At the same time, Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine is rattling the worldâs grain supply, driving up costs and further aggravating supply chains.Even as these and other crises hammer the multitrillion-dollar industry, startup investors see potential for huge returns with tech that could boost yields, slash emissions and mitigate waste.âThere are opportunities to develop [and] adopt new technologies all along the food value chain that will impact key issues like food security and emissions,â Adam Anders, a managing partner at Anterra Capital, told TechCrunch. Among the areas where he sees the biggest potential impact, the investor cited improving plant genetics, boosting the shelf life of more products and putting digital tools in the hands of farmers.Consumer behavior is another piece of the proverbial puzzle as climate literacy increasingly alters how folks shop.âOver the last few years, we have seen skyrocketing interest in sustainability from consumers and food brands, and awareness over the negative impacts of agriculture continues to grow,â said Ting-Ting Liu, investor at Prosus Ventures. âPeople are not only paying more attention to agricultural-related emissions but also how much land and water is required to support the worldâs food supply and the amount of runoff being generated,â she said.Liu argued that this demand is creating strong tailwinds for businesses that strive to address agricultureâs environmental impact, ultimately driving more capital into everything from cellular agriculture to methane reduction solutions for livestock.Still, agtech is not immune to some of the broader trends in venture.While the value of agtech VC deals rose to $11.4 billion in 2021 from $6.5 billion in 2020, several investors told TechCrunch theyâve noticed a slowdown in agtech deals this year amid the wider tech downturn of 2022.â2021 was a record year for VC across the board. In 2022, VC investments across the board are about 30% lower year on year, and I would expect a similar slowdown for agtech,â Monica Varman, a partner at G2 Venture Partners, told TechCrunch. âOver the medium to long term, however, I do expect agtech VC funding to grow, given supply chain challenges, traceability concerns and advancements in enabling technologies in synbio and robotics,â she added.Agtech investors are also still largely funding men. Out of the nearly $11 billion dispensed into agtech in 2021, 78% went to firms with all-male founders, according to PitchBook. The disparity has only worsened so far in 2022, rising to 81% (out of nearly $7.3 billion) as of September 14, per the data firm.To gauge whether (and how) VCs are responding to these issues and more, we reached out to:Brett Brohl, managing director, Techstars Farm to Fork, and managing partner, Bread and Butter VenturesAgtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue?Itâs not going to continue in the short run largely because of macroeconomic factors youâre just not seeing â for example, many late-stage deals are going through recently â so in the short term, definitely not.In the long run, the sector has a tremendous amount of opportunity and room for innovation, so with time, you will see continued growth and investor focus on agtech.Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global GhG emissions. How has the climate crisis changed how you invest?It is a huge reason deal value skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. Investors understand that this challenge creates an opportunity. Agtech is not as mainstream as many other sectors, so we need more eyeballs and capital. If you are making the food system more effective and efficient, you are making it more sustainable.We arenât a big enough fund to finance a startup forever, and we depend on later-stage investors, so this attention and resulting influx of capital helps remove some risk from our portfolio.Which emerging technologies, such as cellular agriculture and AI-powered robots, have the greatest potential to impact key issues like food security and emissions in the next decade?We 100% believe in cellular agriculture and are also huge fans of the robotics space, especially robotics that solve very specific pain points and have low BOMs.âAutomation and computer vision will be transformative for agriculture over the next decade, particularly as food production is moved closer to the point of consumption due to food security concerns.â Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture PartnersWe also love the packaging space â lots of packaging goes into the transportation and movement of food. Weâre also excited about anything to do with logistics, manufacturing or transportation that makes the food chain more sustainable.When investing in an agtech startup, which green flags do you look for? Are you open to backing founders who donât have experience in the industry?Investing in agtech startups is no different from any other company. A great team can take a C- idea, pivot, iterate and make it work. But a C- founder will run any idea into the ground, regardless of how good it is.While founder-market fit can be a benefit to a company, great entrepreneurs are smart, have a great work ethic, are coachable and know how to surround themselves with people who make up for their weaknesses. So industry experience isnât a requirement for us.Which areas of agtech have received the most attention from early-stage founders in recent years? In which areas would you like to see more work done or investments?The obvious answer is alternative proteins. So much capital has been invested and so many founders are building cool things in the space.Iâd love to see more attention paid to things that are a bit downstream, such as manufacturing, logistics and the future of food retail. Over the last few years, you have seen traditional agtech investors move their thesis further downstream, so it is happening.Iâm also really interested in fintech applications in the agriculture space, like what Traive and Milk Moovement are doing.What are you doing to fund underrepresented founders in agtech?We actively seek out investors, forums and networks that support underrepresented founders and invest or work with entrepreneurs that are a stage earlier than where we invest. We also maintain a diverse investment team â 75% of our fund are women.Finally, we hold open office hours for anyone every week and provide free public education through multiple channels to help founders level up.Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 28% of wheat and 15% of corn exports globally. How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected agtech VC deal-making given its impact on the global supply chain and the worldâs grain supply?I donât think itâs done much to early-stage agtech founders or venture capital. The macroeconomic effect of the war has at least, in part, been a tightening of monetary supply, which will trickle down to early-stage startups. However, the impact has not been significant at early stages yet.Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, and a year earlier, ChemChina acquired Syngenta for $43 billion. Today, Bayerâs market cap is less than that dealâs value, and Chinaâs ambassador to Switzerland has called the Syngenta acquisition a bad deal for Beijing. Have the outcomes of these deals affected investorsâ hopes for blowout late-stage exits?I wouldnât call these acquisitions of âmodernâ agtech companies. Monsanto has been around for 100+ years, and Syngenta was formed over 20 years ago, and even then it was a spin-off. Additionally, these happened in 2017 and 2018. Investment in agtech has exploded since then, indicating that the market does not think these two acquisitions are indicative of underperforming venture investments.The outcomes of companies like Upside Foods, FBN and Indigo Ag will be far more important to the agtech ecosystem. Unfortunately, itâs a very tough market for late-stage companies right now, and that will slow exits and depress ROI on many venture investments, not just agtech deals.How do you prefer to receive pitches? Whatâs the most important thing a founder should know before they get on a call with you?Iâm open to warm intros, thoughtful cold emails or pitches during my open office hours. If youâre pitching me on a call, the number one thing is to be yourself.Anything else youâd like to comment on?I think the blurred lines between food tech and agtech are really interesting. What is agtech? Itâs not just farm inputs; there is a lot more to it and that, to me, is exciting.Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture PartnersAgtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue?2021 was a record year for VC.

The wheel is used in only one of MIRI 's four observation modes, the medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode, in which the camera takes not images but light spectra (fingerprints of light absorption of the various chemical elements in the observed objects).The ground control teams first detected friction in the wheel in late August, NASA officials wrote in a statement (opens in new tab) released on Tuesday (Sept. 20), and after further investigation decided to pause observations in the affected mode. On Sept. 6, the agency convened an anomaly review board ""to assess the best path forward,"" the statement added.Related: Marvel at the James Webb Space Telescope's largest image of the cosmos yet""The Webb team has paused in scheduling observations using this particular observing mode while they continue to analyze its behavior and are currently developing strategies to resume MRS observations as soon as possible,"" NASA officials wrote in the statement. ""The observatory is in good health, and MIRI's other three observing modes â imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy and coronagraphy â are operating normally and remain available for science observations.""MIRI, one of four high-tech instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope, is a combined camera and spectrograph, which means it takes both images and light spectra of the distant universe . A specialist in detecting mid-infrared wavelengths, MIRI can see light from far-away galaxies , as well as stars forming inside of shrouds of dust. While all of Webb's instruments require extremely low temperatures to observe properly, MIRI is the coldest of them all.The other three instruments â NIRCam, NIRSpec and FGS/NIRISS â rely on the telescope's tennis-court-sized sunshield to reach temperatures of minus 369.4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 223 degrees Celsius). MIRI, in addition to the sunshield, requires special cryocoolers to achieve an even colder temperature of minus 447 degrees F (minus 266 degrees C), only 12 degrees F (7 degrees C) above absolute zero, the temperature at which the motion of atoms stops.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,glitch in telescope camera,,,
other news sites865,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/21/1062001/spacex-starlink-signals-reverse-engineered-gps/,Starlink signals can be reverse engineered to work like GPS whether SpaceX likes it or not,"In a non peer-reviewed paper published on arXiv, Humphreys claims to have provided the most complete characterization of Starlinkâs signals to date. This information, he says, is the first step toward developing a new global navigation technology that would operate independently of GPS or its European, Russian, and Chinese equivalents.âThe Starlink system signal is a closely guarded secret,â says Humphreys. âEven in our early discussions, when SpaceX was being more cooperative, they didnât reveal any of the signal structure to us. We had to start from scratch, building basically a little radio telescope to eavesdrop on their signals.âTo get the project started, UT Austin acquired a Starlink terminal and used it to stream high-definition tennis videos of Rafael Nadal from YouTube. This provided a constant source of Starlink signals that a separate nearby antenna could listen in on.Humphreys quickly realized that Starlink relies on a technology called orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is an efficient method of encoding digital transmissions, originally developed at Bell Labs in the 1960s and now used in Wi-Fi and 5G. âOFDM is all the rage,â says Mark Psiaki, a GPS expert and aerospace professor at Virginia Tech. âItâs a way to pack the most bits per second into a given bandwidth.âThe UT Austin researchers did not try to break Starlinkâs encryption or access any user data coming down from satellites. Instead, they sought out synchronization sequencesâpredictable, repeating signals beamed down by the satellites in orbit to help receivers coordinate with them. Not only did Humphreys find such sequences, but âwe were pleasantly surprised to find that they [had] more synchronization sequences than is strictly required,â he says.Each sequence also contains clues to the satelliteâs distance and velocity. With the Starlink satellites transmitting about four sequences every millisecond âthatâs just wonderful for dual use of their system for positioning,â says Humphreys.If the terrestrial receiver has a good idea of the satellitesâ movementsâwhich SpaceX shares online to reduce the risk of orbital collisionsâit can use the sequencesâ regularity to work out which satellite they came from, and then calculate the distance to that satellite. By repeating this process for multiple satellites, a receiver can locate itself to within about 30 meters, says Humphreys.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,GPS navigation through Starlink,non-reliant on external company or government,,,

other news sites698,https://electrek.co/2022/09/23/second-largest-us-electric-school-bus-fleet-just-crossed-500k-miles/,The second largest electric school bus fleet in the US just crossed service miles,"The school year is beginning, so the buses will be out in full force. However, you may notice a significant difference this year as emission-free electric school buses roll out across the United States. One of the nationâs leading school bus manufacturers, Thomas Built Buses, just achieved a major milestone with help from its Virginia-based dealer Sonny Merryman â Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley electric school buses have now driven more than 500,000 miles.Electric school buses are designed for a cleaner, sustainable future. Not only do they produce zero emissions, but they are also more efficient, can cost less to maintain, and have abilities their gas-powered counterparts lack.450,000 yellow school buses across the United States travel over 4.3 billion miles each year, according to information from the US Department of Transportations National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).More importantly, toxic emissions from traditional school buses can harm students, bus drivers, and the communities they drive in.Although the EPA has introduced stricter standards, itâs not enough as many school buses still emit harmful diesel exhaust. With federal funding more accessible than ever for electric school buses, making the transition makes sense.As of June 2022, 38 states had adopted electric school buses thanks to several initiatives such as the $5 billion Clean School Bus program.Meanwhile, states like Virginia are taking the initiative to provide funding and accelerate the transition. For example, in 2019, Virginiaâs Governor Ralph Northam and Dominion Energy announced an initiative to provide 13,000 electric school buses by the end of 2030.Through programs like these, Virginia has grown to become the countryâs second-largest electric bus fleet, currently operating 64 Thomas Built electric school buses. In a significant milestone, the electric school buses have now traveled over 500,000 miles, with more buses expected to be delivered as the school year progresses.Growth of electric school buses in Virginia Source: Sonny MerrymanThomas Built Buses achieves 500,000 electric miles in VirginiaThe first electric school bus to roll out in the state of Virginia was Thomas Built Busesâ Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley in November 2020.One C2 Jouley electric bus can transport 81 students with up to 138 miles of range and a 226 kWh standard battery capacity.Virginia now has 64 electric buses in total. The first 50 were purchased and deployed through the Dominion Energy program, and the remaining 14 were bought using funds from the American Power electric school bus program.The 500,000 miles driven include several different terrains (city, rural, and hills) and distances from less than 20 miles to more than 90 miles. Although the electric buses have primarily been used for regular school routes, a few have made their way to field trips, band competitions, and more.By using electric buses for these trips, 447.7 short tons of greenhouse gases were avoided, according to the AFLEET tool.Through the experience so far, Thomas Built Buses dealer Sonny Merryman and its customers have learned a few critical takeaways that can help others deploy electric buses safely and efficiently:Properly train drivers and technicians for a smooth transition.Consider assigning a partner or team to help with the deployment.Perhaps, most importantly, the electric buses have withstood various operational tests, and drivers who have switched to the electric Jouley school buses have loved them so far, according to the school bus dealer.Electrekâs TakeFirst things first, congratulations to Thomas Built Buses and Sonny Merryman on the huge milestone. Electric school buses protect students and communities from harmful emissions while saving school districts money on fuel and maintenance in the long run.At the same time, I think there is a major takeaway from this case study. State funding works, and electric buses are the future. Virginia is proving it. California has proved it. State leaders need to get on board to speed up the transition.

His previous projects, LayWoo-d3 and Laybrick, are two non-warping plastics that offer wood and brick-like consistencies when extruded. Oddly, LayWoo-d3 actually smells like wood when printed.Now heâs created a bendable printing filament called BENDLAY that is 91% transparent and remains âbendableâ after printing.One of the problems with ABS plastic is that it can split and warp as it is formed and it isnât quite food safe. It is also very brittle and will âwhitenâ when bent, resulting in a messy final object. This filament is made of stretchy Butadiene, a form of synthetic rubber. It is foodsafe and can be used for clear bottles and containers and works well for flexible straps.While ABS can be used to create flexible items like bracelets, this material will truly bend without breaking, allowing for hinges and other mechanical parts to be built into other, stiffer parts.It costs $42 a roll, which is about right for a pound or so of 3mm filament, and comes on 750 gram rolls. It should work with almost any extruder-based device but, sadly, doesnât smell like fresh rubber.via 3DPrintingIndustry",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,bendable 3d printing material,,,,
other news sites814,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lithograhy-tool-russia-7nm-2028,Russian University Vows to Buildnm Chipmaking Tools,"A Russian institute is developing its own lithography scanner that could produce chips using 7nm-class fabrication technologies. The machine is under development, with the plan to build it by 2028. When it is ready, it should be more efficient than ASML's Twinscan NXT:2000i tool, whose development took over a decade.After Russia unleashed its bloody war against Ukraine on February 24, Taiwan was quick to ban shipments of advanced chips to the nation. The U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. then followed up with sanctions that effectively prohibit virtually all contract chipmakers with advanced fabs from working with Russian entities. In addition, companies like Arm cannot license their technologies to Russia-based chip designers. As a result, the Russian government rolled out a national program to develop the country's own 28nm-class fabrication technology by 2030, reverse engineer as many foreign chips as possible, and educate local talent to work on domestic chips.However, there is a problem with a 28nm-class production node by 2030. Russia's most advanced fab can produce chips using a 65nm fabrication technology. Meanwhile, American and European makers of fab tools cannot supply their equipment to Russia due to sanctions, so the country has to design and build domestic wafer production equipment if it wants to adopt a 28nm node. Essentially, what has taken companies like ASML and Applied Materials decades to develop and iterate has to be done in about eight years.Apparently, the Russian Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences intends to beat all expectations and produce a 7nm-capable lithography scanner by 2028, according to its plans published on Nizhy Novgorod Strategy Development website (via CNews).A modern lithography scanner capable of processing wafers using a 7nm-class process technology is a highly complex apparatus that involves a high-performance light source, sophisticated optics, and precise metrology, just to name a few critical parts. However, as a leading applied physics university in Russia, IAP believes that it can develop such a tool in a relatively short amount of time.The tool will be somewhat different from scanners produced by companies like ASML or Nikon. For example, IAP plans to use a >600W light source (total power, not intermediate focus power) with an 11.3nm exposure wavelength (EUV wavelength is 13.5nm), which will require considerably more sophisticated optics than exists today. Because the light source of the device will be relatively low power, it will make the tool more compact and easier to build. Yet, it also means that its production of the scanner will be considerably lower than that of modern deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools. That might not be a problem, according to IAP.When it comes to timing, IAP may be slightly too optimistic. For everything below 32nm, chipmakers use the so-called immersion lithography (which is essentially a booster to DUV tools). ASML introduced its first immersion lithography system â the Twinscan XT:1250i â in late 2003 with a plan to deliver one in Q3 2004 to produce 65nm logic chips and 70nm half-pitch DRAMs. It took the company about five years and another generation of tools to announce its 32nm-capable Twinscan NXT:1950i in late 2008, with customer deliveries starting in 2009.Then, it took the market leader some nine years to deliver its 7nm and 5nm-capable Twinscan NXT:2000i DUV tool in 2018. TSMC used less advanced tools with multi-patterning for its first-generation N7 fabrication technology, but the timing of ASMLâs introductions demonstrate how hard it is to transition from 65nm to 7nm. It took ASML 14 years to go from 65nm to 7nm. Now, IAP, which does not have any experience in chip production or ties with chipmakers, intends to build a 7nm-capable machine for volume production from scratch in about six years. While the plan does not sound feasible, it looks like IAP is full of enthusiasm.""ASML, the global lithography leader, has been developing its EUV lithography system for almost 20 years and the technology has turned out to be incredibly complex,"" said Nikolai Chkhalo, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences for scientific and technological development. ""The main objective of ASML in this case was to maintain the extremely high productivity that is needed only at the world's largest factories. In Russia, no one needs such high productivity. In our work, we start from the needs and tasks faced by domestic microelectronics â and this is not so much about quantity, but about quality. First of all, we need to transit to our own fabrication processes, develop our own design standards, our own tools, engineering, materials, so our own path is inevitable here. In fact, we need to balance between simplicity and performance.""IAP plans to build a fully functional alpha scanner by 2024. This one will not have to offer high productivity or maximum resolution but will have to work and be attractive to potential investors. IAP intends to build a beta version of the scanner with higher productivity and resolution by 2026. This machine should be mass production ready, but its productivity is not expected to be at its maximum. The final iteration of the litho scanner is said to emerge in 2028. It should get a high-performance light source (hence better productivity), better metrology and overall capabilities. There is no word how many of such machines IAP and/or its production partners will be able to produce by 2028.It should be noted that fab equipment is not limited to lithography scanners. There are other types of machines performing etching, deposition, resist removal, metrology, and inspection operations that are not made in Russia. Furthermore, there is somewhat less advanced machinery like ultrapure air and water generators which also are not produced in Russia. Even if IAP RAS manages to build a lithography tool, Russia will still be a few hundred tools short of building a modern fab. Also, fabs need ultrapure raw materials produced in countries that will not supply to Russia.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Russian attempt to produce 7nm capable lithography scanner,,,

Cost, flavor, and convenience are all factors in this imbalance, but as health statistics show, we should be working harder to reverse our dietary trends.A startup called PairWise is out to help change the way we eat by making fruits and vegetables more appealing. The company is zeroing in on traits that may deter people from consuming produce and tweaking those traits using CRISPR gene editing. Their hope is that the resulting products will not only pique consumersâ interest, but keep them healthy and keep them coming back. Tom Adams, PairWise cofounder and CEO, shared details about the company and its products in an interview.CRISPRâd ProduceCRISPR was first used to edit bacterial DNA in 2012. Since then, scientists have used the tool to edit the genomes of crops, animals, and even humans, and have begun testing it as a means of curing inherited conditions from blindness to muscular dystrophy and other genetic diseases.CRISPR is made up of a synthesized sequence of guide RNA that matches a target DNA sequenceâthat is, the portion of DNA to be alteredâand a Cas enzyme. Once in a cellâs nucleus, the guide RNA links up with the target DNA sequence. The Cas enzyme cuts the DNA at that point, and the cell repairs the cut. The repairs can either knock out a gene, inactivating it, or insert a new sequence.Modifying a gene that encodes for a given trait either eliminates or alters that trait; in the case of fruits and vegetables, say, the bitterness of mustard greens or the seeds in blackberries. Given that the genomes of PairWise products are modified, some consumers may want to know whether the fruits and vegetables are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs).The short answer is no. The USDA doesnât regulate gene-edited plants as long as their traits could have occurred through traditional breeding methods or a whim of nature. The CRISPR technique PairWise uses involves manipulating genes that exist naturally in a given speciesâ genome. âThe changes PairWise has made in our greens are no different than what can be achieved through conventional breeding, contain no foreign DNA, and therefore are not considered GMOs,â Adams said.GMOs, on the other hand, can contain genes from other species, and wouldnât come about naturally even after decades of traditional breeding. Bt crops, for example, are engineered to contain a natural form of pesticide derived from bacteria, which means they donât need to be sprayed with chemical pesticides.Adams pointed out that the anti-GMO sentiment out there isnât necessarily about resistance to the technology itself. âThereâs a lot of reasons GMOs may be less popular, and one of them is that people didnât feel there was transparency,â he said. âMost of the products that fall under the category GMO are things that get added to foods as ingredients, and nobody knew when they were getting it and when they werenât, and it created this stigma.âHe wants PairWise to take a more proactive and transparent approach. âWeâre going to be very clear about the processes weâre using to create the products, and itâs your choice whether you like the benefits or youâre worried about the technology,â he said.Next-Gen ProduceThe first product PairWise will bring to market is a milder-tasting version of mustard greens. âAlmost four years ago, we were searching for things we could do that were amenable to the technology but also were addressing a consumer need,â Adams said.The companyâs market research found that people often ended up buying romaine lettuce even after saying theyâd prefer kale or another green because of their greater nutritional value. âPeople want healthy salads, but they keep buying romaine because theyâre used to the flavor,â Adams said. Ease of preparation is a factor too.Mustard greens, Adams told me, are a relative of kale, but they taste like horseradish when you bite into them. Two components come together that react and cause the horseradish flavor. PairWise used CRISPR-Cas12a to edit the greenâs genome and remove one of those components. âItâs really just removing something that the plant doesnât need for survival and doesnât contribute to the nutritional benefits,â Adams said. The mustard greens have already been approved by the FDA and will start being sold in California and the Pacific Northwest in early 2023 under the brand Conscious Foods.The companyâs not stopping there, though; they have multiple fruit and veggie improvement projects underway.One is a softer version of kale. If youâve ever made a kale salad from the stuff that comes still on the stalk, you know itâs labor-intensive: thereâs the washing, the de-stemming, the chopping, the massagingâ¦ (thatâs right, massaging!). PairWise kale will retain all of the leafy greenâs nutritional properties, but have a texture more like lettuce, making it easier to prepare and eat.Another is seedless berries, including blackberries and raspberries. Hate how those tiny seeds get stuck in your teeth, always in the hardest-to-reach places? CRISPR to the rescue.One of the companyâs most intriguing projects, in my opinion, is pitless cherries.âI love cherries, but theyâre a pain to eat,â Adams said. âYour fingers are all red when youâre done with a few of them, and if thereâs not a trash can nearby you donât know what to do with the pit.â I asked him how itâs possible to grow a cherryâor any other stone fruit, like plums, peaches, or apricotsâwithout the pit, as it connects to the fruitâs stem and is its lifeline to the tree.âItâs easiest to think about it like a seedless grape,â he said. âIt actually still has a seed in it, but the seed has lost its hard outer shell. Thereâs still that nutritious plant embryo thatâs normally protected by the shell, weâre just making it so itâs all edible.â If they succeed, eating pitless cherries will be a different experience altogether; isnât having to remove the pit the only thing keeping us from stuffing handfuls of the scrumptious fruit into our mouths at once?A Whole New PlantWhen it comes to cherries, itâs not just the end product PairWise is focusing on. Currently 90 percent of sweet cherries are grown in Washington state, where thereâs little to no rain in the summer. The fruit is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and can only thrive in a dry climate; this specificity and the fact that the fruit needs to be shipped from the far northwest corner of the country pushes up its price. But what if cherries could grow in, say, Michigan, or Kansas, or Vermont?âWe think we understand the genetics well enough that we could modify the architecture of the tree so that itâs more like a blueberry bush,â Adams said. âAnd then you can grow them in more environments and put them at less risk.âPairWise is also trying to alter the way blackberries grow. The moisture sensitivity has already been taken care of by nature, as has the bush-not-tree situationâbut the bushes have thorns, and thorns make fruit hard to harvest. The company is working on cutting out the thorns.Hereâs an idea: blueberry-sized cherries without a pit that grow on bushes without thorns in any climate. Seems like a product that would need a whole new name, and heck if I have any suggestions. (Not to mention, it probably wouldnât occur naturally no matter how many generations you waited.)Getting HealthierBe it softer kale, pitless cherries, or thornless bushes, PairWiseâs mission is to create a healthier world by taking away barriers to eating fresh produce. âWeâre interested in anything that moves the needle on the fact that only 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables,â Adams said. âIt really doesnât change very much just by telling people they should eat more of them. Our idea is, you need to take down the barriers.âItâs certainly a noble aim. But how likely is engineered produce to play an instrumental role in changing consumersâ habits, or in attracting a previously-veggie-averse demographic? People who already buy and eat kale on a regular basis may opt for a smoother kale 2.0, but people who have never bought kale may not be so easily swayed by a newfangled version of the green.Adams believes thereâs a consumer base out there who will benefit from products like PairWiseâs. âThere are people who are looking for a healthy lifestyle,â he said. âAnd theyâre looking for something different in salads. Weâre coming in with a new category: a nutritious green that still tastes good.âPhysical traits of produce may be one barrier that deters people from buying them, but cost is equally important (if not more so). With years of research and development going into CRISPRâd produce, my assumption was that it wonât be affordable. Ten dollars for a bag of lettuce-like kale? No thanks.Not the case, according to Adams. âThereâs a fairly wide range of pricing within the salad space. We expect to be in the top quartile of the pricing, but weâre not going to be above it,â he said. Production of PairWise greens, he added, is actually quite cost-competitive with other types of salad greens.Based on marketing activation events the company ran over the summer in Seattle, Austin, and Palo Alto, the outlook for their first product looks pretty rosy. They gave away bags of salad (which were clearly labeled as being gene-edited) consisting of red- and green-leaf mustard greens, and asked people to complete a short survey about it. Adams estimated that more than 6,000 people tried the salads, and over 90 percent responded that they were âvery motivatedâ or âsomewhat motivatedâ to buy the product.A New Green Revolution?Helping people make healthier dietary choices is just one benefit that CRISPR could bring to produce. Its possibilities are wide-ranging, as evidenced by PairWiseâs work to create fruit trees that can grow in different climates and yield food thatâs easier to harvest. Itâs not unlike Norman Borlaugâs work back in the 1940s to create a high-yield wheat seed that was resistant to stem rustâa project that ended up saving millions of people from hunger and famine.The difference is that technology has taken over the painstaking, time-consuming steps Borlaug had to slog through, like pollinating and inspecting thousands of plants by hand (a hundred and ten thousand in just one growing season! Talk about labor-intensive).Adams sees PairWiseâs work similarly and believes CRISPR holds all sorts of possibilities for a new frontier of engineered foods. âWeâre doing the same thing as traditional plant breeders, but itâs just faster,â he said. âWe could create a lot more resilience for the whole food system.âImage Credit: Anrita from Pixabay",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,CRISPR edited fruit,GMO that is technically not a GMO,,,

General Motors is preparing to roll out a $30,000 Chevy Equinox electric vehicle in the most popular part of the U.S. auto market. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)WARREN, Mich. (AP) â Even though battery costs are rising, auto companies are rolling out more affordable electric vehicles that should widen their appeal to a larger group of buyers.The latest came Thursday from General Motors, a Chevrolet Equinox small SUV with a starting price somewhere around $30,000 and a range-per-charge of 250 miles (400 kilometers). You can get range of 300 miles (500 kilometers) if you pay more.GM wonât release the exact price of the Equinox EV until closer to the date it goes on sale, about this time next year. But the SUV is at the low end of Edmunds.comâs list of prices for electric vehicles sold in the U.S., where the average cost of an EV is around $65,000.Hitting a price around $30,000 and a range per charge close to 300 miles is key to getting mainstream buyers to switch away from gasoline vehicles, industry analysts say.âYouâre kind of at that sweet spot,â said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. âYouâre basically at the price point that everyone is clamoring for.âADVERTISEMENTAuto industry analysts say that if the Equinox makes efficient use of interior space with plenty of cargo and passenger room, and if it is styled similar to current gas-powered small SUVs, it should be a hit in the most popular segment of the U.S. auto market. About 20% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. are compact SUVs.âItâs a perfect vehicle for a lot of different users, whether itâs a small family, maybe an empty nester,â said Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, a Detroit-area consulting firm. âYouâve got space to haul things, but itâs easy to drive.âA $30,000 EV that checks all of the boxes is just a little above the price of a comparable small gas-powered SUV. The Toyota RAV4, the top seller in the segment and the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that isnât a pickup, starts at just over $28,000.Until the last few years, electric vehicles were either expensive and aimed at affluent luxury buyers, or cheaper but with limited travel ranges. For example, a base version of Teslaâs Model 3, the lowest-price model from the top-selling EV brand in the U.S., starts at more than $48,000. A larger Tesla Model X SUV starts at over $120,000.ADVERTISEMENTThe only EVs with starting prices under $30,000 (including shipping) now are versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt. Both are smaller than a typical gas-powered compact SUV. The Mini Cooper Electric, Mazda MX30 and Hyundai Kona Electric are in the $30,000s, according to Edmunds.Kiaâs Niro EV, Hyundaiâs Ioniq 5, Fordâs F-150 Lightning pickup, the Volkswagen ID.4, Kia EV6, Toyota b24x, Fordâs Mustang Mach E, Audiâs Q4 e-tron, the Subaru Solterra, Polestar 2, and Tesla Model 3 all have starting prices in the $40,000s.GM may find it difficult to keep the Equinox price around $30,000, largely because minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and nickel that are key components of batteries have been rising fast. Thereâs a finite number of mines and increasing demand as nearly all automakers introduce new EVs.ADVERTISEMENTDrury says that even if GM is able to keep the Equinox starting price around $30,000, demand likely will be high enough so the company builds mainly higher-priced versions. And some dealers have been marking up EVs beyond the automakerâs sticker price due to high demand. In the first half of the year, U.S. EV sales rose 68% from the same period a year ago, to nearly 313,000.Some EVs could get a whole lot cheaper in the U.S., too, with federal tax credits starting next year of up to $7,500 that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act . But meeting federal requirements may be difficult.The vehicles and batteries have to be assembled in North America, and the new law phases in requirements that battery minerals and parts have to come from the continent. Most minerals such as lithium, a key battery ingredient, are now imported from China and other countries.The Equinox checks the North American assembly box. It will be made in Mexico. The company wonât say where the battery will be made, but GM has announced three joint-venture battery factories in the U.S., including one thatâs operating already in Warren, Ohio.ADVERTISEMENTFrom there, GM is working on meeting the other criteria for getting the tax credit. âWeâre really working through the rules and the regulations right now,â said Steve Majoros, vice president of marketing for Chevrolet. âWe think itâs all lining up nicely, but more details to come on that.âMajoros hinted that it may take a couple of years to meet all the governmentâs requirements to get the full credit as GM takes more control of its supply chain for EV parts.The Equinox EV, Majoros said, is longer, wider and a bit shorter than the gas versions of the same vehicle. GM used new interior packaging methods to create comparable passenger and cargo space to the gas Equinox, he said. The relatively small price difference between the two should get many customers to consider EV over gas, he said.âIt does a lot of things right,â Majoros said. âSo when it does that, the (sales) volume follows.âADVERTISEMENTGM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will overtake Tesla as the nationâs largest seller of EVs by the middle of this decade. The Equinox EV is a step toward that.âWe think itâs going to be one of the products thatâs really going to help that mainstream adoption really take off in the marketplace,â Majoros said.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,cheaper electric vehicles,,,

It also uses a length scale input to characterize the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration.âThe convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,â the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production.Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08.âIncreasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilized in agrivoltaic systems,â said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. âThat could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.âPopular contentThrough the modeling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelized cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters. With two-meter spacing, the LCOE was $0.33/kWh, and with 11 meters it was $0.36/kWh.The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modeling in the study âTechnoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,â recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.Other recent proposals for using convective solar module cooling include packing PV panels in close proximity, and taking wind direction and module inclination into account.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,increasing space between solar panels leads to better cooling,,,

It found that nearly half the generating capacity was installed in the US during 2021 and is poised to dominate future installs. That's in part because costs have dropped by more than 75 percent since 2010; it's now often cheaper to build and operate a solar plant than it is to simply buy fuel for an existing natural gas plant.The analysis was performed before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains many incentives and tax breaks that should expand solar's advantages in the coming years.Solar, by the numbersIn terms of large, utility-scale solar installs, the US added over 12.5 gigawatts of new capacity last year, bringing the total installed capacity to over 50 gigawatts. Texas led the way, with about a third of the total capacity added (3.9 GW) going online in the Lone Star State. Combined with residential and other distributed solar installations, solar alone accounted for 45 percent of the new generating capacity added to the grid last year.AdvertisementThat growth showed up in figures on how much energy solar supplies. Five states now receive more than 15 percent of their electricity from solar power, including Massachusetts and Vermont, with California receiving 25 percent of its electricity from the Sun.Solar's expansion has largely been driven by falling costs. The DOE estimates that the price of building a solar plant has been dropping by an average of about 10 percent a year, leading to a fall of over 75 percent since 2010. That has left prices averaging about $1.35 for each watt of capacity in 2021. Large-scale plants benefit the most, with projects over 50 megawatts costing about 20 percent less than those under 20 MW.The drop in prices is causing some somewhat odd trends, driven by the fact that it's becoming increasingly economical to install large facilities in states that don't get as much sun, like Maine, Michigan, and Wisconsin. As a result, the past several years have seen the average incoming energy at newly constructed facilities (measured as daily kilowatt-hours per square meter) drop by about 20 percent.That has helped cause a large spread in what's called the capacity factor, which is calculated by dividing the amount of energy produced at a facility by the maximum energy it could have generated if it produced 24 hours a day. The median capacity factor of solar plants in the US was 24 percent, but outliers were as low as 9 percent and as high as 35 percent. As prices continue to fall, this spread may become more pronounced, with more plants at the low end of the range.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,"solar capacity in US increases, prices drop",,,

And by focusing on renewables and solar, Oz Minerals has absolute clarity on its electricity costs for the life of the mine.The West Musgrave transport fleet will initially be powered by fossil fuels, but the company intends to switch to electrify the haul truck fleet at the first opportunity, likely to be the first engine change-out.It hopes to increase the penetration of renewables to reach net zero scope 1 emissions well before 2038, and expects technology advancements will help it make the leap from 80 per cent to full renewables, most likely in the areas of storage.Low cost and low emissionsOz Minerals has actually been looking at the renewables options for West Musgrave for many years â we first wrote about it in 2018 â because it knew then that powering the mine with fossil fuels wasnât a viable option.It has long recognised that at such a remote location a big share of renewables was the key to helping it deliver one of the worldâs lower cost and lowest emissions copper and nickel mining projects.The fact that it will supply a low emissions supply of nickel and copper will be important for the electric vehicle markets that it intends to tap into, because EV makes also want to ensure their supply chains are low carbon too.Oz Minerals is currently seeking bids from vendors before finalising the best mix of wind, solar, battery and diesel, and will then sign a long term power purchase agreement with an option to buy the energy component outright at a later date.The mine is being built on the land of the Ngaanyatjarra people.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,renewable extensive microgrid at remote mine,,,

(AP Photo/Jens Meyer, file)BERLIN (AP) â Germany wants to massively expand the countryâs charging network for electric cars, spending 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn away from combustion cars to more climate-friendly vehicles.The countryâs transportation minister on Wednesday presented a âmaster planâ for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ cabinet earlier in the day.âWe are not just any automotive location, but a leading one in the world. And thatâs why itâs important to us that what weâre preparing succeeds well,â Volker Wissing told reporters in Berlin. âWe need a forward-looking expansion of the nationwide charging infrastructure that meets demand and is user-friendly.âThe share of electric vehicles in Germany grew 24.8% year-on-year to a total share of 14.6% of all newly registered automobiles, according to figures released by the countryâs Federal Office for Motor Vehicles.ADVERTISEMENTThere are around 70,000 charging points in the country but only 11,000 of those are fast-chargers, the ministry said.That is not enough to sufficiently fulfill the current needs, and it will be even less so as the number of electric cars grows quickly. There is also a big difference in availability of charging points between big cities and rural areas, where it is even harder to find charging stations.The German governmentâs goal is to have 1 million publicly accessible charging points in the country by 2030.In order to boost the number of charging points, the federal government will, among other initiatives provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging stations can be built. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars overnight.Electric charging is also supposed to get more user-friendly with new digital offers showing drivers where they can charge their cars on the road or being able to check online how much the different charging points demand, the minister said.Another issue the government wants to tackle is getting the countryâs electric grid ready for the increased demand as more people turn to electric cars.ADVERTISEMENTâWe are expecting an exponential increase in registered vehicles with battery electric drive in the next few years and must prepare accordingly,â the minister said.Switching Germans from combustion-engine automobiles to electric cars plays a key role in achieving the governmentâs climate targets set for the transport sector.The transformation to electric cars has also been boosted by a mix of regulatory pressure, tax breaks, improving battery range, and a wider range of vehicles to purchase.Europe in general is leading the push into battery-powered cars as electric vehicles enter the mainstream and has promised to phase out internal combustion cars by 2035.But availability of charging points is a problem not just in Germany but almost everywhere across the continent.ADVERTISEMENTâNot only is there an insufficient number of electric charging points along the road networks in most European Union countries, but the vast majority of these do not charge quickly enough,â the European Automobile Manufacturersâ Association said.Or as the German minister said: âElectric mobility will only find acceptance if charging is as easy as refueling is today.â___Follow all AP stories on climate change issues at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Germany to increase ev charging spots,,,

He has lived in southwest Florida for nearly 19 years, had experienced Hurricanes Charley in 2004 and Irma in 2017 and saw what stronger storms could do to the coast.Grande told CNN he wanted to find a new home where developers prioritized climate resiliency in a state that is increasingly vulnerable to record-breaking storm surge, catastrophic wind and historic rainfall.What he found was Babcock Ranch â only 12 miles northeast of Fort Myers, yet seemingly light years away.Babcock Ranch calls itself âAmericaâs first solar-powered town.â Its nearby solar array â made up of 700,000 individual panels â generates more electricity than the 2,000-home neighborhood uses, in a state where most electricity is generated by burning natural gas, a planet-warming fossil fuel.The streets in this meticulously planned neighborhood were designed to flood so houses donât. Native landscaping along roads helps control storm water. Power and internet lines are buried to avoid wind damage. This is all in addition to being built to Floridaâs robust building codes.Some residents, like Grande, installed more solar panels on their roofs and added battery systems as an extra layer of protection from power outages. Many drive electric vehicles, taking full advantage of solar energy in the Sunshine State.Climate resiliency was built into the fabric of the town with stronger storms in mind.So when Hurricane Ian came barreling toward southwest Florida this week, it was a true test for the community. The storm obliterated the nearby Fort Myers and Naples areas with record-breaking surge and winds over 100 mph. It knocked out power to more than 2.6 million customers in the state, including 90% of Charlotte County.But the lights stayed on in Babcock Ranch.âIt certainly exceeded our expectations of a major hurricane,â Grande, 58, told CNN.A damaged building is seen in Babcock Ranch after Hurricane Ian. Courtesy Nancy ChorpenningAn uprooted tree in Babcock Ranch after Hurricane Ian. Courtesy Nancy ChorpenningSign up for CNNâs Life, But Greener newsletter.The storm uprooted trees and tore shingles from roofs, but other than that Grande said there is no major damage. Its residents say Babcock Ranch is proof that an eco-conscious and solar-powered town can withstand the wrath of a near-Category 5 storm.âWe have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,â Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. âWe have water, electricity, internet â and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.âGrande said Hurricane Ian came through southwest Florida âlike a freight train.â But he wasnât afraid that he would lose everything in a storm, like he was when he lived in Fort Myers.âWeâre very, very blessed and fortunate to not be experiencing what theyâre experiencing now in Sanibel Island and Fort Myers Beach,â Grande said. âIn the times that weâre living in right now with climate change, the beach is not the place to live or have a business.âSolar successSyd Kitson, a former professional football player for the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, is the mastermind behind Babcock Ranch. Kitson envisioned it to be an eco-conscious and innovative neighborhood that is safe and resilient from storms like Ian.The ranch broke ground in 2015 with the construction of the solar array â which was built and is run by Florida Power and Light â and its first residents moved into the town in 2018. Since then, the array has doubled in size and thousands of people have made Babcock their home.Around 700,000 solar panels power Babcock Ranch.

The state opened Babcock Neighborhood School as an official shelter, even though it didnât have the mandated generator. The solar array kept the lights on.Some of Chorpenningâs friends who live on Sanibel Island â which is now cut off from the mainland after Ianâs devastating storm surge severed the causeway â came to shelter at a friendâs house at Babcock Ranch. It will be a while before they can go back, she said.âTheyâre going to be renting a place over here for a while, while they figure out whatâs going to happen out there,â she said. âI joked that we may be the only people in southwest Florida whose property value just increased.âEven Kitson chose to ride out the storm in Babcock to see how the community would fare in the hurricane. Kitson declined CNNâs request for an interview; Hall said he is focused on helping neighboring communities rebuild.âHe was there during the storm; he said, âwhere else would I be?ââ Hall said. âWe built it to be resilient and as much as you plan and think youâve done the right thing, you donât know until you put it to the test.âBabcock Ranch has sold more than 2,000 homes, according to the neighborhood's website. Dennis Stephenson/AlamyAs utilities scramble to restore power across the state, Babcock residents say September storms showed that Americaâs energy infrastructure is not well-equipped to handle worsening extreme weather events. Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Ricoâs power grid when it made landfall there on September 18. Now, Ian has left millions of people in the dark in Florida.Babcock residents say their neighborhood is a model for urban development in a climate change-ravaged future.âItâs not what it was 20 or 25 years ago; the storms are getting bigger and bigger, and itâs no surprise, because the warnings have all been there,â Grande said. âI think Babcock Ranchâs future has gotten even brighter.â",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,community using on solar power survives hurricane with no power outages,,,

(Karen Ducey/The Seattle Times via AP)Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at an event highlighting the Biden-Harris Administration's investments in electric school buses at Lumen Field in Seattle on Wednesday, oct. 26, 2022. (Karen Ducey/The Seattle Times via AP)WASHINGTON (AP) â Nearly 400 school districts spanning all 50 states and Washington, D.C., along with several tribes and U.S. territories, are receiving roughly $1 billion in grants to purchase about 2,500 âcleanâ school buses under a new federal program.The Biden administration is making the grants available as part of a wider effort to accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles and reduce air pollution near schools and communities.Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan announced the grant awards Wednesday in Seattle. The new, mostly electric school buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions , save money and better protect childrenâs health, they said.As many as 25 million children ride yellow buses each school day, and they will have a healthier future with a cleaner fleet, Harris said.âWe are witnessing around our country and around the world the effects of extreme climate,â she said. âWhat weâre announcing today is a step forward in our nationâs commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, to invest in our economy ... to invest in building the skills of Americaâs workforce. All with the goal of not only saving our children, but for them, saving our planet.â³ADVERTISEMENTOnly about 1% of the nationâs 480,000 school buses were electric as of last year, but the push to abandon traditional diesel buses has gained momentum in recent years. Money for the new purchases is available under the federal Clean School Bus Program, which includes $5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed last year.The clean bus program âis accelerating our nationâs transition to electric and low-emission school buses while ensuring a brighter, healthier future for our children,â Regan said.The EPA initially made $500 million available for clean buses in May but increased that to $965 million last month, responding to what officials called overwhelming demand for electric buses. An additional $1 billion is set to be awarded in the budget year that began Oct. 1.The EPA said it received about 2,000 applications requesting nearly $4 billion for more than 12,000 buses, mostly electric. Some 389 applications worth $913 million were accepted to support purchase of 2,463 buses, 95% of which will be electric, the EPA said. The remaining buses will run on compressed natural gas or propane.ADVERTISEMENTSchool districts identified as priority areas serving low-income, rural or tribal students make up 99% of the projects that were selected, the White House said. More applications are under review, and the EPA plans to select more winners to reach the full $965 million in coming weeks.Districts set to receive money range from Wrangell, Alaska, to Anniston, Alabama, and Teton County, Wyoming, to Wirt County, West Virginia. Besides the District of Columbia, big cities that won grants for clean school buses include New York, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Los Angeles.White House adviser Mitch Landrieu said he expects many buses to be delivered by the start of the next school year, with the remainder likely to be in service by the end of 2023. The billion dollars being spent this year â along with an additional $4 billon expected over the next four years â should âsuperchargeâ a domestic manufacturing boom for electric school buses, said Landrieu, a former New Orleans mayor tapped by Biden to oversee spending in the massive infrastructure law.ADVERTISEMENTâThese buses will be made in America â real jobs with real wages,â³ Landrieu said in an interview. âWe are going to ramp up manufacturing in this country.â³Environmental and public health groups hailed the announcement, which comes after years of advocacy to replace diesel-powered buses with cleaner alternatives.âIt doesnât make sense to send our kids to school on buses that create brain-harming, lung-harming, cancer-causing, climate-harming pollution,â³ said Molly Rauch, public health policy director for Moms Clean Air Force, an environmental group. âOur kids, our bus drivers and our communities deserve better.â³",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,"more clean school buses, mostly electric",,,

other news sites714,https://electrek.co/2022/10/04/renewables-global-electricity/,Renewables metof the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of ,"Renewables met all of the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of 2022, preventing any growth in coal and gas generation, according to a new report published by London-based energy think tank Ember.The rise in wind and solar generation met over 75% of the demand growth in the first half of 2022, while hydro met the remainder, preventing a possible 4% increase in fossil-fuel generation and avoiding $40 billion in fuel costs and 230 Mt CO2 in emissions.Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior analyst at Ember, said:Wind and solar are proving themselves during the energy crisis. The first step to ending the grip of expensive and polluting fossil fuels is to build enough clean power to meet the worldâs growing appetite for electricity.The report analyzes electricity data from 75 countries representing 90% of global electricity demand. It compares the first six months of 2022 to the first half of 2021 to show how the electricity transition has progressed.The report finds that global electricity demand grew by 389 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first half of 2022. Renewables â wind, solar, and hydro â increased by 416 TWh, slightly exceeding the rise in electricity demand.Wind and solar alone rose by 300 TWh, which was equal to 77% of the rise in global electricity demand. In China, the rise in wind and solar generation alone met 92% of its electricity demand rise. In the United States it was 81%, and in India it was 23%.Rise in fossil-fuel generation unchangedAs a result of the growth in renewables, fossil-fuel generation was almost unchanged (+5 TWh, +0.1%). Coal fell by 36 TWh (-1%) and gas by 1 TWh (-0.05%). This offset a slight rise in other fossil fuels (mainly oil) of 42 TWh. Consequently, global CO2 power sector emissions were unchanged in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year, despite the rise in electricity demand.Coal in the EU rose 15% only to cover a temporary shortfall in nuclear and hydro generation. Coal in India rose 10% because of a sharp rebound in electricity demand from lows early last year when the pandemic struck hardest. Globally, these rises were offset by coal-power falls of 3% in China and 7% in the United States.The growth in wind and solar prevented a 4% rise in fossil fuel electricity generation worldwide. In China, the growth in wind and solar enabled fossil fuel power to fall by 3%. Without this growth, fossil fuels would have risen by 1%. In India, fossil fuel power rose by 9%, but it would have been 12% without growth in wind and solar. In the United States, it slowed down the rise in fossil fuel power from 7% to just 1%. In the EU, fossil fuel power rose by 6%, but it would have been 16% without growth in wind and solar.Despite the halt in fossil-fuel generation in the first half of 2022, coal and gas generation increased in July and August. It leaves open the possibility that power sector emissions in 2022 may yet rise, following last yearâs all-time high.Further, a new report from San Francisco-based NGO Global Energy Monitor found that approximately 89.6 gigawatts (GW) of gas plants in development globally, totaling 5,070 million metric tons of CO2e lifetime emissions if built, are coal-to-gas conversions or replacements.These conversions are proceeding despite data showing that gas projects are increasingly uncompetitive with renewables and are just as bad, if not worse, for the environment than coal.Wiatros-Motyka said:We canât be sure if weâve reached peak coal and gas in the power sector. Global power sector emissions are still pushing all-time highs when they need to be falling very quickly. And the same fossil fuels pushing us into a climate crisis are also causing the global energy crisis.

other news sites718,https://www.eenews.net/articles/global-emissions-targets-spell-growth-for-co2-tech-sector/,Global emissions targets spell growth for COtech sector,"Companies that produce technologies to remove or reduce carbon emissions are âpoised for strong continued growth,â reaching an expected value of $1.4 trillion by 2027, according to new market research.The research report, recently released by the financial data firm PitchBook, predicts that the sector will be worth $905 billion by the end of this year. That makes the global climate tech sector relatively small â collectively worth less than electric vehicle maker Tesla.But PitchBook predicts that the emerging sector will enjoy an 8.8 percent growth rate over the next five years, âthanks to increasing global focus on aggressive emissions targets and consumer interest in emissions reduction.â That rate could also increase if there were âdramatic regulatory change or technological innovationâ during that time, the report for investors said.AdvertisementThe sector PitchBook analyzed is a broad one. It includes startups that capture or trade carbon dioxide, industrial and building firms with products that are less emissions-intensive than conventional ones, and land management companies that use or produce monitoring tools or low-emissions fertilizers.The most valuable group of companies in the space are ones working to reduce planet-warming emissions during construction and over the lifetimes of buildings. They are currently worth almost $459 billion and are expected to increase in value to $650 billion over the next five years, according to the report.That segment includes incumbents like building materials producers Holcim Group and HeidelbergCement, as well as startups like green construction firm Veev and energy efficiency company Resideo Technologies.The segment PitchBook calls âgreen industryâ is focused on decarbonizing industrial production of chemicals and raw materials. Itâs valued at more than $400 billion, according to the report. Notable firms include lithium battery recycler Redwood Materials and the mining company Lilac Solutions.PitchBook expects green industry to be the most valuable climate tech segment by 2027, with an estimated value of $657 billion. For those projections to play out, however, emissions pricing legislation like the European Unionâs carbon border adjustment mechanism âwill be critical to ensure that those providing green chemicals and materials are not at a disadvantage against foreign high-emissions products,â the report said.The value of low-carbon land management companies is expected to reach $30 billion this year, increasing to $49.5 billion in five years. The segment includes major monitoring firms like Honeywell and the alternative fertilizer company Pivot Bio.Venture capital investment in land management firms has recently slowed, the report noted. But the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August, included more than $20 billion to support climate-smart agriculture practices and $5 billion in grants for fire-resilient forests, urban tree planting and forest conservation.The smallest but fastest-growing segment of the sector is made up of carbon technology firms like the direct air capture pioneer Climeworks and the carbon trading platform Xpansiv. Theyâre now valued at around $9 billion and estimated to be worth $20.9 billion by 2027.The carbon tech sector will also get a boost from Bidenâs new climate law, the report said. The value of carbon captured in the United States has increased from $50 per ton to $85 for CO2 removed from smokestacks. For direct air capture projects, which suck CO2 from the atmosphere, the price they earn per ton of carbon has jumped 250 percent, to $180.But itâs not all smooth sailing for carbon capture and trading firms.âThe core risk facing the carbon tech space is in the potential for the value of carbon to shift dramatically due to changes in policy and regulation,â PitchBook said. âThe product of carbon tech (removing or reducing carbon) does not directly provide value â outside of some value as a feedstock for carbon utilization â and fiscal value from carbon tech activities is heavily driven by the value that legislative incentives and schemes place on carbon.âDespite that risk, investors continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential for carbon capture firms. There were 11 venture capital deals in the second quarter of 2022, raising $882.2 million for Climeworks, Carbon Clean and other firms, according to PitchBook.âThis far surpasses any prior quarter, with the total invested over the previous four quarters totaling only $432.1 million,â the research firm said in another investor report published last week.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,carbon tech companies to grow,,,

The country listed border control, oil spill detection and ship detection and tracking among the practical uses for the satellites. The UAE aims to launch the first satellite in three years, with the entire satellite program to last around six years. It did not specify the total amount it plans to invest in the constellation.The 3 billion AED ($820 million) National Space Fund, announced Monday, is the latest signal that the country is looking to the space sector to help diversify its oil-dependent economy. As of 2020, oil exports made up nearly 30% of total gross domestic product.

Both unlinked events re-emphasize the importance of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks and why regulators enforce strict policies that financial institutions need to be held accountable to while operating across the continent and globally.For the many startups whose services help keep the operations of financial institutions such as banks and fintechs in check, this period highlights their relevance more than ever. In the latest development, Youverify, a Lagos and San Franciscoâbased identity verification company helping African banks and startups automate KYC and other compliance procedures, is announcing that it has secured a $1 million seed round extension. The startup raised a $1.5 million round in 2020, bringing its total seed raise to $2.5 million.Africa-focused VCs Orange Ventures and LoftyInc Capital, the two investors who co-led its initial seed round, also led the extension. Additional investment came from Octerra Capital, Plug & Play Venture, Syntax Ventures, HTTP Investors, Afer Group and Fronesyz Capital.The proliferation of financial services in Africa is beginning to attract more scrutiny from regulators. According to reports, transactions worth $116 billion will be made through digital payment channels this year, requiring stringent measures to prevent identity theft and fraud. Therefore, the rise in focus on maintaining transparency in financial regulations and improving strategies for KYC and AML by implementing regulatory technologies has become a significant growth factor for the market. And as regtech demand globally increases, so will Africaâs, with reports saying it will reach about $1.2 billion in the next five years.Youverify came into Africaâs regtech scene when founder and CEO Gbenga Odegbami founded the company in 2018. Launched in the Nigerian market, Youverify first provided API for address and identity verification to several financial institutions. Now it has added more KYC products and expanded into new markets such as Ghana, CÃ´te dâIvoire, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda.âThe way our customers see us is that we help them automate their KYC and compliance issues,â said Odegbami on a call with TechCrunch.In addition to verifying identities beyond Nigeriaâs bank verification number (BVN) and addresses, Odegbami says Youverify layers KYC and compliance products such as transaction monitoring. He further explained that these offerings cater to issues some fintech platforms have faced recently: alleged AML issues in the case of Flutterwave in Kenya and Ping Express in the U.S. and fraud in the case of Union54âs chargebacks. In the latter, Youverify claims it couldâve prevented large-scale chargeback fraud by identifying the pattern of transactions to flag fraud, blocking the virtual cards and tying them back to fraudsters committing the multiple fake chargebacks.âThey [Union54] grew faster than they could put in place the proper transaction monitoring and fraud detection systems that will identify transactions happening from their customers,â the CEO said of the chargeback situation Union54 has dealt with over the past couple of months. âA system like ours will be able to identify previous and new patterns in such a way that we wouldâve been able to help such the company.âIt wasnât until last year that Youverify started dealing with fintechs. Initially, most of its customers were governmental bodies, big corporations like Bolt and banks. Nearly two-thirds of Nigeriaâs commercial banks, such as Standard Chartered, Standard Bank and Fidelity Bank, use the platformâs identity verification and KYC products, Youverify said.However, in a bid to serve more clients, the company launched its proprietary technology, the Youverify OS (YVOS), which provides a single platform for automating due diligence and combines risk and compliance management with its core identity verification platform to deliver these fintechs an enterprise-grade compliance solution. With its other product, vFORM, a low and no-code tool, businesses can create a custom process for onboarding new customers using a drag-and-drop builder.As a result of diversifying its clientele and demand for its KYC products, Odegbami said Youverifyâs customer base increased by 300% to serve more than 400 banks and high-growth startups. In the last 24 months, Youverifyâs application processes have grown by more than 1,000% to more than 5 million applications that have helped its clients hire talent, sell financial products, and remotely onboard ride-hailing drivers. The companyâs YouID digital identity platform added more than 500,000 users, with 600 service providers on its marketplace waitlist across the continent. Odegbami said the Lagos-based identity verification company crossed an ARR of over $1 million last year.Youverify isnât the only identity verification company in Africa. Similar providers include Smile Identity and YC-backed companies IdentityPass and Dojah. Without mincing words, Odegbami said his company is a âmarket leaderâ because it came into the market much earlier and possesses more experience, and provides more data sets than the others.Over the next 18 months, Youverify plans to grow its footprint to cover 30 countries, especially in the southern, eastern and francophone parts of Africa, where Odegbami says the company will be recruiting aggressively. It also intends to increase the number of IDs it can verify, from 400 million to 2 billion, and develop new automated compliance products for the gaming, travel, healthcare and telecommunications industries.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,identity verification company spreading n Africa,,,
techcrunch733,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/07/convective-capitals-35-million-answer-to-the-increasing-threat-of-wildfires/,Convective Capital s million answer to the increasing threat of wildfires,"Wildfires have become an ever-increasing threat as houses are built closer together and the growing impacts of climate change wreak havoc on natural landscapes. Entrepreneurs, in response, have started to develop tech meant to minimize the scale and damage of these natural disasters. Convective Capital is a new VC firm looking to back them.Bill Clerico, the former co-founder and CEO of fintech WePay, launched the firm this year and has since raised $35 million for a first fund to back early-stage startups creating tech that can help detect and contain wildfires. The fund plans to invest in roughly 15 companies by writing seven-figure checks.While some of these startups could fall under the umbrella of climate tech, Clerico said focusing on wildfire solutions fits more into the climate resilience category. He thinks the distinction makes it a more straightforward investment opportunity because increasing wildfires are already a problem today as opposed to climate tech meant to prevent or minimize future problems.The thesis turned out to be a polarizing one to pitch as some investors understood the need immediately while others thought focusing on wildfire could prove to be too niche.âIt made fundraising easier in that there were people who had witnessed the economic opportunity first hand, and understood the impacts of fire there,â Clerico said. âOr they had experienced it personally in various waysâ¦or folks didnât.âClerico left WePay after a decade to pursue angel investing and become a volunteer fire fighter. While spending time at his home in Mendocino, California, he saw the impacts of the growing wildfire crisis as one of the natural disasters closed down the road to his house and he found himself struggling to get home insurance.âJust watching wildfires become the really big crisis that it is, and having a real vested interest in the outdoors, led me down this path,â Clerico said. âI started thinking about how technology could be a solution.âClerico had made about 50 angel investments and admitted he was bored at the thought of hearing another fintech pitch. He started backing fire tech companies and began to specialize in the category. He decided to raise a fund so he could invest in the sector at scale.He estimated that there are currently 200 startups focused on this area, claiming that Convective Capital has probably talked to all of them. These startups are tackling different areas of the wildfire crisis ranging from Pano, a startup that uses camera systems and AI to help emergency response teams detect fires earlier, to Rain Industries, a company that creates autonomous drones to help put out fires.âWhat was missing though is that community coming together and acknowledging that fire tech is thing,â Clerico said. âIt doesnât exist as a category like fintech exists. Part of what we want to do as a firm is bring awareness to that category and really just help these founders get to know each other.âMaxwell Brodie, the co-founder and CEO of Rain Industries, told TechCrunch that while most likely everyone in California has been impacted by wildfires, itâs nice to see that someone like Clerico is actually trying to do something about it. He hopes that his involvement can help draw more builders and investors into the category.âAll larger pools of resources [and capital] seek out where new emerging growth is going to come from,â Brodie said. âWhat [Clerico] is doing with Convective Capital is proving that there is a new emerging area of growth and everyone should be paying attention to that, especially late-stage investors.âWhile Clerico doesnât believe that any sectors can really be recession proof, he thinks firetech is an area that isnât really tied to broader market conditions. And while many of the companies he backs arenât preventing the wildfires from starting, he hopes they can help mitigate some of the damage.âTo leverage the power of startups to have a positive impact is a really inspiring challenge,â he said. âAnd one of the reasons why myself and my partners have gone after this.â",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,fire detecting AI|fire extinguishing drones,,,,
techcrunch741,https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/29/badass-millennial-women-are-supercharging-startup-investments/,Badass millennial women are supercharging startup investments,"Across the political, social and economic stage, womenâs issues are finally receiving heightened attention and priority.There are more women than ever seeking political office; funding for female-founded startups is reaching record levels (even if they still have a long way to go to reach gender parity); a sizable cohort of female-founded and led companies have achieved billion-dollar unicorn valuations; and several women-led companies, including PagerDuty, The RealReal, and Eventbrite, have entered the public markets with successful IPOs.Whatâs driving so much positive change?Clearly, broadened awareness of gender and power issues, largely due to #MeToo, as well as an increase in the number of female investors, thanks to groups like All Raise, are all contributing catalysts. In addition, women now outnumber men in college, a majority of American moms are in the workforce, and in 40 percent of households those women are the breadwinners. But itâs more than that; I believe that thereâs a profound generational shift afloat, and that this first wave of female-led unicorns is just the tip of the NASDAQ iceberg.Unlike previous generations who may have either looked at self-investment as self-indulgence or who simply didnât have the resources or technology available to make supplementary investments in themselves, todayâs badass millennial women are unapologetic about their desire to invest in their own success and well-being. Determined to succeed without compromising their values or physical and mental wellness, these uber-empowered millennial women are making viable a new generation of startups to help them realize their dreams and feel comfortable in their skin. I refer to this economic wave as She-conomy 2.0.For decades now there have been tech companies, which I refer to as She-conomy 1.0 , catering to traditional and homogeneous identities of women primarily as shoppers and caregivers. In contrast, these new modern She-conomy 2.0 brands address latent, historically unmet, often un-discussed and under-served needs that speak to the multitude of other facets of our identities.These companies have less to do with what women buy and more to do with their willingness to invest in themselves â in their careers and in their physical and emotional health and well-being. They are seeking and are willing to pay for products and services that help them advance their careers, feel comfortable about their bodies, and provide the physical and emotional support theyâre seeking.Women are taking control of their careers and supporting each other.More than two decades ago, when I had my first child, I joined a momâs group at Stanford Hospital. We were all working moms trying to juggle career and motherhood. It was a truly challenging time for each of us. The group provided such helpful support that we met every Monday evening for five years until our kids were in kindergarten. Why Mondays? Because Mondays are especially hard for working parents, marking yet another week in search of balance. We realized that meeting on Monday evenings provided us with the support we needed to make it through the work week. Perhaps even more critically, it gave us something about Mondays to look forward to.Thereâs something incredibly empowering about experiencing a major transition like a new job or new parenthood as part of a cohort. Sheryl Sandberg famously sought to institutionalize this kind of support for working women with her non-profit Lean In. It has dramatically raised awareness around working womenâs struggles. However, individual Lean In group leaders are usually volunteers running these sessions on the side while working and shouldering lifeâs endless list of other responsibilities.Now a new generation of organizations is offering this support â for a fee. As for-profit organizations, theyâre doing so in a scalable, consistent and reliable way. Women donât have to worry about whether the organizer will be able to carve out time to orchestrate a meeting because doing so is the organizerâs job. Chief, Declare, The Assembly * , The Wing and The Riveter are all examples of companies that are growing and thriving because theyâre offering valuable space, support and services that women are willing to pay for. Most of these organizations initially targeted millennials, but women of all generations are benefiting and participating.Women are changing the narrative around previously taboo topics and promoting inclusiveness and acceptance of oneself.It wasnât long ago that mannequins, much like cover models, only came in one size. Now mainstream brands not only sell broader offerings; they increasingly showcase them in magazines, catalogs, stores and the runway. For example, Nikeâs flagship store in London featured both plus-sized mannequins and para-sport mannequins for people with physical and intellectual abilities, and Rhiannaâs new inclusive lingerie line regularly presents both plus-size and pregnant models.Millennials (like all of us) donât want to feel shamed; they want to feel empowered and beautiful. Instead of settling for frumpy, ill-fitting clothing or outdated product design, millennials are using their social media megaphones to tell the market what they want. Traditional companies like Victoriaâs Secret have moved at a molasses-like pace to evolve from treating women as objects of fantasy to celebrating their right to feel great about themselves. Their antiquated practices have created the opportunity for new startups to create brands centered on body positivity. Some companies are filling largely underserved market needs by catering exclusively to larger and specialty sizes, and others are addressing previously taboo topics like body hair, which also contribute strongly to feelings around body positivity. Eloquii offers extended clothing sizes, Ruby Ribbon * and Third Love provide a wide sizing range of under garments and bras, and Fur addresses body hair and grooming.Women are dedicating more attention to their own health and relationships.Self-help books have been around for ages, but tech is paving the way for a new generation of services to provide guidance and support that are more convenient and targeted. At the same time, women are increasingly willing to discuss health issues that were previously taboo, like menstruation, menopause and perimenopause, fertility, and depression. Advancements in technology are making health-related self-care more accessible from the convenience of our wristbands and phones. Meanwhile, people are spending a disproportionate amount of their wealth on health, making the entire healthcare industry ripe for disruption.All of these factors are making femtech big business. Countless new companies are helping women take more active control of their sexual health, including birth control and STI testing (Pill Club and Nurx), period tracking (Flo Health), fertility and egg freezing (Kind Body and Carrot Fertility), menopause (Rory, Genneve), postpartum depression and miscarriage (Maven) and even our relationships (Relish* and Bumble). In addition, no shortage of femtech companies are addressing period care, such as Lola, Cora, The Flex Company, Thinx, and Sustain Natural.These companies are only viable because so many women â beginning with millennials but expanding out to the rest of us â are now willing and able to invest in themselves. United across a shared mission of female empowerment and inclusivity, She-onomy 2.0 is making it more realistic than ever to empower us to advance our careers, feel good about ourselves and stay healthy. Hats off to the badass millennial women leading this charge; weâre all better off professionally, emotionally and even physically thanks to you!*Denotes portfolio company for Trinity Ventures",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,femtech in general,,,

Itâs making a strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in Ecarx, an auto tech startup co-founded by Eric Li, founder of Chinaâs largest private automaker Geely, Ecarx said on Thursday.The funding will be part of the pairâs wider collaboration on automotive-grade technologies, which aims to âenable advanced safety and automated driving capabilities in the production of consumer vehicles and commercial trucks,â a plan that Luminar unveiled in May.Luminarâs sensing technology can potentially reach millions of vehicles through the Geely/Ecarx auto empire. Ecarx is building a comprehensive platform for the future of cars, focusing on the likes of auto chips and smart vehicles. Its customers include, unsurprisingly, Geely-owned brands like Lotus and Volvo.Shen Ziyu, Ecarxâs other co-founder and a former General Motors executive, told Reuters in March 2021 that the company had already supplied 2.5 million vehicles.The lidar industry in China is enjoying a boom as the countryâs electric car makers â which themselves have benefited from government support for renewable energy â woo picky consumers with advanced driving technology, in-car entertainment and other novel auto features.Luminarâs tie-up with Ecarx will be critical in helping it confront domestic lidar players, from BYD-backed RoboSense and Bosch-backed Hesai to Temasek-funded Innovusion and Livox, which sprang out of DJI.âThe collaboration will help Luminar to accelerate deployment of its industry-leading long-range lidar and software in the [Chinese] market and beyond through Ecarâs deep connection with Geely and the Geely ecosystem, comprising some of the worldâs most reputable automotive brands,â Luminar said in May.The same month, the American lidar maker said it had brought on Jackie Chen, a Harman veteran, to head its China business.Ecarxâs empire is ever expanding. On Thursday, the company announced another funding boost along with the Luminar partnership. Siengine, an automotive system on chip maker it co-founded with Arm China, has completed a Series A funding round of nearly 1 billion yuan or $15 million. Sequoia Capital China led the round, with Boschâs China venture capital arm Boyuan Capital and others participating.Earlier this month, Li and Shen bought Chinese smartphone maker Meizu, once a Xiaomi archrival, to work toward a future of âmulti-device, scenario-agnostic, and immersiveâ digital experience, which will no doubt include system integration between vehicles and handsets.In May, Ecarx announced plans to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm in a $3.8 billion deal.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,lidar,,,

techcrunch807,https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/,Sequoia backed recycling robot maker AMP Robotics gets its largest purchase order,"AMP Robotics, the manufacturer of robotic recycling systems, has received its largest purchase order from the publicly traded North American waste handling company Waste Connections.The order, for 24 machine learning-enabled robotic recycling systems, will be used on container, fiber and residue lines across numerous materials recovery facilities, the company said.The AMP technology can be used to recover plastics, cardboard, paper, cans, cartons and many other containers and packaging types reclaimed for raw material processing.The tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups â the robots can even identify the brands on packaging.So far, AMPâs robots have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.In January, before the pandemic began, AMP Robotics worked with its investor, Sidewalk Labs on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits.Working with the building and a waste hauler, Sidewalk Labs transported the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics. Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how theyâre doing in their recycling efforts.Sidewalk says that the tips were communicated through email, an online portal and signage throughout the building every two weeks over a three-month period.For residents, it was an opportunity to have a better handle on what they can and canât recycle and Sidewalk Labs is betting the information will help residents improve their habits. And for folks who donât want their trash to be monitored and sorted, they could opt out of the program.Recyclers like Waste Connections should welcome the commercialization of robots tackling industry problems. Their once-stable business has been turned on its head by trade wars and low unemployment. About two years ago, China decided it would no longer serve as the worldâs garbage dump and put strict standards in place for the kinds of raw materials it would be willing to receive from other countries. The result has been higher costs at recycling facilities, which actually are now required to sort their garbage more effectively.At the same time, low unemployment rates are putting the squeeze on labor availability at facilities where humans are basically required to hand-sort garbage into recyclable materials and trash.AMP Robotics is backed by Sequoia Capital, BV, Closed Loop Partners, Congruent Ventures and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, a spin-out from Alphabet that invests in technologies and new infrastructure projects.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,trash sorting robot,,,,

And ""when possible"" they said they will review customers' plans in hopes of avoiding those who would turn the robots into weapons, in addition to exploring technical features that could prevent such use.In addition to Boston Dynamics, five other firms signed on to the commitment: Agility Robotics, ANYbotics, Clearpath Robotics, Open Robotics and Unitree Robotics.What they're saying: Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said, in an e-mailed statement: ""We are concerned about recent increases in makeshift efforts by individuals attempting to weaponize commercially available robots... For this technology to be broadly accepted throughout society, the public needs to know they can trust it. And that means we need policy that prohibits bad actors from misusing it.""Go deeper: Here's the full text of the letter:An Open Letter to the Robotics Industry and our Communities,General Purpose Robots Should Not Be WeaponizedWe are some of the worldâs leading companies dedicated to introducing new generations of advanced mobile robotics to society. These new generations of robots are more accessible, easier to operate, more autonomous, affordable, and adaptable than previous generations, and capable of navigating into locations previously inaccessible to automated or remotely-controlled technologies. We believe that advanced mobile robots will provide great benefit to society as co-workers in industry and companions in our homes.As with any new technology offering new capabilities, the emergence of advanced mobile robots offers the possibility of misuse. Untrustworthy people could use them to invade civil rights or to threaten, harm, or intimidate others. One area of particular concern is weaponization. We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues. Weaponized applications of these newly-capable robots will also harm public trust in the technology in ways that damage the tremendous benefits they will bring to society. For these reasons, we do not support the weaponization of our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots. For those of us who have spoken on this issue in the past, and those engaging for the first time, we now feel renewed urgency in light of the increasing public concern in recent months caused by a small number of people who have visibly publicized their makeshift efforts to weaponize commercially available robots.We pledge that we will not weaponize our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots or the software we develop that enables advanced robotics and we will not support others to do so. When possible, we will carefully review our customersâ intended applications to avoid potential weaponization. We also pledge to explore the development of technological features that could mitigate or reduce these risks. To be clear, we are not taking issue with existing technologies that nations and their government agencies use to defend themselves and uphold their laws.We understand that our commitment alone is not enough to fully address these risks, and therefore we call on policymakers to work with us to promote safe use of these robots and to prohibit their misuse. We also call on every organization, developer, researcher, and user in the robotics community to make similar pledges not to build, authorize, support, or enable the attachment of weaponry to such robots. We are convinced that the benefits for humanity of these technologies strongly outweigh the risk of misuse, and we are excited about a bright future in which humans and robots work side by side to tackle some of the worldâs challenges.Signed,Boston DynamicsAgility RoboticsANYboticsClearpath RoboticsOpen RoboticsUnitree Robotics",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,robot ethics,,,
other news sites816,https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23401381/great-lakes-plastic-pollution-cleanup-tech-robots,How a fleet of robots could help solve the Great Lakes plastic pollution problem,"In the murky waters of Lake Ontario just off the Toronto harbor, a stream of trash inches toward a round, tubular-looking device floating in the water. A piece of white styrofoam bumps up against the deviceâs lip. Then, in one fluid motion, it tumbles over the edge. With tendrils of marine plants circling the waste, it looks like the styrofoam could have entered a portal to an undersea world. Instead, the device is a gateway to a less mystical â yet vital â destination: the garbage dump.âItâs basically like a floating trash can,â says Chelsea Rochman, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto, who has worked with a team at the university to capture trash in Lake Ontario with bins like these since 2019. Powered from shore, the device, called a Seabin, uses a motor to create a vortex that gently pulls in floating waste from a 160-foot radius and then stores the trash in an attached basket.Across the Great Lakes, which stretch from Duluth, Minnesota, to the border between the United States and Canada in northern New York, dozens of Seabins now work alongside stormwater filters in a cross-border project dubbed the Great Lakes Plastic Cleanup. In mid-September, they were also joined by aquatic waste-collection drones and beach-cleaning roving robots â all to remove some of the 22 million pounds of plastic that enter the lakes each year and help researchers like Rochman understand the Great Lakes waste problem.People canât remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices canâWe know that the amount of litter we have out there needs more power than the people power that we have,â Rochman explains. Though local groups have organized beach cleanups for decades, people canât remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can, nor can they pick up the tiny pieces that machines are able to capture.Standing on the shore of Lake Ontario, with Torontoâs streetcars rattling by, Rochman points out the overflowing municipal trash bin along the sidewalk â one of several sources of the trash. Municipal sewage systems, industrial spills, stormwater runoff, recreational boating and beach waste, and agricultural debris all wind up in the lakes as well. In one bin, toothbrushes, tampon applicators, dental flossers, shoe strings, eyeglasses, food scraps, and syringes are entwined in the tendrils of marine plants. Between the leaves, tiny flecks of plastic poke out.Bright colored plastic floats among leaves and other debris in one of the Great Lakes Image: Great Lakes Plastic CleanupIn the lakes, which 40 million people rely on as their primary drinking water source, this waste breaks down, turning into microscopic pieces of plastic and debris, which are then eaten by fish, sucked into surrounding water treatment plants, or pulled to shore or out into the ocean. When plastic is consumed by fish, it can release chemicals like dyes and flame retardants, irritating and potentially damaging their digestive systems. In big sport fish, like lake trout or salmon, Rochman expects to find hundreds of pieces of plastic. Microplastics have also been found in drinking water in the region, where many water treatment plants are ill-equipped to filter the tiny pieces out. (The risk of consuming microplastics for humans remains unclear, though researchers continue to investigate the potential problem.)Once captured by researchers like Rochman, each piece of trash becomes another data point. Each day during the summer, students haul out the bins to count, classify, and dispose of their contents. âThey know how many cigarette butts we collect, how many straws we collect, how many foam containers we collect,â Rochman says. Some days, the catch is more surprising â students have counted slices of deli meat, old shoes, and, once, a coconut in Seabins this summer.The Seabins capture 28 grams of waste, on average, each day. âItâs going to sound like a small number because plastic is light,â says Rochman. That weight translates to a couple hundred to 2,000 pieces of microplastic, along with multiple pieces of larger waste. This summer, Rochman expects her team to remove the amount of plastic equivalent to 7,000 plastic water bottles â and thatâs only in the 12 bins the university oversees, which make up just a fraction of the devices deployed at 45 marinas across the Great Lakes region.From the northern shores of Lake Superior in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to the harbor of Buffalo, New York, just a short drive from Niagara Falls, Seabins like the ones in the Toronto harborfront are deployed at 44 other locations, typically in operation from May to November. These bins are monitored not by researchers but by marina owners or local organizations. Partners at the participating sites weigh and dispose of the binsâ contents as they fill up and perform full waste characterizing audits five to 10 times each year. Many marinas also have catch basin baskets installed, called LittaTraps, that sit inside stormwater drains to capture waste before it enters the lake system. Between 2020 and 2021, the projectâs technology captured over 74,000 pieces of trash, a number that the team expects will increase as they continue outreach to marinas and municipalities in the region.A promotional photo of the beach-cleaning BeBot. Image: The Searial CleanersIn September, a waste collecting drone and beach-cleaning robot also joined the projectâs fleet of trash catching technology. The devices, built by French waste capture technology company The Searial Cleaners, collect waste from lakes and beaches, working both via remote control and autonomously. The roving robots are also key public engagement tools, says Claire Touvier, the companyâs chief executive. âThatâs why this robot needed to be sexy and cool and fun, and to also have a cool name â these are extremely efficient tools when it comes to raising awareness,â she says.Still, the technology remains a reactive approach. Robots can help clean up the lakes, but human choices about how much plastic to produce, consume, and throw out are at the core of the Great Lakes trash problem. Changing them will be key to any long-term solution, says Melissa De Young, policy and programs director at the Canadian nonprofit Pollution Probe, one of the projectâs main funders. âWeâre doing what we can to remove plastic from the water, but we know that the technologies alone are not going to solve the problem,â she explains. âThe data that weâre collecting is really critical because it provides, first, an understanding of the extent of the problem.âIf large macroplastics wind up in capture devices in a certain area, for example, that can indicate communities nearby may lack easy access to disposal facilities or may be uninformed on why proper waste disposal is important. Alternatively, if small plastic pieces used to build other products, called preproduction pellets, or nurdles, are more common, that can indicate that somewhere upstream, a manufacturer may be improperly disposing of its trash.The PixieDrone collects plastic.

Last year, the team consulted on a new Ontario law that requires the foam used to build floating docks for cottages and marinas to be fully enclosed so it does not break down into the water. The group has also contributed to proposed legislation to include mandates for filters on washing machines to prevent microfibers from entering the sewage system in Ontario and stronger laws regarding preproduction plastic disposal in Illinois.âWhen we go to government policymakers, when we go to industry in the region, when we go to others to say, âListen, weâve got a problem here and we need to fix it,â having that localized data, having that regional data, really aids us in those conversations in terms of capturing peopleâs attention and really motivating them to do something,â says Mark Fisher, head of the Council for the Great Lakes, a binational organization that also funds the project.âWe donât want to have to have trash traps in the water forever.âOther researchers in the region are hopeful about the new technology in the lakes, too. No initiative is going to be able to pick up 22 million pounds of plastic out of the Great Lakes every year, but a project that can motivate public and political action can have magnifying results, explains Timothy Hoellein, a biology professor at Loyola University Chicago who has worked on separate lake cleanup projects but is not involved in this one. When it comes to the Seabins, âTheir individual footprint is pretty small,â Hoellein says. âBut on a collective basis, it could really make a difference.âAs the strategy garners success in the region, its lessons have begun to reach far beyond the shores of the Great Lakes. Rochman and the team at the University of Toronto have partnered with the nonprofit environmental group Ocean Conservancy to found the International Trash Trap Network, which works with groups from Fiji to Florida to help create more trash trapping strategies. Wherever trash traps capture waste, data collection follows.Itâs all part of the goal of achieving a future where freshwater sources, like the Great Lakes, are no longer dumping zones for waste, Rochman says. âWe donât want to have to have trash traps in the water forever,â she adds.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Seabin,plastic collecting robot,,,

According to data cited by the World Economic Forum, the textile industry accounts for 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per-year â nearly as much as the auto industry. Nylon production alone is responsible for about 60 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to the companies.The multi-year agreement with European-based Aquafil expands on the two companiesâ existing relationship. Earlier this year the two companies produced the first ton of bio-nylon-6 precursor material at a pilot scale. Now, the move to a demonstration scale plant will give Genomatica the ability to move ahead with supply agreements to certain brand partners.Clothing maker Far Eastern New Century uses Genomaticaâs products in its clothes, and other partnerships are in the works, the company said.Genomatica is backed by Casdin Capital, Viking Global Investors, which continues as Genomaticaâs largest shareholder, and organism engineering partner Ginkgo Bioworks.âBio-nylon is positioned to replace a material thatâs used in millions of applications every day,â said Christophe Schilling, Genomatica CEO. âOur research shows that despite health and economic turmoil, 56% of Americans still want brands to prioritize sustainability. With this scale, Genomatica is offering our brand partners a key way to meet their sustainability objectives, differentiate themselves, and meet surging consumer demand.âAquafil is building the plant in Slovenia, where the Genomatica biological precursor material will be converted into bio-nylon-6 yarns, films and engineered plastics.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Bio-nylon,,,,

other news sites855,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/how-deere-plans-to-build-a-world-of-fully-autonomous-farming-by-2030.html,How John Deere plans to build a world of fully autonomous farming by ,"Deere's autonomous 8R is the culmination of nearly two decades of work in automation, data analytics, GPS-guidance, internet-of-things connectivity and software engineering.Can John Deere become one of the leading AI and robotics companies in the world alongside Tesla and Silicon Valley technology giants over the next decade?That notion may seem incongruous with the general perception of the 185-year-old company as a heavy-metal manufacturer of tractors, bulldozers and lawnmowers painted in the signature green and yellow colors.But that is what the company sees in its future, according to Jorge Heraud, vice president of automation and autonomy for Moline, Illinois-based Deere, a glimpse of which was showcased at last January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Deere unveiled its fully autonomous 8R farm tractor, driven by artificial intelligence rather than a farmer behind the wheel.The autonomous 8R is the culmination of Deere's nearly two decades of strategic planning and investment in automation, data analytics, GPS guidance, internet-of-things connectivity and software engineering. While a good deal of that R&D has been homegrown, the company also has been on a spree of acquisitions and partnerships with agtech startups, harvesting know-how as well as talent.""This comes from our realization that technology is going to drive value creation and increase productivity, profitability and sustainability for farmers,"" Heraud said.While Deere made a big splash at CES and intrigued the investment community, Stephen Volkmann, equity research analyst at Jefferies, said, ""We are very, very, very early in this process.""""The total global fleet of autonomous Deere tractors is less than 50 today,"" he added. And even though Deere's goal is to have a fully autonomous farming system for row crops in place by 2030, Volkmann said, ""in Wall Street time, that's an eternity.""For the time being, Deere is creating value and profits with well-established automated systems that can be retrofitted to its existing tractors, such as GPS-based self-steering and precision seeding that measures how deep and far apart to plant. Those steps have to be in place, Volkmann said, before you can put full autonomy around them.The autonomous 8R represents a giant leap in current agtech, not to mention the marketing benefit. ""Prior to its introduction at CES, everybody thought [full autonomy] was pie in the sky,"" said Scott Shearer, chair of the department of food, agricultural and biological engineering at Ohio State University.Around the world, Shearer said, there are probably 30 different autonomous tractor projects in the works, though none are commercially available. ""But when Deere, with 60% of the tractor market share in North America, comes out with one, that's when reality sets in,"" Shearer said.That reality reflects Deere's autonomy strategy. ""The AI we use involves computer vision and machine learning,"" Heraud said, science that was well underway at Silicon Valley startup Blue River Technology, which Deere bought in 2017 for $305 million â a deal that also brought on Blue River co-founder and CEO Heraud. Blue River's ""see and spray"" robotics platform utilizes dozens of sophisticated cameras and processors to distinguish weeds from crop plants when applying herbicides.Attached to the autonomous tractor are six pairs of stereo cameras that can ""see"" an obstacle in the field â whether it's a rock, a log or a person â and determine its size and relative distance. Images captured by the cameras are passed through a deep neural network that classifies each pixel in approximately 100 milliseconds and decides whether the tractor should keep moving or stop.""We've curated hundreds of thousands of images from different farm locations and under various weather and lighting conditions,"" Heraud said, ""so that with machine learning, the tractor can understand what it's seeing and react accordingly. This capability also allows the farmer, instead of being in the tractor, to operate it remotely while doing something else.""Heraud was referring to autonomous driving, another piece of Deere's agtech puzzle that came together when it purchased Bear Flag Robotics last year for $250 million. Also a Silicon Valley startup, launched in 2017, Bear Flag's autonomous navigation system can be retrofitted onto existing tractors. In the case of Deere's 8R model, a tractor which first went on the market in 2020, the latest version with autonomous capabilities uses technology from Blue River.Since the CES rollout, Deere has acquired AI assets from two other agtech pioneers. In April, Deere formed a joint venture with GUSS Automation, which has devised semi-autonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers. Using AI and IoT, multiple GUSS (Global Unmanned Spray System) sprayers can be remotely controlled by a single operator, running up to eight sprayers simultaneously from a laptop. GUSS can detect trees and determine how much to spray on each one, regardless of height or canopy size.A month later, Deere announced the acquisition of numerous patents and other intellectual property from AI startup Light, according to The Robot Report. Light's depth-perception platform improves upon existing stereo-vision systems by using additional cameras, mimicking the structure of a human eye to enable more accurate 3D vision. Deere plans to integrate Light's platform into future versions of its autonomous farm equipment.To keep a close eye on other agtech R&D, Deere has established a Startup Collaborator program to test innovative technologies with customers and dealers without a more formal business relationship. ""The hope is that they find the diamonds before they become obvious to [competitors] and keep them in the fold,"" Volkmann said. Among the current crop are Four Growers, a Pittsburgh-based startup providing robotic harvesting and analytics for high-value crops, starting with greenhouse tomatoes, and Philadelphia-based Burro, which is producing small, autonomous robots that can assist farm workers with various conveyance tasks.Not surprisingly, Deere's biggest competitors have been developing automation and autonomy for its farm machinery, too. AGCO, whose brands include Massey Ferguson and Fendt, ""has been automating farming operations since the mid-1990s,"" said Seth Crawford, senior vice president and general manager of the Duluth, Georgia-based company's precision agriculture and digital division. ""We're at a stage we call supervised autonomy, where we still have someone in the cab of the machine,"" he said. ""The buzz is around fully autonomous operations, but where farmers are willing to pay for automation is feature by feature.""Whereas Deere is focused on adding full autonomy to its own farm equipment, AGCO is eying the wider retrofit market, Crawford said. ""In summer 2023, we'll have a performance-enhancing retrofit kit available for multiple brands of machines,"" he said. ""Where others say we bring you autonomy with a half-million-dollar tractor,"" he said, alluding to the price tag of Deere's 8R, ""we have kits that allow you to do that with your existing fleet. We see a huge opportunity with the installed base, where farmers want to adopt technology to enhance their outcomes, and yet don't want to flip their entire fleet and make that massive investment.""In 2016, Case IH, a subsidiary of CNH Industrial, headquartered in London, rolled up to the Farm Progress Show with what it called the Autonomous Concept Vehicle. The sleek prototype tractor, minus a driver's cab, hinted at the view of autonomy at the time. Fast forward six years, to September's Farm Progress Show, where Case IH unveiled its Trident 5550 autonomous applicator.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Autonmous tractor,,,,

It has the capacity to produce over 2 million pounds of leafy greens annually.The facility got its start in 2018 when Crop One, an indoor vertical farming company, and Emirates Flight, the airline Emirates catering arm, signed a $40 million joint venture to build Emirates Crop One. AgFunder reported the $40 million was a majority debt funded.Dubbed ECO 1, the farm uses 95% less water than field-grown produce and is guaranteed an output of three tons per day, according to the companies. Passengers on Emirates and other airlines will be able to eat the leafy greens, which include lettuces, arugula, mixed salad greens and spinach on their flights starting this month.Those local to the United Arab Emirates will be able to buy the produce at stores under the Bustanica brand. The greens require no pre-washing and are grown without pesticides, herbicides or chemicals.âWe are proud to bring Crop Oneâs best-in-class technology to this innovative food production facility alongside our joint venture partner,â said Craig Ratajczyk, CEO at Crop One., in a written statement.â ECO 1 will address growing supply chain challenges and food security issues, while introducing millions of new consumers to the benefits of vertically farmed produce. Itâs our mission to cultivate a sustainable future to meet global demand for fresh, local food, and this new farm is the manifestation of that commitment. This new facility serves as a model for whatâs possible around the globe.âThis is Crop Oneâs second vertical farm after its flagship facility in Millis, Massachusetts.Emirates Crop One joins vertical farms being built all over the world.

Now that it's seeing more widespread adoption, do you agree with those claims? According to a new study, many people feel 5G connectivity is overhyped and have failed to notice any speed or reliability improvements since upgrading.Research from UK-based price comparison service and switching website Uswitch found that one in six 5G users feel the technology doesn't live up to its promise. Less than half said they notice faster speeds or more stable connections since jumping to the fifth-generation cellular network.One of the problems with 5G has long been its coverage in rural areas. That's an issue everywhere mobile networks are found, including the UK, where 17% of those who live outside of urban areas say they've never been able to connect to a 5G signalâthree times more than those in cities.Some mobile users in the countryside can't even get reliable connections to older networks. Only 48% of people in the county of Yorkshire said they could access 4G reliably, and 14% said they often had to revert to 2G.5G advocates have talked about its lower latency and higher speeds enabling more applications for consumers, including the use of mobile virtual and augmented reality. Many point to the metaverse as one of the biggest areas that will benefit from 5G connectivity. But most people remain apathetic towards the concept, and a recent report predicting most business projects in this virtual realm will close by 2025 hasn't helped increase enthusiasm.While it might not be living up to the hype for some users, 5G still has the distinction of being the fastest-growing mobile communications technology ever. Ericsson said coverage reached roughly 25% at the end of 2021, hitting the milestone about 18 months faster than 4G. 5G is also expected to have around one billion users by the end of the year.Part of the reason why people feel somewhat disappointed in 5G is that we're yet to see its full potential; the technology is still in its relative infancy. As 5G expandsâit's expected to be the dominant network with 4.4 billion users by 2027âso will the number of applications that take advantage of it.

The companyâs key innovation was the development of a water-based plasma propulsion system for low-cost transportation in space. Thatâs what powers the companyâs Vigoride orbital shuttle.Meanwhile, Relativity Space is barreling ahead with its own technology development.With the goal of building a rocket that goes from raw materials to launch-ready in less than 60 days with a payload capacity of up to 1250 kilograms, the company is planning its first test launch in 2020 with a commercial payload ready for 2021.So far the company has performed 200 engine tests to date across 14 different serial numbers and begun conducting turbo pump testing as well. Testing has also begun on the companyâs initial avionics hardware, according to company co-founder Tim Ellis.Relativity has also started printing and stress testing some second stage structures and is beginning to print its larger primary stage structures now.âWith Momentusâ innovations in sustainable in-space âlast mileâ solutions, we look forward to working together to expand Terran 1âs flexibility and offering beyond LEO, offering small and medium satellite launch opportunities with industry-defining lead time, flexibility, and cost,â Ellis said in a statement. âThis partnership will enable us to build the space economy faster, and accelerate the future of humanity in space.âThe company has dramatically expanded its production, testing and launch facilities to include 280,000 square feet of operations on facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida and the NASA Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.Relativity also has customer agreements with Telesat, to support their low Earth orbit constellation; the Thai satellite and space technology company, mu Space; and Spaceflight Industries to launch their smallsat ride-shares.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3d printed rocket,,,,

While they can buy offsetting credits, the market remains pretty âwild-westâ, and has multiple competing standards running in parallel. For instance, the price range of $5 to $500 per ton is clearly all over the place, and sometimes carbon offset resellers make buyers pay high prices for low-quality carbon credits, pulling in extra revenues from a very opaque market.The startupâs offering is for corporates to integrate both carbon removal and avoidance credits in one package. It does this by mining the offsetting market for lots of data points, enabling carbon offset sellers to reach buyers without having to use these middle-men resellers.The startup claims that sellers no longer waste time and money on bespoke contracts with corporates but instead use Ceezerâs legal framework for all transactions. Simultaneously, buyers can access credits at a primary market level, maximizing the effect of the dollars they spend on carbon offsets.Ceezer says it now has more than 50 corporate customers and has 200,000 tons of carbon credits to sell across a variety of categories, and will use the funds to expand its impact and sourcing team, the idea being to make carbon removal technologies more accessible to corporate buyers, plus widen the product offering for credit sellers and buyers.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,B2B marketplace for carbon credits,,,

As startups look for ways to adapt the global food system to the chaos of today, we reached out to seven agtech investors to get a better understanding of how the climate crisis has informed their strategies to date.âClimate challenges are not new to anybody operating in the broader food and agriculture space, so our approach is to invest in solutions that can help mitigate and adapt to climate change,â Yield Lab partner Camila Petignat told TechCrunch.Themes the firm looks at âinclude soil and water conservation, improved use of crop inputs, the shift from chemical to biological crop protection solutions and reduction of food waste,â Petignat said.âWe could argue,â Petignat added, âthat the increased awareness of carbon markets in recent years has triggered new opportunities at the intersection of agtech and fintech, a space that we are interested in.ââIndia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change,â Omnivore managing partner Jinesh Shah told TechCrunch. âAgriculture represents 20% of Indiaâs GHG emissions, but the sector is also incredibly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which may begin to threaten Indian food security in the coming decade.â he said. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, per the EPA.Shah added that the firmâs strategy is to âinvest in startups that align with one or more of our four key pillars â increasing smallholder profitability, enhancing smallholder resilience, improving agricultural sustainability and catalyzing climate action.â The investor went on to state that agtech in India must âevolve beyond digital technologies (farmer platforms and B2B marketplaces), and we look to agrifood life sciences for long-term solutions to climate change.âRead the full survey to learn where investors are looking to invest, whatâs on their minds right now, the best way to pitch and contact them, and understand which emerging technologies have captured their attention.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,agtech and climate change,,,

Stoves in California homes are leaking the cancer-causing gas benzene, researchers found in a new study published on Thursday, Oct. 20, though they say more research is needed to understand how many homes have leaks. (PSE Healthy Energy via AP)Gas stoves in California homes are leaking cancer-causing benzene, researchers found in a new study published on Thursday, though they say more research is needed to understand how many homes have leaks.In the study, published in Environmental Science and Technology on Thursday, researchers also estimated that over 4 tons of benzene per year are being leaked into the atmosphere from outdoor pipes that deliver the gas to buildings around California â the equivalent to the benzene emissions from nearly 60,000 vehicles. And those emissions are unaccounted for by the state.The researchers collected samples of gas from 159 homes in different regions of California and measured to see what types of gases were being emitted into homes when stoves were off. They found that all of the samples they tested had hazardous air pollutants, like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), all of which can have adverse health effects in humans with chronic exposure or acute exposure in larger amounts.ADVERTISEMENTOf most concern to the researchers was benzene, a known carcinogen that can lead to leukemia and other cancers and blood disorders, according to the National Cancer Institute .The finding could have major implications for indoor and outdoor air quality in California, which has the second highest level of residential natural gas use in the United States.âWhat our science shows is that people in California are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of benzene from the gas that is piped into their homes,â said Drew Michanowicz, a study co-author and senior scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, an energy research and policy institute. âWe hope that policymakers will consider this data when they are making policy to ensure current and future policies are health-protective in light of this new research.âHomes in the Greater Los Angeles, the North San Fernando Valley, and the San Clarita Valley areas had the highest benzene in gas levels. Leaks from stoves in these regions could emit enough benzene to significantly exceed the limit determined to be safe by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessment.This finding in particular didnât surprise residents and health care workers in the region who spoke to The Associated Press about the study. Thatâs because many of them experienced the largest-known natural gas leak in the nation in Aliso Canyon in 2015.ADVERTISEMENTBack then, 100,000 tons of methane and other gases, including benzene , leaked from a failed well operated by Southern California Gas Co. It took nearly four months to get the leak under control and resulted in headaches, nausea and nose bleeds.Dr. Jeffrey Nordella was a physician at an urgent care in the region during this time and remembers being puzzled by the variety of symptoms patients were experiencing. âI didnât have much to offer them,â except to help them try to detox from the exposures, he said.That was an acute exposure of a large amount of benzene, which is different from chronic exposure to smaller amounts, but âremember what the World Health Organization said : thereâs no safe level of benzene,â he said.ADVERTISEMENTKyoko Hibino was one of the residents exposed to toxic air pollution as a result of the Aliso Canyon gas leak. After the leak, she started having a persistent cough and nosebleeds and eventually was diagnosed with breast cancer, which has also been linked to benzene exposure . Her cats also started having nosebleeds and one recently passed away from leukemia.âIâd say letâs take this study really seriously and understand how bad (benzene exposure) is,â she said.___Follow Drew Costley on Twitter: @drewcostley .___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Instituteâs Department of Science Education.

other news sites771,https://elifesciences.org/articles/80315,Transient cell in cell formation underlies tumor relapse and resistance to immunotherapy,"We then set out to understand what signaling cascade governs cell-in-cell structures. Initially, we sought to test if the observed results were cell fusion. Thus, we incubated tumor cells whose cytosols were labeled with either Wasabi or tdTomato with tumor-reactive T cells. Confocal analysis indicated that each cell type in the cell-in-cell formation maintained its cytoplasm, and no mix between colors was detected (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Furthermore, long-term follow-up of cell dissemination from this structure indicated that each cell maintains its initial single labelling color (Figure 6âvideo 1 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). To corroborate this, we also incubated tumor cells whose membrane, nucleus, and F-actin were labeled with different fluorophores. Similarly, each cell in this formation was separated and maintained the integrity of its original cell components (Figure 6A). Given the similarity of this formation to entosis, we used ROCK inhibitor, which is the key regulator of this process. Indeed, blocking ROCK almost completely prevented T cell-mediated cell-in-cell formation (Figure 6B, C). We then tested whether the molecular machinery reported to mediate tumor spontaneous entosis applies to govern the current cell-in-cell structure. However, we observed no increase or changes in the cellular localization of phosphorylated Î² catenin, E-cadherin, and phosphorylated integrin Î²1 (26) (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1) suggesting other mediators promote this entosis. Furthermore, there was no reduction in cell-in-cell formation upon blocking of E- and N- cadherins, or inhibition of Wnt signaling (Figure 6DâE). In sharp contrast, disruption of actin filaments, blocking of mRNA synthesis or protein production completely abrogated tumor cellsâ capacity to form a cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that the structure requires de novo synthesis of genes (Figure 6DâE).Figure 6 with 2 supplements with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset STAT3 and EGR1 signaling govern T cell-mediated cell-in-cell tumor formation.

Over 400 genes were increased in cell-in-cell formation induced by T cell secreted granules compared to untreated B16F10 cells, 215 of which were also upregulated by the tumor cells sorted from treated animals (Figure 6F, ). KEGG analysis further indicated that multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT3 axis and FGF-receptors downstream pathways, are enriched in cell-in-cell formation generated in vivo, with approximately 80 significantly elevated genes relating to these pathways (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1, ). Indeed, EGR1 and STAT3 expression was significantly elevated in cell-in-cell tumors (Figure 6G). Both mice and human tumors incubated with reactive T cells had elevated their p-STAT3 levels, in comparison to untreated tumor cells (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1), suggesting this mechanism is conserved across species. Since these results may also reflect adaptation to the tumor microenvironments, we next corroborate the necessity of these factors to cell-in-cell formation ex vivo. Overexpression of either STAT3 or EGR1 was sufficient to induce cell-in-cell formation without additional stimulation (Figure 6H). Furthermore, these cells were significantly more resistant to killing by CD8+ T cell, compared to sham transfected cells (Figure 6I). We also tested if inhibiting these genes would reduce cell-in-cell tumor formation. Inhibition of STAT3 and EGR1, but not MAPK3 and EGR2, significantly abrogated the capacity of tumor cells to form cell-in-cell structures upon incubation with IFNÎ³-stimulated T cells and with T cell secreted granules (Figure 6J and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). In order to integrate cell-in-cell inhibition to an in vivo therapy, we first tested the effect of small molecule inhibitors on tumor cell formation. We found that inhibition of STAT3, or EGR pathway, completely prevented cell-in-cell formation upon incubation with reactive T cells or T cell-secreted granules (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Since blocking EGR1 also reduced T cell viability, we then set out to establish a treatment protocol that combines STAT3 inhibition (which also inhibits T cell activity) and immunotherapy. To this end, mice bearing palpable tumors were injected with Stattic or with PBS for two consecutive days. On the second day, we sub-lethally irradiated the mice and injected them with 5 Ã 106 gp100-reactive T cells and IL-2. In another model, we treated mice for two days with Stattic, followed by treatments with anti-CD40, TNFÎ±, and anti-TRP1. Recurrent tumors were treated with the same regimen. In both models, injection of Stattic alone had no effect on tumor growth. We found, however, that injection of Stattic prior to administration of immunotherapy partially restored the responsiveness of tumors that re-occur following immunotherapies (Figure 6KâL). While tumor cell sensitization may be a result from multiple mechanisms, these results stress the benefit of combining immunotherapy with STAT3 inhibition.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,discovery of tumor resistance mechanism to immunotherapy,,,

The researchers found no associations with uterine cancer for other hair products that the women reported using, including hair dyes, bleach, highlights, or perms.The study data includes 33,497 U.S. women ages 35-74 participating in the Sister Study, a study led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, that seeks to identify risk factors for breast cancer and other health conditions. The women were followed for almost 11 years and during that time 378 uterine cancer cases were diagnosed.The researchers found that women who reported frequent use of hair straightening products, defined as more than four times in the previous year, were more than twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the products.âWe estimated that 1.64% of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70; but for frequent users, that risk goes up to 4.05%,â said Alexandra White, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the new study. âThis doubling rate is concerning. However, it is important to put this information into context - uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.âUterine cancer accounts for about 3% of all new cancer cases but is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system, with 65,950 estimated new cases in 2022. Studies show that incidence rates of uterine cancer have been rising in the United States, particularly among Black women.Approximately 60% of the participants who reported using straighteners in the previous year were self-identified Black women, according to the study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Although, the study did not find that the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer incidence was different by race, the adverse health effects may be greater for Black women due to higher prevalence of use.âBecause Black women use hair straightening or relaxer products more frequently and tend to initiate use at earlier ages than other races and ethnicities, these findings may be even more relevant for them,â said Che-Jung Chang, Ph.D., an author on the new study and a research fellow in the NIEHS Epidemiology Branch.The findings are consistent with prior studies showing straighteners can increase the risk of hormone-related cancers in women.The researchers did not collect information on brands or ingredients in the hair products the women used. However, in the paper they note that several chemicals that have been found in straighteners (such as parabens, bisphenol A, metals, and formaldehyde) could be contributing to the increased uterine cancer risk observed. Chemical exposure from hair product use, especially straighteners, could be more concerning than other personal care products due to increased absorption through the scalp which may be exacerbated by burns and lesions caused by straighteners.âTo our knowledge this is the first epidemiologic study that examined the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer,â said White. âMore research is needed to confirm these findings in different populations, to determine if hair products contribute to health disparities in uterine cancer, and to identify the specific chemicals that may be increasing the risk of cancers in women.âThis team previously found that permanent hair dye and straighteners may increase breast and ovarian cancer risk.Grant Numbers: Z01-ES044005, Z1AES103332-01About the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS): NIEHS supports research to understand the effects of the environment on human health and is part of the National Institutes of Health.

In the laboratory, the researchers proved that these substances cause tumors in mice. The finding was published in the journal Science on October 28.A human being has more bacterial cells (38 trillion) than human cells (30 trillion). However, defecation can reverse the proportion in favor of human cells. Through this act, in which a third of the microbes in the colon is expelled, the person ceases to be numerically bacterial and becomes fully human. Most of these microorganisms are harmless, or even beneficial, but some can cause illness, explains Noah Palm, lead author of the study, and it is possible that the indolimines have an effect on colorectal cancer. However, much more work will be needed to prove that they are indeed the cause.More information Scientists transplant human neurons into rats and modify their behaviorThe lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 1 in 23 in men and 1 in 25 in women, according to data from European tumor registries. The usual risk factors are age, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and a diet low in fruit and high in processed meats. Having an inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease, increases the risk as well.Palmâs team developed a new technique that allows for the simultaneous study of a hundred types of microbes and their products. The researchers detected the (previously unknown) indolimines in strains of Morganella morganii in people with inflammatory diseases. However, even though there is a larger amount of this bacterium in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer, it is also present in seemingly healthy people. Even the epithelial cells of the intestines of healthy individuals show some mutations that can be caused by toxins from these communities of microorganisms, such as indolimines, explains Palm.Morganella morganii, which measures one thousandth of a millimeter, is commonly found in water, soil and the intestines of mammals. It is usually a benign microbe, but it is also associated with urinary tract infections.Spanish biotechnologist Cayetano Pleguezuelos and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute in the Netherlands were the first to show the direct connection between the bacteria that live in the human digestive system and the genetic alterations that cause the development of cancer. The researchers saw that a specific strain of Escherichia coli produces a toxic molecule called colibactin which damages the DNA of human cells. This was confirmed in miniature versions of intestinal tissue generated in the laboratory. Their discovery was published in the journal Nature on February 27, 2020, while the human race had its attention on another microorganism: a coronavirus that was spreading around the world from China.Pleguezuelos applauds the new work, but suggests prudence. âOur intestinal microbiota is very complex, with many different species of bacteria, and among them there are mutualistic relationships, symbiosis, negative competitionâ¦ and there are many other parameters. Bacteria can produce these toxic compounds in humans but, for some reason, they may not be able to reach the epithelial cells of the intestine and damage the DNA. These factors are not seen in experiments with mice,â he warns.The Spanish researcher believes that the new Yale University technique âopens the door to evaluating a large number of bacteria and their ability to damage DNA.â A person that weighs 70 kilos has about 46 kilos of human cells, according to a study carried out by a team from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The heaviest ones are muscle and fat cells. The 38 trillion bacteria only weigh about 200 grams, but they make up an extremely complex universe. âTheir ability to carry out different enzymatic reactions is immense. And we donât know most things,â says Pleguezuelos.The Spanish biotechnologist explains that every agent that damages human DNA causes a specific pattern of mutations called a mutational signature. Pleguezuelos and his colleagues identified the mutational signature of the harmful strains of the Escherichia coli and found this characteristic trace in more than 5% of the colorectal cancer patients that were analyzed, compared to 0.1% detected in other types of tumors. Of course, that figure must be taken with a grain of salt â pending further studies in other populations â but it gives an idea of the magnitude of the problem: 5% of the two million annual cases means 100,000 colorectal cancer patients with the mutational signature of these harmful strains of Escherichia coli.Doctor Palm points out that most cases of colorectal cancer occur in people who have no family history. Therefore, environmental factors, including the microbiome, play a key role in most colorectal cancer cases. However, he explains, it is still impossible to calculate the relative importance of the microbiome against other environmental factors.Although currently there are no specific treatments to prevent DNA damage induced by the microbiome, treatments could be developed to neutralize, or even eliminate, these toxin-producing microbes.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,common gut bacterium may be cause of colorectal caner,,,

The findings, published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggest a risk of increased SARS-CoV-2 infections this winter, unless the new updated bivalent vaccines help to boost immunity in the population.âWhile antibody immunity is not completely gone, BA.2.75.2 exhibited far more dramatic resistance than variants weâve previously studied, largely driven by two mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein,â says the studyâs corresponding author Ben Murrell, assistant professor at the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet.The study shows that antibodies in random serum samples from 75 blood donors in Stockholm were approximately only one-sixth as effective at neutralizing BA.2.75.2 compared with the now-dominant variant BA.5. The serum samples were collected at three time points: In November last year before the emergence of Omicron, in April after a large wave of infections in the country, and at the end of August to early September after the BA.5 variant became dominant.Only one of the clinically available monoclonal antibody treatments that were tested, bebtelovimab, was able to potently neutralize the new variant, according to the study. Monoclonal antibodies are used as antiviral treatments for people at high risk of developing severe COVID-19.BA.2.75.2 is a mutated version of another Omicron variant, BA.2.75. Since it was first discovered earlier this fall, it has spread to several countries but so far represents only a minority of registered cases.âWe now know that this is just one of a constellation of emerging variants with similar mutations that will likely come to dominate in the near future,â Ben Murrell says, adding âwe should expect infections to increase this winter.âSome questions remain. It is unclear whether these new variants will drive an increase in hospitalization rates. Also, while current vaccines have, in general, had a protective effect against severe disease for Omicron infections, there is not yet data showing the degree to which the updated COVID vaccines provide protection from these new variants. âWe expect them to be beneficial, but we donât yet know by how much,â Ben Murrell says.The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers at ETH ZÃ¼rich in Switzerland and Imperial College London in the U.K.Funding was provided by SciLifeLab, the Erling-Persson Foundation, the European Unionâs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

Starting today, the platform will let doctors and nurses apply for verified provider labels and showcase their videos on special healthcare carousels in search results.The announcement was made on Thursday by YouTubeâs global head of health Dr. Garth Graham, who pointed out in a blog post that this is the first time the platform will extend its health product features to individual healthcare providers. Previously, the features were available to organizations like universities and government agencies. YouTube has historically struggled to rein in medical misinformation, most recently during the pandemic, and has been criticized for dragging its feet on implementing fixes for the problem.AdvertisementAt the moment, only individuals in the U.S. and Germany will be able to apply to be YouTube Health Sources, although YouTube stated that the company hopes to be able to open up the process to more countries and regions in the future.âThis is a big step towards helping people more easily find and connect with content that comes from the extraordinary community of healthcare creators on YouTubeâthe smart, dedicated and creative folks who are transforming the ways that we share medical information,â Graham said in a YouTube blog post.The companyâs global head of health pointed to channels helmed by licensed individuals that provide helpful health content on the platform, such as Doctor Mike, a family doctor who debunks medical myths, and Doctor Ali, a psychologist who makes easily accessible videos on mental health.AdvertisementWhat will qualify someone to be a YouTube Health Source? According to the platformâs support page, the application process is open to licensed doctors, nurses, registered nurses, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, and licensed clinical social workers. All applicants must be licensed, YouTube notes, adding that third-party partner LegitScript will be in charge of coordinating license verification by working with licensing bodies like the Federation of State Medical Boards in the U.S.Besides obtaining license verification, YouTube states that channels must follow its monetization policies, even if itâs not monetizing content. Applicants must also have more than 2,000 valid public watch hours in the past 12 months and primarily focus on covering health information.

Improvements in health care, sanitation, diet, and education over the past century have markedly increased life expectancy, but this has not been paralleled by concomitant increases in healthy life expectancy. Increasing healthspan, which is the time spent free of major illness or disease, is therefore an important priority worldwide. The UK Government, for example, has pledged to increase the healthy life expectancy of the UK population by an extra 5 years by 2035 without increasing inequality. Achieving this goal would simultaneously improve individual quality of life, increase productivity, and boost national wealth. Notably, a gain of just one additional healthy year is predicted to be worth US$38 trillion to the USA.However, a 2021 review of national progress in the UK towards this goal revealed that policy makers have little confidence that healthy life expectancy can be markedly improved either through focusing on technological solutions (which promote independence but not health) or on diet and exercise regimes (which are often out of reach of those who would most benefit, because of socioeconomic inequalities).2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select CommitteeAgeing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. 3 LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n CBlasco MAPartridge LSerrano MKroemer G The hallmarks of aging. 4 Fraser HCKuan VJohnen Ret al.

The same reviewrevealed a general lack of awareness and scrutiny of the potential offered for improving health in later life by ameliorating the ageing process itself. This unawareness is alarming when set against the backdrop of a quiet research revolution in biogerontology that has seen the identification of some key hallmarks of ageing,evidence that these hallmarks and underlying mechanisms independently predict the emergence of age-related diseases in real patients,and positive outcomes from preclinical and early-stage human clinical trials based on targeting ageing mechanisms.Humanity stands on the threshold of being able to prevent multimorbidity and age-associated diseases by addressing the underlying biology of ageing; parallels with the era of antibiotics do not seem unduly hyperbolic.7 WHODecade of healthy ageing: baseline report. 8 Cox LSBellantuono ILord JMet al. Tackling immunosenescence to improve COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine response in older adults. Ignorance of these developments carries appalling costs, which have been, and will continue to be, borne by older people unless the situation changes. For example, the UK's 2017 Healthy Ageing Grand Challenge specifically excluded biomedical science research from its funding remit, and the extensive Decade of Healthy Ageing: baseline report,by WHO (2021), fails to mention these advances, or even the word biology, focussing instead on socioeconomic determinants of health and overcoming ageism. Given that hallmark ageing mechanisms cause the progressive failure of innate and adaptive immunity, it is a fascinating counterfactual to consider how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic would have been handled had it been preceded by a sustained international effort to target immune senescence and enhance later life immune function.The need to avoid such mistakes in the future is patent, as are the triple economic benefits (lower health and social care costs, greater economic activity of older adults, and investment into new industries) that will accompany efforts in this area.2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select CommitteeAgeing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. 9 Cox LS The economic and scientific case for therapeutic intervention in ageing. It is perhaps the perceived complexity of ageing biology that has dissuaded policy makers from directly tackling it. As a result, academic research on ageing in many parts of the globe is fragmented and siloed,and driven by funding models and professional metrics that reward specialisation and disease-specific focus. However, the biological mechanisms that cause ageing must be a central focus if integrational and intersectional approaches aimed at improving lifelong health figure ) are to be truly effective.Figure UK Research and Innovation-funded ageing networks addressing ageing processes across the life course Show full caption 8 Cox LSBellantuono ILord JMet al.

Biological mechanisms of aging predict age-related disease co-occurrence in patients. 11 networks (depicted in ovals) cover a broad but overlapping range of research topics, with intersections between socioeconomic determinants of health, diet, exercise, microbiome, extracellular matrix, and molecular and cellular mechanisms of ageing, through to cognition, immunity, frailty, therapeutics, and clinical trials. This breadth allows the networks to identify interventions appropriate for different stages of the life course, with a shift in focus from disease-preventive approaches in early life and mid-life through to more intense clinical monitoring and interventions in older adults, including development and testing of new geroprotective and gerotherapeutic medicines, such as senolytic drugs.A multiscale, multisystem, and whole of life course approach to improve healthy life expectancy can be achieved by drawing these broad research disciplines together through a core focus on hallmarks that underlie the biology of ageing and drive age-related disease.AGENTS=Ageing and Nutrient Sensing network.

It is therefore hugely exciting that the diversity and complexity of ageing across the life course has now been recognised in a national initiative by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and Medical Research Council of UK Research and Innovation (the national government-sponsored research funder). Launched in March, 2022,the UK Ageing Network comprises 11 new research networks addressing core aspects of ageing biology and health in a national macro network, drawing together ageing research across systems and scales ( figure ). These networks aim to enable knowledge exchange and research beyond the narrow focus of individual research projects and academic disciplines, drawing from the social sciences, humanities, economics, and biomedical and physical sciences, as well as bringing in expertise from industry, biotechnology, the third sector, and policy makers; membership is open and non-prescriptive, and interested individuals and organisations are encouraged to join . Importantly, the networks also include the voice of those with the lived experience of ageing, to enable relevant co-design of future research strategies, together with health practitioners and clinical trialists to ensure that promising interventions can be taken forward from the laboratory into patients. Through workshops, training programmes, grassroots events, and research pump priming, the networks will not only enable integration of expertise and cross-disciplinary working to generate new knowledge and provide solutions to ageing problems, they also aim to build ageing research capacity, enticing researchers from all career stages and disciplines in academia and beyond to embrace ageing research. Dissemination of new findings and development of new training materials for a range of audiences, including clinical practitioners and policy makers, is also key to the networksâ goals, to ensure that actionable findings from ageing research are rapidly adopted into policy and practice.Initially funded for 2 years, positive outcomes from the networks should drive investment to sustain and grow them, with expansion to include colleagues from around the world. We therefore welcome input, suggestions, and support from all who wish to contribute to improve health across the life course and work towards the goal of substantially extending healthy life expectancy.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,it is important to extend healthy life expectancy,,,
other news sites798,https://newatlas.com/medical/cancer-metastasis-breakthrough-rethink/,Cambridge cancer breakthrough may prompt rethink of metastasis,"Cancerâs ability to spread through the body is one of its most devastating tricks. Scientists at Cambridge have now identified a protein that plays a key role in metastasis, which not only hints at a new potential treatment but reveals for the first time that this process isnât unique to cancer.No matter where in the body it originates, cancer can eventually begin to colonize other organs and tissues through a process known as metastasis, which makes it much harder to treat. Unfortunately, thereâs still much about metastasis that scientists donât understand, but ongoing research is continually uncovering mechanisms that could lead to new therapy options.In the new study, Cambridge scientists discovered not just a new mechanism for metastasis, but completely recontextualized its role. Itâs long been thought that metastasis was an abnormal process that arises in cancer, but the new study found that itâs a process used by healthy cells as well â cancer just hijacks it for its own purposes.The team made the discovery while investigating a cellular structure known as sodium leak channel, non-selective (NALCN). These channels are located on cell membranes and control how salt goes in and out of the cell. In the new study, the researchers found that NALCN also regulates the release of cells from tissues into the bloodstream, where they can be taken up by other organs and tissues.In tests in mice, the scientists blocked the function of the NALCN protein, and found that it triggered metastasis in stomach, intestinal and pancreatic cancers. That suggests this could be a new target for preventing metastasis, potentially improving outcomes for patients with cancer.But the most surprising discovery came when the team tested the technique in mice without cancer. Blocking NALCN also caused healthy cells to migrate away from their original organs to other ones â pancreatic cells, for instance, moved to the kidney and became healthy kidney cells instead.âThese findings are among the most important to have come out of my lab for three decades,â said Professor Richard Gilbertson, Group Leader of the study. âNot only have we identified one of the elusive drivers of metastasis, but we have also turned a commonly held understanding of this on its head, showing how cancer hijacks processes in healthy cells for its own gains. If validated through further research, this could have far-reaching implications for how we prevent cancer from spreading and allow us to manipulate this process to repair damaged organs.âThe team now plans to investigate ways to take advantage of this discovery to prevent metastasis, including repurposing existing drugs.The research was published in the journal Nature Genetics.Source: University of Cambridge",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,metastasis is a natural process of a healthy body,,,

After peaking in 2014 at 10 percent, the trend has been decreasing, especially since China stopped accepting the West's plastic waste in 2018.Virgin production â of non-recycled plastic, that is â meanwhile is rapidly rising as the petrochemical industry expands, lowering costs.""Industry groups and big corporations have been pushing for recycling as a solution,"" Greenpeace USA campaigner Lisa Ramsden told AFP.""By doing that, they have shirked all responsibility"" for ensuring that recycling actually works, she added. She named Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestle as prime offenders.According to Greenpeace USA's survey, only two types of plastic are widely accepted at the nation's 375 material recovery facilities.The first is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used in water and soda bottles; and the second is high density polyethylene (HDPE), seen in milk jugs, shampoo bottles and cleaning product containers. These are numbered ""1"" and ""2"" according to a standardized system in which there are seven plastic types.But being recyclable in theory doesn't mean products are being recycled in practice.The report found that PET and HDPE products had actual reprocessing rates of 20.9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively â both down slightly from Greenpeace USA's last survey in 2020.Plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" â including children's toys, plastic bags, produce wrappings, yogurt and margarine tubs, coffee cups and to-go food containers â were reprocessed at rates of less than five percent.Despite often carrying the recycling symbol on their labels, products that use plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" fail to meet the Federal Trade Commission classification of recyclable.This is because recycling facilities for these types aren't available to a ""substantial majority"" of the population, defined as 60 percent, and because the collected products are not being used in the manufacturing or assembly of new items.According to the report, there were five main reasons why plastic recycling is a ""failed concept.""First, plastic waste is generated in vast quantities and is extremely difficult to collect â as becomes clear during what the report called ineffective ""volunteer cleanup stunts"" funded by nonprofits such as ""Keep America Beautiful.""Second, even if it were all collected, mixed plastic waste cannot be recycled together, and it would be ""functionally impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of consumer plastic waste produced each year,"" the report said.Third, the recycling process itself is environmentally harmful, exposing workers to toxic chemicals and itself generating microplastics.Fourth, recycled plastic carries toxicity risks through contamination with other plastic types in collection bins, preventing it from becoming food-grade material again.Fifth and finally, the process of recycling is prohibitively expensive.""New plastic directly competes with recycled plastic, and it's far cheaper to produce and of higher quality,"" said the report.Ramsden called on corporations to support a Global Plastics Treaty, which United Nations members agreed to create in February, and move toward refill and reuse strategies.""This isn't actually a new concept â it's how the milkman used to be, it's how Coca-Cola used to get its beverages to people. They would drink their beverage, give the glass bottle back, and it would be sanitized and reused,"" she said.Some countries are leading the way, including India, which recently banned 19 single-use plastic items. Austria has set reuse targets of 25 percent by 2025 and at least 30 percent by 2030 for beverage packaging, while Portugal has also set the 30 percent by 2030 goal.

That number is expected to drop further as more plastic is produced.Greenpeace found that no plastic â not even soda bottles, one of the most prolific items thrown into recycling bins â meets the threshold to be called ""recyclable"" according to standards set by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation New Plastic Economy Initiative. Plastic must have a recycling rate of 30% to reach that standard; no plastic has ever been recycled and reused close to that rate.""More plastic is being produced, and an even smaller percentage of it is being recycled,"" says Lisa Ramsden, senior plastic campaigner for Greenpeace USA. ""The crisis just gets worse and worse, and without drastic change will continue to worsen as the industry plans to triple plastic production by 2050.""Waste management experts say the problem with plastic is that it is expensive to collect and sort. There are now thousands of different types of plastic, and none of them can be melted down together. Plastic also degrades after one or two uses. Greenpeace found the more plastic is reused the more toxic it becomes.New plastic, on the other hand, is cheap and easy to produce. The result is that plastic trash has few markets â a reality the public has not wanted to hear.Trent Carpenter, the general manager of Southern Oregon Sanitation, says when they told customers a couple years ago that they could no longer take any plastic trash other than soda bottles and jugs â like milk containers and detergent bottles â people were upset. They wanted to put their strawberry containers, bags, yogurt cups and all manner of plastic trash in their recycling bin.""We had to re-educate individuals that a great deal of that material is ending up in a landfill,"" Carpenter said. ""It's not going to a recycling facility and being recycled. It's going to a recycling facility and being landfilled someplace else because [you] can't do anything with that material.""That message has been difficult for the public to absorb with so many different bins in public spaces, and their own communities telling them to put their plastic in recycling containers.Carpenter says they wanted to be transparent with their customers and tell them the truth, unlike companies that continue to tell customers that plastic, such as bags and containers, is being turned into new things.""Politically it's easier to just say 'Gosh, we're going to take everything and we think we can get it recycled,' and then look the other way,"" Carpenter said of the other companies. ""That's greenwashing at its best.""Greenpeace found a couple facilities are trying to reprocess cups and containers â sometimes called ""number 5s"" because of the markings on the containers. But the numbers are low. While 52% of recycling facilities in the U.S. accept that kind of plastic, the report found less than 5% of it is actually repurposed â and the rest is put into a landfill.Similarly, the National Association for PET Container Resources, an industry trade group, found in 2017 that only 21 percent of the plastic bottles collected for recycling were turned into new things.The low reprocessing rates are at odds with plans from the oil and gas industry. Industry lobbyists say they plan to recycle every piece of plastic they make into something new by 2040. In interviews with NPR, industry officials were unable to explain how they planned to reach a 100 percent recycling rate.An NPR investigative report found in 2020 that industry officials misled the public about the recyclability of plastic even though their own reports showed they knew as early as the 1970s and 1980s that plastic could not be economically recycled.The American Chemistry Council, an industry lobby group, initially did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the Greenpeace report. After publication, Joshua Baca, vice president of plastics for the group, sent an email to NPR calling Greenpeace's views ""misleading, out of touch and misguided.""He said the industry believes it is ""on the cusp of a circularity revolution"" when it comes to recycling plastic by ""scaling up sortation, advanced recycling, and new partnerships that enable used plastic to be remade again and again.""Environmentalists and lawmakers in some states are now pushing for legislation that bans single use plastics, and for ""bottle bills"" which pay customers to bring back their plastic bottles. The bills have led to successful recycling rates for plastic bottles in places like Oregon and Michigan, but have faced steep resistance from plastic and oil industry lobbyists.""The real solution is to switch to systems of reuse and refill,"" Ramsden said. ""We are at a decision point on plastic pollution. It is time for corporations to turn off the plastic tap.""After years of embracing plastic recycling, many environmental groups say they hope the public will finally see plastic for what they say it is â trash â and that people will ask themselves if there is something else they could be using instead.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,recycling not working,,,
other news sites875,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy,The James Webb Space Telescope spied the earliest born stars yet seen,"Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, astronomers report in the Oct. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but itâs hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (SN: 7/11/22). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.âWhen we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called âthe sparkles,ââ says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (SN: 10/15/20).âThe outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?â Mowla says. Were they born at âcosmic noon,â 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at âcosmic dawn,â when stars were first able to form at all (SN: 3/4/22)?Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.Zooming into one part of JWSTâs image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler. Some of the dots may be globular clusters of same-age stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. L. Mowla et al/The Astrophysical Journal Letters 2022Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.âWhen we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,â says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, âthereâs only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,â he says.In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universeâs history. They could also help unravel galaxiesâ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWSTâs first year that could do just that.Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer AdÃ©laÃ¯de Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster.âItâs the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,â Claeyssens says. âJames Webb will be a game changer for this field.â",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Telescope discoveries,,,

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.CNN âThe Artemis I mega moon rocket is gearing up for another test Wednesday before its next launch attempt to journey around the moon and back.The Artemis I cryogenic demonstration test began with fueling at 7:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.Since the second scrubbed launch attempt of the uncrewed Artemis I mission on September 3, engineers have replaced two seals on an interface for the liquid hydrogen fuel line between the rocket and mobile launcher, according to NASA officials. These seals were associated with a large hydrogen leak that led to the scrub of the launch attempt.Engineers found an indentation on the seal on an 8-inch (20-centimeter) quick disconnect line for hydrogen, said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, at a Monday NASA press conference.The team did not recover any piece of debris, but the dent was clear and pointed to a problem that contributed to the hydrogen leak, Sarafin said.The indentation on the seal was under 0.01 inch (0.3 millimeter), but it allowed pressurized gas to leak through, something that can be very dangerous given the flammability of hydrogen when it meets air. The team believes the dent was associated with the leak, but the results of the test could confirm it. They have since replaced the seal.On September 3, the large hydrogen leak was between two and three times the accepted limit, Sarafin said.Testing âkinderâ proceduresThe purpose of the cryogenic demonstration is to test the seals and use updated, âkinder and gentlerâ loading procedures of the supercold propellant, which is what the rocket would experience on launch day.Unlike the wet dress rehearsals, the previous tests of Artemis I that simulated every stage leading up to launch, the cryo test focuses on a very specific aspect in the countdown: loading supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the rocketâs core stage and upper stage.The Orion spacecraft and rocket boosters remained unpowered during the test, and the team does not intend to go into terminal count, or the final 10 minutes that occur in the countdown before launch, said Jeremy Parsons, deputy manager for NASAâs Exploration Ground Systems Program at Kennedy Space Center.The kinder and gentler loading procedure is to minimize pressure spikes and thermal spikes witnessed during prior launch attempts.âItâs going to be a very slow, steady ramp,â Parsons said. âSo (weâre) really just trying to slowly introduce some of those thermal differences and reduce thermal and pressure shock.âLiquid oxygen is relatively dense, about the density of water, and it is pumped into the rocket. Meanwhile, hydrogen is very light, so it is moved using pressure rather than being pumped, said Tom Whitmeyer, deputy associate administrator for NASAâs common exploration systems development.The new loading operations will use a slower rate of pressure with more gradual temperature changes, Whitmeyer said.The call to stations for the test, when all of the teams associated with the mission arrive at their consoles and report theyâre ready, begins today at 3 p.m. ET. The mission team anticipates receiving a âgoâ to begin loading the rocket with propellant around 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday. If all goes well, the team expects the test to be completed by 3 p.m. ET that day, Parsons said.The test will also include an engine bleed, which chills the engines for launch. The mission team scrubbed the first Artemis I launch attempt on August 29 largely due to an issue with a faulty sensor that occurred during this bleed.So far, the forecast looks promising for the test. The Artemis team is receiving daily briefings about Hurricane Fiona in case it has any impact on whether or not the rocket stack needs to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that can take three days.Preparing for launchIf the cryo test goes well, the next launch attempt could take place on Tuesday, September 27, with a 70-minute window that opens at 11:37 a.m. ET. The mission managers will meet to discuss the test results on September 25 to assess the potential launch date.If Artemis I launches on September 27, it would go on a 39-day mission and return to Earth on November 5. Another backup launch date is possible on October 2. While these launch dates are recommended by NASA, the team ultimately depends on a decision by the US Space Force, which would need to issue a waiver for the launch.The US Space Force, an arm of the military, still oversees all rocket launches from the United Statesâ East Coast, including NASAâs Florida launch site, and that area is known as the Eastern Range.The officials at the range are tasked with making sure thereâs no risk to people or property with any launch attempt.The Artemis team continues to have âproductive and collaborativeâ discussions with the Eastern Range, NASA officials said, and NASA is sharing additional detailed information requested by the Space Force for review.The team is taking things one step at a time and wants to get through the test before other decisions are made, Whitmeyer said.âWeâre going to go when weâre ready,â Sarafin said. âBut in terms of the reward of flying this flight, we have said from the outset that this is the first in an increasingly complex series of missions, and it is a purposeful stress test of the rocket.âThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of NASA space exploration that intends to land diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon â on the Artemis II and Artemis III missions, slated for 2024 and 2025, respectively â and eventually deliver crewed missions to Mars.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,launch delay,,,

These bikes when they fail, they fail like a blowtorch,"" said  Dan  Flynn, the chief fire marshal at the  New  York  Fire  Department. "" We've seen incidents where people have described them as explosive   incidents where they actually have so much power, they're actually blowing walls down in between rooms and apartments."" Brooklyn: 374  East 9th  Street @ FDNY operating at a 3  Alarm  Fire in a 3 story private dwelling with extention to adjoining building pic.twitter.com/o Cs3 V I39 S Q    NYRRT (@ NYRRT)  April 21, 2022 A fire in  Brooklyn in  April was traced to a faulty e-bike or e-scooter battery that ignited and gutted two houses. And these fires are getting more frequent. As of  Friday, the  FDNY investigated 174 battery fires, putting 2022 on track to double the number of fires that occurred last year (104) and quadruple the number from 2020 (44).  So far this year, six people have died in e-bike-related fires and 93 people were injured, up from four deaths and 79 injuries last year. In early  August, a 27-year-old  Venezuelan immigrant, identified as  Rafael  Elias  Lopez- Centeno, died after his lithium ion battery caught fire and ripped through the  Bronx apartment where he was staying.  Carmen  Tiburcio, a neighbor, said  Lopez's aunt told her he had tried to escape through the front door, but the bike was in the way.  Instead, he took refuge in the bathroom, where he tried to fill up the bathtub with water to protect himself from the flames.  But the smoke got to him, she said."" He didn't make it,""  Tiburcio said. "" His lungs were very bad."" Another danger to delivery work Many, if not most, of the fires in  New  York involve e-bike batteries owned by restaurant delivery workers, who work long shifts, traveling dozens of miles a day."" The bikes tend to get beat up, subjected to the elements,""  Flynn said. "" They're not really made for our streets."" The longer the batteries are used, the more time it takes to fully recharge them, and it can take up to 8 hours.  That in turn makes it harder for owners to keep on eye on their batteries the whole time they are plugged in, which is key for safety. Enlarge this image toggle caption  FDNY  FDNY In addition, new batteries are costly, and the temptation to opt for a less-expensive refurbished battery for much less money is great   especially for couriers who make an average of $12.21 an hour after expenses, according to a survey by  Los  Deliveristas  Union, an advocacy and membership organization. Several e-bike owners interviewed by  NPR in  New  York  City said they were aware of the risks batteries posed, and took measures to reduce them."" A lot of guys have four, five, six bikes in their apartment and they swap out chargers for different bikes when it doesn't belong to that bike,"" said  Rafael  Cardanales, who lives on the  Lower  East  Side. "" You can't just use any charger, you know."" Musfiqur  Rahman said that when he first got into the delivery business, he bought two new  Arrow brand batteries   for $550 each.  He did it specifically to avoid fires."" As far as  I know, this brand never get involved in this kind of incident,"" the 27-year-old  Bangladeshi immigrant said. The  FDNY says most batteries are so destroyed by fire when they inspect them that they can make no conclusions about which brand is safer than another. The  FDNY has begun posting videos on social media warning about the dangers of recharging lithium ion batteries. Living in close quarters E-bike related fires have occurred elsewhere, such as  London,  San  Francisco,  Michigan and  South  Florida.  But nowhere does concern for them appear to be as high as in  New  York, perhaps because of the prevalence of apartment living   and also the prevalence of ordering take-out. While restaurants sometimes store bikes overnight for employees, fewer people are now working for particular restaurants and many more for themselves, using apps like  Door  Dash or  Uber  Eats to connect with customers.  And these couriers often don't have any other place to store and recharge their e-bikes except in their apartments. That, in turn, creates a fire hazard not just for the workers, but also for their neighbors.  This summer, the  New  York  City  Housing  Authority proposed banning e-bikes and batteries from its 2,600 buildings.  But the proposal created an uproar, and officials have not gone through with it. Enlarge this image toggle caption  Matthew  Schuerman/ NPR  Matthew  Schuerman/ NPR City councilmembers have proposed their own solutions.  One bill, for instance, would ban the sale of used batteries within city limits.  Another would require all batteries to be sold to be approved by a national testing service, such as  Underwriters  Laboratories.  Mayor  Eric  Adams recently announced he would direct $1 million to create hubs for delivery workers with charging stations and other amenities   though they would likely be used during the day and not provide overnight charging. Councilmember  Gale  Brewer, who sponsored the legislation that would outlaw the sale of used batteries, says she recognizes that new batteries could be prohibitively expensive to delivery workers."" They do, you know,  God's work, so to speak, because  New  Yorkers like to have food delivered,"" she said.

While this may suggest supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said module capacity expansions are slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, catering to the trend of n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing.Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW this quarter, most of which can be attributed to two facilities bringing 23 GW online.Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily due to a major provider retiring its multi-crystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in Q2 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW.Module production reached 324 GW in Q2. CEA forecasts this may expand 20% by the end of the year, reaching 400 GW.Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production, with most others operating at the cell and module link in the supply chain. âWith growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,â said CEA.The report said suppliers are working to optimize wafer sizes after the industry standardized 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The â182 mm Plusâ (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce âwhite spaceâ caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The â210 mm Reducedâ (210R) reduced wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced.Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds.Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingot, 42 GW of cell, and 50 GW of module capacity. By end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively.âPolicy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,â said CEA in the report.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,about resources,,,

What if we could apply this technology to miners in the EV industry, creating a full circle sustainable supply chain?BHPâs Jansen potash project is expected to be the largest of its kind, with initial capacity forecasts of 4.3 to 4.5 Mtpa.Potash is often found in fertilizer and is a rich source of potassium, a mineral essential for our health. Since potassium is not produced by the body naturally, it must be consumed through food. Potash is the most commonly used potassium fertilizer, but over 70% is based on conventional underground mining that uses heavy-duty equipment to extract it.Although underground mining can release half the CO2 emissions of open-pit mining, the company is taking it further by introducing several battery electric vehicles.Normet Canada, the mining company behind the project, was awarded a new contract to use battery electric vehicles at the Jansen potash project, including 10 underground EV loaders and one electric tethered loader.With these heavy-duty electric vehicles, BHP says the Jansen project is forecast to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% compared to the Saskatchewan potash mine.The electric vehicle deliveries are expected to begin in March 2023 and run through 2024, which will work perfectly as the miners aim to start production in 2026.Like potassium is critical for humans, electric vehicles also require certain minerals such as lithium and nickel. These miners are looking for ways to build on the momentum electric vehicles are establishing in reducing carbon emissions, completing a complete sustainability supply chain. Several companies are now working to make this a reality.Normet electric mining equipment (Source: Normet)Miners using electric vehicles can complete the sustainability supply chainAlmost every automaker has set its intentions to scale production of its electric vehicles to meet the growing demand for zero-emission cars while setting carbon reduction targets.For example, GM is going all-electric by 2035, Ford looks to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026, and Volkswagen plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2035, while North America follows.Tesla, only selling electric cars, continues breaking records with 343,000 EVs delivered in Q3 on its way to producing 20 million annually.However, getting to these numbers will require mining. A few companies have already begun working to build a sustainable EV supply chain.Snow Lake Lithium outlined its plans in February to develop the worldâs first all-electric lithium mine, one of the most critical minerals used to build EV batteries. The mining companyâs CEO said at the time if you are going to mine for these resources that will be used to protect the environment, then obtaining them must also be done in a sustainable matter.The company is working with Meglab, an electrical equipment provider and mining solutions company, to make the dream a reality.There are operations around the world working to reduce emissions in the mining sector. In July 2021, Opibus (now ROAM) converted a Toyota Land Cruiser fitted with an electric powertrain to use a mining vehicle.Miners using electric vehicles can significantly reduce the heat and carbon exposure they typically experience with diesel-powered equipment. Furthermore, EV mining technology can cost less as it requires less ventilation and cooling.The point is, as the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, companies are figuring out ways to build on the momentum EVs are establishing in reducing emissions. If miners get on board, it will come full circle, creating a complete sustainable EV supply chain.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,miners switching to electric vehicles,,,

other news sites711,https://www.igorslab.de/en/evga-pulls-the-plug-with-loud-bang-yet-it-has-long-been-editorial/,EVGA pulls the plug with a loud bangbut it has been stewing for a long time Editorial,"If you want to (or have to) separate, then there are two ways to announce this: one emotionless and one where you once again seek the big stage. EVGA chose, what a coincidence, the time shortly before NVIDIAâs in-house exhibition GTC (after that, the whole thing would have gone down a bit) to drop the bombshell that wasnât really a bombshell anymore. This media uprising and aftermath is really just the long overdue flashback after a smoldering fire that lasted for months and in which the green fuse was even shorter than Jensenâs wood screws in his old Fermi mock up.I thought long and hard about whether to write something about it (and about what), because I also have my own private opinion about the circumstances in general and EVGAâs appearance in particular, which has been formed in the last few years also due to my own experiences. Thatâs why I also used the weekend to chat or talk on the phone with one or the other competitor and colleague, in addition to all the benchmarks. Because the way in which and where the reason is now located and the way in which a suitable culprit is presented at the same time has caused quite a stir among many people. Itâs not about defending NVIDIA, but using Jensen as the ideal object of hatred is a bit short-sighted and only distracts from oneâs own failures. But you have to throw something down the throat of the investors and brand-affine customers. And thatâs where the green leather jacket Hulk is best suited.My colleague Stephen Burke from Gamersnexus has actually already said most of it, I donât need to dissect and regurgitate that again. Iâll just post the short quote from EVGA CEO Andrew Han again now before I get my own thoughts on it.We are not going to be on Jensenâs lap on stage, so I donât want people to speculate whatâs going onâ¦.EVGA has decided to nat carry the next gen. (Andrew Han, CEO)The business model: Let others do itIn principle, EVGA is nothing more than a brand without its own production. Of course, the company has its own R&D department for the engineering, but the level of creativity is not particularly high here either, if you only have to rely on the abilities of third parties in the end, be it the circuit boards, the coolers and the complete production as the final implementation. Unfortunately, having it done instead of doing it yourself costs money. And while this very concept mitigates risk and effort in manufacturing, it also reduces the margin that can still be achieved with such a highly complex product. Therefore, I asked several competitors and found out that the currently achievable margins in the worst case (like EVGA) are still 5%, and up to 10% for the do-it-yourself manufacturers, who can manage an own production.This is not less than in 2021 or 2020, only this year merchandise sales have dropped significantly due to orders staying away and a change in demand. However, that one produces at a loss because of NVIDIAâs money-grubbing claws, as EVGA colports, is considered by many to be an urban legend. These are rather homemade problems with faulty designs and a RMA rate that was beyond good and evil. I donât want to quote myself again, but the disaster with Amazonâs New World and the scorched circuit boards was expensive, really expensive. To attach this to every card as a loss is definitely too short-sighted.Letâs say they made 10x profit than normal business last year, if you are the boss, will you quit now or waste another 10 years just to make the same profit amount last year? (Competitor)The business of brands is actually like the good old stock market business, because you should sell at the peak and best take what is still to be taken. If you have to buy almost all services at a high price, there is not much left in the graphics card business. A large manufacturer (not EVGA) easily produces around 200,000 graphics cards per week, which puts the 5 to 10 percent in a different light. In the system gastronomy, business also only works via sheer mass, which is no different with graphics cards. However, EVGA lacks exactly this mass (which can also be seen as a buffer), which can cushion smaller outliers.If you ask the competitors why they havenât copied EVGAâs warranty, upgrade and exchange model as well, you actually only see grinning faces or shaking heads. Statements such as âeconomic suicide by defaultâ are still the most polite thing to say. I wrote that the cards have become more and more complex and that the risk of failure has increased dramatically as a result. Therefore, the RMA processes do not become more favorable, on the contrary. Goodwill and generosity, as EVGA has made its trademark, must also be afforded and what was manageable 10 years ago can end in collapse any day today. House of cards and all. Here, EVGA simply lacks the critical mass to easily pull off something like this financially. Being the US market leader is all well and good, but how big is the DIY market there?If it were profitable, we would have done it long ago (Competitor)Peripherals and power supplies are much easier to keep track of and now offer much higher margins of up to 30 percent. Power supplies are just the new thermal paste and the run is still properly fueled by ATX 3.0. Speaking of power supplies, I remember how EVGA at the time (this was back in the Kepler days) made the sampling of graphics cards dependent on a positive review of the newly introduced power supplies. Back then, I was still writing for Tomâs Hardware and very stubbornly resisted the âreward for awardâ system. At that time, however, the âJust buy it!â philosophy did not yet exist there and one was still allowed to do such things as a reviewer.As a result, I was then excluded from sampling for a few years. By the way, Iâm still alive, which shows once again that you donât have to go along with something like that if you donât want to. I also donât want to repeat how EVGA products later failed my tests and the engineering used my findings (pad mod, area increase on the cooling frame, RAM monitoring in the ICX design), but the PR kicked nasty in my direction. I never asked for money for my support, but would probably have been happy to receive a thank you now and then. By the way, this is exactly where you notice the difference between a US company like EVGA and a German medium-sized company. EVGA is extremely profit-oriented, and when things donât go so well, they just part with a division. By the way, this is not reprehensible, but the explanations should then also be more honest.The Green Light Program as a buzzkillAnd what does NVIDIA have to do with it now? Yes, even the competitors are properly pissed off that they still donât know NVIDIAâs prices and donât know at which dumping or scalper rate Master Jensen will beat his new Ada into the market as a playmate (depending). Thatâs why you wonât see so many completely new designs, and what I had already called âPlaygroundâ in the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will mostly be continued. This is then economic prudence and not even stupid. EVGA could have thought of that as well.However, you also have to know that NVIDIA strives for total control and also mercilessly enforces these policies. There isnât much room left for technical gimmicks Ã¡ la EVGAâs special models and both sides have clashed hard not only once. EVGA always explores how far you can go and NVIDIA then intervenes to correct the situation. I have already explained this in detail in the article linked above and I donât want to repeat myself. However, it is also a fact that NVIDIA only provides replacements if you follow âNVIDIAâs rulesâ. You can approve of this or not, but it leads (at least in theory) to more durable products.Things like EVGAâs Kingpin models break those rules, but thatâs where theyâve found a clever loophole because itâs effectively declared a mod. Galax does the same with the HoF series. Various overclockers give their face for it (for good money) and it is not a consumer product. Thatâs why you donât get a real HoF including unlimited OC tool as a normal customer, but only the âroadworthyâ version under the same name. The rest is then expensive cannon fodder for the LN2 artillery. Such marketing escapades also cost money, of course, even if they can boost the companyâs image. The good Kingpin must now look for another place in the money rainforest, but the choice is rather manageable there.I didnât really want to go that far, but once youâre in such a nice writing flow, the shore youâre aiming for gets further and further away. In order to come to some kind of conclusion at the end, Iâll make it simple for myself, because I can perhaps also question some things differently: It is certainly not a loss for me (and many others), because it became apparent that the model practiced for years would no longer have been financially viable in this way. And before one admits this publicly and meekly, one looks for the last big performance and says goodbye to the shocked audience with a big bang. I only hope that all previous customers will still be dealt with gallantly and treated fairly. Then it will surely work out with the power supplies, housings and other stuff.After all, I havenât heard from any other small Jensen exclusive customers that they now have to throw in the towel for the reasons I mentioned. But they can probably calculate better and also produce themselves. It is a pity about a colorful facet on the graphics card market, which I will also miss, but the customer will get over it.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,commentary,,,

other news sites717,https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/carmakers-lifetime-emissions-50-higher-than-reported/,Carmakersglobal emissions higher than reported,"Carmakersâ global emissions are on average 50% higher than what they report with Hyundai-Kia and BMW underreporting emissions by as much as 115% and 80% respectively, a new Transport & Environment (T&E) report shows. With obligatory scope 3 (lifetime) emissions disclosure set to be introduced in 2023, asset managers with exposure to carbon intensive carmakers face a âticking carbon bombâ, says T&E.In 2023, the EU will introduce a requirement that financial institutions disclose their scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions)[1]. The new requirement will hit asset managers with exposure to carmakers hard. Unlike manufacturers of furniture or mobile phones, the vast majority (98%) of a car companyâs emissions come under scope 3 â primarily the use of the cars [2].But, as T&Eâs analysis shows, carmakersâ already high scope 3 emissions are likely far larger than officially reported.Luca Bonaccorsi, director of sustainable finance at T&E, said: âFor green investing to be effective, we need accurate data. Carmakers are trying to pull the wool over investors eyes by underreporting the lifetime emissions of their cars. This makes a mockery of carmakersâ green claims.âCarmakers base their total reported emissions on a number of factors such as the average size of the vehicles, where the cars are driven and the lifespan of vehicles. Carmakers on the whole have used selective data to reach a lower figure. Toyota, for example, bases the lifetime average emissions of its vehicles on a scarcely believable 100,000 kilometres.This makes car companies, from an investment perspective, almost as carbon intensive as the oil industry. At todayâs prices, â¬1 million invested in an average of oil giants Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell finances around 5,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The same amount finances more than 4,500 tCO2e in the car sector[3]. In some cases the carbon intensity of carmakers is significantly higher: nearly 10,000 tonnes if invested in Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and 7,000 tonnes for Honda according to carmakersâ reporting [4].Luca Bonaccorsi added: âAccording to official disclosures, a euro invested in a car company finances virtually the same amount of carbon as a euro in an oil company. This should be a wake up call for the financial industry. Asset managers wanting to avoid a ticking carbon bomb will have to start ditching carmakers that continue to sell polluting cars.âBy the end of 2022, Morningstar, a US-based financial firm, estimates that some 50% of all new financial products sold will be environmental, social and governance (ESG) based. However, ESG ratings fail to capture the companiesâ true climate impact. Despite CO2 emissions being the most important environmental indicators, they represent less than 1% of the ESG rating for S&P and MSCI, two of the worldâs leading ESG indexes. T&E calls on the EU to regulate and harmonise the methodology for ESG ratings to ensure consistent and transparent reporting of data.ENDSNotes to editor[1] Car companiesâ true carbon intensity will be revealed in 2023 thanks to mandatory Scope 3 disclosure (both in the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive).[2] Greenhouse gas emissions are categorised into three groups (Scopes) by the most widely-used international accounting tool, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a companyâs value chain.[3] This is based on the official scope 3 disclosures of carmakers and oil companies, not T&Eâs estimates. Oil companies are likely also significantly underreporting their scope 3 emissions. However, we have no evidence to believe that the under-reporting is higher in any specific sector. On the contrary, in another analysis, evidence suggests the error must be rather homogeneous across sectors and is somewhat filtered out by the use of ratios.[4] The chart does not compare companiesâ total emissions but the amount of emissions equivalent to a specific financial investment. This ratio is influenced by the appetite of the market for a specific company, so the higher the evaluation of the company, the lower the carbon intensity ratio. A companyâs evaluation is affected by a large number of variables.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,carmakers underestimating emissions,,,

A paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds that itâs raining harder in most of the United States. The study, written by researchers at Northwestern University, tied the results to climate change and to warmer airâs ability to hold more water. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Record rain is hitting drought-stricken areas. Thatâs not good news. The findings echo the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics, as well as the evidence from decades of research, and highlight the real-time effect that humans are having on the weather and climate.The research offers confirmation of what atmospheric scientists have been warning of for years: a warmer world is, on balance, a wetter world. And as global temperatures continue to rise, an uptick in precipitation extremes is expected.Climate change is causing heavier rainsWhat the study finds is consistent with a basic tenet of atmospheric physics: For every degree Fahrenheit that air temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold 4 percent more water; this is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Where storm clouds develop and the atmosphere is sufficiently moist, it means a warmer climate will support more intense rainfall.AdvertisementThe study reports âconsistent shifts from lower to higher daily precipitation intensities, particularly in the central and eastern United States.â The authors compared rainfall over two periods â 1951 to 1980 and 1991 to 2020 â to see how patterns evolved.âWhen itâs raining, itâs raining more,â said Ryan Harp, the author lead author on the study, in an interview. âBut what we also did was â¦ we were able to verify some of the expectations we had based on modeling studies.âIn other words, most similar studies to date had centered on projections made by forward-running computer models fed with historical data. This is among the first that, on a nationwide level, examine observed daily rainfall trends.âI think during that process we were a little surprised that this paper hasnât been written before,â said Daniel Horton, a study co-author and a professor at Northwestern University, in an interview. âWe know that precipitation should be increasing â¦ but we just wanted to do a very straightforward paper that says, âYep, weâre seeing it.â âAdvertisementHarp said the fact that reality matched simulations lends credence to climate models.âPeople should in general be trusting in climate models,â he said. âWeâre constantly working to improve them to the best of our abilities.âNot necessarily more rain overall, and not everywhereIn the study, the authors examined daily data from more than 1,700 weather stations distributed in the Lower 48. Each had to have a continuous record dating back to at least 1951 to be included in the study.In the eastern United States, the researchers observed a 4.5 to 5.7 percent increase in average daily rainfall on days when it rained. That does not say there are more days with rain, or more rain overall.âThat doesnât necessarily give us the whole story,â Harp said. âThere may be places where precipitation intensity is increasing but frequency is decreasing. We might not know if thereâs an overall increase or decrease. Thatâs one thing that weâre working on.âGreg Carbin, the head of forecast operations at the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center, who was not involved in this research, appreciated that the study touched on the âparadox of potentially fewer precipitation days with higher-intensity precipitation occurring on those days.âCarbin has noted a trend of more rain falling on fewer days in his analysis of recent precipitation.AdvertisementâOverall, the area covered by the count of 1-inch rainfall days was lower than in recent years across large parts of the central and eastern U.S.,â Carbin wrote in an email. âIn fact, moderate to severe drought has plagued areas of the Northeast, and extreme to exceptional drought is now expanding across part of the central U.S. Nonetheless, we have had extreme rainfall events occur in St. Louis, Dallas, eastern Kentucky, and, most recently, with Hurricane Ian in Florida.âDespite strong trends in the central and eastern United States, the authors noted that there were a few places where rainfall did not appear to be growing more intense. The paper does detail âmixed signals in the western U.S.,â but for reasons the authors are still trying to identify.âThat [trend] didnât hold true for the western U.S.,â said Harp, especially in the Pacific Northwest. He explained that changes in the overall placement of weather systems are âsuppressingâ any tendency for heavier precipitation in the West. A slight change in the location at which high and low pressure systems are anchored can have an enormous bearing on steering currents, and subsequently on how much precipitation falls in a given location.Changing precipitation trends poses societal challengesWith the planet continuing to warm, a continued increase in rainfall intensity can be expected. That spells concern over whether existing infrastructure can handle the downpours of the future.AdvertisementCommunities may need to turn to simulated precipitation events of the future to guide building decisions, Horton said.The past summer was a testament to the extent to which climate-supercharged downpours can wreak havoc on major metropolitan areas. During a five-week span in July and August, five 1,000-year rain events â or extremely heavy rainfall episodes that have a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year â occurred across the nation.âRecent years have seen some remarkable high-end precipitation events,â Carbin said.GiftOutline Gift Article",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,climate change causing more intense rains,,,
techcrunch725,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/solid-63m-embedded-fintech/,Solid banksM for easier deployment of embedded fintech products,"Solid, which rebranded from Wise in 2021, raised a $63 million Series B round of funding to continue providing its fintech-as-a-service offering for companies wanting to launch and scale their own fintech products.The San Mateo-based company works with fintech and vertical SaaS companies and offers banking, payments, cards and cryptocurrency products via easy-to-integrate APIs.We last profiled the company in 2020, before its name change, and after it had picked up both a $5.7 million seed and a $12 million Series A.Arjun Thyagarajan, co-founder and CEO at Solid, told TechCrunch that the company spent the last 18 months working with early customers on product-market fit.Traditional fintech infrastructure was not built for the modern company, he explained, and that results in companies needing dozens of point solutions and often spending millions in upfront and ongoing maintenance costs, all before launching an actual product.Instead, by utilizing APIs and a few lines of code, customers can embed fintech products and get them up-and-running quickly.âCustomers arenât looking for UI/UX, but really for DI/DX, that developer interface with a powerful dashboard that is self-service,â he said. âWe understood what they were looking for â that demand for modern infrastructure. They work with banks, but those often donât have tools for launching the fintech experience or the building blocks to make it easy to put together.âIt was also during that time that they decided to rebrand as they solidified their business-to-business focus. The new Solid name also resonated more with customers, Thyagarajan added.Over the past year, Solid grew 10x in revenue, doubled its customers to 100 and became profitable. Year to date, the company processed $2 billion in transactions.After being in sort of a stealth mode during the past 18 months, Thyagarajan said the company was now on a journey to get to 100 customers. To do that, he and co-founder Raghav Lal thought it was time to go after new funding. They started the process in May and closed the Series B at the end of July.âWe saw early signs of product market fit, so our thought process was to do the Series B when we were ready for hypergrowth, and now we have cash in the bank,â Thyagarajan said. âWe are going after the mid-market, so we had to go back and fine-tune our product as we figured out what businesses need. The key was to build our technology from the ground up to own the complete experience so we could give customers what they want.âFTV Capital led the new investment and was joined by existing investor Headline. To date, Solid has raised $80.7 million. Thyagarajan didnât disclose a specific valuation with the new round, but did reveal it was 5x over Solidâs Series A valuation.The capital infusion will help accelerate Solidâs entrance into some new verticals like travel, logistics, construction, healthcare, education and the gig economy. The company is looking at where money is moving and identified 40 to 50 different verticals where there is an impedance in how money moves, but they want to benefit their customers.The company is also focusing on mid-market and larger companies, which is another reason why Thyagarajan said the investment was important.âWe are talking to Fortune 1000 companies and they feel more comfortable working with companies with a strong balance sheet,â he added. âA lot of work has been under the radar, so we are getting the brand out and showcasing we are the âAWS of fintech,â a one-stop shop. Our goal is to be alongside them as a partner, not just a vendor.â",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,embedding fintech solutions,,,
other news sites726,https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5vwzq/the-pacific-ocean-is-shrinking-amasia-supercontinent,The Pacific Ocean Is Shrinking and Will Form a New SupercontinentScientists Say,"The Pacific Ocean is shrinking. Every year, it gets about an inch smaller as the tectonic plates that the Americas sit on are pushed westward. Now, thanks to calculations by a supercomputer, scientists say that a new âsupercontinentâ will eventually emerge due to this process: Amasia.The current world map, with its recognizable pattern of continents and oceans, is just one snapshot of our planet in time. Earth has tried on all kinds of continental configurations over its 4.5-billion-year lifespan, including periods where almost all of Earthâs land consolidates into one giant supercontinent.AdvertisementWe currently live in the broken remains of the supercontinent Pangaea, which formed 335 million years ago and disintegrated during the rise of the dinosaurs. The existence of even older supercontinents, such as Rodinia and Columbia (Nuna), suggest that Earth is locked into a âsupercontinent cycleâ that sees the formation and destruction of these immense landmasses on a rough timeline of 600 million years. The cycle raises the question of what kind of new supercontinent might emerge millions of years from now, prompting scientists to propose future landmasses with names like Novopangaea, Aurica, and Amasia.To shed light on this mystery, researchers led by Chuan Huang, a geophysicist at Curtin University in Australia, simulated the future of Earth with a supercomputer. The results suggest that a new supercontinent, Amasia, will form when the Pacific Ocean shrinks into nothingness some 200 million years from now, causing North America to slam into Asia, according to a recent study published in National Science Review.The future emergence of Amasia, a portmanteau of America and Asia, has been discussed by scientists for more than a decade, but there is debate over whether this supercontinent would form âinside in,â a process known as introversion, or âoutside in,â which is called extroversion. Introversion involves the closure of younger post-Pangaea oceans, such as the Indian or Atlantic, whereas extroversion indicates the closure of the Pacific Ocean, which is the oldest ocean on Earth and is shrinking at a rate of about one inch per year.AdvertisementâEarth's known supercontinents are believed to have formed in vastly different ways, with two endmembers being introversion and extroversion,â said Huang and his colleagues in the study. âThe former involves the closure of the internal oceans formed during the break-up of the previous supercontinent, whereas the latter involves the closure of the previous external superocean.ââWith our modelling results, we speculate if the next supercontinent will likely assemble through the closure of the Pacific Ocean,â which would be extroversion, âor the Indo-Atlantic oceans,â which would be introversion, the team added.As Huang and his colleagues ran their supercomputer simulations, they noticed the strength of the lithosphere, the stiff top layer of Earth that encompasses the crust and surface, is an overlooked variable in the emergence of the next supercontinent. The oceanic lithosphere has been weakening over time as a result of Earthâs slow cooling, a shift that clearly predicts the rise of Amasia from extroversion, or the closure of the Pacific Ocean.Sign up for Motherboardâs daily newsletter for a regular dose of our original reporting, plus behind-the-scenes content about our biggest stories.âOur results show that the yield strength of the oceanic lithosphere plays a critical role in determining the assembly path of a supercontinent,â the researchers said. âWe found that high oceanic lithospheric strength leads to introversion assembly, whereas lower strength leads to extroversion assembly.ââThis predicts that the next supercontinent Amasia could only be assembled through the closure of the Pacific Ocean,â the team concluded.In this way, the new study offers a glimpse of our planet some 200 to 300 million years from now, when an enormous landmass could unite over the ashes of the long-lived Pacific Ocean. Itâs a reminder that humanity has existed for a mere split-second in geological time, and that our planet in the deep past and far future may as well be an alien world.""Earth as we know it will be drastically different when Amasia forms,â said Zheng-Xiang Li, a professor at Curtinâs Earth Dynamics Research Group who co-authored the study, in a statement. âThe sea level is expected to be lower, and the vast interior of the supercontinent will be very arid with high daily temperature ranges.""",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,tectonic movement shrinking Pacific Ocean,,,

A year ago, nearly every investor had a fintech thesis, companies were racing to go public and investors at nearly every stage of the market were fighting to jam money into the hands of founders.Thatâs not true any longer. The collapse in valuations on the public market has been extreme. A significant number of the biggest fintech companies to go public in the last couple of years are now worth less than the money theyâd raised. And that drop in confidence has now permeated to all stages of the market.Understandably, many early founders are unprepared to contemplate that the valuation of their idea â which will likely take about a decade to come to fruition â is now worth 75% less than it would have been six months ago.But the long-term outlook of the sector remains unchanged for most investors and founders.

Airbus now has a wide lead in the single-aisle market â the hottest area of aviation â leaving Boeing to grapple with how to bridge the gap.The European company has grabbed new orders and market share with its popular A320 family of narrow-body jets, which predominantly serve shorter-haul destinations, to which travel has rebounded faster, compared with long-haul flights.Latest figures to the end of June show that Airbus had close to 17,000 orders of its A320 and A220 aircraft, and has so far delivered just over 10,600. The A320 is now the bestselling aircraft ever, overtaking US-based Boeingâs 737 jet.Recent fleet data from aviation consultancy Cirium showed Airbusâs A320 family with a âfirm order backlogâ market share of 59 per cent compared with Boeingâs 737 family of jets.The bestseller within the A320 family is its largest model, the A321neo, which is also offered with extra fuel tanks in long-range and extra-long range variants. Some airlines â such as Americaâs JetBlue â now use these for long-haul flights that were traditionally flown by more expensive wide-body jets.Airbusâs market share is only likely to grow as the group moves ahead with aggressive plans to lift output of the jets to 75 a month by 2025, despite industry-wide concerns about constraints in the supply chain. Production had reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before dropping to 40 a month when Covid hit.Some analysts have questioned when Boeing will be able to regain some of that lost market share, as the company has continued to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 Max 8 after two fatal crashes within five months.Production problems have prevented customer deliveries of Boeingâs wide-body 787 aircraft Â© Richard Ellis/AlamyGlobal regulators have since cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing implemented software and design changes and the plane is notching up new orders.Another challenge looming, however, is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. Boeing is racing to complete those processes before the end of the year to avoid having to develop a new flight deck under rules introduced by US Congress following the Max crashes.I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but heâs not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in SeattleBoeing has also suffered production issues that have prevented customer deliveries of its wide-body 787 aircraft. In addition, development of its 777X aircraft has been delayed, while problems on a number of big defence contracts have only added to the challenges.Union representatives, meanwhile, have criticised the companyâs decision to move its global headquarters from Chicago to Washington, DC â seen as taking it further away from its spiritual home, the commercial aircraft factories of Seattle, and adding to persistent questions over the quality of its engineering.Repeated delays on the commercial side have frustrated some of Boeingâs largest customers, including Ryanair. The low-cost carrierâs chief executive, Michael OâLeary, has said sweeping changes are needed to Boeingâs senior management led by chief executive Dave Calhoun.In a recent interview, OâLeary told the Financial Times that the US aviation group has âlost huge market share and existing customers are being lost to Airbus, which is why I donât understand why they sit there and do nothingâ.âI have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but heâs not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle,â he said.But others, including Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr, have continued to back the US company. Boeing has insisted that things have changed since the Max accidents. It is also ramping up the hiring of engineers as it works with the US aviation regulator to certify its upcoming 777X aircraft.Boeingâs chief executive Dave Calhoun has sought to resist discussion on market share Â© Christopher Goodney/BloombergHowever, in a further blow, Boeing last month lost out to Airbus on a $37bn order from Chinaâs three big state airlines. They chose 290 A320neo jets â the biggest order by Chinese airlines since the start of the pandemic. The country is a crucial market for both Airbus and Boeing and the orders come at a time of rising political tensions between the US and China.Calhoun has previously cited uncertainty over orders from China as one of the three main risks facing the company, along with securely boosting production of the Max and resolving issues around the 787. China was the first country to ground the Max and, although its aviation regulator last year approved its return to service, Chinese carriers have not started flying the plane commercially again.The multibillion-dollar question facing Boeing, therefore, is how to recover its lead against Airbus, at the same time as Chinaâs first self-developed aircraft â Comacâs narrow-body C919 â is finally nearing completion.Boeing abandoned a plan for a new midsize aeroplane â a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 Max and the larger 787 â and it remains unclear what its next step will be. Its balance sheet also remains constrained, with some $45bn of net debt.$45bn Net debt on Boeing balance sheetThe company needs to âlaunch an answer to the A321neo,â says Kevin Michaels, managing director of Michigan-based AeroDynamic Advisory. âCan they afford it? I think they can. Their balance sheet isnât great but youâve got to invest in your core business to stay around in the long run.ââThe other problem they face is knowing what to do â if you do press the button, how do you do that plane? The world is about to change massively but no one yet knows what that technology will be and you could end up spending $20bn on something that will be immediately obsolete,â says Nick Cunningham, analyst at research firm Agency Partners in London, who believes the company needs to raise equity to fund a new programme.But Calhoun has recently played down any concerns about the companyâs market share position vis-Ã -vis Airbus. âAt this moment in time, itâs less important,â he told an investor conference in June. Boeing, he added, had to concentrate on getting planes back in the air.âWe have to stay focused on doing that incredibly well. One aeroplane at a time. If I jump to a market share discussion immediately and say, âLetâs get above 50 and letâs do it next yearâ, what happens? The whole system gets crammed down in every way.âHe also indicated at the same conference that the company might not launch anything new for at least another couple of years. He does not believe that the performance improvement to justify an all new aircraft currently exists.Boeing, he said, was sure it had the ability to compete. âIâm confident, my sales team is confident,â said Calhoun. âOur customers express confidence to me, so why would I rush? No good reason.âAdditional reporting by Philip Georgiadis",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Airbus-boeing,,,
techcrunch736,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/10/fears-of-climate-tech-underinvestment-are-probably-overblown/,Fears of climate tech underinvestment are probably overblown,"Thereâs been a lot of hand-wringing over whether the world will get its act together enough to prevent catastrophic warming. Thereâs certainly a case to be made there â weâve spent the last several decades kicking the can down the road at every opportunity.Well, here we are again, with the can again before us and the end of the road fast approaching.Lucky for me, I tend to be an optimist. I still think weâre in for a world of pain, and weâll probably have to rely on some exotic technologies like fusion power and direct air capture to pull ourselves back from the brink. But in my opinion, when the chips are down, humanity tends to pull through.If we use computing and software as a guide, we should expect to see a nearly fivefold increase in the capital committed in the next 30 years.That is why I think many of the gloom-and-doom scenarios regarding climate tech investments tend to be overly bearish. Take the International Energy Agencyâs (IEA) forecasts, which for years habitually underestimated the growth of solar power. The agency has since added better models to its toolkit, but it and others still make predictions that go on to be proven overly pessimistic.In reality, renewable energy and other climate tech is likely to follow an adoption curve thatâs similar to other industries. It might even follow an accelerated version given how broad and deep the impacts and benefits of climate tech are likely to be â and the very real prospect of Armageddon if we do nothing.To see how climate tech stands to outperform todayâs forecasts, you only have to look as far back as 1970, when the computing revolution was beginning.Exponential trendsThe overarching trend of investment in the computing and telecommunications space over 50 years has been exponential. But that simplistic analysis papers over the significant growth that happened in the early years. It also fails to pick up on key technological advances that sparked wider adoption.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,investment,,,
techcrunch737,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/bitmain-matrixport-john-ge/,Bitmain co founder welcomes crypto regulation to restore market confidence,"The collapse of Three Arrow Capital and the counterparties wrapped in the crypto hedge fundâs troubles have drawn questions about the soundness of the heady digital asset investment space. For the industryâs survivors, watching their rivals fall to pieces overnight has been an alarming experience.To understand where the industry might be going after the market turmoil, we spoke with John Ge, chief executive officer at Matrixport, a Singapore-based digital asset manager with over $10 billion in assets under management and custody.Ge was formerly the head of investment and financing as well as a founding partner at Bitmain, the worldâs biggest maker of Bitcoin mining machines. Together with Bitmainâs co-founder and former CEO Jihan Wu, Ge co-founded Matrixport in 2018.Three Arrow Capital, known as 3AC in the crypto community, was one of the worldâs largest crypto hedge funds before its fall from grace. Its success was predicated on a risky strategy: it borrowed aggressively from crypto lenders and in turn invested that money in other crypto projects.When cryptocurrency prices began to plummet earlier this year, the firm, as well as other similar outfits that bet on rising crypto prices, failed to repay their creditors and plunged into liquidation. The crypto market is down by $1.8 trillion since its peak in November, led by the slide in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.The recent market crash is âinevitableâ, Ge says in an interview with TechCrunch. âThe core issue is that we saw players whose business model is like a black box. They borrow money from investors without giving transparency over how the money will be used.âThe other problem is that these crypto managers are acting both as the player and referee, Ge contends. âMany of them are providing both asset management and proprietary trading. An asset manager should not be doing proprietary trading, and if it does, it needs to follow stringent leverage requirements.ââEven the most conservative investment strategy has risks and may result in losses, but the principle is to be transparent with your customers, not fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading,â the founder says.Matrixport, which serves individuals as well as over 500 institutions across Asia, Europe and North America, was exposed to 3AC and has lodged a claim alongside other creditors. But Ge assures that the firmâs exposure is ârelatively smallâ when compared to the exposure other industry players faced and is considered âminorâ when compared relative to Matrixportâs equity.As to how to restore investor confidence in the crypto sphere, Ge believes regulators are on the right track to bring more oversight over consumer-facing crypto products and protection for retail investors, as is the case in Singapore.But itâs âunrealisticâ to have regulators design risk control models for institution-focused asset managers. âThe pace of regulations tends to fall behind that of industry development.âGe thinks investors have âlost a certain level of confidenceâ in the crypto market and the industry will take time to recover. On the other hand, he thinks competition has waned for survivors like Matrixport because âmany of the other players are gone.âMatrixport told Bloomberg last year that it planned to go public in three to five years and Ge said that plan âhasnât changed.â Itâs too early to say which market the company is floating its shares but the U.S. is a âlikelyâ option given investors there are more âwelcoming of crypto innovation.â",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,crypto regulation calls,,,

But itâs still business as usual at fintech companies here. They have proven their resilience even in wartime conditions, and impressively, 90% of Ukrainian tech startups are still hiring.This March, Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a bill to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the country. While the bill doesnât let you use digital assets as a form of payment, it seeks to create proper conditions to establish a strong cryptocurrency market.Cryptocurrency exchanges can now claim a license to operate legally in the country. Banks will be able to open accounts for crypto companies, which can opt for different licenses depending on what they do.The Ukrainian IT sector is still growingIn the first five months of 2022, Ukraineâs IT sector generated roughly $3.2 billion from exports â 27% more than the same period in 2021, and accounting for almost half of the countryâs total volume of export services.One of the main goals of the Ukrainian government is to increase the IT sectorâs share of the countryâs GDP from the current 4% to 10% by 2024.The governmentâs backing and the strong growth together make for a strong signal of how the IT sector is ripe for investments.Global finance and tech firms are supporting UkraineEarlier this month, the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation presented Digital4Freedom â a global initiative that is the primary source of charitable donations for tech companies to support Ukraine.Digital4Freedom is part of the global UNITED24 effort and allows anyone across the globe to make monetary contributions to the restoration of the countryâs economy.The program consists of nine projects presented to 40 companies, of which the vast majority have agreed to help with monetary contributions or technology solutions.Amazon, for example, will reportedly provide over $100 million in cloud hosting services for Ukrainian state registers and is planning to develop solutions for deploying artificial intelligence in courts.Crypto exchange Binance will become an official partner of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine to offer educational projects in the IT, web3 and finance fields.Meta, with the support of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, recently launched a $1.5 million assistance program for the recovery of the Ukrainian economy, helping small- and medium-sized businesses with a specialized training centre.Startups are an integral part of the Ukrainian economyUkrainian businesses expect a reduction in the production of goods and services due to the war. Whatâs more, company executives predict the next 12 months will bring inflation and devaluation of the hryvnia.Ukrainian tech startups are dedicating their efforts to elevating the industry to new heights. They are set to become the foundational pillars for a new layer of technology companies that will add significant value to the economy.Fintech is growing fast despite setbacksThis year, Ukrainian lawmakers introduced the Law of Ukraine on Payment Services (LPS), which will provide a better regulatory environment for the fintech sector, including for payment services.Additionally, the Ukrainian Association of Fintech and Innovation Companies (UAFIC) became the first non-EU member to join the European Digital Finance Association (EDFA). Both organizations are collaborating to strengthen the fintech landscape in Ukraine.I believe Ukraineâs resilience in the face of Russian aggression, and the tremendous growth of the fintech landscape despite the crisis has proven that investors should not hesitate to invest in the fast-growing industry.Despite the difficult situation in the country, the industry continues to develop. While attending numerous conferences and fintech events, I meet investors from all over the world interested in companies from Ukraine. All this tells us that the prospects for fintech in Ukraine look good, and that now is an excellent time to invest in it.",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Ukraine fintech growing,,,

I am not at all trying to minimize what people go through when theyâve been laid off. Itâs happened to me, and it sucks.But layoffs also offer a chance at a new beginning.

other news sites752,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-catastrophic-threat-of-thawing-permafrost-hangs-over-us-all/,The catastrophic threat of thawing permafrost hangs over us all,"Attendees at a permafrost conference in Dawson City, Yukon, inspect a creek bank in the Klondike where ice-rich terrain has been washed away by placer mining. Climate change threatens to unlock the carbon in sediments such as this.Julien SchroderRichard Littlemore is a Vancouver-based journalist, consultant, speechwriter, and co-author of Climate Cover-up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming.The Klondike capital of Dawson City is one of the best places in Canada to contemplate the catastrophic consequences of thawing permafrost. Or, if youâd rather, it might be a place to ignore the implications entirely, and with confidence that you are not alone in doing so. It depends on how closely you want to look â or how desperately you want to look away.Most of Dawson â like 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Canada â is underlain by permafrost, which scientists define as ground that has remained frozen, winter and summer, for at least two years. The notion may seem chilly, even forbidding, in the south, but many northerners call permafrost âour concrete.â They use it as a base for roads and bridges, as the foundation for homes, churches and businesses. In the words of Steve Kokelj, a Carleton University geographer and one of the deans of the Canadian permafrost community, itâs âthe glue that holds the northern landscape together.âBut if the promising prefix âperma-â suggests that this essential base is going to remain frozen forever, you might be disappointed. Thanks to climate warming, which a recent study by the Finnish Meteorological Institute showed is advancing in the North at up to seven times the global average, permafrost is thawing at an accelerating rate.Which means that stuff is starting to break. The Northwest Territories Association of Communities said in 2017 that its annual bill for permafrost-related repairs was already $51-million â a big additional tax for a small population (44,800). And itâs going to get worse. A January study in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment predicted that permafrost-related damage will affect 30 per cent to 50 per cent of all northern infrastructure by 2050.Thatâs obviously bad news for everyone who lives in one of the houses that is riding a permafrost thaw slump into the sea. But there is an even greater threat that hangs over us all.According to Sue Natali from the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., there is currently between 1.4 trillion and 1.6 trillion metric tonnes of carbon trapped in northern circumpolar permafrost, the remains of plants and animals that, over many thousands of years, died and slipped below the surface, where they have remained frozen ever since. For scale, thatâs roughly twice as much carbon as is currently contained in the worldâs atmosphere, three times as much as in all the forests on Earth.And when the permafrost thaws and micro-organisms start chowing down on all that suddenly available carboniferous material, those microbes wind up breathing out the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2) or the even more powerful methane.Next comes the truly dangerous turn, the self-reinforcing feedback that could become an irreversible global tipping point. The warming atmosphere hastens the thaw of the permafrost, which belches up more greenhouse gases, which further accelerates the warming â and so on into the crisis-ridden future. The short- to medium-term impact of this âpermafrost carbon feedbackâ loop remains speculative and controversial but by one estimate, based on calculations from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs 2019 Arctic report card, Canadian permafrost could be emitting greenhouse gases by 2050 at a rate equal to all of the countryâs current human output. If we were including those GHG emissions in our national totals (weâre not), that would mean we would have to double our emission reductions and/or carbon-capture efforts to reach the federal governmentâs widely heralded target of net zero by 2050. It hardly bears considering.In the slightly longer term, an overview paper published this month in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources reported that by the end of the century, even middling forecasts show that northern permafrost will be emitting carbon at a rate higher than the current output of any country other than China.A drone's-eye view of the Yukon wilderness. Much of the land in this area lies on permafrost hundreds of thousands of years old that was never scoured by glaciers.Julien SchroderWhich brings us back to Dawson, where in late August the foremost permafrost experts in the country gathered with an unprecedented contingent of First Nations delegates for the North Yukon Permafrost Conference.It is, again, a fitting venue. The fabled home of the Klondike Gold Rush, Dawson transformed in the late 1890s from a Dene community of a few hundred to a bacchanalian metropolis of up to 30,000 miners, revellers and hangers-on before crashing back down to its current permanent population of fewer than 2,000.Honouring that history, the town presents as something of a theme park â though, because it is curated by Parks Canada as a National Historic Site, it looks more quaint than Disneyfied. By municipal decree, all the downtown building fronts must remain âin conformity with the architectural and landscape â¦ style common in Dawson during and immediately following the âGold Rush.ââAt a distance, the effect is pretty convincing. The landscape part is easy â 1890s-style dirt roads and rickety wooden boardwalks where the sidewalks might be. This is also robustly practical. The heaving permafrost and winter temperatures that frequently dip below -40 would quickly turn pavement or sidewalk concrete to rubble.The buildings appear similarly authentic, as long as you donât peek behind the facades to see the ones that are, in fact, corrugated-metal Quonset huts with false fronts. If you were to lift the skirts of the actual buildings, you also would find that nearly all of them are sitting on âcribbing,â beams and posts that can be shimmed and adjusted year after year to remain level, despite the permafrost decline. You donât have to wander far from the main streets to see drunken, slewing (and ultimately dangerous) structures that have not been kept up.âMost of us are used to relevelling our buildings quite a bit,â says Dawson Mayor Bill Kendrick. Itâs more difficult, though â and even more expensive â to manage some of the other infrastructure, he says, offering the example of the sewer and water lines that snapped a few years ago, thanks to a four-foot, permafrost-driven âdeflectionâ along Sixth Avenue.These historic buildings in Dawson, shown in the mid-2000s, are smushing together as the permafrost thaws.Chris BeacomSome of Dawson's more picturesque buildings, as seen at 2018's Canada Day parade.Darryl Dyck/The Canadian PressSo people in Dawson are hypersensitized to the local effects of permafrost â the geohazard. But many seem to actively ignore the implications of permafrost carbon feedback. Far from trying to protect the permafrost, to keep excess carbon in the ground, many dozens of placer mines are working tirelessly to destroy the permafrost layer, to get access to the gold that still lurks in Klondike gravel. The miners, usually in operations of four to six people, set up in creek beds and spray water at the banks, blowing off any surface flora and the layers of permafrost ice, soils and fossilized material to get to the good stuff. Then they sluice out the gold, thereafter covering the landscape with washed-gravel tailings that, from the plane coming in from Whitehorse, look like castings from Dune-sized sandworms.According to the Yukon government manager of surficial geology, Jeff Bond, there are roughly 150 placer mining operations in the Dawson region, generating 90 per cent of the 80,000 ounces of gold that come out of the Yukon every year. At current gold prices, about $2,200 an ounce, thatâs roughly $160-million worth of income, an estimated 87 per cent of which stays in the local economy. As Mayor Kendrick says, âWhen COVID devastated tourism, mining helped us weather the storm.âHere, then, is an analogy for the whole climate-change dilemma: what you know versus what you donât want to know. As in southern Canada, where governments set emission-reduction targets and then invest in oil sands pipelines or promote oil and gas developments, there is always the tension between an uncertain threat tomorrow and a reliable income today.Against that tension, the Dawson permafrost conference was set up as a multifaceted act of reconciliation. First, of course, was the challenge of engaging and reconciling with the Indigenous people on whom the climate effects are having the most immediate and, often, devastating impact. Carleton Universityâs Chris Burn, another giant in the Canadian permafrost panoply, describes First Nations people in the North as âthe last group who are not removed from the environment.â He says, âThey realize that they are facing an existential problem, not just an interesting intellectual exercise.â Dr. Burn is also beloved in these parts as an academic who came to the Yukon to research permafrost in 1982 and has been coming back almost every summer since. Unlike too many academic researchers, who fly in with thousands of dollars of equipment and head straight into the field, neither tapping the locals for their insights nor sharing any knowledge gained in the process, Dr. Burn recognized early that âthe observations of the people who actually live here are always more interesting than those I can make myself.â As if to drive home the point, 40 years later, he still gets ribbed for the unlikely riverbank location of his first camp.So, in preparing for this conference, Dr. Burn and others from the Canadian Permafrost Association (CPA) invited First Nations to participate as co-organizers. Three First Nations accepted: the TrÊ¼ondÃ«k HwÃ«chÊ¼in, the Vuntut Gwichen, and the Na-cho Nyak Dun.The outcome, according to current CPA president Kumari Karunaratne, was âamazing.â Knowing that a third of the people in the room would be First Nations elders, the scientists accepted a challenge to avoid jargon-filled, insider presentations. âTheyâre not dumbing it down,â Dr. Karunaratne said, âbut theyâre breaking it down enough to be understood.â And in the multidisciplinary world of permafrost science, that turned out to be a boon for other scientists, as well.Participants at the Dawson permafrost conference listen to scientist Antoni Lewkowicz and Peggy Kormandy, a Tr'ondÃ«k HwÃ«ch'in elder, describe the Moosehide Slide north of town.Julien SchroderThat signals the second point of reconciliation â the drawing together of the permafrost science community and, especially, the co-ordination of permafrost research.Like other dangerous climate forcings, the permafrost threat is so dispersed that no single jurisdiction can claim or exercise responsibility. Scientists, distributed among many institutions â and many countries â tend to work in isolation and, in Canada certainly, funding agencies prioritize short-term capital-intensive research projects, resisting long-term or operating grants. As a result, the Canadian permafrost research community has been relying on what University of Montreal geographer Oliver Sonnentag calls âa coalition of the willing,â in which âco-ordination is not funded and every person, every project is disconnected.âThanks to at least three initiatives, however, that may be about to change.The first is being led by Carleton University geographer Stephan Gruber, who is the principal investigator for the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Permafrost Partnership Network (NSERC PermafrostNet), which unites researchers from 11 universities, and partners with government agencies, industry, and Indigenous communities to monitor, predict and adapt to permafrost thaw and its consequences.Dr. Natali and the Woodwell Center are driving an even larger research and co-ordination project called Permafrost Pathways, which is building a comprehensive international monitoring network to improve tracking and modelling of Arctic permafrost and carbon fluxes â i.e., how much carbon is being emitted from permafrost as opposed to that which is being absorbed as new plant material dies and is frozen in the annual cycle. Dr. Natali and company are working to partner with local leaders and to provide local and national policy makers with the data they need to fill gaps in monitoring and modelling permafrost thaw.As mentioned above, permafrost emissions are not currently included in national carbon budgets, which means that emission-reduction targets negotiated at the 2015 Paris climate conference could be way off the mark as the world seeks to keep global warming from exceeding catastrophic levels.The bad news in the Permafrost Pathways project comes in the sudden and unfortunate departure of Russia from international permafrost science collaboration, thanks to the diplomatic break driven by the Ukraine war. Two-thirds of the worldâs permafrost lies within Russian borders, so permafrost researchers in the rest of the world are eager to restore the flow of scientific information.In the meantime, there may be a greater opportunity to focus on Canadian monitoring and the Woodwell team has now engaged Dr. Sonnentag, who will be taking a leave from his University of Montreal teaching duties, beginning Jan. 1, to serve as a liaison to the Canadian research community.The Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University is launching a third co-ordination project, called the Permafrost Carbon Feedback Intervention Roadmap, again seeking to expand the conversation and reduce the scientific uncertainties that some policy makers use as a rationale to delay action.Even without working through the next stage of monitoring and analysis, however, Dr. Natali bridles at the continuing policy delay. She says, âUncertainty is just a range of possibilities. It shouldnât frustrate action.âShe also points out that we already understand the range of consequences and says that we should be making decisions based on the high end of the range, precisely because the possible consequences are so huge. (Dr. Gruber calls permafrost carbon feedback âa trillion-dollar question for coastal cities.â)Dr. Natali concludes that, in the long run, âThe science will give us the numbers. For decisions, we need the wisdom to come together as human communities.âJimmy Johnny, a Na-Cho Nyak Dun elder, speaks at the Dawson conference.Julien SchroderOne of the most popular sources of wisdom in Dawson was a Na-Cho Nyak Dun elder named Jimmy Johnny, a presenter in a panel discussion on climate-change adaptation. Mr. Johnny is a short, wiry and quietly mirthful character who has spent his life as a horse wrangler, having gotten his first job as a guide-outfitter in 1958. And he dresses the part: cowboy boots, hat, leather vest and blue jeans that stay up out of pure stubbornness, there being too little flesh on Mr. Johnnyâs bones to stop them from falling down.He told a story of a recent hunting trip in which a pack horse named Big Blue fell into a huge permafrost sinkhole: âRight before my eyes, he disappeared.â Tapping the strength of all hands and a couple of other horses, Mr. Johnny worked to pull Big Blue out, but the sloppy hole was too constricted and the horse too panicked. Facing a terrible decision, Mr. Johnny walked to a high point and phoned the horseâs owner â for permission, or maybe for his blessing. But the owner just said, âJimmy, youâre the trail boss. You do what you have to do.âMr. Johnny walked back to his own horse and, to the consternation of the southern hunters in the party, he pulled a .30-30 rifle from his saddle. âAnd then I walked around behind the horse, so he didnât have to see.âBut Big Blue was neither inattentive nor new to the world of hunters. When Mr. Johnny cocked the rifle â âclick, clickâ â the horse bounded upward, not clear of the hole, but far enough that they were able to wrestle him the rest of the way.The moderator for the adaptation panel was a Na-Cho Nyak Dun adviser named John Meikle, who noted that there is now ample evidence of the risks we all face from climate change, and the urgency of the call to action, concluding, âMaybe itâs time to take a lesson from Big Blue and imagine Jimmy Johnny standing behind you with a .30-30.âItâs a rough metaphor, but the head-nodding and mirthless laughter that greeted Mr. Meikleâs comment suggest that, in this room, at least, there is wary consensus about the looming implications of climate change generally and permafrost specifically: Even if weâre not yet capable of jumping out of the hole, it might be time to stop digging.Editorâs note: (Nov. 1, 2022): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Woodwell Climate Research Center is linked to Harvard.

But for Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of battery tech startup Sila, hard tech problems are also some of the most tantalizing.âItâs always a good time to be a hard tech startup,â Berdichevsky said at TechCrunch Disrupt. âOne of the reasons is that the world doesnât change just because it should. It changes because someone goes after something insanely hard and actually succeeds at it.âSuch hard.tech startups run the gamut from advanced batteries like those made by Sila to nuclear fusion, quantum computing, automation and robotics. Any tech that has the potential for such broad impact also has a massive potential market, and that means a certain class of investors are willing to be in it for the long haul.âHire people to do the technical stuff. Keep an eye on it, but then go learn the other pieces.â Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO, SilaâWe look for real step-change, game-changing technologies that are going to benefit everyone and we think that will drive a huge [total addressable market],â said Milo Werner, a general partner at The Engine.When Berdichevsky founded Sila, he believed his companyâs technology, a silicon-based anode that promises to improve lithium-ion battery energy density by 20%â40%, would be a significant enough advance that it would have no problem finding a market.What he didnât expect was how long it would take.

techcrunch755,https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/to-reach-fintechs-next-level-infrastructure-providers-must-address-these-pain-points/,To reach fintech s next levelinfrastructure providers must address these pain points,"Weâve all seen the headlines: Fintech is struggling. Since last year, valuations are down 70%-80%, deal activity is down 67% and layoffs have plagued many former industry favorites.But fintech is resilient. Innovation continues to drive new developments in lending, payments, crypto and, in particular, infrastructure, showing that the industry still has lots of room for growth. And even though investment activity decreased this year, it still remains well above where it was in 2019 and 2020.Infrastructure providers have a unique opportunity to be a bright spot amidst all the doom and gloom. Over the years, infrastructure has enabled fintech companies and non-financial services companies alike to seamlessly integrate financial products into their platforms.However, as the market grew crowded, infrastructure providers have started competing over who can develop the least expensive product and sign the most fintech companies. The infrastructure market is overlooking a pivotal opportunity to build additional product capabilities that address pain points arising from the struggles of fintech.Infrastructure providers can help connect fintech companies with incumbent banks so that they can both reap the benefits of the interest rate environment.Infrastructure providers must reprioritize and find a way to grow their capabilities for their current customers instead of just signing new ones. To do this, theyâll have to take a closer look at the problems those customers deal with on a daily basis. What does a fintech company do when itâs under a fraud attack? What does a new compliance order in the U.K. mean for their business? How do they retain customers who are terrified by news of skyrocketing interest rates and inflation?These are the questions the leaders of the fintech industry face daily, and infrastructure providers need to understand how they can help answer them.Identifying and addressing pain pointsThe influx of prodigious amounts of cash in the financial infrastructure sector has crowded the space with newcomers. Addressing specific fintech pain points is not only a way to help the fintech industry out; itâs also a way for infrastructure providers to differentiate themselves and show that they provide real value.International coverageThe draw of additional customers and revenue streams has caused fintech companies to explore international waters. In an increasingly globalized world, international coverage is no longer optional.Infrastructure providers must meet their customersâ appetite for global growth by ensuring that their platform is available in countries outside the U.S. They also need to ensure their platform helps fintech companies stay compliant with rapidly changing global regulations â more on that below.Regulatory scrutiny",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,fintech in general,,,

However, since much of modern civilian infrastructure is based on global positioning systems and other satellite technologies that fall under the Defense Departmentâs purview, those views on cooperation are changing on both sides.âSpace isnât a quiet domain of communication and navigation and exploration anymore,â Roper told the audience at TechCrunchâs latest Sessions event, TC Sessions: Space 2020. âItâs increasingly becoming a hostile placeâ¦ So weâre gearing up a new kind of competition on the military side that could extend to space and thatâs creating a lot of new space programs.âRoper emphasized that the interest from the Air Force and the government more broadly extends well beyond offensive capabilities and military priorities. As space becomes an economic opportunity, Roper sees the Air Force as an engine for driving technology development forward in ways that have commercial benefits.âItâs a great, great time for innovation in new technologies that could help the military, but we want to do more than just help the military. Thatâs the old thinking in the Pentagon. Thatâs all that would help us win the Cold War in the 20th Century, but itâs not going to help us in the 21st, where technology is globalized and accelerating,â Roper said.âWe want to find ways where our military mission and our funding can help accelerate commercial markets too, so itâs competing on a much bigger stage. But we think itâs where we need to aspire to be, so that weâre playing the right catalyst role in this nation and with our partners around the world,â Roper said.There are several programs that startups can tap to get those federal dollars. Two of the easiest points of entry are through the AFWERX and its recently announced SpaceWERX arm focused entirely on space technology.âThese look like any tech company,â Roper told the audience at the TechCrunch event. âTheyâre outside our fence lines. Theyâre easy to walk intoâ¦ Now you donât have to know the mission, we will help you find the mission and the customer â the warfighter associated with it. Itâs a great model because it keeps the company focused on what they know best, which is their tech.âOver the last three years, Roper estimated that the AFWERX program had brought 2,300 companies into the Air Force and Space Force programs, and most of them had never worked with the military before, he said.Within AFWERX there are three programs that particularly relate to integrating startups into the procurement process, Roper said. One is the Spark program, which pairs military with private industry; one is the AFVentures program, which is designed to finance new innovations coming from private industry; and finally thereâs the Prime program, which helps commercialize and certify technologies.Roper pointed to the recent certification the Air Force gave to Joby Aviation for its flying cars. âSo thereâs a new military market that will hopefully generate a new commercial market,â Roper said.In 2021, the Prime program will expand to space technologies, according to Roper.As the demand for new tech grows, thereâs no shortage of innovations Roper would like to see from private industry. From new autonomous innovations that could help co-pilot spacecraft to technology for refueling and in-space maneuverability, and reusable equipment from boosters to other components that can bring costs down.Roper also acknowledged that the Pentagon has a long way to go to âhack the acquisition systemâ when it comes to dual-use technologies.Entrepreneurs have pointed out that one of the biggest obstacles to the growth of the commercial space industry has been the inability of the U.S. government to open up the technology for use by private industry.Roper hopes to change that. âWe want to use our military dollars, our mission, and potentially our certifications to help get you there without changing your core product,â he said. âIf you succeed as a commercial success, then we succeed as well, because now weâve got a great tech partner, that hopefully we can continue to come to to solve problems in future. The thing that weâll want to understand early on is how our military market and all those benefits I just mentioned, how can they help you get to commercial success? And what is it that we not need to do to pull you off that trajectory?âContracts with AFWERX are fixed-price and progress as companies hit certain milestones on the product roadmap. These orders increase incrementally as the technology proves itself, so a contract could start with the delivery of a prototype, then experimental usage, then a commercial contract, then broad adoption. âWhat weâre looking to do is see if you can move the ball forward on your technology, and if you do, then we do another contract. We step you up our process,â Roper said.Roper sees the project as nothing less than the evolution of the aerospace and defense industry.âWe have a lot of amazing companies today that helped build stealth bombers and space planes and all sorts of awesome stuff. Theyâre defense companies and we still need them,â Roper said. âWhat weâre hoping to help build in this century is a set of new companies that are just tech companies. Theyâre not defense, purely, and theyâre not commercial purely. Theyâre just technology companies and they do a bit of business on both sides.â",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,space startup funding,,,

For years, our understanding of cancer has focused on genetic mutations which permanently change the DNA code. But our research has shown that the way the DNA folds up can change which genes are read without altering the DNA code and this can be very important in determining how cancers behave.""The research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, Human Technopole in Milan, and the Queen Mary University of London.Epigenetic changes are involved in cancer's evolutionIn the first paper, the researchers collected 1,373 samples from 30 bowel cancers and looked at epigenetic changes as cancers grew. Their observations showed that epigenetic changes are common in cancerous cells, are heritable, and were present in cancer cells that had ""survival advantages.""The second paper intended to study why cancer cells within the same tumor can be different from one another. So, the researchers looked at the DNA sequence in diverse samples taken from different parts of the same tumor. The study revealed that less than two percent of ""changes in the DNA code in independent areas of a tumor were associated with changes in gene activity and variation in cancer cell characteristics throughout tumors is often governed by factors other than DNA mutations"".With these studies, scientists were able to track the influence of epigenetic control on the growth and evolution of bowel cancers. They also noted that epigenetic changes are heavily involved in cancer's evolution.""I hope our work will change the way we think about cancer and its treatment â and should ultimately affect the way patients are treated. Genetic testing for cancer mutations only gives us part of the picture about a personâs cancer â and is blind to âepigeneticâ changes to how genes are read. By testing for both genetic and epigenetic changes, we could, potentially, much more accurately predict which treatments will work best for a particular personâs cancer,"" said Graham.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,cancer research,,,

The site has focused, so far, strictly on cancer.Due to rules governing medical information and patientsâ privacy, questions posted to The Mednet cannot be case-based. They are situation-based only, meaning doctors donât share patient info, not even blurred photos.While the startupâs site, theMednet.org, has been in development for about 2.5 years, the company officially launched today and is part of the latest batch of the Y Combinator accelerator. Co-founders Nadine Housri, a radiation oncologist, and her brother CEO Samir Housri told TechCrunch their company has raised some grant funding and equity funding to date, including from YC and The Hope Foundation.Results on the platform have been hope-inspiring so far to Nadine Housri, she said. Cancer experts regularly help each other there to figure out complex issues that will immediately impact their patients. For example, a new study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine came out, and an investigator in that study, Howard Sandler, answered questions about it on The Mednet, helping other doctors decide whether or not to use hormones, along with radiation, to treat a prostate cancer patient.His study had found that adding hormonal therapy to radiation treatment improved the average long-term survival of men with prostate cancer who have had their prostate gland removed. But of course, the science was complicated and the regimen wasnât recommended for any or every patient.Nadine Housri said when theMednet.org first launched, she wasnât sure if oncologists, professors, department chairs and other cancer researchers would be too busy to give away their expertise on some new online platform. But, she explained, âExperts are willing to give away info to random people here because they constantly field phone calls, emails and answer questions at medical conferences anyway. One reason you go into academia or medicine is to have a great impact on people, on your community. On Mednet experts can put their answers out there, clear up misconceptions on research and clinical practices.âLike many startups, The Mednet has spent its early years focused on building an expert user community, and becoming a vital resource to users, as well. The Housris said their network will always be accessible for free to doctors, and they want it to serve as a knowledge base for medicine broadly. The company plans to expand beyond oncology over the long run.It is exploring the potential to generate revenue by helping companies raise awareness of and enroll patients in their clinical trials. It could also aggregate some of its expert answers into automated decision support for clinics, the founder said. Depending on its monetization strategy, The Mednet could compete with online resources for physicians like Figure 1 or UpToDate over the long run. But when it comes to medicine, there probably canât be too many tools to help people get good, up-to-date information.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,cancer quoratype platform,,,

So it is important to note that although everyone in this study was hospitalized, vaccinated individuals were less likely to be severely ill or die, suggesting that you are likely to have far less severe consequences if vaccinated,â said Dr. Annette Regan, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health assistant professor of epidemiology and lead author of the peer-reviewed research, published in the October edition of The Lancet Infectious Diseases. âThis is an important point, especially in light of the upcoming influenza season coupled with ongoing COVID-19 activity, both this season and into the future.âGlobally, influenza contributes to 9.5 million hospitalizations, 81.5 million hospital days, and 145,000 deaths each year. Vaccination offers the best method of preventing influenza illness, reducing illness in the general population by 40â60%, experts say.Specifically, The Lancet analysis found that three groups routinely targeted for influenza vaccination experiences less severe illness. Children who had received only part of their first series of influenza vaccines had 36% lower chances of being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and children who had fully completed their first series of influenza vaccines had 48% lower chances of admission to ICU compared to unvaccinated children, the researchers found.The study â âSeverity of influenza illness associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among hospitalized patients in four South American countriesâ â is the product of an international team of researchers from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay, and drew on data from all four South American countries over a period of seven years. Data were obtained through the Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean, influenza (REVELAC-i) which is coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).âAlthough several studies have reported drops in influenza illness following influenza vaccination, the results have focused predominantly on adults in the United States, and this study aimed to evaluate the severity of influenza illness by vaccination status in a broad range of age groups, and across multiple South American countries,â said Dr. Marta Von Horoch, a co-author who serves as coordinator of the National Immunization Program in Paraguay. âWe were very pleased to work with our partners in the U.S. and across the continent, and these findings demonstrate, quite clearly, the importance of influenza vaccination for children and adults, no matter where they live.âThe study â the first-ever on this scale in South America - examined influenza-related hospitalization rates and outcomes across all four countries from 2013-19. Specifically, the analysts reviewed the outcomes for some 2,747 patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza virus infection, in three age groups â children aged 6â24 months, adults aged 18â64 years, and adults aged 65 years or older.Given the reality that vaccination rates have fallen, in the U.S. and globally during the COVID-19 pandemic, including among children, the findings should help make clear the benefits of timely, pro-active immunization campaigns to the public, the researchers said.âWith influenza season approaching this winter and influenza vaccines now available, these results highlight the importance of getting vaccinated for flu for anyone six months of age or older â as CDC recommends,â Regan said. âIt is critical that healthcare providers and the public understand the risks of missing out on vaccinations â it is so much better to prevent a serious illness than to suffer through it, for the patient and everyone in their community.â===================================================",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,effectiveness of flu vaccine,,,

Chan School of Public Health.âBefore our study, research on how political ideology affects COVID-19 looked solely at votersâ political lean; we expanded on that research to investigate associations of COVID-19 outcomes with the voting records of federal elected representatives and the concentration of political party power at the state level. The point is not partisan analysis, but rather to understand how politics, and political polarization, are affecting population health,â said Nancy Krieger, professor of social epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and corresponding author of the study.The study was published online in the Lancet Regional Health â Americas on November 1, 2022.Little prior research had looked at COVID-19 health outcomes in relation to U.S. congressional districts. The researchers analyzed data on COVID-19 mortality rates and stress on ICU capacity from April 2021 to March 2022, a period when adult vaccines were available, across all 435 U.S. Congressional districts. They examined three exposure variables that had not been used previously in COVID-19 research: the political ideology of U.S. elected members of Congress, as measured by their overall voting records; their votes on four key COVID-19 relief bills; and âstate trifectas,â the concentration of political power at the State level, defined as the governor, House, and Senate, all under the control of one party.The study found that the higher the exposure to conservatism on each political metric, the higher the COVID-19 age-standardized mortality rates, even after adjusting for the districtâs social characteristics, votersâ political lean, and vaccination rates. The same relationship held true for stress on hospital ICU capacity.For COVID-19 mortality rates, for example, models controlling for political and social metrics and vaccination rates showed that Republican trifectas were, respectively, 11% higher and conservative voter political lean 26% higher.âOur study offers new approaches to analyzing political determinants of COVID-19 metricsâsuch as mortality, illness, or vaccination ratesâas one component of analyzing political accountability for populationsâ COVID-19 burdens. It also points to the importance of analyzing political metrics in relation to population health outcomes more generally,â said Krieger.There was no funding for the study from any agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sector.âRelationship of political ideology of US federal and state elected officials and key COVID pandemic outcomes following vaccine rollout to adults: April 2021-March 2022,â Nancy Krieger, Christian Testa, Jarvis T.

This yearâs report, published in Cancer, also places focus on pancreatic cancer.Knowledge in the fight against cancerCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is expected that the number of new cancer cases globally will grow to 27.5 million, with 16.3 million cancer deaths, by 2040. Breast, lung, colon and prostate cancers are the four most common cancers worldwide, accounting for approximately 40% of all new cases collectively.In the US, annual reports on the statistical trends in cancer cases have been published since 1998 as part of a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR).These reports examine a plethora of data, analyzing trends in cancer incidence, mortality and survival by cancer type, sex, age and racial/ethnic groups.The current report combined information about race and ethnicity to create five mutually exclusive groups: nonâHispanic White (White), nonâHispanic Black (Black), nonâHispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), nonâHispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and Hispanic (of any race).Additionally, data for the various groups analyzed in the current report were collected at time points ranging from 2001â2019 â therefore, it is important to note that all data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic.Cancer incidence ratesOverall incidence rates per 100,000 individuals were 497 for males and 431 for females from 2014â2018.API and Black males had the lowest and highest incidence rates among men, respectively, and API and AI/AN females also had the lowest and highest rates respectively for women.However, incidence varied across 18 of the most common cancer types included in this report:For males â incidence rates for three of these cancers increased (including pancreas and kidney), seven were stable (including prostate) and eight decreased (including lung and larynx).For females â incidence rates of seven cancers increased (including melanoma, liver and breast), four cancers were stable (including uterine) and seven decreased (including thyroid and ovary).Additionally, for breast cancer â the most common cancer among adolescents and young adults (15â39 years of age) â the incidence rate increased by 1.0% per year on average between 2010 and 2018.Mortality ratesCombining data from males and females showed that the decline in overall death rates from cancer steepened from 2001 to 2019, decreasing by 2.1% per year. Similar trends in overall death rates were also observed in each of the racial/ethnic groups analyzed in the report.Data from adolescents and young adults showed a decrease in death rates by 3% per year between 2001 and 2005, however, this rate of decline slowed to around 0.9% per year thereafter.Racial and ethnic disparitiesThe report also highlighted racial and ethnic disparities, in both the incidence rates (2014â2018) and death rates (2015â2019) across many cancer types, as summarized in the table below.Type of cancer Incidence and death rates Bladder cancer In White, Black, ApI and Hispanic males, incidence of bladder cancer decreased. Incidence increased among AI/ AN males. Uterine cancer Incidence rates remained stable in White females but increased in every other racial/ethnic group. Lung, breast and colon cancer Incidence rates decreased for females in all racial/ethnic groups. For AI/ AN females, death rates for breast cancer increased but remained stable for colon cancer. Breast cancer death rates remained stable among API females. Prostate cancer Death rates decreased for API, AI/AN and Hispanic males. Rates remained stable for Black and White males.Lisa C. Richardson MD, director of the CDCâs Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, elaborated on these findings in a press release: âFactors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status should not play a role in peopleâs ability to be healthy or determine how long they live. [The] CDC works with its public health partners â within and outside the government â to address these disparities and advance health equity through a range of key initiatives, including programs, research and policy initiatives. We know that we can meet this challenge together and create an America where people are free of cancer.âA special focus on pancreatic cancerThe pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach which produces enzymes that help digest food, as well as hormones like insulin and glucagon that regulate our blood sugar levels.Cancer of the pancreas is commonly diagnosed once it is already in its advanced stages â early pancreatic cancers often have vague symptoms or even none at all. For these reasons, the combined five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is just 5â10%.In the current report, the researchers explain that diagnoses of pancreatic cancer account for around 3% of new cancer cases â however, it also accounts for 8% of cancer deaths.Nevertheless, the report also highlights significant steps forward for the survival rates of certain types of pancreatic cancer. Between 2001 and 2017, one-year relative survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors increased from 65.9% to 84.2%, and there was also an increase from 24% to 36.7% for patients with adenocarcinomas.âPancreatic cancer incidence and survival reflect both the underlying risk of disease as well as the difficulty of diagnosing pancreatic cancer at a treatable stage,â said Betsy A. Kohler, M.P.H, NAACCR executive director. âAs advancements in screening technology and effective treatments for early-stage disease become available, we are hopeful for greater improvements in pancreatic cancer survival, which historically has been a particularly lethal cancer type.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,decline in US cancer deaths,,,

The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio either to receive an invitation to undergo a single screening colonoscopy (the invited group) or to receive no invitation or screening (the usual-care group). The primary end points were the risks of colorectal cancer and related death, and the secondary end point was death from any cause.ResultsFollow-up data were available for 84,585 participants in Poland, Norway, and Sweden â 28,220 in the invited group, 11,843 of whom (42.0%) underwent screening, and 56,365 in the usual-care group. A total of 15 participants had major bleeding after polyp removal. No perforations or screening-related deaths occurred within 30 days after colonoscopy. During a median follow-up of 10 years, 259 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the invited group as compared with 622 cases in the usual-care group. In intention-to-screen analyses, the risk of colorectal cancer at 10 years was 0.98% in the invited group and 1.20% in the usual-care group, a risk reduction of 18% (risk ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.93). The risk of death from colorectal cancer was 0.28% in the invited group and 0.31% in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.16). The number needed to invite to undergo screening to prevent one case of colorectal cancer was 455 (95% CI, 270 to 1429). The risk of death from any cause was 11.03% in the invited group and 11.04% in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.04).ConclusionsIn this randomized trial, the risk of colorectal cancer at 10 years was lower among participants who were invited to undergo screening colonoscopy than among those who were assigned to no screening.

This site features several honeybee hives that are used for research. In the event of overcrowding of a beehive, the original queen leaves the hive with a fraction of the workers (on average around 12,000 bees) (), resulting in occasional swarming events near PG measuring equipment at our study site. When honeybees swarm, they usually cluster on a limb of a tree for several days while scout bees search for suitable cavities to nest in. After an appropriate nest is found, the swarm will collectively migrate. An electric field monitor was placed near the swarm. A camera (AKASO V50Ã, 30 fps) was positioned next to the field mill with an upward orientation to record the swarm in flight ( Figure 1 B). A second electric field monitor was placed in an open field, 50m away from the other electric field monitor and swarm to ascertain any dynamics in the electric field monitor was caused by the presence of a swarm. For about three minutes, part of the swarm passed over the electric field monitor.Modelling of electric fields was performed using finite element analysis within COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® v. 5.4 (COMSOL AB, Stockholm, Sweden) utilising the âElectrostaticsâ interface within the âAC/DCâ module. The three-dimensional geometry consisted of a 60 m Ã 60 m x 40 m (length, width, height) cuboid within which the model operated. The two runs made for differently sized and charged ellipsoids represented insect swarms of honeybees and locusts. The honeybee swarm was represented as an ellipsoid with semi-axes 2 m x 1 m x 0.5 m ellipsoid at a height of 3 m, and the locust swarm an ellipsoid with semi-axes 4 m x 1 m x 1 m at a height of 15 m. The swarm charge was distributed evenly as a volume charge within the ellipsoids, with the total charge calculated respectively as the sum of 500 bees each carrying +100 pC (order of magnitude from ()) and 1000 locusts carrying +850 pC each. An approximately 8 m tall deciduous tree was included in each model to provide scale and an electrical landmark for comparison (). The remainder of the model domain was assigned as air. The upper surface of this air column was given an electrical potential typical of a 40 m altitude in fair-weather conditions (+4 kV), with the bottom surface defined as zero potential, equivalent to the established surface (first meter) atmospheric potential gradient of 100 V/m (). The surface of the tree was also defined as ground (). Meshing of the geometry was physics-controlled, set to âextremely fineâ. The relative permittivity, Îµ, was defined as Îµ= 12 for living trees (), Îµ= 1 for air, and Îµ= 80 inside the insect swarms (likely an overestimate, based on the permittivity of water). Model outputs presented for this study were produced by plotting data from two-dimensional slices through the centre of the three-dimensional dataset.Quantification and statistical analysisThe video recording capturing the swarm event was cropped to a 500 by 220-pixel window to remove foreground objects obstructing the view of the swarm and was analysed using a custom script in Python 3.8.1. The video was converted to black and white pixels such that the background was white and any non-background objects, comprising the swarm, were black. The ratio of black to white pixels was calculated for each frame of the video resulting in a proxy measure for bee density, defined as relative pixel density here. At points during the swarmâs passage, flowering heads of grass entered the frame, increasing the relative pixel density. Such affected data were therefore removed. The relative pixel densities were filtered by a moving mean over 10 data points (corresponding to 0.5 s) to emphasise the long-term trend of the data. These data were compared to data collected by the electric field monitor using cross correlation and linear regression in PAST v.4. Since insect charges can be expected to influence PGs directly, data were aligned (zero lag) based on the highest cross correlation coefficient.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,electric charge of insects,,,
other news sites825,https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/969866,Bats protect young trees from insect damagewith three times fewer bugs,"URBANA, Ill. â Bats help keep forests growing. Without bats to hold their populations in check, insects that munch on tree seedlings go wild, doing three to nine times more damage than when bats are on the scene. Thatâs according to a groundbreaking new study from the University of Illinois.âA lot of folks associate bats with caves. But as it turns out, the habitat you could really associate with almost every bat species in North America is forest. And this is true globally. Forests are just really important to bats,â says Joy OâKeefe, study co-author and assistant professor and wildlife extension specialist in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. âWe wanted to ask the question: Are bats important to forests? And in this study, we've demonstrated they are.âOther researchers have demonstrated batsâ insect-control services in crop fields and tropical forest systems, but no one has shown their benefits in temperate forests until now.âIt's especially important for us to learn how bats affect forests, given that bats are declining due to diseases like white-nose syndrome or collisions with wind turbines. This type of work can reveal the long-term consequences of bat declines,â says Elizabeth Beilke, postdoctoral researcher and lead author on the study.The research team built giant mesh-enclosed structures in an Indiana forest to exclude the eight bat species that frequent the area, including two federally threatened or endangered species. The mesh openings were large enough to allow insects free movement in and out, but not flying bats. Every morning and evening for three summers, Beilke opened and closed the mesh sides and tops of the structures to ensure birds had daytime access to the plots. That way, she could be sure she was isolating the impacts of bats.Beilke then measured the number of insects on oak and hickory seedlings in the forest understory, as well as the amount of defoliation per seedling. Because she erected an equal number of box frames without mesh, Beilke was able to compare insect density and defoliation with and without bats.Overall, the researchers found three times as many insects and five times more defoliation on the seedlings when bats were excluded than in control plots that allowed bats in each night. When analyzed separately, oaks experienced nine times more defoliation and hickories three times more without bats.âWe know from other research that oaks and hickories are ecologically important, with acorns and hickory nuts providing food sources for wildlife and the trees acting as hosts to native insects. Bats use both oaks and hickories as roosts, and now we see they may be using them as sources of prey insects, as well. Our data suggest bats and oaks have a mutually beneficial relationship,â Beilke says.While insect pressure was intense in plots without bat predation, the seedlings didnât succumb to their injuries. But the researchers say long-term bat declines could prove fatal for the baby trees.âWe were observing sublethal levels of defoliation, but we know defoliation makes seedlings more vulnerable to death from other factors such as drought or fungal diseases. It would be hard to track the fate of these trees over 90 years, but I think a natural next step is to examine the impact of persistent low levels of defoliation on these seedlings,â Beilke says. âTo what extent does repeated defoliation reduce their competitive ability and contribute to oak declines?âThe researchers point out that birds, many of which share the same insect diets as bats, are also declining. While they specifically sought to isolate batsâ impact on forest trees, the researchers are confident insect density and defoliation rates would have been higher if they had excluded both birds and bats in their study. In fact, similar exclusion studies focusing on birds failed to account for bats in their study designs, leaving mesh enclosures up all night.âWhen we were initially working on the proposal for this research, we looked at 37 different bird exclusion studies, across agriculture and forest systems. We found nearly all of them had made this mistake. Most of them had not opened or removed their treatment plots to bats,â Beilke says.In other words, before Beilkeâs study, birds were getting at least partial credit for work bats were doing in the shadows.Clearly, both types of winged predators are important for forest health in temperate systems. And, according to OâKeefe, that makes these studies even more critical to inform forest management.âI think itâs important to stress the value of this type of experimental work with bats, to really try to dig into what their ecosystem services are in a deliberate manner. While we can probably extrapolate out and say bats are important in other types of forest, I wouldn't discount the value of doing the same kind of work in other systems, especially if there are questions about certain insect or tree species and how bats affect them. So rather than extrapolating out across the board, let's do the work to try to figure out how bats are benefiting plants,â she says. âAnd before they're gone, hopefully.âThe article, âBats reduce insect density and defoliation in temperate forests: an exclusion experiment,â is published in Ecology [DOI: 10.1002/ecy.3903].

techcrunch834,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-vine-reboot-poll/,Chief TwitElon Musksignals interest in reviving Vine,"New Twitter owner Elon Musk has signalled a potential interest in reviving Vine, the social video app Twitter gave up on six years ago.In the last few hours the self styled âChief Twitâ) has tweeted a yes/no poll to his 112.4 million followers â pithily positing: âBring back Vine?â.The question â whether serious product idea or another Elon flight of fancy/âtrollercoasterâ tweet â quickly drew millions of votes (most in favor) and thousands of responding tweets. This engagement in turn garnered a bit of additional attention from Musk who responded to some of his followersâ questions/suggestions on the social video topic.In response to a tweet from YouTuber, Mr Beast â which jokily referenced TikTok â Musk struck a serious tone, asking: âWhat could we do to make it better than TikTok?âHe also took the time to publicly agree with another Twitter user â who had chimed in to opine that âvideo shouldnât be a separate appâ but should rather be âwithin Twitterâ. That observation earned the âTesla Owners Silicon Valleyâ account an â100â emoji reply from Musk, to signal (apparent) total approval of the idea that any Vine/video revival should be a feature inside Twitter, not a standalone product.So make of that what you will.The Vine revival poll (plus Muskâs wider engagement to the chatter it generated) could imply his attention to the topic of video is, at least, genuine â although itâs anyoneâs guess whether a Vine reboot is actually being seriously considered, or what that would even mean beyond reviving a brand name if his plan would include a major feature set makeover. (Twitterâs press team did not respond to requests for comment.)Itâs equally plausible Musk is doing the equivalent of throwing spaghetti at a wall and seeing which/if bits stick. Or heâs just bored in the small hours and thought heâd bounce another shower thought off-of his fanbase. And/or fancied indulging in a spot of âlazy webâ brainstorming outsourcing.As ever where Elon is concerned, the usual caveats apply.Still, Vineâs demise was a pretty self-defeating chapter in Twitterâs company history â so a reboot could offer Musk the chance to rewrite that particular bit of the script and claim incoming hero status with former Vine fans.Bring back Vine? â Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 31, 2022At the time of writing, more than 2.8M votes had been cast in Muskâs poll about bringing back Vine, with a strong majority (69.4%) voting for a return â although the poll still has 14 hours left to run.Twitter acquired the short form video platform Twitter back in 2013. But, in typical clown car fashion, the company ended up squandering the opportunity to build the fledgling social video platform into a TikTok-style juggernaut, after then-CEO Jack Dorsey opted to ditch the app a few short years later.The shuttering of Vine earned Twitter the baldest of subtweets from Vineâs founder, Rus Yusupov â who had this straight-up warning to other entrepreneurs at the time: âDonât sell your company!âIronically enough (given itâs *Twitter* thatâs now been sold), Yusupov has chipped into the Musk-initiated chatter around reviving Vine â offering up the (non-serious?) suggestion that Vine should have â69 second videosâ.69 second videos â Rus (@rus) October 31, 2022While Vine launched with hyper short videos (of up to 6 seconds), the max upload length was later expanded to 140 seconds â and social video behemoth TikTok has gone way beyond that and even began letting its users upload videos of up to 10mins long earlier this year â so 69 second videos is probably just an attempt to grab Muskâs attention (with a puerile joke), not a serious product suggestion.Regardless, the interaction does indicate that Yusupov is watching whatâs unfolding at Twitter with interest.And thatâs relevant because this is also not his first foray into tweeting at Musk about Vine: His public timeline remains topped with an earlier tweet â from April 25 â when he posted a photo of himself with the (then) would-be Twitter owner, asking Musk a (rhetorical?) question: âHey @elonmusk was this meeting about saving Vine? I forgetâ¦ âPublic response from Musk to that tweet there came none. But the Chief Twit is king of keeping everyone else guessing over what heâs actually going to do next â so, again, you canât read much/anything into his public silence back then. (Musk did also try to wiggle out of buying Twitter entirely prior to agreeing to closing the deal last week; ergo, there have been a fair few cycles of ups and downs even just over these past few months.)Hey â¦@elonmuskâ© was this meeting about saving Vine? I forgetâ¦. pic.twitter.com/FgmxIfS8Vx â Rus (@rus) April 25, 2022If Yusupov and Musk have been talking about a Vine reboot, the formerâs response to another Twitter userâs question last month â when author Eli Pariser asked the Twitterverse for âthe smart take on why Vine died even though it was basically TikTokâ â might offer a few clues about what any discussions might have focused on.The Vine founder responded to Pariser by lamenting over not having built the right features âin timeâ â likely linked to another blindspot he conceded around not understanding the importance of building on trends like lip-sync video â as well as blaming the appâs demise on a failure to help creators monetize.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,revival of vine,,,
techcrunch841,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/japans-e-commerce-leader-rakuten-gets-into-agriculture-tech/,Japan s e commerce leader Rakuten gets into agriculture tech,"Rakuten may be cutting back its e-commerce business in Europe and Southeast Asia, but, at home in Japan, the internet giant is stepping into a new field â quite literally â after it invested in an agriculture tech company for the first.Weeks after withdrawing e-commerce sites from the UK, Spain and Austria, Rakuten is putting an undisclosed sum into seven-year-old Telefarm, which operates a platform that promotes organic farmers in Japan. Most notably, Telefarm connects consumers with organic farmers and their produce, while it also helps with processes such as storage, transportation, manufacturing, and even the hiring of farm workers.Itâs an interesting move for Rakuten, which is best known for its online shopping empire in Japan, where it has also expanding into financial, a mobile service and more. Rakutenâs presence outside of Japan has been less successful. While it has invested in a range of U.S. companies including Lyft and Pinterest, and it has acquired firms like chat app Viber, video platform Viki, and U.S. coupon site Ebates, the company has withdrawn from less lucrative regions as part of a new strategy.Organic farming, or organic products, could be a part of that new focus in Japan. Rakuten said that this invest in Telefarm would lead to it launching new products in its domestic market.With the working population in the agricultural industry steadily declining, coupled with Japanâs aging population, labor shortages in the industry are becoming a serious problem, and the amount of deserted arable land is increasing every year. Farmers are facing serious challenges, with initial investment and unstable revenues posing obstacles for new farmers, and the securement of stable sales channels and a shortage of successors presenting challenges for established, small-scale farmers. Going forward, Rakuten will explore the development of new services in the agriculture field through the internet, while aiming to contribute to regional revitalization through the utilization of deserted arable land and support for new farmers.Beyond scaling back parts of its global business, Rakuten recently embraced drones â running its first trial on a golf course â and earlier this month it struck an agreement to bring a selection of premium Japanese goods to China via Kaola, the cross-border e-commerce service operated by Chinese internet giant NetEase.",5.0,5_farmers_farming_technology_meat,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,company news,,,

other news sites863,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/26/physics-particles-physicists#comments,No one in physics dares say sobut the race to invent new particles is pointless,"Imagine you go to a zoology conference. The first speaker talks about her 3D model of a 12-legged purple spider that lives in the Arctic. Thereâs no evidence it exists, she admits, but itâs a testable hypothesis, and she argues that a mission should be sent off to search the Arctic for spiders.The second speaker has a model for a flying earthworm, but it flies only in caves. Thereâs no evidence for that either, but he petitions to search the worldâs caves. The third one has a model for octopuses on Mars. Itâs testable, he stresses.Kudos to zoologists, Iâve never heard of such a conference. But almost every particle physics conference has sessions just like this, except they do it with more maths. It has become common among physicists to invent new particles for which there is no evidence, publish papers about them, write more papers about these particlesâ properties, and demand the hypothesis be experimentally tested. Many of these tests have actually been done, and more are being commissioned as we speak. It is wasting time and money.Since the 1980s, physicists have invented an entire particle zoo, whose inhabitants carry names like preons, sfermions, dyons, magnetic monopoles, simps, wimps, wimpzillas, axions, flaxions, erebons, accelerons, cornucopions, giant magnons, maximons, macros, wisps, fips, branons, skyrmions, chameleons, cuscutons, planckons and sterile neutrinos, to mention just a few. We even had a (luckily short-lived) fad of âunparticlesâ.All experiments looking for those particles have come back empty-handed, in particular those that have looked for particles that make up dark matter, a type of matter that supposedly fills the universe and makes itself noticeable by its gravitational pull. However, we do not know that dark matter is indeed made of particles; and even if it is, to explain astrophysical observations one does not need to know details of the particlesâ behaviour. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) hasnât seen any of those particles either, even though, before its launch, many theoretical physicists were confident it would see at least a few.Talk to particle physicists in private, and many of them will admit they do not actually believe those particles exist. They justify their work by claiming that it is good practice, or that every once in a while one of them accidentally comes up with an idea that is useful for something else. An army of typewriting monkeys may also sometimes produce a useful sentence. But is this a good strategy?Experimental particle physicists know of the problem, and try to distance themselves from what their colleagues in theory development do. At the same time, they profit from it, because all those hypothetical particles are used in grant proposals to justify experiments. And so the experimentalists keep their mouths shut, too. This leaves people like me, who have left the field â I now work in astrophysics â as the only ones able and willing to criticise the situation.There are many factors that have contributed to this sad decline of particle physics. Partly the problem is social: most people who work in the field (I used to be one of them) genuinely believe that inventing particles is good procedure because itâs what they have learned, and what all their colleagues are doing.But I believe the biggest contributor to this trend is a misunderstanding of Karl Popperâs philosophy of science, which, to make a long story short, demands that a good scientific idea has to be falsifiable. Particle physicists seem to have misconstrued this to mean that any falsifiable idea is also good science.In the past, predictions for new particles were correct only when adding them solved a problem with the existing theories. For example, the currently accepted theory of elementary particles â the Standard Model â doesnât require new particles; it works just fine the way it is. The Higgs boson, on the other hand, was required to solve a problem. The antiparticles that Paul Dirac predicted were likewise necessary to solve a problem, and so were the neutrinos that were predicted by Wolfgang Pauli. The modern new particles donât solve any problems.In some cases, the new particlesâ task is to make a theory more aesthetically appealing, but in many cases their purpose is to fit statistical anomalies. Each time an anomaly is reported, particle physicists will quickly write hundreds of papers about how new particles allegedly explain the observation. This behaviour is so common they even have a name for it: âambulance-chasingâ, after the anecdotal strategy of lawyers to follow ambulances in the hope of finding new clients.Ambulance-chasing is a good strategy to further oneâs career in particle physics. Most of those papers pass peer review and get published because they are not technically wrong. And since ambulance-chasers cite each otherâs papers, they can each rack up hundreds of citations quickly. But itâs a bad strategy for scientific progress. After the anomaly has disappeared, those papers will become irrelevant.This procedure of inventing particles and then ruling them out has been going on so long that there are thousands of tenured professors with research groups who make a living from this. It has become generally accepted practice in the physics community. No one even questions whether it makes sense. At least not in public.I believe there are breakthroughs waiting to be made in the foundations of physics; the world needs technological advances more than ever before, and now is not the time to idle around inventing particles, arguing that even a blind chicken sometimes finds a grain. As a former particle physicist, it saddens me to see that the field has become a factory for useless academic papers.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,on value of particle physics research today,,,

Just as its creators had hoped, the multibillion-dollar machine is flawlessly ""unfolding the universe"" by revealing cosmic light we cannot see with our own eyes -- and its excellent results make even the most unlikely of stargazers feel alive.Because of this gold-plated telescope, Twitter went wild one day over a bleary red dot. For 48 hours, people worldwide were gawking at a galaxy born shortly after the birth of time itself.

Please check your email and try againBut here's the thing.Amid personal awe, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warn that we ought to consider one crucial scientific consequence of having a superhero telescope.If the JWST is like a zero-to-100 'scope upgrade, they wonder, is it possible our science models need a zero-to-100 reboot, too? Are the datasets scientists have been using for decades unable to match the device's power and therefore falling short in revealing what it's trying to tell us?""The data we will be getting from the JWST will be incredible, but ... our insights will be limited if our models don't match it in quality,"" Clara Sousa-Silva, a quantum astrochemist at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, told CNET.And, according to a new study of which she's a co-author, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, the answer is yes.More specifically, this paper suggests some of the light-parsing tools scientists normally use to understand exoplanet atmospheres aren't totally equipped to deal with the JWST's exceptional light data. In the long run, such a hindrance may impact the most massive JWST quest of all: the hunt for extraterrestrial life.""Currently, the model we use to decrypt spectral information is not up to par with the precision and quality of data we have from the James Webb telescope,"" Prajwal Niraula, graduate student at MIT's department of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ""We need to up our game.""NASAHere's one way to think about the conundrum.Imagine pairing the newest, most powerful Xbox console with the very first iteration of a TV. (Yes, I know the extreme hypothetical nature of my scenario). The Xbox would be trying to give the TV awesome high-resolution, colorful, beautiful graphics to show us -- but the TV wouldn't have the capacity to compute any of it.I wouldn't be surprised if the TV straight up exploded. But the point is you wouldn't know what the Xbox is trying to provide for you, unless you get an equally high-res TV.Similarly, in the vein of exoplanet discoveries, scientists feed a bunch of deep-space light, or photon, data into models that test for ""opacity."" Opacity measures how easily photons pass through a material and differs depending on things like light wavelength, material temperature and pressure.This means every such interaction leaves behind a telltale signature of what the photon's properties are, and therefore, when it comes to exoplanets, what kind of chemical atmosphere those photons passed through to get to the light detector. That's how scientists sort of reverse-calculate, from light data, what an exoplanet's atmosphere is composed of.In this case, the detector liaison lies on the James Webb Space Telescope -- but in the team's new study, after putting the most commonly used opacity model to the test, the researchers saw JWST light data hitting what they call an ""accuracy wall.""The model wasn't sensitive enough to parse stuff like whether a planet has an atmospheric temperature of 300 or 600 Kelvin, the researchers say, or whether a certain gas takes up 5% or 25% of the atmosphere. Such a difference is not only statistically significant, but per Niraula, also ""matters in order for us to constrain planetary formation mechanisms and reliably identify biosignatures.""That is, evidence of alien life.""We need to work on our interpretive tools,"" Sousa-Silva said, ""so that we don't find ourselves seeing something amazing through JWST but not knowing how to interpret it.""T. Treu/GLASS-JWST/NASA/CSA/ESA/STScIFurther, the team also found its models kind of disguising its uncertain readings. A few adjustments can easily paper over uncertainty, deeming results a good fit when they're incorrect.""We found that there are enough parameters to tweak, even with a wrong model, to still get a good fit, meaning you wouldn't know that your model is wrong and what it's telling you is wrong,"" Julien de Wit, assistant professor at MIT's EAPS and study co-author, said in a statement.Going forward, the team urges opacity models be improved to accommodate our spectacular JWST revelations â especially calling for crossover studies between astronomy and spectroscopy.""There is so much that could be done if we knew perfectly how light and matter interact,"" Niraula says. ""We know that well enough around the Earth's conditions, but as soon as we move to different types of atmospheres, things change, and that's a lot of data, with increasing quality, that we risk misinterpreting.""De Wit compares the current opacity model to the ancient language translation tool the Rosetta Stone, explaining that so far, this Rosetta Stone has been doing OK, such as with the Hubble Space Telescope.""But now that we're going to the next level with Webb's precision,"" the researcher said, ""our translation process will prevent us from catching important subtleties, such as those making the difference between a planet being habitable or not.""As Sousa-Silva puts it, ""it's a call to improve our models, so that we will not miss the subtleties of data.""",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,need for better models,,,

But until the full report is released to the public in mid-2023, NASA says everything will be kept a secret.UAPs get their classification due to their puzzling behavior in the sky, which doesnât fit into the known behavior of aircraft or known natural phenomena.

The probe itself seemed to be in good shape, with a signal that's still strong enough to beam back information, and nothing was triggering its fault protection systems that would put it in ""safe mode."" According to NASA, the Voyager team has not only figured the problem out since then â it has also solved the issue.Turns out we're getting jumbled data here on Earth, because the probe's attitude articulation and control system (AACS) has been sending back information through an onboard computer that had stopped working years ago. The computer was corrupting the data before it even went out. Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd said that when her team suspected that this was the issue, they implemented a low-risk fix: They commanded the AACS to send its data through the probe's working computer again.While the engineers have fixed the glitch, they've yet to figure out why the AACS started routing information through the old computer in the first place. They believe it was triggered by a faulty command by another onboard computer, which was itself triggered by an underlying issue with the spacecraft. Voyager's engineers will keep looking for the problem's root case, NASA said, but they don't think it will have a huge effect on the spacecraft's operations.Turn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from Engadget You can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu.

But with its latest set of branding and logo guidelines itâs going even further, simplifying its legacy branding and signaling the end of the decade-old SuperSpeed branding. If the name doesnât ring any bells, then thatâs probably because you (like most other people) simply referred to it by its USB 3 version number. Alongside it, the USB-IF is also ditching USB4 as a consumer-facing brand name.An old Certified SuperSpeed logo. Photo by The VergeThe changes came into effect this quarter, and could start appearing on products and packaging as early as by the end of the year, according to the USB-IFâs president and chief operating officer Jeff Ravencraft. But any products that were certified prior to the shift will still be able to use the old brand names.In a Zoom call, Ravencraft explains that the new branding is designed to prioritize what the standards can actually do, rather than the USB version theyâre based on. âAs we started to update our branding we did a lot of focus group studies with many different types of consumers,â he tells The Verge, âand none of those people understood the messaging and the branding, and they donât understand revision control or spec names.âThe new range of USB packaging and device logos, no âSuperSpeedâ or âUSB4â branding in sight. Image: USB-IFâWhat consumers want to know â and what we learned â is they want to know two things: Whatâs the highest data performance level the product can achieve? And whatâs the highest power level I can get or drive from this product,â he says. âThatâs all they want to know.âSo, instead of referring to USB devices by a version number or vague name like âSuperSpeed,â the USB-IF wants companies to use branding that reflects these all-important specs. âSuperSpeed USB 5Gbpsâ and âSuperSpeed USB 10Gbpsâ are now just âUSB 5Gbpsâ and âUSB 10Gbpsâ respectively, while âUSB4 40Gbpsâ and âUSB4 20Gbpsâ are becoming âUSB 40Gbpsâ and âUSB 20Gbps.âBranding for certified USB Type-C cables is also being updated. Rather than simply listing their data transfer speeds, cables will also (for the most part) have to list the charging wattage theyâre capable of carrying. So a cable canât just be branded as being a 40Gbps cable as with last yearâs guidelines, itâll now also have to list a charging speed like 60W or 240W.Itâs important to note that using these brandnames is far from mandatory. They apply to USB devices certified by the USB-IF, but these only cover a fraction of the total number of USB products out on the market. Thatâs because unlike specifications like Thunderbolt 4, which manufacturers have to license directly from Intel, USB is an open standard that anyone is free to use. Thatâs allowed it to become as ubiquitous as it is, but means the USB-IF is all-but-powerless to stop companies from building USB products that donât use the specification properly. And no oneâs going to stop them from branding a device as USB4 Version 2, or offer no branding at all.Certified cables will now need to show maximum wattage alongside data transfer speeds, unless theyâre using the older Hi-Speed standard. Image: USB-IFThe underlying USB version numbers arenât going anywhere. But while manufacturers and OEMs still have to wrap their heads around specs like USB4 Gen3x2 and USB4 Version 2, the USB-IF doesnât want customers to care what version number their devices or cables are using. Yes, USB4 Version 2.0 is a terrible name, but the idea is that most consumers should end up seeing it branded as USB 80Gbps.This branding applies regardless of the specific USB port being used, whether itâs old fashioned USB Type-A, microUSB, or USB Type-C. But naturally the higher performance logos will only be applicable to USB Type-C, which is the only connector to support transfer speeds over 10Gbps.Putting the two most important specs front-and-centerA key exception to all these rules is USB Hi-Speed, more commonly known by its version number USB 2.0, which maxes out at a now achingly slow 480Mbps. But the USB-IFâs reasoning is that if it were to be completely consistent, and brand USB 2.0 ports as âUSB 480Mbps,â then itâd risk confusing customers who might see the branding next to a âUSB 5Gbpsâ device and wrongly assume itâs faster because of the higher number. Original USB 1.0 branding is also unaffected by this yearâs changes.As my former colleague Chaim Gartenberg wrote last year, even with new simplified branding the situation is still far from perfect. Ideally we wouldnât need half a dozen different logos to describe all the variations of a single connector. But Ravencraft argues that it wouldnât make sense to force every manufacturer to support the highest specs.âA USB printer will never be USB4 Version 2,â he says. âThereâs no need for it, and no oneâs going to put the cost of this higher end technology into a printer or a keyboard or a mouse.â Instead, the âbillionsâ of devices on the market that only need the transfer speeds of older standards like USB 2.0 (ahem, sorry, USB Hi-Speed) can continue to use them.Thereâll still be lots of different USB versions out thereThe new branding guidelines also donât cover absolutely everything that a USB cable can do. Thereâs no information on resolutions or refresh rates if you need a cable thatâs going to carry a DisplayPort video signal, nor is there anything to say how a cable might handle taking a PCIe signal. The logos are focused on the USB-IFâs own standards like USB Power Delivery. That also means they donât offer the same guarantees if you need support for a competing fast-charging standard like Qualcommâs Quick Charge.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,USB brandingchanges,,,

In a webcast with The Washington Post, Amazon senior VP of devices and services Dave Limp touched on this concern, and he refused to rule out asking the company's rival SpaceX for help with its launches.Amazon is playing catch-up with StarlinkAmazon's two prototype satellites are set to launch aboard the new Vulcan Centaur rocket early next year, as per an October press statement. The Project Kuiper mega-constellation is eventually expected to total 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit, bringing high-speed internet anywhere in the world, much like SpaceX's Starlink. SpaceX currently has more than 3,000 satellites in orbit, and it aims to eventually send roughly 30,000 more up to the skies.That's a lot of catching up to do, and Amazon may even need to turn to its rival for help, Limp conceded during his recent webcast interview with The Washington Post.

See More âHumans have spent centuries wondering if we are alone in the universe, or if there are alien beings somewhere in the vast reaches of space. Given that Earth remains the only planet that we know supports lifeâand we are not even sure how it arose hereâit remains challenging to assess the odds that extraterrestrial life exists based on this lonely sample size of one.These limitations in our knowledge prompted the theoretical physicist Brandon Carter to propose decades ago that the presence of life on Earth does not indicate that the mysterious process of abiogenesis, in which living organisms arise from inanimate matter, is more or less likely to occur on other planets. Now, a mathematician has revisited this idea and come to a very different conclusion with a more optimistic view about the existence of alien life.AdvertisementDuring the 1970s, Carter developed an influential series of arguments based on this âselection effectâ of our own existence. This view suggests that humans, as a species that lives on a planet where life emerged, cannot make objective inferences about the possibility that life may be present on other worlds, in part because we have no idea if Earth is typical of planets that might host life. For this reason, we cannot exclude the possibility that Earth may be the only world in the universe that supports living beings.This argument is widely accepted in the scientific community. But now, Daniel Whitmire, an astrophysicist who teaches mathematics at the University of Arkansas, has presented a new challenge to Carterâs assumptions that suggests âthe occurrence of abiogenesis on Earth-like planets is not rare,â according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Astrobiology.Whitmire told Motherboard over email that up until last year, he was one of countless researchers who thought that the Carter argument was âunassailable.â But he started to have doubts about its foundations during the peer review process for a different paper, when an anonymous reviewer offered an analogy between abiogenesis and human conception that inspired Whitmire to counter these long-held assumptions.In order to rethink Carterâs assertion that we canât judge if abiogenesis on Earth was easy or hard, Whitmire draws a comparison to his own existence, noting that he is here regardless of whether his conception, or origin, was easy or hard. For the purposes of this thought experiment, conception would be âhardâ if contraception was used, and âeasyâ if it was not used. The basic idea is that, rather than a personâs existence not telling us anything about whether conceiving them was easy or hard, it can be shown mathematically that it was most likely easy.AdvertisementâThe Conception analogy stuck in my mind and ultimately I came to believe that the Carter argument must be wrong,â Whitmire said. âBut at that point I didn't know why it was wrong.âTo tug on this thread, Whitmire developed a mathematics-based argument that builds on the analogy with the help of the so-called âold evidence problemâ in Bayesian Confirmation Theory, which concerns the incorporation of newly-acquired data into existing hypotheses.The details are pretty complicated, but the gist is that while Carter holds that old evidence (i.e. the existence of life on Earth) has no influence on the probability of its occurrence elsewhere, Whitmireâs paper attempts to show that, actually, this âold evidenceâ does in fact increase the probability of it occurring in the first place. Under this novel framework, both abiogenesis on Earth and Whitmireâs conception are more likely to have been easy than hard, which suggests that life on other planets may be common.These ideas are a bit heady, and Whitmire notes that they might not actually have that much of an impact on anyoneâs hopes or doubts about the probability of alien life existing somewhere in space.âMy opinion is that what many scientists believe about life and intelligent life in the universe is almost political or psychological,â Whitmire said. âIf they want to believe life is rare they will point to the Carter argument or some other argument, like the statistical improbability of abiogenesis, to make their case.âAdvertisementWhitmire's formula. AB means abiogenesis, and LoE means life on Earth.Likewise, Whitmire added that those who want to believe life is abundant can find evidence for that position in other studies, including his new paper.âThere is no reason that I know of (outside of my paper) for any objective optimism about abiogenesis being easy, yet this is the belief of most astrobiologists in spite of the Carter argument,â he said. âPerhaps my paper will give some objective credence to this subjective belief. That said, I think that arguments like mine and Carter's have some influence but the dominant attitude is that since none of the arguments are 100 percent, only future observations will decide.âFortunately, we live in an era packed with exciting missions focused on the search for extraterrestrial life, both inside our solar system and beyond it. NASAâs Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life on Mars, and future missions may scout out Jupiterâs moon Europa or Saturnâs moon Enceladus, which are both considered to be potentially habitable. Next-generation observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope, have the capacity to spot signs of life (or biosignatures) on planets in other star systems, and astronomers are scanning the skies for messages from technologically advanced aliens.Of course, all of these efforts could come up short in the search for life beyond Earth. But just one detection of life beyond our planetâeven if it were microbial, or long-extinctâwould validate Whitmireâs new argument that abiogenesis is not rare in the universe.",6.0,6_nasa_nasas_dart_webb,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,debate about alien life,,,

other news sites769,https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/a-bold-effort-to-cure-hiv-using-crispr/,A bold effort to cure HIV using Crispr,"In July, an HIV-positive man became the first volunteer in a clinical trial aimed at using Crispr gene editing to snip the AIDS-causing virus out of his cells. For an hour, he was hooked up to an IV bag that pumped the experimental treatment directly into his bloodstream. The one-time infusion is designed to carry the gene-editing tools to the manâs infected cells to clear the virus.Later this month, the volunteer will stop taking the antiretroviral drugs heâs been on to keep the virus at undetectable levels. Then, investigators will wait 12 weeks to see if the virus rebounds. If not, theyâll consider the experiment a success. âWhat weâre trying to do is return the cell to a near-normal state,â says Daniel Dornbusch, CEO of Excision BioTherapeutics, the San Francisco-based biotech company thatâs running the trial.The HIV virus attacks immune cells in the body called CD4 cells and hijacks their machinery to make copies of itself. But some HIV-infected cells can go dormantâsometimes for yearsâand not actively produce new virus copies. These so-called reservoirs are a major barrier to curing HIV.AdvertisementâHIV is a tough foe to fight because itâs able to insert itself into our own DNA, and itâs also able to become silent and reactivate at different points in a personâs life,â says Jonathan Li, a physician at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital and HIV researcher at Harvard University whoâs not involved with the Crispr trial. Figuring out how to target these reservoirsâand doing it without harming vital CD4 cellsâhas proven challenging, Li says.While antiretroviral drugs can halt viral replication and clear the virus from the blood, they canât reach these reservoirs, so people have to take medication every day for the rest of their lives. But Excision BioTherapeutics is hoping that Crispr will remove HIV for good.Crispr is being used in several other studies to treat a handful of conditions that arise from genetic mutations. In those cases, scientists are using Crispr to edit peoplesâ own cells. But for the HIV trial, Excision researchers are turning the gene-editing tool against the virus. The Crispr infusion contains gene-editing molecules that target two regions in the HIV genome important for viral replication. The virus can only reproduce if itâs fully intact, so Crispr disrupts that process by cutting out chunks of the genome.In 2019, researchers at Temple University and the University of Nebraska found that using Crispr to delete those regions eliminated HIV from the genomes of rats and mice. A year later, the Temple group also showed that the approach safely removed viral DNA from macaques with SIV, the monkey version of HIV.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,crispr excision of HIV,research on new use for old tech,,,

These screenings would let individuals know their risk of stroke and heart attack without the need for blood tests or even blood pressure measurements.âThis AI tool could let someone know in 60 seconds or less their level of risk,â the lead author of the study, Alicja Rudnicka, told The Guardian. The study found that the predictions were as accurate as those produced by current tests.âThe eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body.âThe software works by analyzing the web of blood vessels contained within the retina of the eye. It measures the total area covered by these arteries and veins, as well as their width and âtortuosityâ (how bendy they are). All these factors are affected by an individualâs heart health, allowing the software to make predictions about a subjectâs risk from heart disease just by looking at a non-invasive snapshot of their eye.âThe study adds to a growing body of knowledge that the eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body,â Pearse Keane, a researcher in ophthalmology and AI analysis not connected to the study, told The Verge. âDoctors have known for more than a hundred years that you could look in the eye and see signs of diabetes and high blood pressure. But the problem was manual assessment: the manual delineation of the vessels by human experts.â The use of machine learning, says Keane, can overcome this challenge.Using AI to diagnose disease from eye scans has proven to be one of the fastest-developing fields of machine learning medicine. The first ever AI diagnostic device approved by the FDA was used to screen for eye disease, and research suggests AI can detect a range of ailments in this way, from diabetic retinopathy to Alzheimerâs (Keaneâs own area of research). Tools applying these findings are in various stages of development, but questions do remain about the reliability and universality of their diagnoses.The researcher named their software QUARTZ. Image: Rudnicka et alThis recent study, carried out by a team from St Georgeâs, University of London, was only tested on the eye scans of white patients, for example. The team sourced their test data from the UK Biobank, a database that happens to be 94.6 percent white (reflecting the UKâs own demographics in age range of patients included in the BioBank). Such biases would have to be balanced in the future to ensure any diagnostic tool is equally accurate for different ethnicities.The researchers compared the results from their software, named QUARTZ (an inventive acronym derived from the phrase âQUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessels Topology and siZeâ) with 10-year risk predictions produced by the standard Framingham Risk Score test (FRS). They found the two methods had âcomparable performance.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,diagnostic eye scan,AI analysis f retinal bloodvessels to gauge heart disease risk,,,

By using a personalized cancer vaccine, the patient's immune system can be prepared to generate a mutation-specific anti-tumor response.Moderna's mRNA-4517/V940 is designed to generate Tcell responses based on the mutational signature of the tumor in the patient. T cells are a type of white blood cell that are tasked with defending the body in the event of an infection.Merck's KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that targets the PD-1 protein that cells can use to evade detection by T cells. Since both healthy as well as cancerous cells use this mechanism to evade T cell attack, using KEYTRUDA even puts healthy cells in the firing line.In combination with Moderna's vaccine, the treatment can aim to specifically target tumor cells.KEYNOTE-942 trialMerck's KEYTRUDA is currently being used in over 1,600 trials across a wide range of cancers. Through these trials, Merck is trying to understand the various factors that might affect the effectiveness of the treatment in patients.KEYNOTE 942 is one such trial studying the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in high-risk melanoma patients.

other news sites832,https://scitechdaily.com/for-the-first-time-a-robot-has-learned-to-imagine-itself/,A swarm of tiny robots could soon brush and floss your teeth for you,"A robot created by Columbia Engineers learns to understand itself rather than the environment around it.Our perception of our bodies is not always correct or realistic, as any athlete or fashion-conscious person knows, but itâs a crucial factor in how we behave in society. Your brain is continuously preparing for movement while you play ball or get dressed so that you can move your body without bumping, tripping, or falling.Humans develop our body models as infants, and robots are starting to do the same. A team at Columbia Engineering revealed today that they have developed a robot that, for the first time, can learn a model of its whole body from scratch without any human aid. The researchers explain how their robot built a kinematic model of itself in a recent paper published in Science Robotics, and how it utilized that model to plan movements, accomplish objectives, and avoid obstacles in a range of scenarios. Even damage to its body was automatically detected and corrected.The robot watches itself like an infant exploring itself in a hall of mirrorsThe researchers placed a robotic arm within a circle of five streaming video cameras. The robot watched itself through the cameras as it undulated freely. Like an infant exploring itself for the first time in a hall of mirrors, the robot wiggled and contorted to learn how exactly its body moved in response to various motor commands. After about three hours, the robot stopped. Its internal deep neural network had finished learning the relationship between the robotâs motor actions and the volume it occupied in its environment.âWe were really curious to see how the robot imagined itself,â said Hod Lipson, professor of mechanical engineering and director of Columbiaâs Creative Machines Lab, where the work was done. âBut you canât just peek into a neural network, itâs a black box.â After the researchers struggled with various visualization techniques, the self-image gradually emerged. âIt was a sort of gently flickering cloud that appeared to engulf the robotâs three-dimensional body,â said Lipson. âAs the robot moved, the flickering cloud gently followed it.â The robotâs self-model was accurate to about 1% of its workspace.A technical summary of the study. Credit: Columbia EngineeringSelf-modeling robots will lead to more self-reliant autonomous systemsThe ability of robots to model themselves without being assisted by engineers is important for many reasons: Not only does it save labor, but it also allows the robot to keep up with its own wear-and-tear, and even detect and compensate for damage. The authors argue that this ability is important as we need autonomous systems to be more self-reliant. A factory robot, for instance, could detect that something isnât moving right, and compensate or call for assistance.âWe humans clearly have a notion of self,â explained the studyâs first author Boyuan Chen, who led the work and is now an assistant professor at Duke University. âClose your eyes and try to imagine how your own body would move if you were to take some action, such as stretch your arms forward or take a step backward. Somewhere inside our brain we have a notion of self, a self-model that informs us what volume of our immediate surroundings we occupy, and how that volume changes as we move.âSelf-awareness in robotsThe work is part of Lipsonâs decades-long quest to find ways to grant robots some form of self-awareness. âSelf-modeling is a primitive form of self-awareness,â he explained. âIf a robot, animal, or human, has an accurate self-model, it can function better in the world, it can make better decisions, and it has an evolutionary advantage.âThe researchers are aware of the limits, risks, and controversies surrounding granting machines greater autonomy through self-awareness. Lipson is quick to admit that the kind of self-awareness demonstrated in this study is, as he noted, âtrivial compared to that of humans, but you have to start somewhere. We have to go slowly and carefully, so we can reap the benefits while minimizing the risks.âReference: âFully body visual self-modeling of robot morphologiesâ by Boyuan Chen, Robert Kwiatkowski, Carl Vondrick and Hod Lipson, 13 July 2022, Science Robotics.DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.abn1944The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation, Facebook, and Northrop Grumman.The authors declare no financial or other conflicts of interest.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,self-modeling robot,a step toward autonomous robot,,,
other news sites768,https://news.mit.edu/2022/sensors-face-masks-fit-1020,MIT engineers develop sensors for face masks that help gauge fit,"The study is a collaboration between Dagdevirenâs lab; Siqi Zheng, the STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; and Tolga Durak, managing director of MITâs Environment, Health, and Safety programs. Jin-Hoon Kim, an MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Electronics.The researchers hope that their sensor will help people to find masks that fit them better, and that designers could use it to create masks that fit a wider variety of face shapes and sizes. The sensor can also be used to monitor vital signs such as breathing rate and temperature, as well as environmental conditions such as humidity.âWhat we realized by analyzing our collected data from the individuals in the study was that the masks that we use in daily life are not very suitable for female participants,â says Canan Dagdeviren, the LG Career Development Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT and the corresponding author of the study.Using this sensor, the researchers analyzed the fit of surgical masks on male and female subjects, and found that overall, the masks fit womenâs faces much less closely than they fit menâs faces.Currently, there are no simple ways to measure the fit of a mask, but a new sensor developed at MIT could make it much easier to ensure a good fit. The sensor, which measures physical contact between the mask and the wearerâs face, can be applied to any kind of mask.Wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, but a maskâs effectiveness depends on how well it fits.Fit qualityThe researchers began working on this project before mask-wearing became common during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their original intention was to use sensors embedded in masks to measure the effectiveness of mask-wearing in areas with high levels of air pollution. However, once the pandemic started, they realized that such a sensor could have more widespread applications.With so many different kinds of masks available during the pandemic, the researchers thought this kind of sensor could be useful to help individuals find the best-fitting mask for them. Currently, the only way to measure mask fit is to use a machine called a mask fit tester, which evaluates the mask fit by comparing air particle concentrations inside and outside of the face mask. However, this type of machine is only available in specialized facilities such as hospitals, which use them to evaluate mask fit for health care workers.The MIT team wanted to create a more user-friendly, portable device to measure mask fit. Dagdevirenâs lab, the Conformable Decoders group, specializes in developing flexible, stretchable electronics that can be worn on the skin or incorporated into textiles to detect signals from the body.âIn this project, we wanted to monitor both biological and environmental conditions simultaneously, such as breathing pattern, skin temperature, human activities, temperature and humidity inside the face mask, and the position of the mask, including whether people are wearing it properly or not,â Kim says. âWe also wanted to check the fit quality.âTo integrate their sensors into face masks, the researchers created a device that they call a conformable multimodal sensor face mask (cMaSK). Sensors that measure a variety of parameters are embedded in a flexible polymer frame that can be reversibly attached to the inside of any mask, around the edges.To measure fit, the cMaSK has 17 sensors around the edge of the mask that measure capacitance, which can be used to determine whether the mask is touching the skin at each of those locations.The cMaSK interface also has sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure, which can detect activities such as speaking and coughing. An accelerometer within the device can reveal if the wearer is moving around. All of the sensors are embedded into a biocompatible polymer called polyimide, which is used in medical implants such as stents.The conformable electronics are laminated and delaminated on a surgical mask.The researchers tested the cMaSK interface in a group of five men and five women. All of the subjects wore surgical masks, and the researchers monitored the readings from the sensors as the participants performed a variety of activities, such as speaking, walking, and running. They also tested the sensors in a variety of temperature conditions.Using data obtained by the capacitance sensors, the researchers created a machine-learning algorithm to calculate mask fit quality for each subject in the study. These measurements revealed that mask fit was significantly worse for women than men, due to differences in face shape and size. However, the fit for women could be improved slightly by wearing smaller surgical masks. The researchers also found that mask fit quality was low for one of the male subjects who had a beard, which created gaps between the mask and the skin.To verify their results, the researchers also collaborated with MITâs Environment, Health, and Safety Office on the design and evaluation of the fit, and found that the fit results for each study participant were very similar to what they found using the cMaSK.Customized fitThe researchers hope that their findings will encourage mask manufacturers to design masks that fit a variety of face shapes and sizes, especially womenâs faces. Dagdevirenâs lab is planning to work on mass production and large-scale deployment of the cMaSK interface.âWe hope to think about ways to design masks and come up with the best fit for individuals,â Dagdeviren says. âWe have different sizes for shoes, and you can even customize your shoes. So why canât you customize and design your mask, for your own health and for societal benefit?âThe researchers also hope to return to their original idea of studying the effects of air pollution on people who work outside.âOur technology can really help to quantify the social costs of these environmental hazards, and also to measure the benefits of any kind of policy intervention,â Zheng says.The research was funded by the MIT Media Lab Consortium, the 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, and the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative (MISTI) Global Fund.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,small group test of fit and sensors on face mask,,,,

The algae provide movement through the lungs, which is key to the treatment being targeted and effective.In experiments, the infections in the mice treated with the algae bots all cleared up, whereas the mice that weren't treated all died within three days.The technology is still at a proof-of-concept stage, but the early signs are very promising.""Based on this mouse data, we see that the microrobots could potentially improve antibiotic penetration to kill bacterial pathogens and save more patients' lives,"" says Victor Nizet, a physician and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego.The nanoparticles on the algae cells are made of tiny polymer spheres coated with the membranes of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. These membranes neutralize inflammatory molecules produced by bacteria and the body's own immune system, and both the nanoparticles and the algae degrade naturally.Harmful inflammation is reduced, improving the fight against infection, and the swimming microbots are able to deliver their treatment right where it's needed â it's the precision that makes this approach work so well.The researchers also established that the microbot treatment was more effective than an intravenous injection of antibiotics â in fact, the injection dose had to be 3,000 times higher than the one loaded on to the algae cells to achieve the same effect in the mice.""These results show how targeted drug delivery combined with active movement from the microalgae improves therapeutic efficacy,"" says Joseph Wang, nanoengineer from UC San Diego.In humans, the pneumonia caused byPseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria used in this study occurs after patients are put on a mechanical ventilator in intensive care. The infection often prolongs stays in hospital and significantly increases the risk of death.The researchers are confident that their new method can be scaled up as required, and would be straightforward to administer to the lungs of ventilated patients (the microbots were delivered to the mice through a tube in the windpipe).Next up for the team is more research into how the microbots interact with the immune system, then scaling up the work and getting it ready to be tested in larger animals â and then eventually, humans.""Our goal is to do targeted drug delivery into more challenging parts of the body, like the lungs,"" says chemical engineer Liangfang Zhang from UC San Diego.

""A key benefit (of a cyborg insect) is that when it comes to an insect's movements, the insect is causing itself to move, so the electricity required is nowhere near as much.""[1/5] A Madagascar hissing cockroach, mounted with a ""backpack"" of electronics and a solar cell that enable remote control of its movement, is pictured during a photo opportunity at the Thin-Film Device Laboratory of Japanese research institution Riken in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, Japan September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 1 2 3 4 5Fukuda and his team chose Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the experiments because they are big enough to carry the equipment and have no wings that would get in the way. Even when the backpack and film are glued to their backs, the bugs can traverse small obstacles or right themselves when flipped over.The research still has a long way to go. In a recent demonstration, Riken researcher Yujiro Kakei used a specialized computer and wireless Bluetooth signal to tell the cyborg roach to turn left, causing it to scramble in that general direction. But when given the ""right"" signal, the bug turned in circles.The next challenge is miniaturising the components so that the insects can move more easily and to allow for mounting of sensors and even cameras. Kakei said he constructed the cyborg backpack with 5,000 yen ($35) worth of parts purchased at Tokyo's famed Akihabara electronics district.The backpack and film can be removed, allowing the roaches to go back to life in the lab's terrarium. The insects mature in four months and have been known to live up to five years in captivity.Beyond disaster rescue bugs, Fukuda sees broad applications for the solar cell film, composed of microscopic layers of plastic, silver, and gold. The film could be built into clothing or skin patches for use in monitoring vital signs.On a sunny day, a parasol covered with the material could generate enough electricity to charge a mobile phone, he said.($1 = 143.3100 yen)Writing by Rocky Swift Editing by Mark HeinrichOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,cyborg cockroach,utilizing tech placed on cockroach,,,

Credit: Steve Zylius / UCIResearchers at the University of California, Irvine and four national laboratories have devised a way to make lithium-ion battery cathodes without using cobalt, a mineral plagued by price volatility and geopolitical complications.In a paper published today in Nature, the scientists describe how they overcame thermal and chemical-mechanical instabilities of cathodes composed substantially of nickelâa common substitute for cobaltâby mixing in several other metallic elements.""Through a technique we refer to as 'high-entropy doping,' we were able to successfully fabricate a cobalt-free layered cathode with extremely high heat tolerance and stability over repeated charge and discharge cycles,"" said corresponding author Huolin Xin, UCI professor of physics & astronomy. ""This achievement resolves long-standing safety and stability concerns around high-nickel battery materials, paving the way for broad-based commercial applications.""Cobalt is one of the most significant supply chain risks threatening widespread adoption of electric cars, trucks and other electronic devices requiring batteries, according to the paper's authors. The mineral, which is chemically suited for the purpose of stabilizing lithium-ion battery cathodes, is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of Congo under abusive and inhumane conditions.""Electric vehicle manufacturers are eager to curtail the use of cobalt in their battery packs not only for cost reduction but to counter the child labor practices used to mine the mineral,"" Xin said. ""Research has also shown that cobalt can lead to oxygen release at high voltage, causing damage to lithium-ion batteries. All of this points to a need for alternatives.""However, nickel-based cathodes come with their own problems, such as poor heat tolerance, which can lead to oxidization of battery materials, thermal runaway and even explosion. Although high-nickel cathodes accommodate larger capacities, volume strain from repeated expansion and contraction can result in poor stability and safety concerns.The researchers sought to address these issues through compositionally complex high-entropy doping using HE-LMNO, an amalgamation of transition metals magnesium, titanium, manganese, molybdenum and niobium in the structure's interior, with a subset of these minerals used on its surface and interface with other battery materials.Xin and his colleagues employed an array of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and 3D nanotomography instruments to determine that their zero-cobalt cathode exhibited an unprecedented volumetric change of zero during repeated use. The highly stable structure is capable of withstanding more than 1,000 cycles and high temperatures, which makes it comparable to cathodes with much lower nickel content.For some of these research tools, Xin collaborated with researchers at the National Synchrotron Light Source II, located at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. As a DOE Office of Science user facility, NSLS-II offered the team access to three of its 28 scientific instrumentsâcalled beamlinesâto study the internal structure of the new cathode.""The combination of the different methods at NSLS II beamlines enabled the discovery of a trapping effect of oxygen vacancies and defects inside the material, which effectively prevents the crack formation in the HE-LMNO secondary particle, making this structure extremely stable during cycling,"" said co-author Mingyuan Ge, a scientist at NSLS-II.Added Xin: ""Using these advanced tools, we were able to observe the dramatically increased thermal stability and zero-volumetric-change characteristics of the cathode, and we've been able to demonstrate extraordinarily improved capacity retention and cycle life. This research could set the stage for the development of an energy-dense alternative to existing batteries.""He said the work represents a step toward achieving the dual goal of spurring the proliferation of clean transportation and energy storage while addressing environmental justice issues around the extraction of minerals used in batteries.More information: Huolin Xin, Compositionally complex doping for zero-strain zero-cobalt layered cathodes, Nature (2022). www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05115-z Journal information: Nature Huolin Xin, Compositionally complex doping for zero-strain zero-cobalt layered cathodes,(2022).

techcrunch775,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/sensor-studded-suit-helps-track-recovery-of-stroke-patients/,Sensor studded suit helps track recovery of stroke patients,"Millions of people suffer from strokes every year worldwide, and severe ones can require long-term care â but as with other rehabilitation regimens, it can be hard for doctors to track the everyday activities of their patients. A high-tech suit created by a Dutch grad student may be a powerful new way to help keep better tabs on those in recovery.Bart Klaassen, from the Netherlandsâ University of Twente, and the rest of his team pursued it as part of a project resulting from Europeâs FP7 research initiative. Klaassenâs doctoral thesis is based on the work, as well.The idea is that while patients are closely monitored while at the rehabilitation clinic or in regular checkups, real-world tasks such as getting out of bed, navigating the house and cooking can only be reported secondhand.âThere has long been a great need for systems like this, but the technology simply was not ready,â explained Klaassen in a news release from the school. But as other projects along these lines have proved, thatâs not the case any more: sensors can be made small enough, fabrics smart enough and the resulting data coherent enough that a high-tech suit like this is not only a possibility, but potentially a major advance.The suit, which is worn underneath the clothes for several months, contains 41 sensors that track strength, flexibility, gait and other relevant metrics. Theyâre collected wirelessly and processed by (at present) university servers.âWe have succeeded in modelling all of the relevant movements, and in cleaning up the data that is relevant for the therapist by filtering out the rest,â said Klaassen. âOur project has delivered new techniques and methods that can be used to monitor patients at home for extended periods of time, and to identify any differences with structured clinical measurements.âPresumably the sensors and data could also be used for tracking progress in cases other than those suffering from strokes, but Klaassenâs research is focused on the one domain for now. If it proves useful it could be adapted for use in other forms of physical therapy.The suit isnât in production or anything right now and there are plenty of questions, from whether it can be made cheaply to whether it can be washed at all â Iâve emailed the university with some questions and will update the post if I hear back.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,multisensor garment,sensor suit for post stroke patients,,,

Research is ongoing, though, and a project at the University of Ghent shows promise not just in advancing the technology but providing some therapeutic value, as well.Herbert De Smetâs group has been working for some time with EU grant money on initial applications and executions of smart lenses, and some early results were presented at IEEEâs International Electron Devices Meeting this week. Their device embeds a tiny monochrome LCD in the lens that can be set to varying opacities and patterns.Now, these patterns would be far too close to the eye for you to make them out, except perhaps as smudges or dark areas in your vision. Theyâre not intended to form images, however, but rather to darken the entire field of view for people who canât do it themselves.Some people suffer from conditions that limit the ability of their eyeâs iris â thatâs the colored circle â to contract and dilate the pupil and control the amount of light admitted to reach the retina. If the pupil is stuck in the open state, bright situations â normally handled by reducing the pupil to a pinhole â will overwhelm the iris and cause pain or even serious damage.A contact lens that automatically changes its shade from totally transparent to as dark as a pair of sunglasses, as required by the ambient light, would fill this role nicely. Thatâs exactly what De Smetâs team has created; head over to IEEE Spectrum for a video of the LCD in action.The parts are in place: the LCD-infused lens and the chip that controls it are solid, and the power system, a set of tiny photovoltaic cells, captures enough energy â but the two have yet to be integrated. Once they are, the lenses will still, of course, need to be tested for safety.You can keep up with De Smetâs work at the Centre for Microsystems Technologyâs webpage.",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,LCD-infused lens,"when integrated with a power source and tested, the lens will act as adaptive sunglasses in a contact lens",,,

(Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA)New type of pacemaker is a safer, more advanced option than traditional surgeryThis March, Dr. Kent Nilsson successfully implanted one of the first wireless, dual chamber pacemakers in the world into a patient. This accomplishment makes Piedmont Hospital the first center in the Southeast and fourth in the U.S. to implant this new device. It was only the 32nd implant in a human in the world.A cardiologist at Piedmont Athens Regional Hospital and professor of medicine at the Augusta University/University of Georgia Medical Partnership, Nilsson has become an expert in implanting single chamber, wireless pacemakers. He was called upon again to test the dual chamber version as part of the clinical trial for the Abbott Aveir DR Leadless (wireless) Pacemaker System.The dual chamber wireless pacemaker is honestly one of the most transformative technologies in cardiology. Ever.â âDr. Kent NilssonWith this procedure, the hospital joined the ranks of leading medical centers and universities in the country. The three locations ahead of Piedmont for the implantation were the University of Arizona, Cleveland Clinic and Cornell University.âThe dual chamber wireless pacemaker is honestly one of the most transformative technologies in cardiology. Ever,â said Nilsson. âWhen the dual chamber launches, it will completely change the field.âHow does a pacemaker work?A pacemaker is a device implanted into the chest to stabilize an irregular or slowly beating heart. A traditional pacemaker is inserted through an incision in the chest and is then connected to wires (leads) that have been inserted into the heart through the subclavian vein. The device sits beneath the skin and on top of the chest muscle, and the wires deliver electrical pulses to correct the heartbeat.In 2014, Piedmont joined a clinical trial to test single chamber leadless â or wireless â pacemakers, which are put directly into the lower right ventricle of the heart via the femoral vein and do not require the chest to be opened for implantation. Nilsson gladly came on board for the trial.Piedmont was the first center in Georgia and 15th in the country to implant a wireless pacemaker. By the time the 2014 trial for the single wireless pacemaker was complete, Nilsson had implanted over 30 devices.Although traditional pacemakers have come a long way (the first implantation in 1958 failed within three hours and the patient went on to have 26 pacemakers in his lifetime), Nilsson said this wireless technology is the biggest advancement in the field since the invention.Benefits of wireless pacemakersThe wireless pacemaker is about 90% smaller than the average pacemaker and the surgery lasts around 30 minutes. The battery life is also comparable with a traditional pacemakerâs 10-12 years and could be longer in some cases.Patients also will not have an incision scar on the chest or a bump protruding from the skin.âThe psychological aspect of not seeing an incision or having something protruding out of your skin is beneficial,â said Nilsson. âJust being able to not broadcast to the world that there is something wrong.âAnother advantage is the elimination of several complications associated with traditional pacemakers. One in 10 patients see complications with pacemaker leads, or wires. Some also experience pocket infections, hematoma, lead dislodgment and lead fracture.Wireless pacemaker patients will also see a shorter, less complicated recovery time. There are no restrictions with taking showers or getting the area wet, and there are also no mobility issues. Traditional pacemaker patients are not able to move their arm above their shoulder for six weeks after surgery.âItâs same day discharge and people are up and moving around and doing everything they need to do,â said Nilsson.The single chamber wireless pacemaker was approved by the FDA in 2016, and Nilsson is now teaching other physicians how to implant the device.âIâm one of 10 proctors teaching close to 5,000 physicians how to implant,â said Nilsson. âThe reception nationwide has been overwhelming. Every day my Twitter is blowing up with pictures of people doing their first single chamber implant.âSingle chamber pacemakers connect to one chamber of the heart while the dual chamber version connects to both chambers on the right side of the heart. Dual chamber pacemakers are the standard of care for pacemaker patients in the United States, so this new technology will affect more patients than the single chamber version.âDual chambers are 95% of what we do,â said Nilsson.First implant of the new deviceNilsson kicked off the first dual implantation of the dual chamber, wireless pacemaker in March with a meaningful milestone. âAlmost eight years to the day after we implanted the single chamber, we put in the dual chamber,â he said.Sixty-four-year-old Anna McKuhen was Nilssonâs first patient. She was the first in the Southeast to have the dual chamber pacemaker implanted.âI am all about new technology, so when they asked if Iâd like to be a part of this trial, I said sure. It sounded exciting,â said McKuhen. âThe technology amazes me.âMcKuhen said she was interested in receiving the wireless pacemaker, in part, because of the greatly reduced recovery time.âMy recovery was fantastic,â said McKuhen. âI did not have any problems whatsoever. I was only confined to a week of not lifting heavy objects. Iâve had zero problems.âNilsson implanted four dual pacemakers by the time the trial concluded in September.Nilsson hopes the dual chamber will be FDA approved in 2023 and widely available soon after.âI would say this is the future of pacemakers 100 percent,â said Nilsson. âEveryone is trying to catch up at this point. This is really transformative technology.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,wireless dual chamber pacemaker,,,,

But todayâs ultrasound imaging technology is large and technical, so itâs only available in healthcare facilities and must be operated by highly trained technicians. Plus, patients, who take time out of their schedules to go to an appointment, have to be covered in a sticky gel.Now, researchers say theyâve developed an innovative solution to some of these challenges. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have unveiled a new adhesive ultrasound patch thatâs about the size of a postage stamp and can provide continuous imaging of the bodyâs inner workings for up to 48 hours. The scientists shared their new technology in a paper published last week in the journal Science.âWe believe weâve opened a new era of wearable imaging,â says Xuanhe Zhao, a mechanical engineer at MIT and one of the studyâs authors, in a statement. âWith a few patches on your body, you could see your internal organs.âIn the past, engineers developing wearable ultrasound technologies have run into issues with image quality and flexibility, but the new MIT stickers seem to have struck the right balance. To create the small devices, which are about three millimeters thick and two square centimeters in size, engineers combined rigid transducers with a stretchy, sticky layer that encapsulates a layer of water-based hydrogel.The researchers put the stickers to the test by placing them on various body parts of healthy volunteers, including their neck, abdomen, arms and chest. Then, they asked the volunteers to move their bodies in various ways, including drinking juice, jogging, lifting weights, biking, sitting and standing.Not only did the stickers adhere to the volunteersâ skin, but they also produced clear images of their internal organs and major blood vessels for up to 48 hours. The patches allowed the researchers to watch volunteersâ stomachs expand, then shrink, when they drank juice. They could observe major blood vessels changing sizes when a volunteer was sitting versus standing, and witness the heart change shape while pumping blood during exercise.For now, the stickers must be connected to instruments to make sense of the data theyâve gathered. But in the near future, the scientists hope to refine their design so that the stickers can operate wirelessly, communicating with a patientâs smart phone for real-time, on-demand imaging.âWe are working hard on the wireless version,â Zhao tells the Guardianâs Ian Sample. âBecause there are already wireless point-of-care handhold ultrasounds, we are confident that we will be able to achieve the wireless version in a few years.âAlready, researchers are dreaming up all the ways the stickers could be useful. Patients could wear them at home to help monitor an array of medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. In hospitals, they could free up medical technicians for other tasks or make it possible to obtain ultrasound images in healthcare facilities with staffing issues.Recommended VideosâYou donât need a trained sonographer and you donât need a huge ultrasound machine,â says Philip Tan, an electrical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin, to New Scientist âs Jeremy Hsu. âYou could deploy it to very low-resource communities.â",3.0,3_cancer_blood_research_breakthrough,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,ultrasound sticker,provides continuous ultrasound image for 48 hours w/o requiring a technician after initial application.

According to the results of the study, the Apple Watch Series 6 is able to âreliably detect states of reduced blood oxygen saturationâ in comparison to medical-grade pulse oximeters. Hereâs how the study came to determine thisâ¦How reliable is the Apple Watchâs blood oxygen sensor?As spotted by MyHealthyApple, the study was published this month in the Digital Health open access journal. The objective of the study was to investigate âhow a commercially available smartwatch that measures peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) can detect hypoxemia compared to a medical-grade pulse oximeter.âFor the study, researchers recruited 24 healthy participants. Each person wore an Apple Watch Series 6 on their left wrist and a pulse oximeter sensor on their left middle finger (the Masimo Radical-7).The participants breathed via a breathing circuit with a three-way non-rebreathing valve in three phases. First, in the 2-minute initial stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air. Then in the 5-minute desaturation phase, the participants breathed the oxygen-reduced gas mixture (12% O 2 ), which temporarily reduced their blood oxygen saturation. In the final stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air again until SpO 2 returned to normal values. Measurements of SpO 2 were taken from the smartwatch and the pulse oximeter simultaneously in 30-s intervals.The study resulted in 642 individual pairs of blood oxygen measurements:The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%-100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%.As such, the researchers conclude:The bias in SpO 2 between the smartwatch and the oximeter was 0.0% for all the data points. The bias for SpO 2 less than 90% was 1.2%. The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%â100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%.Apple first added blood oxygen measurement support to the Apple Watch Series 6. Itâs also a feature on the newest Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra. Apple has been hesitant to promote the feature with any actual medical claims, and the company hasnât advertised any significant improvements to the technology since it first debuted on the Series 6 in 2020.You can read the complete study right here on the SAGE Journals website.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The path is made of a light-emitting material that charges in the sun and can glow for up to 10 hours in the dark, bathing cyclists in a calming blue glow.The company that made it, TPA sp. z o.o is an engineering firm focused on future tech. They expect this sort of road to be useful in larger projects â highways, say â but for now theyâre limiting it to bike paths until they can test the material in the wild. They said that this type of path may be installed in Warsaw soon and that it can glow in multiple colors.The lane uses luminophores â chemicals that âingestâ light â to keep the bike path nicely lit at night.

Photo: Ocean BuildersWith minimalist decor, curved walls and an ultra-sleek design, the SeaPod flagship model looks like something from The Jetsons. It is spread over 77 square metres of space that's split across three levels.There's a master bedroom with epic views, a living room and kitchen, a bathroom and an outdoor patio. Wraparound panoramic windows give residents 360-degree unobstructed ocean views.Wooden teak flooring, colour-changing lights and wireless charging stations are available in each SeaPod, which also comes with automated black-out blinds and sliding panel windows.Entirely customisable, there's the option to add climbing walls, greenhouses, skylights, hot tubs and patio gardens.Cutting-edge technology is at the heart of Panama's newest waterfront destination, with each pod using software to control lighting, internal air temperature, water pressure and more.Guests wear a smart ring that can be used to control technology settings, as well as being used to unlock doors, open windows and turn on music and mood lighting. Wireless charging stations are built into several of the pod's surfaces so that chargers and wires for phones become a thing of the past.Daily drone delivery and new marine habitatsDaily essentials such as groceries and medicine are flown in by drones that have been designed to easily withstand open ocean conditions. Self-driving boats remove rubbish, compost and recycling and, when they're not on duty, work to clean up the surrounding ocean waters by expelling trash to help mitigate human impact on the ocean even beyond the community.The SeaPods are designed so that each one can function as a new habitat for marine life. Photo: Ocean BuildersSustainability is a key focus for Ocean Builders and pods are designed to be respectful of their surrounding environment.The pods have been designed to become marine habitats for fish and other creatures, and artificial intelligence cameras will monitor what goes on beneath the waves. Marine detection technology is available to alert pod residents when dolphins, whales or their other favourite sea creatures are nearby.Ocean Builders officially launched three models on Monday. They include the original SeaPod, the GreenPod for land living and the EcoPod, a more affordable option of each version.The single-level SeaPod Eco is slightly smaller than the flagship version and laid out on a single floor, but includes the same principles, technology options and customisable design features.12 futuristic cities being built around the world, from Saudi Arabia to China â in pictures",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,floating SeaPods,offshore home,,,

See More âContinuing Silicon Valleyâs long and storied history of misreading dystopian satires as instruction manuals, a startup has created a tech product that makes call center workers' voices sound white.The startup, called Sanas and founded by three former Stanford students, was first reported on by Joshua Bote for SFGate on Monday. On Sanas' website, you can âhear the magicâ: a simulated conversation between a call center worker with an Indian accent that can be modified with a slider that applies Sanasâs accent translation. After Sanas is applied, the voice sounds more like a text-to-voice reader than another human being, but it does sound typically American and white.AdvertisementIn a demonstration for Motherboard, company President Massih Sarimand and COO Sharath Keysheva Narayana called an employee in India who talked about his background and work. Then the Sanasa filter was applied. It removed the employeeâs accent and created a passable white and American-sounding voice, albeit a bit robotic.Sanas describes its approach as ""accent matching,"" and advertises on its website that it can ""improve understanding by 31% and customer satisfaction by 21%."" Apparently, the software can offer multiple accents at the touch of a buttonâalthough its demo only features an Indian accent being turned into typically white and Americanâand the company frames its technology as ""empowering"" workers. According to materials offered by the company to SFGate, the company claims to have garnered about $132 million worth of funding thus far.Ironically, given its focus on empowerment, Sanas' software to turn call center workers' voices into white American voices mirrors the plot of Boots Riley's 2018 dystopian satire Sorry to Bother You. In the film, the ability to put on a ""white"" voice on the phone allows the film's Black protagonist to rise up in the company, but introduces tension in the workplace that undercuts a union drive and eventually pits him against his former co-workers.In an interview with Motherboard, Sarim and Narayana sketched out their business strategy and explained why call centers were their first choice as clients.Advertisement""Call centers have a very specific speech pattern. You don't have people laughing, crying, singingâthose nuances of speech are not there so it is easier to build it. The next use case is on enterprise communications. As we started going live with enterprise call centers, they said 'Hey we have teams in Asia, we have teams in Africa,'"" Naryana told Motherboard. ""We want to leverage a tool like this so that we can give them a choice and we want everybody to be heard. We want to build a very inclusive work culture and we think this could be an extremely great product and technology to actually bring people closer.""Call centers are heavily surveilled workplacesâdominated by âemployee monitoringâ which some are eager to argue is somehow beneficial for the workers. These workers suffer the brunt of a customerâs anger when something goes wrong but lack the autonomy to go beyond a script or narrow guidelines laid out by management. Viewed as disposable, closely surveilled, experiencing little if any autonomy, and forced to deal with angry or racist customers, call center workers typically burn out in a few monthsâwhen they donât, their mental health suffers. The core question here, then, is what deploying Sanas will actually do to working conditions for call center workers.AdvertisementItâs not hard to imagine scenarios where the introduction of Sanas results in companies demanding more of their workers because they now have âaccent matching"" that is supposed to increase their performance with customersâa typical outcome when workplaces with minimal autonomy implement performance-boosting software. Narayana said increased performance would be a side-effect of Sanas' software, but it mainly has the potential to improve every aspect of this industry: call center labor conditions, the mental health of these workers, and the experience of customers on the phone.""I don't care about metrics, I think about mental health, employee satisfaction, retention, and overall employee happiness. All of those metrics are checked out for me,"" Narayana told Motherboard. ""I strongly believe once you keep your employees happy, all the business metrics will get better. So that's a secondary result of what we're trying to achieve. But the primary result for me is actually improving the lives of all these agents.""Sanasâs product doesnât address the structural issues with call center work nor racism from callers, which its product implicitly side steps. Sanas acknowledges the potential for misuse of its software and says nobody will be ""forced"" to use it because workers themselves activate it with a buttonâhowever, this doesn't acknowledge the possibility of being forced to use it by default due to performance quotas. Sanas also says it has a ""code of ethics"" with three values: individual choice (it's activated by the worker), personal control (effectively the same point), and flexibility (Sanas offers multiple accents).The desire to communicate clearly and seamlessly with one another is understandableâas Sarim and Narayana reiterated to Motherboard multiple times, and as the website says, 80 percent of this companyâs workers were immigrants. Sarim and Narayana have both worked call center jobs where they dealt with racism. The two insist this informs their end goal: not to simply have an accent translation engine that turns anything into white, American English (âmany-to-oneâ) but one day to develop a translator for any accent to any accent (âmany-to-manyâ).",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,accent converter,tool for live accent alteration,,,
techcrunch823,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/replacing-plastic-with-plant-pulp-for-sustainable-packaging-attracts-a-billionaire-backer/,Replacing plastic with plant pulp for sustainable packaging attracts a billionaire backer,"In a small suburb of Melbourne, two entrepreneurs are developing a technology that could mean big changes for the packaging industry.Stuart Gordon and Mark Appleford are the co-founders of Varden, a company that has developed a process to take the waste material from sugarcane and convert it into a paper-like packaging product with the functional attributes of plastic.Their technology managed to grab the attention of â and $2.2 million in funding from â Horizons Ventures, the venture capital fund managing the money of Li Ka-shing, one of the worldâs wealthiest men.Itâs an opportune time to launch a novel packaging technology, as the European Union has already instituted a ban on single-use plastic items, which will go into effect in 2021. Taking their lead, companies like NestlÃ© and Walmart have pledged to use only sustainable packaging for products beginning in 2025.The environmental toll that packaging takes on the earthâs habitats is already a concern for many, and the urgency to find a solution is only mounting with consumers and businesses actually producing more waste in the rush to change consumer behavior and socially distance as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.âI like technologies that focus on carbon reductions,â said Chris Liu, Horizons Venturesâ representative in Australia.A longtime tech and product executive who had stints at Intel and Fjord, a digital design studio, Liu relocated to Australia recently and has actually taken himself off the grid.Living in Western Australia, the climate emergency was brought directly to the top of Liuâs mind when the wildfires, which raged through the country, came within two kilometers of his new home.For Mark Appleford, it wasnât so much the fires as it was the garbage that kept washing up on the shores of his beloved beaches.Over beers at a barbecue he began talking to his eventual co-founder, Stuart Gordon, about the environmental problem theyâd solve if they had the ability to change things. They settled on plastics.Working in Applefordâs laundry room they started developing the technology that would become Varden. That early laundry room-work in 2015 led to a small seed round and the companyâs long slog to get an initial product in the hands of test customers.Finagling some time with the New Zealand manufacturer Fisher and Paykel, the two co-founders put together an early prototype of their coffee pods made from sugarcane bagasse, a waste byproduct of the sugar feedstock.âWe worked backwards through customers to supply chain, which led us to material selection, which was something that would allow us to create a product that people understood,â said Gordon.The production process has evolved to fit inside a 40-foot container that holds the firmâs machine, which takes agricultural waste and converts that waste into packaging.Instead of using rollers like a paper mill, Vardenâs technology uses a thermoform to mold the plant waste into a product that has the same properties as plastic.It removes a complicated step thatâs been essential to the current crop of bioplastics, which use bacteria to convert plant waste into plastic substitutes that are then sold to the industry.âIt looks like paperâ¦ you can tear it in half and it sounds like paper when you rip it, and you can throw it in the bin,â said Appleford.Gordon said that the companyâs containers are outperforming commodity based plastics. And the first target for replacement, the founders said, is coffee capsules.âWe went for coffee because itâs the hardest,â said Appleford.Itâs also a huge market, according to the company. Varden estimates there are more than 20 billion coffee pods consumed every year.With the new money, Varden will begin manufacturing at scale to meet initial demand from pilot customers and is hoping to expand its product line to include medical blister packs in addition to the coffee pods.âA pilot plant on the products weâre looking at is a pilot plant that can generate 20 million units a year,â said Gordon.Both men are hoping that their product â and others like it â can usher in a generation of new sustainable packaging materials that are better for the environment at every stage of their life cycle.âThe next generation of packaging will be betterâ¦ there are plant-based flexibles for your salads, for your potato chipsâ¦ [But] the next generation of molded packaging is usâ¦ bioplastic will ultimately go.â",4.0,4_plastic_robots_robot_recycling,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,bioplastic thermoform,slightly better bioplastic method,,,

Devices watch the frequency and adjust their power output according to the frequency's changes. Credit: NRELDuring a power outage or after a disaster, it is hard to beat the simplicity of a diesel generator. Just supply fuel and start it upâso easy, anyone could do it. Renewable microgrids, on the other hand, are not so simple, with their suite of controls, software, and asset coordination. But the beauty of renewables is that fuel is free and already available on-site, even in remote disaster areas.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has now published a description of the improvised controls that saved NREL during its own outage, which could make microgrids easy and low cost where they are needed most.The publication, titled ""Unleashing the Frequency: Multi-Megawatt Demonstration of 100% Renewable Power Systems with Decentralized Communication-less Control Scheme,"" describes a microgrid approach that sidesteps the central controllerâan expensive and complicated componentâand its reliance on communications, instead using native controls of battery, solar, and wind systems.""NREL's approach makes it possible to assemble devices into a microgrid without arduous configuration, relying on just renewable energy and amateur electrical experienceâperfect for recoveries in a pinch,"" said Przemyslaw Koralewicz, NREL engineer and co-developer of the communication-less method.A low-cost recovery resourceWhen NREL experienced a surprise power outage, the laboratory had few options for recovery: No microgrid controller and no preconfigured setup. Just a large battery, solar panels, and wind turbines. Other campusesâor districts, neighborhoods, and homesâcould find themselves in similar circumstances, and during an outage is no time to be fumbling with complicated configurations. Like NREL, communities can now implement a resilient microgrid off the cuff, using controls that exist on essentially any energy resource.While microgrids are an apparent answer for recovery and resilience, the costs of a controller present a barrier to communities. In 2019, NREL found that microgrid controllers have a mean cost of $155,000/megawatt, potentially putting resilient microgrids out of reach for vulnerable areas.Besides costs, controllers introduce a tangle of communications and system settings, often opaque, proprietary, and designed to suit particular scenarios. These features can be useful for minimizing energy use and costs, but recoveries often call for a quick-and-ready option. NREL's method prioritizes fail-safe startup, foregoing elaborate programs and communications in favor of exceedingly basic controls, while still allowing more advanced designs to be built on top.Developers of the communication-less microgrid method observe the NREL Flatirons Campus' battery energy storage systems. Credit: Dennis Schroeder, NRELHow does it work?NREL's scheme is decentralizedâthe devices do not exchange data or issue commands (i.e., they are ""communication-less""). Instead, devices self-regulate using system frequency as the common language. In short, a battery or other power source forms the grid by supplying power at a set frequency. Other generators like solar panels and wind turbines follow the grid by watching frequency and changing their power accordingly.The method is nothing too newâso-called ""droop"" controls are familiar in standard fossil fuel generatorsâwhich is part of the appeal. The NREL researchers showed that the method works with 100% renewable energy, can be scaled, and is feasible with most any energy device.What is innovative is that NREL's method frees the grid frequency from a tight 60 hertz (Hz). Unbound by mechanical rotation, the microgrid frequency can take a wider range. In fact, that range is precisely how the devices coordinate without communicating: As frequency rises past 60 Hz, generators reduce power. At even higher frequencies, the generators reduce their power further, rebalancing the frequency around 60 Hz. The system self-stabilizes, never overcharging the batteries or underserving the loads.If this sounds more difficult than a diesel generator, it might be. It still requires some device programming and parameter setting, which are detailed in the report.""NREL's method is the very first step in a design that could become the standard for fail-safe microgrids,"" Koralewicz said. ""Our communication-less method could be natively configured in future devices or possibly certified for easy access by operators. With standardized adoption, microgrids of any typeâmilitary bases, hospital backups, even networked districtsâcould count on an unfailing foundation to their day-to-day operations.""The frontier of renewable energy systemsAt the frontier of power systems, engineers are addressing the technical matters of operating the grid with mostly renewables. Outstanding questions relate to inverters, which are the power electronic devices that interface renewable energy to the grid, and particularly, how inverters can form the grid in ways that fossil-based resources traditionally have. The UNIFI consortium is taking on the inverter challenge with the combined effort of dozens of research institutions, led by NREL.NREL's communication-less method is one example of a grid-forming strategy, the sort that will be needed as systems push toward higher levels of renewables. In proposing the method, NREL is breaking ground into some of the trickier topics that confront UNIFI and power systems everywhere, such as how to handle grid protection and which controls should be essential on grid-forming devices. The authors approach these questions in the report, offering one direction that future energy systems can take on the path to decarbonization.",1.0,1_solar_electric_power_energy,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,frequency controlled microgrid,microgrid without a central controller that adjusts automatically according to distance from 60 Hz,,,

But of course, the problem is that cities are unlikely to stop building, and growiing.Some estimates say that if global urban growth continues at its current pace, then weâd build a New York City every month for the next 40 years. So if we could reduce this amount or transition, this growth to ânet zeroâ (or better), weâd would do to a lot alleviate the impending, and disastrous, affects of climate change. This is why we are seeing so many new climate funds appear, which are concentrating on the built environment.A large part of this problem is that concrete and steel are just not sustainable materials, unlike (say) timber.Now, â011hâ, based out of Barcelona, thinks it might have the answer.Currently, the building processes that use manual labor and usustainalble materials donât pass muster, so if you can standardize and digitize the building process to make it repeatable and scalable (says 011h) while shifting sustainable materials â like mass timber â you can allow architects, builders, developers and investors to make net-zero buildings faster, cheaper and more sustainable.It all sounds lovely in theory, but in fact 011h says it has already completed such a project with Renta CorporaciÃ³n, a publicly traded developer, where the âembodied carbonâ of the building was reduced by more than 90% compared to conventional methods, while construction timelines were reduced by 35%. This has led to three more major projects being commissioned.No doubt partly as a result of this, 011h has now raised a significant â¬25 million in Series A funding. The funding round was led by Redalpine, accompanied by Seaya Andromeda and Breega, with the participation of Aldea Ventures, among others. Previous investors also joined the round, including Giuseppe Zocco, Foundamental and A/O Proptech, which accelerates 011hâs ambition to create a sustainably built world.The funding will be used to further develop 011hâs platform, building system and team, initially focusing on Spain, then internationally.Lucas CarnÃ©, co-founder and co-CEO of 011h, said the impact of reducing the carbon footprint of building canât be iunderestimated: âIf the embodied carbon of every building were reduced by more than 90%, this would reduce 10% of annual global CO 2 emissions, this is equivalent to three gigatonnes of CO 2 every year. In real terms, this is almost 2x more carbon than completely transitioning from petrol to electric vehicles; and is equivalent to eliminating 1 billion domestic gas boilers,â he told me.Harald Nieder, general partner of Redalpine, added in a statement: âAt Redalpine, we believe that there are massive opportunities around sustainability. In fact, the opportunities are such that we are not looking for marginal improvements of the status quo. We are looking for teams that are aiming to have a real impact, worthy of the global challenges we are facing. Construction is both one of the most unsustainable industries and one of the least digital and the 011h vision is exactly what we were looking to support.â",2.0,2_climate_tech_fund_change,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,wooden construction platform,use of wood to reduce emissions,,,

arxiv2,,Evolutionary dynamics with game transitions,"  The environment has a strong influence on a population's evolutionary
dynamics. Driven by both intrinsic and external factors, the environment is
subject to continual change in nature. To capture an ever-changing environment,
we consider a model of evolutionary dynamics with game transitions, where
individuals' behaviors together with the games they play in one time step
influence the games to be played next time step. Within this model, we study
the evolution of cooperation in structured populations and find a simple rule:
weak selection favors cooperation over defection if the ratio of the benefit
provided by an altruistic behavior, $b$, to the corresponding cost, $c$,
exceeds $k-k'$, where $k$ is the average number of neighbors of an individual
and $k'$ captures the effects of the game transitions. Even if cooperation
cannot be favored in each individual game, allowing for a transition to a
relatively valuable game after mutual cooperation and to a less valuable game
after defection can result in a favorable outcome for cooperation. In
particular, small variations in different games being played can promote
cooperation markedly. Our results suggest that simple game transitions can
serve as a mechanism for supporting prosocial behaviors in highly-connected
populations.

arxiv6,,Sensing Data Fusion for Enhanced Indoor Air Quality Monitoring,"  Multisensor fusion of air pollutant data in smart buildings remains an
important input to address the well-being and comfort perceived by their
inhabitants. An integrated sensing system is part of a smart building where
real-time indoor air quality data are monitored round the clock using sensors
and operating in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment. In this work, we
propose an air quality management system merging indoor air quality index
(IAQI) and humidex into an enhanced indoor air quality index (EIAQI) by using
sensor data on a real-time basis. Here, indoor air pollutant levels are
measured by a network of waspmote sensors while IAQI and humidex data are fused
together using an extended fractional-order Kalman filter (EFKF). According to
the obtained EIAQI, overall air quality alerts are provided in a timely fashion
for accurate prediction with enhanced performance against measurement noise and
nonlinearity. The estimation scheme is implemented by using the
fractional-order modeling and control (FOMCON) toolbox. A case study is
analysed to prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach.

arxiv7,,Secondary Use of Electronic Health Record: Opportunities and Challenges,"  In present technological era, healthcare providers generate huge amount of
clinical data on daily basis. Generated clinical data is stored digitally in
the form of Electronic Health Records (EHR) as a central data repository of
hospitals. Data contained in EHR is not only used for the patients' primary
care but also for various secondary purposes such as clinical research,
automated disease surveillance and clinical audits for quality enhancement.
Using EHR data for secondary purposes without consent or in some cases even
with consent creates privacy issues for individuals. Secondly, EHR data is also
made accessible to various stake holders including different government
agencies at various geographical sites through wired or wireless networks.
Sharing of EHR across multiples agencies makes it vulnerable to cyber attacks
and also makes it difficult to implement strict privacy laws as in some cases
data is shared with organization that is governed by specific regional law.
Privacy of an individual could be severely affected when their sensitive
private information contained in EHR is leaked or exposed to public. Data leak
can cause financial losses or an individuals may encounter social boycott if
their medical condition is exposed in public. To protect patients personal data
from such threats, there exists different privacy regulations such as GDPR,
HIPAA and MHR. However, continually evolving state-of-the-art techniques in
machine learning, data analytics and hacking are making it even more difficult
to completely protect individual's / patient's privacy. In this article, we
have systematically examined various secondary uses of EHR with the aim to
highlight how these secondary uses effect patients' privacy. Secondly, we have
critically analyzed GDPR and highlighted possible areas of improvement,
considering escalating use of technology and different secondary uses of EHR.

arxiv10,,IMDfence: Architecting a Secure Protocol for Implantable Medical Devices,"  Over the past decade, focus on the security and privacy aspects of
implantable medical devices (IMDs) has intensified, driven by the multitude of
cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in various existing devices. However, due
to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional
security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes
have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of
security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require.
In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that
provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes
availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote
monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access
that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without
compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security
protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively
analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security
requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption,
and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint,
respectively.

arxiv34,,American Sign Language Recognition Using RF Sensing,"  Many technologies for human-computer interaction have been designed for
hearing individuals and depend upon vocalized speech, precluding users of
American Sign Language (ASL) in the Deaf community from benefiting from these
advancements. While great strides have been made in ASL recognition with video
or wearable gloves, the use of video in homes has raised privacy concerns,
while wearable gloves severely restrict movement and infringe on daily life.
Methods: This paper proposes the use of RF sensors for HCI applications serving
the Deaf community. A multi-frequency RF sensor network is used to acquire
non-invasive, non-contact measurements of ASL signing irrespective of lighting
conditions. The unique patterns of motion present in the RF data due to the
micro-Doppler effect are revealed using time-frequency analysis with the
Short-Time Fourier Transform. Linguistic properties of RF ASL data are
investigated using machine learning (ML). Results: The information content,
measured by fractal complexity, of ASL signing is shown to be greater than that
of other upper body activities encountered in daily living. This can be used to
differentiate daily activities from signing, while features from RF data show
that imitation signing by non-signers is 99\% differentiable from native ASL
signing. Feature-level fusion of RF sensor network data is used to achieve
72.5\% accuracy in classification of 20 native ASL signs. Implications: RF
sensing can be used to study dynamic linguistic properties of ASL and design
Deaf-centric smart environments for non-invasive, remote recognition of ASL. ML
algorithms should be benchmarked on native, not imitation, ASL data.

arxiv35,,Indoor Localization Techniques Within a Home Monitoring Platform,"  This paper details a number of indoor localization techniques developed for
real-time monitoring of older adults. These were developed within the framework
of the i-Light research project that was funded by the European Union. The
project targeted the development and initial evaluation of a configurable and
cost-effective cyber-physical system for monitoring the safety of older adults
who are living in their own homes. Localization hardware consists of a number
of custom-developed devices that replace existing luminaires. In addition to
lighting capabilities, they measure the strength of a Bluetooth Low Energy
signal emitted by a wearable device on the user. Readings are recorded in real
time and sent to a software server for analysis. We present a comparative
evaluation of the accuracy achieved by several server-side algorithms,
including Kalman filtering, a look-back heuristic as well as a neural
network-based approach. It is known that approaches based on measuring signal
strength are sensitive to the placement of walls, construction materials used,
the presence of doors as well as existing furniture. As such, we evaluate the
proposed approaches in two separate locations having distinct building
characteristics. We show that the proposed techniques improve the accuracy of
localization. As the final step, we evaluate our results against comparable
existing approaches.

This gave the client the ability to check available parking spaces and reserve

recovered by the mobile application which offers many options attractively and
with no cost to users and lets the user check reservation details. With IoT
technology, the smart parking system can be connected wirelessly to easily

arxiv52,,Real Time Vigilance Detection using Frontal EEG,"  Vigilance of an operator is compromised in performing many monotonous
activities like workshop and manufacturing floor tasks, driving, night shift
workers, flying, and in general any activity which requires keen attention of
an individual over prolonged periods of time. Driver or operator fatigue in
these situations leads to drowsiness and lowered vigilance which is one of the
largest contributors to injuries and fatalities amongst road accidents or
workshop floor accidents. Having a vigilance monitoring system to detect drop
in vigilance in these situations becomes very important.
  This paper presents a system which uses non-invasively recorded Frontal EEG
from an easy-to-use commercially available Brain Computer Interface wearable
device to determine the vigilance state of an individual. The change in the
power spectrum in the Frontal Theta Band (4-8Hz) of an individual's brain wave
predicts the changes in the attention level of an individual - providing an
early detection and warning system. This method provides an accurate, yet cheap
and practical system for vigilance monitoring across different environments.

arxiv62,,Time-Optimal Planning for Quadrotor Waypoint Flight,"  Quadrotors are among the most agile flying robots. However, planning
time-optimal trajectories at the actuation limit through multiple waypoints
remains an open problem. This is crucial for applications such as inspection,
delivery, search and rescue, and drone racing. Early works used polynomial
trajectory formulations, which do not exploit the full actuator potential
because of their inherent smoothness. Recent works resorted to numerical
optimization but require waypoints to be allocated as costs or constraints at
specific discrete times. However, this time allocation is a priori unknown and
renders previous works incapable of producing truly time-optimal trajectories.
To generate truly time-optimal trajectories, we propose a solution to the time
allocation problem while exploiting the full quadrotor's actuator potential. We
achieve this by introducing a formulation of progress along the trajectory,
which enables the simultaneous optimization of the time allocation and the
trajectory itself. We compare our method against related approaches and
validate it in real-world flights in one of the world's largest motion-capture

arxiv76,,Sidewalk Measurements from Satellite Images: Preliminary Findings,"  Large-scale analysis of pedestrian infrastructures, particularly sidewalks,
is critical to human-centric urban planning and design. Benefiting from the
rich data set of planimetric features and high-resolution orthoimages provided
through the New York City Open Data portal, we train a computer vision model to
detect sidewalks, roads, and buildings from remote-sensing imagery and achieve
83% mIoU over held-out test set. We apply shape analysis techniques to study
different attributes of the extracted sidewalks. More specifically, we do a
tile-wise analysis of the width, angle, and curvature of sidewalks, which aside
from their general impacts on walkability and accessibility of urban areas, are
known to have significant roles in the mobility of wheelchair users. The
preliminary results are promising, glimpsing the potential of the proposed
approach to be adopted in different cities, enabling researchers and
practitioners to have a more vivid picture of the pedestrian realm.

arxiv81,,Posture Prediction for Healthy Sitting using a Smart Chair,"  Poor sitting habits have been identified as a risk factor to musculoskeletal
disorders and lower back pain especially on the elderly, disabled people, and
office workers. In the current computerized world, even while involved in
leisure or work activity, people tend to spend most of their days sitting at
computer desks. This can result in spinal pain and related problems. Therefore,
a means to remind people about their sitting habits and provide recommendations
to counterbalance, such as physical exercise, is important. Posture recognition
for seated postures have not received enough attention as most works focus on
standing postures. Wearable sensors, pressure or force sensors, videos and
images were used for posture recognition in the literature. The aim of this
study is to build Machine Learning models for classifying sitting posture of a
person by analyzing data collected from a chair platted with two 32 by 32
pressure sensors at its seat and backrest. Models were built using five
algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Na\""ive Bayes, Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machine and Deep Neural Network (DNN). All the models are
evaluated using KFold cross-validation technique. This paper presents
experiments conducted using the two separate datasets, controlled and
realistic, and discusses results achieved at classifying six sitting postures.
Average classification accuracies of 98% and 97% were achieved on the
controlled and realistic datasets, respectively.

arxiv88,,Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Contact Tracing Without User Intervention,"  Previous contact tracing systems required the users to perform many manual
actions, such as installing smartphone applications, joining wireless networks,
or carrying custom user devices. This increases the barrier to entry and lowers
the user adoption rate. As a result, the contact tracing effectiveness is
reduced. Unlike the systems above, we propose a new privacy preserving Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth (BLE) contact tracing system that does not require smartphone
applications, joining wireless networks, or custom user devices. Our specially
built routers seamlessly track smartphones, laptops, smartwatches, BLE
headphones, and tablets without any user action, but do not trace user
identity. Mapping between devices and users is only carried out for confirmed
cases and suspected contacts. Moreover, we can track the absolute positions of
user devices within 1.0 m due to using bidirectional long short-term memory
neural networks that are trained with data pre-collected by an autonomous
robot. This allows public health authorities to track indirect droplet and
surface transmissions that other contact tracing systems often overlook.

with only six-axis Inertial-Measurement-Unit (IMU) sensor data. The presented
approach can adapt to various walking conditions by adopting differential and
window based input. The training data are further augmented by sliding and
random window samplings on IMU sensor data to increase data diversity for
better performance. The proposed approach fuses predictions of three
dimensional output into one model. The proposed fused model can achieve average
error of 2.30+-2.23 cm in X-axis, 0.91+-0.95 cm in Y-axis and 0.58+-0.52 cm in
Z-axis.

arxiv99,,Internet of Things (IoT) based ECG System for Rural Health Care,"  Nearly 30% of the people in the rural areas of Bangladesh are below the
poverty level. Moreover, due to the unavailability of modernized
healthcare-related technology, nursing and diagnosis facilities are limited for
rural people. Therefore, rural people are deprived of proper healthcare. In
this perspective, modern technology can be facilitated to mitigate their health
problems. ECG sensing tools are interfaced with the human chest, and requisite
cardiovascular data is collected through an IoT device. These data are stored
in the cloud incorporates with the MQTT and HTTP servers. An innovative
IoT-based method for ECG monitoring systems on cardiovascular or heart patients
has been suggested in this study. The ECG signal parameters P, Q, R, S, T are
collected, pre-processed, and predicted to monitor the cardiovascular
conditions for further health management. The machine learning algorithm is
used to determine the significance of ECG signal parameters and error rate. The
logistic regression model fitted the better agreements between the train and
test data. The prediction has been performed to determine the variation of
PQRST quality and its suitability in the ECG Monitoring System. Considering the
values of quality parameters, satisfactory results are obtained. The proposed
IoT-based ECG system reduces the health care cost and complexity of
cardiovascular diseases in the future.

eit217,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-invests-eur-3m-early-detection-cancer,EIT RawMaterials: advanced training for mining industry professionals,"Practical training and learning over the mining value chain are among the key components of lifelong knowledge building of mining experts and recognised as a challenge in the development of sustainable mining sector. However, its not so easy to find meaningful training opportunities, with the possibility of hands-on experiences of the multiple activities taking place in an operating mine. The EIT RawMaterials-supportedMINETRAIN project was launched in 2018 to evaluate the potential of the shortly-closing Pyhsalmi mine in Finland as an educational and training underground facility, and thus, prolong the utility of the existing modern mine site by introducing new business opportunities. One of the major objectives of the project is to produce and test practical training programmes for mining professionals at the Pyhsalmi mine. Pyhsalmi facilities enable training in all disciplines related to the overall mine value chain with the opportunity to test both skills and equipment in an authentic environment. Hence, the project has potential in providing education for sustainable management of any phase of mining operations. In summer 2019, MINETRAIN launched its first pilot course with 45 professionals from all over the globe joining an online course. Fourteenpeople were then selected for one-week practical training at the Pyhsalmi mine site in August 2019. The course was developed to cover topics across the whole lifecycle of a mine. The course received the highest possible evaluations from the professional learners. Professionals emphasised the significance that the practical onsite training had for them. MINETRAIN gave meaning to the theory and improved the understanding of the bigger picture of mining at the various phases of the mine life. It was a great experience to learn different ways of doing mining and know more about the latest technology related to the care of the environment. At the same time thinking of networking, it was really helpful to meet miners from all around the world. The next MINETRAIN course will focus on new mining technology and will be held in summer 2020. After an online module, professionals will be able to use the latest equipment at Sandvik test mine in Tampere, Finland. MINETRAIN is a three-year project funded by EIT RawMaterials.

There is a complex value chain here, starting with the exploration, mining, processing and production of raw materials, all the way through to their being sold to consumers. There are human and automated processes, developed and developing countries, and a variety of tolerances working together here in the face of a whole host of ethical, environmental and social considerations. Dr Andreas Klossek,Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials The decision-makers within industrial enterprises are obliged to verify the origins of the raw materials used for their products far more stringently. These days, the issue of sustainability can have a major influence on peoples decisions to buy products. Governments and communities are setting legal parameters. NGOs are taking a critical look at the countries of origin and at the supply chain as a whole. The modern-day consumer gives consideration to product origins and environmental aspects not only when it comes to food, but also increasingly with regard to clothing, electrical goods and the entire area of mobility. This is prompting companies to take a stance and to review their ethical, environmental and sustainable footprint. Get the best of the EITs news once each month In the past, this was left to the individual market players to address themselves  each and every exploration or mining company, every mineral processor, every shipping company, every manufacturer or service provider had to monitor their own internal or external standards. And they had to do so in a range of areas such as corruption, environmental impacts, labour conditions, child labour, social issues and corporate governance. The result which has evolved over time is an inefficient, inconsistent and fragmented landscape of raw material certification standards in which sustainability is defined differently from country to country, from mineral to mineral and from organisation to organisation. This hampers transparency within the supply chain and the verifiability of the parameters at a time when sustainability is evolving from being a cost factor to being an investment that is crucial to success. This was the starting point for theCERA innovation project. In terms of tonnage, around three quarters of all imports to the European Union are raw materials, the majority of which come from developing countries. We in Europe and in Germany therefore bear a particularresponsibility for the conditionsunder which raw materials are mined. Its all about observing standards, verifying the legality of mining and safeguarding investments, and about operational reliability and environmental impacts. A first step was taken in this regard with the adoption of theEU Regulationon conflict resources. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials According to Dr Klossek, a great deal more will be achieved with CERA. He added that it will be possible for the origins of raw materials to be unequivocally proven with the aid of a standardised analytical and comprehensive certification system which guarantees the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the exploration, mining, processing, trading and production of all mineral raw materials. Guarantees based on audit processes which can be scrutinised externally and covering the entire value chain  much like well to wheel considerations for the environmental footprints of fuels, we need a 'mine to product' consideration of raw materials. The Certification ofraw materials (CERA) EIT RawMaterials is co-financing the development of the CERA standard and is supporting the introduction of the network to the mining community and to all other raw material-related sectors. It is also assuming three important roles. As an innovator, we are actively supporting technological developments that will help us achieve our goals, such as fingerprinting based on the analysis of trace elements and the use of blockchain software to verifiably track trade and transport routes. As an incubator, we are ensuring that such technologies make it to market maturity. We promote young companies, offer networking between researchers and businesses, and see to it that innovations are embraced sooner. Because it is a lot easier for us as a large network to achieve what an individual company, university or research institution is perhaps not able to. Dr Andreas Klossek,Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials One of the CERA partners is one of its initiatorsDMT, which has close to 300 years of experience in the area of raw materials. Another isTV NORD CERT, which has great expertise regarding the existing certification and auditing systems. In turn, these two companies collaborate with the mining universityMontanuniversitt Leobenin Austria, theInstitute of Environmental Sciences at Leiden Universityin the Netherlands and the independent non-profit research centreRISE SICSin Sweden, as well as with companies such asLTU Business AB, likewise based in Sweden. The partners on the Advisory Board such asFairphoneandVolkswagen AGare, of course, just as important, as they ultimately represent the customer side of raw materials trading. Basically, any company is welcome to join us as a partner when we establish the CERA Association  the more companies that get involved, the sooner we will achieve the necessary market penetration and therefore also the desired level of transparency. Because only if we provide reliable information can the consumer make informed decisions regarding their manufacturer or product preferences. CERA will make this possible in Europe for the first time. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Transforming healthcare with AI: The impact on the workforce and organisations', a Europe-wide report published on 03 March 2020 explores the impact of AI on healthcare practitioners, as well as the implications and obstacles for scaling AI in healthcare organisations and systems. The report includes a survey of 175 people on the frontline of healthcare delivery, and interviews with 62 decision-makers, and is complemented by macroeconomic analyses from the work of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). Subscribe now to the EITs monthly newsletter Along with exploring the effect AI will have on the future of European healthcare and its workforce, the report highlights the need to define new organisational models and skillsets that healthcare professionals will need to support the adoption and scaling of AI. It also outlines the new types of talent that the healthcare sector will need to attract. The report finds that basic digital skills, biomedical and data science, data analysis, and the fundamentals of genomics will be critical, if AI and machine learning is to penetrate healthcare services. These subjects are rarely taught alongside traditional clinical sciences systematically. And so, through no fault of their own, todays healthcare workforce is simply not yet equipped for the adoption of AI. Jorge Fernndez Garca, Director of Innovation at EIT Health Download the EIT's AI report The incentives for healthcare systems to embrace these changes are clear. TheWorld Health Organisation (WHO) estimatesthat by 2030 the world will be short of 9.9 million doctors, nurses and midwives, which adds further urgency to address the challenge of already overburdened health systems. Supporting the widespread adoption and scaling of AI could help alleviate resource capacity shortfalls both now and in the future, for example, by streamlining or even eliminating administrative tasks, which can occupy anything between 20 and 80 percent of a healthcare professionals time,according to the WHO. Being at the forefront of healthcare innovation in Europe, we are seeing an increasing number of tangible, impactful and exciting AI solutions created. However, we must couple the generation of new technology that can relieve some of the pressure on healthcare services, with the ability for it to be integrated into care delivery. Now is the time for us to address the gaps, so that Europe does not fall behind in the application of AI. Jorge Fernndez Garca, Director of Innovation at EIT Health Besides upskilling, better involvement of healthcare professionals in the early stages of AI development was also identified in the report as a key need. Of the healthcare stakeholders interviewed for the report, 44% said they had never been involved in the development or deployment of an AI solution. AI has enormous potential to improve productivity and efficiency in health systems and make them more sustainable  but more importantly, it has the potential to deliver better health outcomes for patients. It can do so in many ways, from enabling more preventive care, to allowing healthcare practitioners to spend more time on direct patient care. This joint report provides guidance for decision-makers to define their level of aspiration on AI and develop and implement the right approach for their organisation or health system. Dr. Angela Spatharou, Partner at McKinsey & Company Decision-makers interviewed for the report emphasised the need to develop scaling up training and suggested that national health systems should work together with healthcare professionals, academia and industryin order to support healthcare providers, in particular those who are not large enough to deliver such programmes alone. They also emphasised the importance of ensuring AI is ethical, transparent and trustworthy. This new report provides a unique view on the state-of-play and prospects of AI for healthcare in Europe, covering areas including: strengthening data quality, governance, security and interoperability, implementing a robust change management strategy, addressing issues around regulation, policy-making and liability, redefining funding and reimbursement models and criteria for investment, and designing how disciplines can work better together to improve quality.

Peak load conditions, taking place when multiple users are accessing a website application concurrently, can be a nightmare for IT departments: crashes and slowdowns in these situations, are far too common and even a limited 2-hour crash can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost revenues. Typically, such issues are linked to a new product release, breaking news or a sales opening which causes a significant and sudden increase in traffic. A resilient and scalable system, in these circumstances, can make all the difference between failure and success. Some successful companies have measured the exact impact of performances on their business:Amazon estimatesthat only 100 ms latency equals -1% in sales, whereas theBBCsaw a 10% decrease in users because of a 1-second latency. Gatlings load-test-as-code approach and its interoperability make it possible to perform load tests very early in the development lifecycle and to automate them. Moreover,Gatlingpromotes a collaborative approach of load testing within organizations, involving all their departments, from IT to Marketing. Today, everyone talks about scalability. But you cant scale your business if your app is not scalable. Dont let your app become a victim of its own success: test it! Paul-Henri Pillet, Gatling co-founder and CEO Gatling brought major changes in the load testing industry since it was created in mid-2015. Today, it has customers on 5 continents and doubles its revenues each year. 'Gatling has an impressive proposition: a superior technology bundled with a disruptive approach. They are enabling developers to test as they code, making it suddenly possible to fit with Agile and Continuous Delivery models which are so critical for those websites and apps facing massive numbers of visitors such as e-retail, media and banks,' said EIT Digitals business developer Gilles Allain. The scaleups R&D efforts target the latest trends in the tech world, including HTTP/2 support, load tests for Internet of Things, integrations with most of the cloud providers of the market (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack-based providers), integrations with Kubernetes and with most of the developers tools (source repositories, build tools, continuous integration solutions). 'We have become the reference solution for load testing, thanks to our investments in R&D over the years.

The project team examined several mine sites in different parts of Finland to assess the recovery potential of valuable metals from drainage water. Collected data were used to develop cost-effective water treatment and metals recovery methods. The upcoming months will bring new challenges, as the first pilot campaign on Ni & Co recovery is on its way. The need for raw materials, especially Rare Earth Elements (REE), is increasing rapidly in the EU and globally. At the same time, the amount of extractive waste is increasing drastically together with concerns related to the environmental effects of mining. The mining industry can achieve more eco-efficient and selective raw material production by enhancing the utilisation of side streams and mine waste. Subscribe now to the EIT's monthly newsletter Innovation project Morecovery aims to enhance the eco-efficient and sustainable use of natural resources creating a modular recovery process service package for hydrometallurgy and water treatment. The project will demonstrate that the modular pilot plant with selective metal recovery processes will work on a larger scale at target sites. Also, the organic adsorbents will be tested for efficient applications in semi-passive drainage water treatment and REE and base metal recovery. After this project, the water treatment pilot plant will be upscaled and proved to work in larger-scale process and adsorbent testing at hydrometallurgical process sites, widening significantly the current business opportunities. Organic adsorbents, e.g. biochars will be proved to be efficient in large scale hydrometallurgical processes and mine waste drainage treatment, becoming a useful part of the side stream utilisation and circular economy. The metal recovery processes at target sites will be enhanced in critical raw materials recovery. The modular recovery process service package including lab-scale services and a mobile pilot plant will be a powerful tool in developing utilisation and cleaning of mining side streams.

In the Digital Cities focus area, one of the key targets is increasing the feeling of safety and security of citizens. A pilot which was conducted in Helsinki at the end of last year hasshownhow this can be achieved.HexaLight,an IoT based lighting system designed to create an illuminated path for better navigation and wayfinding, was tested in the Hyvntoivonpuisto park of the Jtksaari neighbourhood in November 2019, the darkest time of the year in Helsinki. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter The system was developed in the context of the Get Home Safely innovation activity, led by Technical University BerlinsCyPhyLaband includingForum Virium Helsinki,Aalto University,Fraunhofer HHI,Telecom ItalyandFluxedoas project partners. With HexaLight, the lights act as navigation devices which brighten or change colour as the pedestrian approach them: this increases the feeling of safety in dark areas, which generally people perceive as potentially more dangerous. The knee-high lights are also designed to be cosy and visually appealing, making the district more atmospheric and improving the overall pleasantness of the area. The project has been piloted in Helsinki, Berlin and Matera. The Hyvntoivonpuisto location in Helsinki was selected based on responses to a survey and workshop conducted among the districts residents in the spring. The lights were meant to be networked and personalised at the same time: during the test period, in fact, residents were able to download theSkramobile application to their phones to change the colour of the park lights to fit their preferences. The results were positive. The lights delighted and created a sense of security. Heidi Heinonen,Project Manager at Forum Virium In addition to making people feel safer, the system could be leveraged by other stakeholders. Through the system, facility operators and security agencies, for instance, could gain in-depth insights of movement patterns in specific areas, especially in the evenings and at night. In other future scenarios, these smart and connected lights could also be used by city administrators or event organisers to monitor crowd movements in busy areas and to guide, if necessary, people to a less congested route.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subscribe now to the EIT's monthly newsletter Flooding and water scarcity in Europe will increase in the coming decades if the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change are not met. Several studies, including a Joint Research Centrestudy released in 2018, have looked at the impact of the changing climate, land use and water usage on Europes water resources. It is known that Southern European countries  particularly Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Turkey  are projected to face increased water shortages. Significant reductions in groundwater recharge are estimated for Spain, Portugal and Greece, with negative impacts on the environment and water availability for irrigation. Increasing droughts will lead to water scarcity and reduced hydropower potential in the Mediterranean region. This is likely to have a knock-on effect in agriculture, energy, transport and food security. With global freshwater consumption on the increase, European economies are being asked to tackle water scarcity by boosting resilient infrastructure, moving towards more circular economics and by enabling multi-stakeholdersgovernance, as these will determine the competitiveness of the European water industry. Therefore, water plays a central role in how societies mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. A holistic approach considering water, the biosphere and the anthroposphere is required to provide sustainable agricultural and economic systems that will allow EIT Community to decelerate climate change, protect us from extreme weather events, and adapt to the unavoidable at the same time. In 2020, the Knowledge and Innovation Communities will be establishing a group of experts on water scarcity in Southern Europe, delivering focused entrepreneur challenge labs for start-ups and organising the EIT Water Academy for water scarcity challenge education. The Knowledge and Innovation Communities will also be running the EIT workshops with public bodies and other stakeholders across different regions and communication activities to reach out to citizens and interested stakeholders, engaging in external events and with the media to raise awareness about water scarcity for citizens. In the upcoming weeks, EIT Community will be looking for experts including not only researchers but also policy-makers, representatives of NGOs, wider civil society organisations and private industry in who can provide valuable contributions to the multi-stakeholders perspective that we need to tackle these societal challenges. A call for experts will be launched soon  stay tuned! Although EIT Community shares one continent, European countries are divided because of disparities in innovation performance. This has resulted in the classification of European countries in two main groupsinnovation leaders and strong innovators versus moderate and modest innovators. One reason for lower innovation performance is weak linkages among the key playersbusinesses and research institutions and academia, as well as between the private and public sectors, including a systematic approach towards innovation. As a response to this challenge, the EIT RISwas introduced. The EIT RIS is designed for EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries in Europe who are modest and moderate innovators, and where Innovation Communities have few or no partners. Strategically, the Scheme is an additional offer to these countries to facilitate their engagement with the EIT Innovation Communities. The Schemes aim is to facilitate the access to services and programmes offered by the EIT Innovation Communities. Each Innovation Community cooperates with local innovators  individuals such asstudents, researchers, entrepreneurs,and organisationssuch as SMEs, universities, research labs, regions, NGOs and cities.The EIT Innovation Communities involve the local players in education, business creation and acceleration activities, as well as innovation-driven research.

What does a start-up journey after Health Venture Lab Reactor look like? Being an alumnus of this programme can probably open many doors, but can also help get access to the EIT Health flagship programmes. The reactor is a key component in the research to the commercialization pipeline. It provides the next step in our transatlantic collaboration with MITs Catalyst programme for the needs-based solution development, amplifies the opportunities offered by the Medical University of Lodz E-Lab, and sets start-ups up to be eligible for EIT Healths Scale-up programmes. What advice would you give to the undecided applicants who are looking for acceleration but are not sure which programme to choose? Those start-ups which are evaluating whether they should join an accelerator, and if so, which one to join, should ask themselves these questions: Is my product or service ready for commercialization? Do I have enough bandwidth in my team to productively participate in the programme? Who are the mentors in the accelerator programme? Do they represent the expertise and industry knowledge I need to actually advance my products? What are my specific customer acquisition goals in the next four months, and how can the Reactor help me achieve them faster? How can companies as GE Healthcare accelerate the CEE region together with the support of EIT Health? What does cooperation with EIT Health mean for you? The representatives from the partner Universities, GE Healthcares organisational department and its Research and Development teams, independent experts and business coaches provide teams with holistic advice. Experts from GE Healthcare provide crucial insight, real-world examples and advice on commercialising healthcare products. Their input covers topics like marketing, sales, building distribution networks and supply chains in detail, and with in-depth knowledge of the current trends.

EIT Climate-KIC, together with its partners the UN, the Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm Conventions (BRS), EIT RawMaterials, the International Telecommunication Union, KU Leuven and the World Resources Forum, has launched an updatedMassive Open Online Course (MOOC)on the e-waste challenge, also with contributions from the World Health Organization. Sign up now to the EIT newsletter Our MOOC highlights that e-waste is a societal challenge that also is part of a larger opportunity to create a prosperous zero carbon future, driven by innovation, jobs, and investment. EIT Climate-KIC is seizing that opportunity by connecting both public and private sectors with climate change-focused education, research and innovation. Ideas are the oxygen of growth in the zero-carbon economy, and I am convinced that this collaboration with UNEP will spark many new ones. Solveig Zophoniasdottir, EIT Climate-KICs Learning Services Lead 'This MOOC will introduce you to the challenge of e-waste and especially to its environmentally sound recycling. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to impacts of e-waste processing on health. In some countries they represent as much as 30 per cent of the workforce. When women and girls are affected in this way as the mothers of today and tomorrow, our common future is affected too. The course will guide you through the problem, to opportunities, and to possible actions at local, national and regional levels, and will introduce you to policy tools, standards and best practices for the collection, recycling, and final disposal of e-waste', said Rolph Payet, BRS Executive Secretary. I have always believed that information and communication technologies (ICTs) have a vital role to play in combatting the major environmental challenges facing the world, such as climate change and e-waste. So, I am especially pleased to support this MOOC which will enable stakeholders across the worlin developing and developed countries aliketo access valuable e-waste resources, insights, best practices, standards and tools, and translate these into practical actions to protect peoples health and the environment. Malcolm Johnson, ITU (International Telecommunication Union) Deputy Secretary-General 'E-waste is a serious health problem affecting millions of young children, adolescents, future mothers to-be. These are people who work in dangerous conditions to retrieve precious metals to earn money to support their families. This work exposes them to dangerous chemicals, heavy metals, toxic air. E-waste pollutes their communities, their homes, their schools, their soil, their food, and the air they breathe. We urgently need to have e-waste very clearly identified as a health problem. As the health agency of the United Nations, WHOs duty is to communicate the evidence, the information, the tools we have available to address this emerging health hazard. We must raise awareness, and advocate for multisectoral policies that promote and protect our childrens health and their rights,'added Maria Neira, Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, at the World Health Organization (WHO). Karel Van Acker, professor in Circular Economy at KU Leuven in Belgium and a member of EIT RawMaterials, mentioned the huge opportunities of a circular economy for electronics in saving resources, lowering the environmental footprint and recovering value, and the close link it has with climate change mitigation. According to Bas de Leeuw, Managing Director of the World Resources Forum, the relaunch of the MOOC on E-waste comes very timely. Circular Economy is attracting worldwide attention, in particular stimulated by the programs of the European Commission and others. We need to make sure that this not only makes sense for the environment but also for the economy, and for wellbeing and human development in developing countries. At the WRF we have hands-on experience in this field through our Sustainable Recycling Industries (SRI) program, and we are very pleased to be able to share our knowledge and skills to the wider community. Making standardswhich is a core priority in our portfoliois one thing, turning them into action requires further capacity building and supporting all stakeholders in the value chains. Bas de Leeuw, Managing Director of the World Resources Forum E-waste is a fast-growing waste stream and poses a number of serious threats to human health and the environment. Conversely, if undertaken in an environmentally sound manner, e-waste recycling can offer sustainable livelihoods, green and decent work, and contribute to the development of a circular economy. The course opens on Tuesday, 18 February, and is aimed at students and researchers, policy-makers in the environment and telecommunication sector, practitioners, entrepreneurs, e-waste recyclers and government officials and invites participants to become part of the solution to this growing problem. Relevant for developed and developing countries alike, the eight-week programme covers all aspects of e-waste with a view to turn the threat of this global explosion of e-waste into an opportunity. The course is organised in five mini-courses which could be taken one after the other or independently. The MOOC explores and explains the Basel Convention technical guidelines on transboundary movements of electrical and electronic waste and used electrical and electronic equipment, in particular regarding the distinction between waste and non-waste. E-waste can be classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention due to the presence of toxic materials such as mercury, lead and brominated flame retardants which include some polybrominated diphenyl ethers listed in the annexes to the Stockholm Convention. E-waste may also contain precious metals such as gold, copper and nickel and rare materials of strategic value such as indium and palladium. These precious and heavy metals could be recovered, recycled and used as valuable source of secondary raw materials.

EIT Food Seedbed Programme 2020 However, the agri-food sector is already facing growing competition and scarcity of land, water and energy for food production which will affect theability to produce this food. This lack of available resources is expected to be exacerbated by climate change, where up to 40% of the world will develop unfamiliar climates with completely new combinations of temperatures and seasonality of rainfall. As a result, these changing weather patterns are expected to disrupt food availability, reduce access to food and affect food quality and safety. Where food is constrained, prices may rise and this introduces a greater risk of food fraud. Simultaneously, around one in three people are already suffering some form of malnutrition, whether that be hunger, micronutrient deficiency, overweight or obesity, whilst one billion people suffer from hidden hunger. It is evident that EIT Community needs to reconsider how peopleproduce, distribute, value and consume food. In particular, innovations in technology are forecasted to play an important role in transforming the food system and achieving global food security for future generations. The EIT Food Seedbed programme supports technology and business-savvy agri-food entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and early-stage startups who are looking to validate their minimum viable product and test their assumptions through a unique customer journey discovery programme. Sign up now to the EIT newsletter Nowopen for 2020 applications, EIT Food Seedbed Programme is designed to address a number of key food system challenges that are urgently facing the global population by supporting state-of-the-art agri-food technologies across the entire food chain, from farm to fork. These technologies should have the potential to create productive, nutritious, safe, sustainable and transparent food systems which contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and teams should have a minimum viable product that is demonstrable to customers. Were particularly interested in the strength and experience of teams that apply, what their motivations are and how prepared they are to be an entrepreneur. A diversity of kinds of people is always a strength, as is complementary skills and a history of working together successfully. On a practical level, applicants should not have received more than EUR 50 000investment in relation to the development of their idea. As described, in order to achieve global food security for future generations, innovations in technology will play an important role in creating more trusted, sustainable, safe and profitable food systems and businesses. In particular, extensive data-enabled technologies are becoming more accessible and affordable - driving a revolution in how the food system operates, connecting stakeholders in the food chain and consumers in new and innovative ways to make the food chain more efficient and productive, reduce resource use and waste and open the door to new food chain collaborations and partnerships. Although not an exhaustive list, EIT Community encourages applications that fall within one of the following areas: The Seedbed team is especially excited by the solutions and rising levels of investment around food waste, as well as IoT and AI solutions for the agri-food sector - for instance, in solutions for smart farming. And on a broader note, it will be great to see how the diversity and inclusion initiatives that EIT Food is supporting in entrepreneurship are translated across theportfolio of programmes into stronger teams and groundbreaking innovations.

eit230,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-skill-one-million-tech-innovators-join-pledge,EIT Food: Can we trust the food industry?,"Answer the following question  Does the food industry produce healthy and sustainable food for me to eat? 1. Yes 2. No 3. Im not sure Have you chosen your answer? Read the post to help you decide. For most of us it is important that EIT Community can trust the food that people eat. EIT Community wants to know that the food is healthy, is produced sustainably and is safe for the consumption. However, a recentFoodThink study has found that almost half of consumers who frequently buy food for their households do not trust the food industry to do the right thing, and nearly a quarter actively distrust it. Sign up now to the EIT newsletter However, the food industry is made up of many key players, so who are they whomconsumers trust?EIT Foods TrustTrackerrecently asked 11 000 consumers across 13 European countries to rate their levels of trust in farmers, food manufacturers, retailers and authorities. They found that: As such, it is evident that consumers have different levels of trust for different actors within the food industry. While the industry has a long way to go to overcome low consumer trust, projects like theEIT Food TrustTracker are giving consumers a voice to express their views and concerns. EIT Food TrustTracker When buying food many people consider different things. For example, many of us think about how healthy the product is, how much it costs, where it was produced, and how fresh it is, amongmany other factors. EIT Food asked consumers across Europe whether they trust the food industry to meet their needs. Watch the video to hear what they had to say:  Many consumers explained why they do not trust the food industry. For example, one consumer suggested that 'selling is the only thing the food industry is interested in', while another explained how their need for affordable and high-quality food is not being met. However, others suggested that the food industry is meeting their needs. One consumer believed that 'we receive high-quality food', while another felt that food producers are making'a bit more effort to be transparent about ingredients'. Buying food that is healthy and sustainable is important to many of us and there are signs that the food industry is listening to what consumers want. For example, more people aredemanding plant-based proteinsthat are believed to behealthierandmore environmentally friendlythan animal-based proteins. EIT Food asked consumers what they thought about the future of protein, as alternative proteins and even insects start to emerge on the supermarket shelves. Watch the video to hear what they had to say:  Many consumers believe the food industry is starting to offer alternatives to animal-based proteins which are both healthy and sustainable. For example, one consumer explained, 'Ive tried so-called vegan burgers, some of them are really tasty', while another commented, 'if insects are available in supermarketsthen I would definitely buy them'. However, not all consumers were convinced. For example, one suggested that insect-based and plant-based proteins did not sound appetising while another consumer admitted that'insects scare me a little'. While it appears that many consumers are cautious about eating alternative proteins, the industry is listening to the consumers who do want to see more plant-based and insect-based options on offer, suggesting they are considering the health and environmental implications of what they produce. Despite efforts to deliver healthier and more sustainable food to consumers, the industry still needs to adapt. For example, the EIT Food TrustTracker found that there is alack of transparency and openness from the industry which causes high levels of consumer distrust. Consumers want to know more about where their food comes from and what is in it. For example, many want to be able to trace their food back to its source and have a clearer understanding of the ingredients included. Some believe that a more digitalised food production process would ensure a more open and transparent journey for food, from fark to fork. EIT Foodasked consumers whether they believed a digitalised food system would help them make more informed food choices. For many, they believed an increased digitalised food industrywhere people could see the journey of their food from farm to forkwould be useful when determining what foods to buy. Do you agree? As consumers, EIT Community can shape the future of the food industry. EIT Community can do this by:",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected todouble in the next 20 years to 8.2 billion air travellersthe emissions of the travel industry alonewill exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people dont realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the targeta 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levelsis still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Along with these reforms, EIT Community also needs bold, technological innovation to get off fossil jet fuel. EIT Climate-KIC has invested in a number of exponential technologies, such as electric helicopter taxiVolocopterand five-seater electric jetLilium, which are paving the way towards the aviation industrys dream: Electric flight. It will be a while before full-sized commercial aircraft go electric. Battery technology is not yet advanced enough to power planes for the distances they cover and weight they carry. Fuel is still 40 to 50 times more power-dense. With the average plane 100 times heavier than a mid-sized car, batteries need to become much more compact and more powerful per kilogram. However, there are already some promising experiments, with thefirst commercial electric flight flown by Harbour Air in December 2019. As EIT Community innovates its way to electric flight, alternative fuels can help to cut emissions.EIT Climate-KIC has supported SkyNRGa pioneer in sustainable aviation fuelin developing a supply chain for a fuel made from waste oils, including used chip fat. SkyNRG are developing a factory in Groningen to supply KLM and German multinational SHV Energy that will be Europes first facility to produce and supply sustainable fuel and bio propane. The fuel will lead to an 85 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions and will also reduce nitrous oxide and fine particulate matter. Although there is a similar amount of CO2 emitted during the flight, as the fuel is a chemically identical hydrocarbon, using waste oil and residues that would otherwise be destined for landfill eliminates the emissions from drilling, transporting, processing and refining fossil fuels. The ideal would be using CO2, water, and renewable electricity to create hydrogen, because its zero-emission and the waste product is water. But that technology is not yet ready to be scaled up Maarten van Dijk, SkyNRGs managing director Creating and supplying sustainable biofuels, such as the one SkyNRG has developed from waste oils, takes 8-10 years from the lab stage to production and hundreds of millions of euros. But van Dijk is not deterred by detractors who say alternative fuel development is too slow, or that it distracts attention and investment from electric flight. We need it all. First we have to reduce the amount of fossil fuel needed with everything we can do. Reduction of demand, smarter flying, better taxing. Then, electric! The more electric, the better. Then, we need to substitute whatever share jet fuel has left with sustainable fuel. Thats it. Maarten van Dijk, SkyNRGs managing director",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is also an absolute necessity; at the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), we are committed to playing our part in Europes drive towards global climate leadership. Delivering a sustainable future for Europe, with innovative, entrepreneurial education, is at the heart of our actions. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that at least 80 million workers in Europe are mismatched in terms of qualifications; and 44 percent of Europes adult population has little to no digital skills at all, with many companies lacking more advanced specialised skills. It is clear that we need to act fast. At the EIT, we believe education is a key tool to boost innovation, tackle pressing global challenges, and create new high-quality jobs in Europe. If we want the next generation of innovators and change-makers to be ready, now is the time for action. As part of the EIT Community, leading higher education, business, and research organisations across Europe work closely together on delivering EIT education programmes. We focus on guiding innovative thinking towards key societal challenges to ensure that innovation and new technologies improve quality of life and bring tangible benefits for citizens. From AI and digital solutions to cleantech, we encourage our students to turn technology applications into solutions with positive social impact. Our model for education is therefore exactly what Europe needs  a platform that develops a community for Europes top entrepreneurs and change makers. There is a significant gap in experiential entrepreneurial learning in Europe. That is why education for entrepreneurship and innovation skills are at the heart of the EITs strategic ambition, teaching students what they need to know to successfully start and run a business, and equipping them with the right skills to thrive in the digital age. Practical solutions are needed if tomorrows entrepreneurs are to tackle climate change and other pressing challenges such as cancer, sustainable energy, sustainable cities, food security and access to raw materials. The World Economic Forum has argued that Education should be like everything else. An on-demand service. Much like just about everything else, this generation expects its education to be personalised. Investing in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education is critical, but needs inspiring and creative approaches to become attractive to students. Our programmes, therefore, include master and doctoral programmes, executive training, and professional development courses, summer schools and online courses  aiming to provide a more consumer-friendly approach, or even education on-demand. Delivering more than 60 master programmes, in addition to several doctoral schools, through 80 universities spread across Europe, the EIT Community can speak of over 2,300 students having graduated from our leadership programmes. By the end of 2020, we project that over 5,000 students will hold an EIT degree. It is just the beginning, as the European Commission has proposed a new education initiative for the EIT that will see us work with an additional 450 universities across Europe, supporting their transition to more innovative and entrepreneurial organisations.   We should remember that our real potential is achieved through diversity and inclusion. So when we see that the average European start-up founder, for example, is male (82.8%) and holds a university degree (84.8%), its clear, there is a mountain still to be climbed; and the fact that less than 8% of investors and business angels in Europe are women, certainly doesnt help either. Therefore, at the EIT, we strive for a broader entrepreneurial demographic and a more gender-balanced entrepreneur profile. A first step towards achieving this is implementing a more female-friendly format, more inclusive of those in need of flexible learning. The EIT is reaching out todiverse groups, not just university students. We are training girls and young women in digital and entrepreneurial skills across Europe, promoting positive role models and enhancing digital and entrepreneurial skills to helptackle the gender gapand boost female participation in science, technology and business. Mobilising this untapped female potential is critical to Europes competitiveness, and one of the major goals we are setting ourselves. The European Commissions proposed new strategy for the EIT for 2021  2027 places us at the heart of the European Unions next Research and Innovation Programme  Horizon Europe  with a 25% budget increase and an increased ambition and mandate, including in the area of education. There is one more thing we all need to remember  we need to work together, we need to be better connected. We look forward to closer cooperation with other EU programmes. United and ambitious, Europe can challenge global competitors. By investing in education, entrepreneurship and innovation, we are creating a greener, healthier, more sustainable Europe.

The results were presented in a workshop held on 7 February 2019 in Huelva, Spain. The aim of RED_SCOPE is to asses the technical and economic feasibility of a new process to maximise wastewater recovery of a copper smelter. The project led by Atlantic Copper will enable optimal use of raw materials within Europe and will contribute to theEuropean Commissions current strategy on the Circular Economy. As part of the RED_SCOPE innovation project, a near zero liquid discharge (NZLD) pilot plant was designed, installed and operated to assess the feasibility of recovering most of the aqueous effluents generated in the Metallurgical Complex of Atlantic Copper. The recovered water, of adequate quality to be used as process water, can be sent back to the factory, reducing the consumption of fresh waterand, therefore, the Water Footprint. In addition, as a consequence of the recovery of clean process water, a dry residue in the form of saline crystals is generated, which is currently under evaluation. SUEZhas developed the design of the water resources optimisation project. The project began in 2017 with pre-feasibility studies and laboratory tests followed by the design of the pilot plant carried out in 2018. Furthermore, different technologies were installed along with the pilot tests carried out for five months. By 2019, the implementation study and the final validation of the project were planned. Moreover, theIVLteam worked on the characterisation and study of the possible recovery of the waste generated in the new process. Subscribe to the EIT newsletter and keep in touch with the latestnews The RED_SCOPE innovation project demonstrates an improved, integrated NZLD process for treating the wastewater stream, which reduces by 99% the water in the current discharge and reduces the freshwater consumption.

Here is the full interview withKirsten Dunlop, CEO EIT Climate-KIC. There are people taking it seriously and the world is definitely not starting from scratch. At the end of 2019, for example, I was invited to present a vision of innovation and systemic change to the parliament of Slovenia. It marked a milestone in our 18-month engagement with the country, which has involved close cooperation with seven Slovenian Government Ministries, EIT RawMaterials and the Joint Research Centre. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC That day, the Slovenian parliament passed a motion to adopt an EIT Climate-KIC-led proposal called 'A Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia.' The proposal commits the country to becoming a fully circular economy. That means essentially no new virgin materials. Moving away from traditional linear economic business models and transitioning to closed-loop systems has been defined by the Government of Slovenia as one of the countrys strategic development priorities and an important building block of the carbon-neutral, prosperous and smart future. Business-as-usual isnt delivering the pace and scale of change needed. Through this proposal and on-the-ground Deep Demonstration, the country is embracing an unprecedented cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach, which seeks to marry different disciplines and work across boundaries, silos and departments. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Its overall goal is to position Slovenia as a European leader in harnessing the transformative power of circularity to decarbonise its economy and transform communities while promoting wellbeing and prosperity for all Slovenes for decades to come. Its a great example of a country embracing the benefits and opportunities of radical, structural transformation for a 1.5 degree world. Really groundbreaking.Averting catastrophic global temperature rise will require deep and holistic transformations in every country. For example, arecent reportby Material Economics calculated that circular approaches could help to reduce CO2 emissions from materials production in the EU by almost 56 per cent by 2050. In many ways, the process that led up to that moment in parliament (when our proposal for a Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia was adopted) is the design phase of doing systemic change. Over 18 months, EIT Climate-KIC engaged challenge owners in Slovenia (government ministries and sector leaders), to articulate an ambitious intent for transformational change, and to build demand for a systemic approach. We worked with them to identify constraints and opportunities, frame the problem space, and map relevant systems. And then there is the painstaking work amongchallenge owners to connect funding and programmes across ministries, and so forth. Get all the EIT's news once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Implementing the change (i.e. building and managing the portfolio of projects and programmes, and learning from it) comes next. Slovenias plan here centres around driving circularity in five main areas: The programme of work is focused on three pillars for National Circular Economy Transition, working together to decarbonise Slovenias socio-economic system through circular economy principles: A dedicated vehicle called the Slovenian Center for Smart and Circular Transition will serve as the beating heart and physical centre of the entire Deep Demonstration, bringing together the different stakeholders and opening up activities to the wider public. EIT Climate-KIC will provide orchestration services in Slovenia, and help to design a broad-based portfolio of interventions that combine budgets and programmes across old siloescovering various combinations of technology, policy, education, entrepreneurship, regulation, social innovation, citizen engagement and financial innovation. We will connect this project into our wider community of innovation actors and initiatives across Europe. You can read more about the detailed working plan inthisarticle by Cliona Howie, EIT Climate-KICs Head of Circular Economy. No, because many of the solutions we need are not simple technological substitutions or single-point interventions. While we may be able to make 1.5 work on a spreadsheet, we dont know yet how to make change spread on the ground. On top of this, the context and conditions for achieving 1.5 will continue to change. Uncertainty is the new normal. There is every reason to feel bewildered by the complexity, uncertainty and urgency of the challenge we face. The big question isdo we have the right frameworks in place, for rapid testing and learning about what does work, and for rapid scaling, in a context of uncertainty? Deep Demonstrations of whole systems change are one of these frameworks. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Definitely. We need to get communities, organisations and national economies onto a 1.5C footing, quickly. Learning how to achieve this is the real innovation of our time. For example, if we want to achieve climate impact, traditional models of funding and politics need to change. In this respect, Slovenia is embarking on an incredibly bold experiment, connecting ministries and funding to break down siloes, and to capitalise on the benefits of circularity. In addition to creating frameworks for collaborative investment, innovation and learning, we also need to broaden the scope of innovation to include finance, regulation, education, governance as well as non-unusual innovation suspects, like the creative arts, community and social movements. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstrations (i.e. advancing innovation across these multiple fronts at the same time in a joined-up, holistic way) can help us identify combinations of actions and investments that lead to pace and scale. So, yes, we need a new model of innovation to catalyse systemic change. The innovation we really need right now is systems innovation. Slovenia recognises the need to treat all people as stakeholders in this change. There is a big focus on communities, well-being and long-term prosperity. The governments approach will activate: Local communities, civil servants, students and younger generations, teachers and other change agents, researchers and academics, non-governmental and non-profit organisations, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, associations and other representations of interest, Strategic Research and Innovation Partnerships (SRIPs), start-ups, SMEs and companies, as well as economic clusters. Consider carbon-free mobility in cities. A huge amount of technical work has been done already to develop alternatives to the combustion engine. Every day, we get better at building electric cars or hydrogen buses. But were less good at reducing demand for individual car ownership or driving a switch to zero-emissions buses. A holistic approach forces us to answer a list of other questions as well, like how to create more cycle lanes, increase video conferencing, source local ingredients, build pedestrianism into a citys health strategy, and so on. In Slovenia, systemic innovation will tackle material production and waste flows across the key economic systems and value chains mentioned above. It will also use training, education and capacity-building to create change agents, to foster life-long learning and to disseminate insights and good practices as widely as possible, and it will use innovative policy initiatives and experiments to ensure enabling conditions. We are running seven other Deep Demonstrations,eight in total, covering: Cities, food, landscapes as carbon sinks, circular regenerative economies, just transitions in coal and heavy industry regions, maritime hubs, long-termism and resilience.Over 30 different locations are involved across Europe. Our long-term goal is for the Deep Demonstration model to help trigger rapid decarbonisation and strengthened resilience across Europe. Many of our current project partners come from EU member states eligible for EITs Regional Innovation Scheme. To accelerate impact in these areas, we are integrating our approach with EU Instruments on smart specialisation, on national climate and energy plans, and on coal regions in transition. In Silesia, Poland, for example, we are working on coal transitions, while in Cyprus were working with the government on the decarbonisation of shipping. Our impacts framework includes an evaluation and learning capability that draws on structured sense-making and frequent calibration of our overall portfolio of projects. Its our desire that decision-makers have actionable intelligence and knowledge at their finger tips. Beyond EIT Climate-KIC and our partners, we also want others to follow our journey and benefit from our learnings. To that end, we are committed to reporting transparently on our Deep Demonstration programme as it unfolds. Whatever the solutions to Europes climate emergency, innovation has to be at the heart of them. The beauty of a systems approach is that it harnesses innovation in all its different forms and channels them towards simultaneous actions on multiple fronts. In our view, this is the fastest route to the transformation that we so urgently need. The global problem of climate change cannot be solved one start-up or one technological breakthrough at a time. Only by changing whole systems and whole economies will we create the low-carbon world we all want to see. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system was developed by the team behindStockholm3andOncoWatch, two projects supported by EIT Health. Find out more about Stockholm3 The study, involving the same team and led by Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, showed that the AI system had considerable accuracy in determining whether a sample contained cancer, and in estimating the length of the cancer tumour in the biopsy. Furthermore, the AI system was comparable with 23 international, leading uropathologists in determining the Gleason score, the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer. Our AI tool has the potential to reduce the workload of uropathologists, allowing them to focus on the most difficult cases and at the same time act as a safety net to improve quality. It also has the potential to speed up diagnostics and reduce costs for healthcare services. Martin Eklund, Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet The Karolinksa team launched the blood-based prostate cancer diagnostic test called Stockholm3 in 2017.Stockholm3 doubles the number of aggressive cancers that are identified, whilst also reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice with PSA.Stockholm3 is currently used in clinical practice in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3 and the new AI system, OncoWatch through network and financial support. As part of the development of OncoWatch, the AI system will be validated in 2020 in a nine-country multicentre study to assess its performance across different labs and in a wider range of digital pathology scanners. A first CE-marked product is expected to launch by the end of the year. There is a high demand for improved tools in prostate cancer diagnostics and we have proven that we can take new innovative tests to the market. The Stockholm3 test was used in more than 20,000 men in the Nordics alone in 2019, and I believe that our new AI system, OncoWatch, will also have strong uptake Martin Steinberg, Project leader for EIT Health-backed OncoWatch Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in Europe, withapproximately 450000 new cases each year.Early diagnosis and treatment of aggressive prostate cancer is crucial to survival. Prostate cancer blights the lives of a large number of men in Europe each year, and despite the advent of new and innovative diagnostics and treatments, we still see too many men die from the condition. Prostate cancer is often treatable with early diagnosis and effective treatment, and AI represents a large opportunity to complement existing medical expertise within the diagnostic process. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health 'The results of the study demonstrate the exciting developments that are happening in the field of AI, and how the technology can be applied to medical practice to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe.

The solution was validated in relevant environment on the micro-seismicity data recorded atGarpenberg mine(Boliden Group, Sweden), the worlds most productive and automated underground zinc mine (1 250 m depth). Mines-In-Time solution addresses the following: Mines-In-Time is based on four dimensions Local Earthquake Tomography (4D LET) methodology and is able to analyse both natural and induced micro-seismicity due to mining operations. This technique is a unparalleled upgrade of the traditional ambient noise analysis and time-lapse 3D LET, since the addition of the fourth dimension (time) allows a real-time monitoring of ground deformation related to the stress variation and provides an instant alert in case of risky conditions, using data provided by the existing networks of seismographs already installed in most of the mining sites (no extra hardware to be installed). For this reason, MIT is the only Decision Support System and early warning systems for mining able to dynamically forecast rock deformations and provide an alert in case of critical conditions. Mining companies and service providers will benefit from the MIT outstanding advantages: SpacEarth Technology, a spin-off of the ItalianInstitute of Geophysics and Volcanology(INGV), founded in 2014 and supported by the EIT RawMaterials Booster to develop applications for the mining industry. Moreover, SpacEarth has direct connections withBolden GroupandLKABmining companies,DMTand IMS service providers and theLule University of Technologyworking on seismic hazards in mines. SpacEarth start-up was initially supported by the EIT RawMaterials Start-up and SME Booster 2016 and 2017. The EIT RawMaterials Booster supported the delivery of a market study for the mining sector including direct contacts with client prospects. As a result, the company achieved a higher technology level, and this boosted the technology attractiveness from the industry. Mines-In-Time will be further validated through 2019 and 2020 thanks to a recently established one-year contract between SpacEarth and Boliden. The constant, competent and thorough support of EIT RawMaterials Innovation Hub South was crucial to bring our business idea into the market. The seismic hazard in the mines is strongly related to the stress changes and the condition of the rock mass (fracturing process with time). That is why monitoring of these two factors is important to foresee the changes in the seismic hazard. MIT is a valuable tool that could give important information about the changing stress and rock conditions  it can be used for large volumes.

The mill is a prototype of a new ultra-fine grinding mill for the liberation of high-value particles met in platinum-group metals containing ores, copper ores or other polymetallic ores with fine dissemination of mineral phases. This mill consumes 20-30% less energy compared to similar established mills and increases ore liberation with at least 20% less locked ore at same particle size. ProfessorUrs Peuker atTechnische Universitt Bergakademie Freiberg and leader of the RoStarproject TheRoStarprototype has proven to increase the operation period with 50% before maintenance is needed. Additionally, the maintenance itself is 50% faster compared to similarly established mills, due to an optimised rotor-stator geometry and improved wear resistance through a modular construction of the mill housing. The RoStar mill offers an answer to the forthcoming challenges already seen in fine milling trends. Tangible applications are opened in re-grinding-flotation circuits, tailings re-processing as well as in enabling access to future deposits containing valuable or critical materials. ProfessorPeuker The mill will be a vertical fine grinding mill, where gravity forces enable a higher filling level than in horizontal mills and a hydraulic pressure on the grinding beads. The new improved design of the Mills Rotor/Stator system was launched into the market in the year 2018. Deliverables of the RoStar innovation project will be a containerised pilot plant, a fine milling process with very low energy consumption. A flexible and mobile unit is set up and followed by a demonstration and proving of mill performance ina real industrial environment, the testing takes place at Assarel-Medet (SME) plant site in Bulgaria.

She is also a member of the EIT Health Supervisory Board, a member of the Board of Trustees of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region and shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board of ABB AG. EIT Community hasa fairly segmented approach to the provision of healthcare today. As patients, EIT Community sees doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and many other healthcare professionals helping us to maintain or regain good health. They must plan together, treat patients together, and talk to one another, a dynamic that often needs to be continued in the long term, particularly for chronic diseases. This becomes a challenge when processes, regulation and mindsetare not all focused on integration of care. The growth in medical knowledge necessitates increased specialisation, which is valuable but results in fragmentation that requires a challenging level of governing infrastructure and reimbursement principles. Integrating healthcare to provide seamless end-to-end care will reduce costs by optimising interfaces, reducing redundancies and avoiding communication breaks and information gaps. It will improve outcomes by making information easily available and providing constant feedback loops for all involved in care. It will enable truly personalised care. And it will help to shift the focus from treating disease to maintaining health, thereby promising both better healthcare and reduced costs. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member Some of the main challenges that I believe EIT Community must address in order to develop, nurture and scale integrated care models across Europe include: Tackling all of these challenges is, of course, no small task. WhileEIT Community may still be some years away from total reform, EIT Community isseeing pilots testing integrated healthcare on a regional level or focused on a disease. One example is the 'Gesundes Kinzigtal' model (GK) in Germany, where healthcare within a local community has been organised as an innovative integrated care system.The GK model focuses on three key principles:better population health, improved experience of care, and reduced per-capita costs. The results of the GK model clearly demonstrated that patient satisfaction and population health can be improved while decreasing the overuse of health services and medicines. In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation projectiPDM-GOis improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation projectiPDM-GOis improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform that integrates diagnostic results with relevant medication and personal information  to help patients and their doctors achieve better short- and long-term outcomes. Controlling blood glucose levels is a highly complex process and a major task for patients. Although monitoring and treatment are readily available, staying within the required blood-sugar range remains a challenge. Providing individual feedback loops and continuous information for patients and doctors can help avoid long-term complications and associated pain and cost.  Another EIT Health project, calledSeizeIT, is addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection. Currently, seizures are being reported with a patient diary, or are measured during hospital stays. This provides a lot of room for seizures to be underreported, but accuracy is relevant to establishing optimal care. By providing a discreet device that patients can wear at home, SeizeIT is working towards a reality where all seizures can be detected. This will improve patient lives and help medical professionals understand more about the condition, and improve treatments available. The variety of healthcare systems across Europe share some common challenges. Integrated healthcare is one of those. EIT Health offers an opportunity to explore pilots and innovative approaches to achieve this vision. Lets use these opportunities to create improvements that provide the best value for citizens and patients. Visit the EIT Health website",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit259,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/new-european-innovation-agenda,EIT InnoEnergy invests EUR 5.8 million in Northvolt,"EIT InnoEnergy has announced its EUR 5.8million investment intoNorthvolts 'Revolt'programme. The programme, which will implement the latest discoveries in efficient materials recovery methods, will see the construction of a pilot battery recycling plant, followed by a full-scale version at Northvolts site in Skellefte in 2022. The EIT InnoEnergy investment supports Northvolts target of using 50% recycled materials in all its new battery cells by 2030. The announcement comes just two days after the European Green Deal highlighted the importance of circular economy initiatives to 'mainstream'sustainability throughout European policy. This is a landmark investment and one that has a mission critical role to play in addressing climate issues. Europes energy transition relies on creating a local, competitive and sustainable battery value supply chain that can support the electrification of the transport, power and industrial sectors. As battery volumes are expected to increase drastically, it will be doubly important that, as an industry, we do everything we can to reduce their manufacturing footprint. Diego Pavia, CEO at EIT InnoEnergy 'As such, greener battery technologies are a cornerstone of a sustainable future, and we are actively seeking to invest in technologies that can unlock economic and environmental benefits. Better technologies mean we can manufacture much more with less, using recycled raw materials and less energy', added Diego. The aim of using 50% recycled materials by 2030 will be achieved through a gradual build-up in capacity. The pilot plant will process 100 tons a year, while the full-scale unit initially will look to recycle 25 000 tons of battery cells a year. At present, much of Europes recyclable battery materials are thought to be exported abroad for reuse in countries such as China and Korea. We are very pleased to have the continued support of EIT InnoEnergy as we take this next step in developing our blueprint for sustainable battery manufacturing. Our partnership with EIT InnoEnergy has been vital in getting us to where we are today; not only has it provided investments, it has opened doors for us across Europe. Peter Carlsson, CEO Northvolt Northvolts programme builds on two years of research where, in conjunction with researchers at Chalmers University, Sweden, it has optimised the process design for hydrometallurgical treatment. The process allows for more efficient recovery of valuable metals includinglithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt. This latest investment brings EIT InnoEnergys total capital contributions to Northvolt toEUR 9.3 million, following an earlier investment of EUR 3.5 million three years ago. Both investments help EIT InnoEnergy unlock the estimated EUR 250 billion annual European battery market, identified by the European Battery Alliance. Northvolt is just one of several battery supply chain start-ups EIT InnoEnergy supports, and it has resources to support more. Earlier this autumn, EIT InnoEnergy issued its first ever globalcall for start-upsacross the entire sustainability value chain. Following strong growth within the storage market, EIT InnoEnergy expects this call to attract a significant number of new storage innovations. Read more about Northvolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit261,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/faster-world-decarbonises-higher-its-metal-demands,EIT Climate-KIC and partners reassess our values in the new normal,"Under the Long-termism Deep Demonstration, we have dedicated an area of action to understanding how we can rethink notions of value. 2020 brought promises of a new decade of action, but it turned into a drastic respite from the pace of life. The world slowed down, and our way of life changed as a result of COVID-19. Health has become a priority and we are already seeing the effects of this pandemic affect our global and our local economy. Governments are now scrambling to balance lockdown with stimulus packages to curb the effects of the inevitable recession. We have rapidly changed the way we live, how we move, how we socialise and how we eat. What is emerging is a new normala reevaluation of what society values. We might eventually need to reassess the values that guide us in reorganising our society. We havent built resilience in our system. Our current society is fed by short-term cycles of supply and demand, built on relatively young economic theories of Keynes, neoliberalism and growth paradigms. When the demand drops, our economy suffers. This fragility has only served to emphasise the importance of building a sustainable and resilient societyone that can minimise the effects of covariate shocks, and also sustain its basic core after the shock has passed. Examples are already coming out of people finding value in other formssuch as singing on balconies, acts of welfare such as helping with their shopping but also in the ultimate dilemmas of supporting life which have brought Italian doctors to tears. None of these could be measured in monetary costs and benefits. For years now, society has been mounting a reaction to achieve long-term safety in the face of climate upheaval. Its diverse and unevenly distributed. it grows at the edges of society: In ecovillages, local currencies, neo-municipality cities and so on. These experiments are so efficient they can survive in a short-term economy, while still taking care of the long-term Alberto Cottica  Edgeryders Whats more, our investment in building resilience and sustainability into our system means that the benefits may not be realised now. Many of the investments needed for mitigating future impacts and shocks that climate change will bring, such as investments in infrastructure, energy and property, will require long-term orientation. Considering long-term impactis critical to unlocking resources today for climate action. Also we need an economic and financial system that can appropriately allocate the resources needed and unlock the financial flows for remedial and preventative climate action. Moneyour basic currency for exchanging valuehas become the fundament for accumulation of wealth, which perpetuates cycles of short-term gain and returns. Value is the basis on which our current financial system has accumulated its wealthto release the needed capital to invest into climate action and sustainability, we must experiment with redefining notions of value by looking at new money paradigms and alternative value creation that can allow people to define, express and exchange what they value and therefore how we invest. Some examples of the positions we want to explore are looking at the role of the gift economy and inheritance, as well as how incentives can work over time. Our design partners are experimenting with or would like to experiment with ways to rethink notions of value: Edgeryders Edgeryders is working to extend the space of economic models that are conceivable and deployable. Conceivable: As Edgeryders puts it: It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism. But if we do not go beyond TINA (There Is No Alternative), we have to carry on business-as-usual. This will kill us all. Edgeryders therefore uses techniques from modelling, speculative fiction, economic history, anthropology and design to broaden the space of conceivable economies. Deployable: As argued above, theres already a mutant population of economic agents that operate in the current economy, while aspiring to a more long-termism one. Edgeryders learns from these agents, in order to come up with policies to thrive and grow further. ETH Zurich ETH Zurich supports mass experimentation in two directions: First, they enable independent incentive systems that allow and push for mass innovation for climate change mitigation. Such systems are bottom-up and democratic like regional currencies, and beyond that, allow entirely new incentive designs to cater to community needs for maintaining common-pool resources. Second, novel solutions like basic income, personal data markets, etc., are too urgently needed to leave to institutions to mull over for years. ETH Zurichs technology allows communities to experiment with these new schemes for real, today. These communities should not need to wait for permission by governments or banks to help themselves if they can. In the spirit of open source development, ETH Zurich wants competition in such projects and in the underlying financial systems powering them. IOTA The generation of value is rooted in networks of trust and shared definitions of value. Todays economy is characterised by globally distributed, centralised networks that work towards a unidimensional objective: Maximising shareholder value. Together with financialisation and increasing automation, this leads to externalities, inequalities and fragile societies. The opensource IOTA protocol aims to remove friction in the transaction of value and information between diverse actors by creating digital trust. Together with ETI Climate-KIC, the IOTA Foundation is exploring how convergent technologies such as the Internet of Things and Distributed Ledgers can empower people with a permission less infrastructure to engage in peer-to-peer economies to collaborate on creating value in their communities and in harmony with the natural systems they inhabit. Decentralised networks of trust and information will be the backbone of a long-term sustainable, resilient economy based on pluralistic notions of value. Clearly, if we want to radically change our financial systems, we still have a long way to go. Through our systematic and innovative approach within Deep Demonstration Long-termism, we look at a wide range of challenges and possible solutions. We give our community and other interested parties the space and resources to test and scale up these solutions. Examples of what we focus on with this Deep Demonstration are: While many humans insist democratic principles are best suited to govern collectives, the design of our money system is blatantly undemocratic. Instead of a mono-dimensional, monopolistic system of money, we need to consider multi-dimensional incentives to create more robust financial systems and we need decentralised communities rather than monopolies to create and distribute currencies. Above all, the new system needs sustainability to be baked into its core design by removing externalities as much as possible Marcus Dapp  ETHZ University Wed like to get in touch with parties from Europe and beyond who want to innovate with us. Would you like to receive more information about the possibilities? Please email us  The Deep Demonstration Long-termism focuses on changing mindsets and devising ways to stimulate long-term thinking. Only this way will we achieve sustainable behaviour, and make impactful investments in sustainability possible. Using a proprietary methodology, we design various systematic interventions within entire ecosystems. It has been proven this methodology leads to actual climate, economic and social impact. Together with a consortium of expert partners, this Deep Demonstration focuses on five areas: The focus of the work up until now has been designing for interventions that can incentivise behavioural and mindset change throughout society, deliberately widening the lens from the financial sector after a key realisation that such systemic impact can only be realised through a holistic and systemic approach within our social systems, as short-termism is essentially rooted in concepts of human identity, sensory capacity, language and power structures, and institutions. 2 Investing Initiative, Centre for Systems Solutions, The Culture Initiative, Dark Matter Labs, Edgeryders, ETHZ University, FFRC Turku University and UNESCO, Influence Map, IOTA Foundation, Luvent Consulting, Red Cross Climate Centre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit262,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/webio-eit-digital-backed-start-raises-eur-38m-scale-its-conversational-ai-platform,EIT Health launches guidance on Value-Based Health Care ,"EIT Health has launched a new framework for achieving Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) to improve patient outcomes and reduce waste of healthcare resources. Designed with insights from established pioneers in the field and laid out in a practical handbook, the framework describes key steps healthcare providers can take to fully realise the opportunity presented by VBHC. Unlike traditional volume-based healthcare provision, modelled on fees for-products or services, VBHC provides a methodology for measurable healthcare outcomes that make the biggest difference to patients, while driving cost efficiencies within health services. The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that around 30% of resources currently spent on healthcare are wasted on avoidable complications, unnecessary treatments or administrative inefficiencies. Tackling this waste head on, the publication from EIT Health aims to kick-start change towards measurable value, in order to support more sustainable models for healthcare. The new EIT Health publication Implementing Value-Based Health Care: Handbook for Pioneers, includes an Implementation Matrix with a clear and structured framework for healthcare providers to follow. The Matrix details five key steps to help healthcare providers activate and accelerate VBHC: 1)recording; 2)comparing; 3)rewarding; 4)improving; and 5)partnering. It outlines how to measure and maximise the outcomes that matter to patients, and addresses the main challenges, such as lack of standardised outcome data and resistance to change. Read the handbook Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health, explains the need for this work: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in VBHC in the health community in Europe; however the focus has been on why it is the way forward, rather than how we effectively implement such a change. This is why we created this framework, to provide an in-depth guide on how health care managers and practitioners can orient efforts and resources towards necessary transformation. Currently, many of Europes health care systems measure the wrong things, which can lead to inefficiencies in cost, time and resources, not to mention the impact on the patient. Metrics focus on volume rather than patient outcomes, and this is simply unsustainable for health care systems. At EIT Health, we are uniquely placed to connect successful pioneers in the field with those just starting out, and to share tools and best practices to help measure outcomes to drive this cultural shift within Europes health care systems. Development of this EIT Health handbook has been directed by Professor Gregory Katz of the University Paris School of Medicine and achieved in collaboration with esteemed experts from across leading European organisations. The new framework is based on several VBHC case studies from some of Europes leading healthcare providers, including: Uppsala Academic Hospital, which reduced the number of unnecessary ambulance dispatches by 17%; Basel University Hospital, which improved the median time from stoke symptom to treatment onset by 14%; and NHS Wales, which identified that in 19% of cases, high-cost cataract surgery had no real impact on a patients activity limitations in daily life. According to Professor Gregory Katz: Today in Europe, VBHC pioneers are choosing to take bold action to measure, compare and improve patient outcomes. This momentum is mainly building from the bottom up, through entrepreneurial initiatives. As care results vary tremendously between therapeutic approaches and medical teams, transparent outcome benchmarks enable the detection of medical innovations and the reduction of inappropriate care. There are good reasons to be impatient for improving health care through VBHC, but there are also reasons to be humble. VBHC is still in its infancy, and successful implementation takes time. Becoming a VBHC early adopter opens the opportunity to learn proactively and spearhead high-value care. The handbook was commissioned by EIT Health under its Think Tank thought leadership forum, which explores the most pressing topics for the health of Europe and its citizens. The EIT Health Think Tank brings healthcare leaders together, across disciplines and borders, to prepare the ground for life-changing innovation and identify the next opportunity for a transformation in how healthcare is delivered. The launch of the handbook marks the first in a series of activities being launched by EIT Health that are designed to support a step-change in the provision of healthcare and to integrate VBHC as the new norm across Europe.

Click here for more information and to apply for the 2020 edition. All of us who have grandparents or elderly relatives have had some experience with pressure ulcers - a medical condition caused by long-term bed rest. In truth, it is a health problem that could be avoided, according to Mohammad Amini. And he does not just talk about it but leads a team that has invented a product to predict the risks. Both my grandparents died while suffering from pressure ulcers, saysMohammad Amini, the Team Leader ofSensoMatt. That was the point when he first started thinking about a solution. Since pressure ulcers affect not just the elderly, but also disabled people and other patients lying in hospitals, it is a common medical problem that needs treatment. ""My grandparents were old, but the pressure ulcer phenomena and the pain caused by the wounds made me think about why there is no reliable solution to alert and forecast,"" he says. Last year, Amini and his uncle started to develop their solution. It contains hardware and an AI-based structure for prediction. ""After I talked with a friend of mine about AI development, we started to produce our MVP[minimum viable product], and then enrolled in the EIT Digital Venture Program due to a friends recommendation. The scope of EIT Digital's Venture Program is nothing other than helping ideas like SensoMatts reach markets and customers. The team had the first ideas and a basic prototype in 2019. Then, with the help of EIT Digital and its partners' experience, they found a way to grow. With their help, they are taking the invention to the areas of use: hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. SensoMatt is a multiplatform solution. It contains a thin smart sheet, that can be placed under any kind of mattress, and an AI-driven cloud system processing all earned data. The sensors in the sheet track the real-time pressure distribution. The AI-based algorithm analyses this data and pressure ulcers can be detected or predicted. During the EIT Digital Venture Program, Amini and his team developed a unique, affordable and reliable device that is suitable to use not just in hospitals but also in homecare. The company is in negotiations with Portuguese and Belgian medical centres.CHwapi, the Belgian medical centre, is one of the investors in SensoMatt, having provided 100,000. Even if the motivation behind the development process is a heart-breaking life event for Amini, many people could benefit from this device. SensoMatt helps protect against and predict a painful and dangerous medical condition in a way we have never seen before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit273,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/insight-value-lifelong-learning-and-digital-upskilling,Transformative policies for the climate challenge,"To meet the scale and urgency of the climate emergency, business-as-usual in government wont suffice. TheIPCC report, which sets out what we need to do to keep global warming under 1.5C by the end of century, has made it clear that we no longer have the luxury of timechange must happen now, across multiple sectors, and governments must adapt too. This climate challenge demands that we rethink the institutions, norms, beliefs and values that underpin our current governance structures and approach to policymaking. Rather than continuing to place our hopes in incremental improvements to the work done by governments and public authorities, we need to foster a rich culture of innovation and experimentation within government. And we need to work with communities to bring them along on the journey. To stand a chance of responding to climate change, policymaking must become innovative, inclusive, radicaltransformative. How can we make this happen? Over the past year, Ive been part of a team atEIT Climate-KIC, Europes largest climate innovation agency, that has been addressing this question. Funded by the EU, EIT Climate-KIC is pioneering the fast action needed to keep climate change under 1.5C. We believe that multiple systems need to change simultaneously if we are to achieve a just, climate resilient society founded on a net zero-carbon, circular economy, and we have set up testbeds to put this into practice. OurDeep Demonstrationsare just that: Eight large-scale pan-European initiatives made up of a coordinated portfolio of projects designed to trigger systems change. These initiativesfrom Just Transformations to Resilient Regions and Long-termismfollow oursystems innovation methodology, in which we collaborate with design partners on ambitious systems-level challenges that are identified by challenge owners such as city mayors, regional leaders, government ministers, citizen leaders and CEOs of major companies. While most of the Deep Demonstrations are in the early stages, the work we have done withSloveniashows what we can accomplish. The Slovenian government has embraced the radical, holistic approach that underpins our Deep Demonstrations, and their parliament has passed a motion adopting our proposal to become a fully circular economy. This collaboration is a part of our overall vision for the Deep Demonstration modelto trigger rapid decarbonisation and enhanced resilience across Europe. Policy and governance innovations are a crucial component of the Deep Demonstrations. Collaborating alongside cities, regions and national governments that are interested in experimenting with a variety of innovative policy and governance approaches, we are moving from ideation to implementation. In preparation for designing these experiments, we have actively sought those at the coalface of policy and governance innovation for the climate challenge. Over the last year, we spent time in conversation with a diverse group of practitioners, including a forward-looking UK city councillor, a young political activist working within a progressive US think tank, a leader from the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change, several European academics, a pioneer of regulatory sandboxes in a national regulator and a policy expert involved in citizens assemblies. We wanted to find out how they define policy and governance innovationwhat is it, and what is itnot? Are there barriers to success and, conversely, are there key characteristics of a transformative climate policy innovation? Several themes emerged from the interviews, and drawn together here they outline the features of a successful policy innovation initiative. Every single person we interviewed told us that it is essential to centre the needs of the whole community (and not just the most politically engaged sections) when developing policy experiments. The negative effects of climate change will be greatest amongst the most vulnerable, and low-income populations, young people, immigrants (and others) in our communities may be overlooked during policy design. Interviewees spoke about the richness that comes from welcoming new opinions and collective intelligence to the process, and they emphasised how much governments can benefit from this cross-pollination. By starting from a place of doing with the community, rather than doing to them, real and lasting transformative changeswith representation at the heartare possible. Innovative approaches that foregroundhowpolicy is made require us to meet people where they are, creating a space for discourse and engagement in the rigour of the design process. The end result is that the policy output will be capable of facing the complexities of real life. Our conversations really underscored that bringing the community along the journey as holistically as possible is directly proportional to the success or failure of an initiative, so it is crucially important. The community focus also links to how innovative policy must respond to concrete problems with an approach that is deeply in sync with the cultural, historical and sociological context of the area. What can be considered an innovative or simply an effective policy will vary from place to place, so a rich understanding of this background is needed before you even begin designing policies. And although cities and regions do often take inspiration and learn from each other, adapting and spreading successful solutions, the solutions that stick are those that address a communitys real challenges rather than just chasing a trend. In a time of increasing disillusionment with government, and facing a need for transformation on an unprecedented scale, it is incredibly important to bring the public along on the policy-making process and to give them reasons to be involved. Their input must serve a purpose and carry weight. New approaches to policy, if done well, can empower communities, giving citizens concrete experiences of catalysing change and demonstrating that policy can work for them and that their voices can make a difference. I was inspired bythis articleabout the UK citizens assembly on climate, as it shows how ordinary peoplemany who werent originally interested in climate changewere drawn into the discussion, given tools to understand the science, and were then able to construct robust recommendations that will be fed back to government. Several interviewees pointed to narrative building and storytelling as a crucial component in fostering changes in behaviour and mindset, helping people to imagine what is possible. Its also a powerful way to work through the various barriers to successful policies. For example, it can be used to foster community interest and engagement, pulling in a rich variety of actors. It could also help to build political will. This is especially important for a complex, wicked problem like climate change, where people may feel completely powerless to create change. Swedens Viable Cities program, which helps Swedish cities become carbon neutral by 2030, has evenhired a chief storytellerto build a compelling narrative around the project and to connect people to the reality of climate change on an emotional level. According to chief storyteller Per Grankvist, to reach the programs mission, storytelling is believed to be a key to get people engaged enough to change their behaviour and norms. Co-design is central to the endeavour, with stories from citizens, public servants and other stakeholders layering to create a comprehensive framework for understanding the various perspectives, needs and concerns from the groups, thus creating a foundation to engage people further. One central learning that emerged through the course of our explorations was that, if we are to create a space for policy innovation and experimentation to flourish, it is vital to innovate around governance processes and structures themselves. While it might be possible to experiment with new policies within a traditional bureaucratic and political structure, chances are it will be a struggle. The Vancouver EcoDensity program, launched in 2006, is an example of this. It aimed to increase density in low/medium dense urban areas along transport corridors in order to reduce urban sprawl and make the area more liveable, green and efficient, but the programs traditional governance model and inability to respond to extensive public concerns seriously impeded the success of its original vision. So there is an exciting piece of work to be done around building new skills and mindsets in the public sector, fostering cross-governmental collaboration, new ways of including citizens and stakeholders in policy design processes, and new policy co-development, experimentation and implementation mechanisms. Looking at current governance set-ups, our interviewees highlighted the following problems: Public sector innovation has of course been widely discussed in recent years, and Apolitical hassomegreatpieces that delve into actions and solutions. I also enjoyed the ideas inthis articleabout building internal cultures within government departments to foster innovative thinking and comfort with experimentation. It isnt an easy thing to solve for, but as Steven Stone, chief of UN Environments Resources & Markets Branch,points out, openness and curiosity can be such a powerful driver of change. Talk to peers and colleaguesfind out if others are curious about working differently and start to build a community to champion the change you want to see. The effects of climate change cut across specialisations and sectors, and bringing people with varied backgrounds and expertise together can surface surprising new ideas to test.

eit275,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/forging-sustainable-timber-construction-europe,Forging sustainable timber construction in Europe,"Built by Nature, a network and grant-making organisation with a mission to accelerate the timber building transformation in Europe, has announced a EUR 250 000 Accelerator Fund grant to support research into perception barriers to mass timber adoption in Italy. The initiative, coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, will establish a physical and digital prototype building to drive understanding and adoption of mass timber, while maximising the amount of timber used in construction of the one-million-square metre Milano Innovation District (MIND) complex. EIT Climate-KIC will coordinate collective learning as part of the research initiative and the Accelerator Fund grant will connect to EIT Climate-KICsDeep Demonstrationsof Healthy Clean CitiesEU CINCO, funded by theLaudes Foundation. The aim of the CINCO project is to learn how can cities shape the markets for carbon-neutral buildings through two experimentations for bio-based and circular construction in Milan and Madrid. Both initiatives set the stage for collaboration with local stakeholders, the city, developers, and designers by supporting the creation of skills, motivation, and leadership to collaboratively explore how to activate levers for timber transformation of buildings. Built by Nature and EIT Climate-KICs partner networks will share the outputs of the project. Thanks to the vision and commitment of Built by Nature and Laudes Foundation, we can help cities tackle deep-seated, seemingly intractable challenges. Our ability to collaborate with the private sector, research experts, and the City of Milan means we can develop insights and actionable knowledge useful to all cities about circular building materials and how to reduce carbon emissions in the built environment. Further, we can connect this work to all cities across Europe through our leadership of NetZeroCities. Thomas Osdoba,NetZeroCitiesProgramme Director, EIT Climate-KIC, Partners in the project include multinational property and construction company Lendlease (which provides co-funding of EUR 528 000), Waugh Thistleton Architects (who are designing the prototypes), Fondazione Politecnico di Milano (who is conducting a review of scientific literature on mass timber sustainability implications in Italy), as well as University College of London, Arup and Stora Enso. Built by Natures Accelerator Fund provides grants of between EUR 50 000-EUR 250 000 to teams and solutions that scale up timber building and raise the bar on the positive climate impact of using timber from sustainably sourced forests. Since launching in October 2021, the Accelerator Fund has already supported leading-edge work by Holland Houtland in scaling biobased buildings through a new blended finance and valuation model; Waugh Thistleton Architects and its New Model Building methodology for building residential developments using engineered timber, and the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunyas Valldaura Labs (IAAC) in convening frontrunners and exhibiting solutions ahead of Barcelonas European Forest City 2022. This is an extremely exciting Accelerator Fund initiative on several levels, bringing together a local network in Italy to develop knowledge and innovation in a demonstration project setting, as part of a larger city scale project that has the potential to really unlock the timber building transformation locally. We are pleased to deepen key Built by Nature partnerships with EIT Climate-KIC and local research partners like Politecnico di Milano, and support city and industry frontrunners such as Milano and Lendlease. James Drinkwater, Chair, Built by Nature Investment Committee Built by Nature connects key actors across the built environment and forest communities to spark city-scale projects and amplify stories of groundbreaking timber projects and solutions. In close collaboration with its major partners and frontrunners, Built by Nature aims to change perceptions around timber construction and reshape the built environment system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both were named as winners during the final ceremony which took place at the MedtecLIVE conference in Stuttgart, Germany  they will now receive EUR 100,000 and 50,000respectively. Were very proud to announce the winners of our first neurotechprize. Many congratulations to Five Lives and Neurocast who showed relentless commitment to the prevention and detection of AD. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank our partner Biogen and all the teams that took part in this crucial programme  it has been truly inspiring to see talented innovators come together with the shared aim of helping to solve one of the greatest health challenges of our time. We now look forward to welcoming and supporting Five Lives and Neurocast as part of our community and seeing their high potential solutions come to fruition, said Jean-Marc Bourez, interim CEO, EIT Health. After passing through a period of 10 weeks of intense mentoring and validation facilitated by a top-class group of mentors, EIT Health and Biogen experts, the neurotechprize teams pitched their ideas to an independent panel of experts, consisting of leading neurologists, patient representatives, startup experts and payors. Fives Lives showed great promise with their mobile app which aims to empower individuals aged 50+ to track their brain health via clinically validated risk assessment. As a result, Fives Lives can provide lifestyle advice based on their individual dementia risk level, with positive messaging and gamified experience. This helps reduce their individual risk of future dementia through lifestyle improvement. Neurocast turns everyday digital interactions, such as smartphone use, into clinically approved outcomes, enabling doctors and researchers to passively measure individual patients. Through tracking each patients performance in daily life, medical professionals can proactively act upon changes. EIT Health and Biogen launched neurotechprize in late 2021 to find new solutions to combat the growing challenges associated with addressing AD. Dementia, of which AD is the most common form, has become one of the most pressing health concerns of the 21st century and is now regarded as a public health crisis.In line with our ageing population, incidence of AD is growing  over 55 million people live with dementia worldwide, and forecasts project that this figure will rise to 78 million by 2030. While there is currently no cure for AD, early diagnosis and treatment can help to slow disease progression and manage symptoms. However, stigma remains a key barrier to diagnosis. Public health bodies and organisations across the world are working to improve diagnosis, and such improvements will require innovative solutions for the subsequent management of newly diagnosed patients. The variety of solutionssubmittedby the various start-ups was unbelievable.It was hard to choose a winner.But we are happy tonowannounce two exciting winners: Five Lives and Neurocast. With our experienced partner, EIT Health,we are proud to support the winners to realise solutionsthatpromise to reduce the individual risk of future AD through lifestyle improvements and for those affected to make the diagnosis of AD easier,said Dr. Thorsten Lambertus, Head of neurotechlab, Biogen. The journey continues: Biogen is also working to find technology-based solutions for other neurological diseases in the future. Find out more about the neurotechprize",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is often the case that knowledge gap exists preventing innovators from benefiting from these rights. By working more closely together, the EIT and EPO can help ensure that the EIT community, Europes largest innovation ecosystem helps not only bring new ideas to market, but also protects those innovations and investments. By establishing a framework for close partnership and dialogue through the MoU, both EPO and EIT will work hand in hand to respond to the needs of their stakeholders responding quickly to the changing demands and conditions of a dynamic global patent system. At the EIT, we support innovation in order to address todays major global challenges ranging from health to climate change. We are delighted to work together with the European Patent Office, in order to offer its expertise to our innovators, helping them to protect and utilise the Intellectual Property generated when they turn their ideas into products and services for European citizens. Particularly SMEs and start-ups often lack capacity and knowledge to do so themselves. With this cooperation between EIT and EPO, we expect to see more of our innovations being grounded on business models that can sustain themselves and create a bigger impact. - Martin Kern, EIT Director Our partnership with the EIT will help us share knowledge even more effectively and support innovators, start-ups, SMEs and businesses across Europe with best-in-class expertise. This will enhance the impact of the European patent system at the same time as improving access to patent information and raising awareness of the power of patent knowledge. - Antnio Campinos, EPO President The two organisations have already enjoyed a fruitful collaboration since 2018, with the EPO participating in the EIT Innovation Communities working group on IP and Innovation Panel meetings to provide tailor made training on IP issues. Since then, additional targeted training has been offered to different parts of the EIT Community. The EIT Community was also introduced to the PATLIB network to find synergies with the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme  a program which aims to boost innovation in countries and regions which are considered by the European Innovation Scoreboard to have modest or moderate levels of innovation. With the signed MoU, the EPO and EIT have agreed to develop specific activities, projects and programmes to be implemented in a spirit of co-operation and common commitment. The aim of this cooperation is to support innovators and entrepreneurs across Europe in turning their ideas into products and services, thus creating highly-skilled jobs and economic growth and also to promote a modern IP culture in Europe among researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs by improving their access to the European IP system.

eit283,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-science-reveals-last-paths-stop-irreversible-planetary-damage,EIT Climate-KIC: Science reveals last paths to stop irreversible planetary damage,"On 4 April, the UNs climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released the last of three installments of its Sixth Assessment Report. The3,675-page long reportfocuses on solutions to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It provides a roadmap for how to rapidly reduce emissions in the next three decades and urges countries to make immediate and deep emissions reductions to avoid the worst-case warming scenario. This report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a litany of broken climate promises. It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world. We need to create a grassroots movement that cant be ignoredby demanding the end of fossil fuel subsidies and the massive deployment of renewable energy. We are on a fast track to climate disaster: Major cities underwater. Unprecedented heatwaves. Terrifying storms. Widespread water shortages. The extinction of a million species of plants and animals. This is not fiction or exaggeration. U.N. Secretary-General Antnio Guterres The report shows that rapid mitigation measures such as reductions in fossil fuels and better building practices are essential to avoid extreme global warming.But without immediate and deep emissionsreductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is beyond reach.It is now or never, the scientists warned during a press conference. According to the IPCC, global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero in the 2050s to stabilise global warming at the target agreed upon in the Paris Climate Accords. The report provides details on the last remaining paths to stop irreversible damage to the planet. It makes clear that there is no one silver bullet solution to solving global warming. Instead, governments, businesses, communities and individuals all have a role to play in transforming economies, embracing new habits, and shaping a safer and more sustainable future. An article on Climate Home Newslists five key takeaways from the report: The report comes amid recent concerns over the global supply of oil and natural gas due to Russias invasion of Ukraine. In opinion pieces recently published in the media, EIT Climate-KIC CEO Kirsten Dunlop writes thatthe EU can stop the import of Russian gasandInnovation is key to enable the EU to break free from Russian energy.

With its diverse programmes, EIT Manufacturing strengthens the European manufacturing industry, which is also a key to growth in Austria, contributing 21% to the gross domestic product. The strength of the Austrian industry is clearly evident in the EIT Manufacturing ecosystem. In the first two years of EIT Manufacturing’s operational activity, Austrian organisations were involved in about 20 % of all funded projects. “Innovation-based manufacturing is a key driver for Austria’s prosperity and competitiveness. EIT Manufacturing and its CLCs offer a strong network for innovative companies, start-ups and SMEs and targeted measures to accelerate innovation within the European manufacturing sector,” says Dipl.-Ing. Michael Esterl, Secretary General and Head of Cabinet of the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW). Following the keynote speeches and the panel discussion, the participants were able to get an overview of the current activities, initiatives, and programmes of EIT Manufacturing in the areas of innovation, education, business creation and RIS (Regional Innovation Scheme). For example, a mobile air purification device with integrated disinfection function was demonstrated, which was funded in 2020 in the course of a special project call and developed with the participation of the Institute of Production Technologies and Photonic Technologies at TU Wien. Supported start-ups (SentryNode), the winner of the LEADERS competition, Angela Ivanova (LAM’ON), and project leaders of funded projects (among others DeCoTe) were also present to showcase their innovations and achievements. In addition, the CLC East team presented the projects MIT.IC.AT and EuProGigant. EuProGigant, in which CLC East is involved as a project partner, is the Gaia-X lighthouse project in the manufacturing environment for smart and sovereign use of data in production. The team informed interested participants about the next planned activities, for example the Manufacturing Day on 1 June 2022 as part of the ViennaUP’22 and the start-up program “Discover Vienna: Manufacturing Edition”, which is already taking place for the second time.

Three among them won the Jury Award and one won the Audience Award. A Special Mention of Honour was also given.  The proposals came from a diversity of places. There was one application from Croatia, Greece, Hungary, India, Italy, Latvia, Peru, Romania, Slovenia and Turkey respectively. Estonia, Kenya and Switzerland had two applications each. There were three applications from Finland, while four were submitted from Germany and Spain respectively. The Jury Award winners were from Italy, Germany and Estonia.  Martin Kern, Director of the EIT said: “The EIT Community shines in bringing together the brightest innovators from all corners of our continent to create new ideas that turn challenges into solutions and transformation. The New European Bauhaus is built on the belief that the spaces and place we cherish need to be sustainable, beautiful, inclusive and a force to bring us together. I congratulate the finalists in dreaming to achieve this and I can’t wait to see their innovations further come to life with the support of the EIT.”  The First Prize of EUR 3,000 plus travel and accommodation to attend the New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards Ceremony was awarded to Jebbia, a solution created with reused materials to rethink urban landscapes. It’s a weather-proof and modular green cover that protects and hides urban technical infrastructure, creating positive impact for the user and the community by preserving urban heritage and landscapes, increase green areas in cities, and absorbing CO2, among other things.     The Second Prize of EUR 2,000 plus travel and accommodation to attend the New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards Ceremony was awarded to TurtleApp, the solution to promote second hand clothing in an attractive and convenient way. The modern and user-friendly app consolidates all the possible second-hand options available in one’s proximity, prioritising consumer needs instead of pushing them to buy more, while making use of digital technology to match the right products to the right consumers. All of this can be localised, bringing together consumers, city initiatives, shops and digital platforms with relevant items located within 25 kilometres.      The Third Prize of EUR 1,000 plus travel and accommodation to attend the New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards Ceremony was awarded to WasteLocker, which aims to tag batches of waste at the source and to make their reuse, recycling or recovery simpler, traceable and certifiable in real-time. The project will remove bottlenecks in the waste stream and give feedback. Only around 30 per cent of waste is recycled at the moment in Estonia, which is why the team has discussed the possibility of pilot projects with support from the cities of Tallinn and Tartu, Cleantech Estonia and contacts across the value chain.    The Audience Award of EUR 1,000 plus travel and accommodation to attend the New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards Ceremony was awarded to Re-monda, a circular solution to manufacture highly-demanded biodegradable materials in a context of plastic crisis worldwide. Re-monda seeks to turn oranges into bioplastic, re-valuing organic waste while reducing the environmental impact of the whole city. This is possible thanks to the presence of valuable polysaccharides such as pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose in the orange peel. The proposal was born in Climathon Sevilla 2021, with the goal of implementing it in eCitySevilla, a carbon-neutral project in Cartuja island for 2025.      An Honourable Mention goes to Food for the Earth. Food for the Earth is a community-based initiative for composting on-site. It empowers local communities and promotes climate-friendly behaviour and ways to live. Food for Earth’s main goal is to create, adapt, transfer knowledge and raise awareness among citizens and municipalities about soil’s health in urban and periurban areas. It addresses specific social groups, such as families, youngsters or children seeking climate friendly behaviour.     Grand Jury Award The Jury Award and Audience Award winners now move forward to the Grand Jury Award contest (“Best of Bests”). The Joint Research Centre will review the four proposals to select amongst them the Grand Jury Award winner. The name of the winner will be released at the New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards in-person ceremony session.

eit289,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-community-new-european-bauhaus-initiative-selected-citizen-engagement-projects,EIT Community New European Bauhaus initiative selected citizen engagement projects,"Mapping challenges and developing solutions in collaboration with citizens is key to delivering transformation. Citizen engagement that reflects the diversity of voices in the community is essential to developing long-term solutions that match the wider community's needs—working together for an expected higher goal results in a true synergy of innovation, creativity, and design, improving citizens' quality of life in cities. For citizens, this can increase social acceptance of change and encourage a shift to more sustainable behaviours. Moreover, it can help the private sector adapt and tackle regulatory frameworks and reconsider the fundamental value systems and norms they are founded upon. Successful citizen engagement will increase the ability to create, experiment, demonstrate, scale, and deploy innovative solutions for a just, equitable and prosperous future.   The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), together with our thematic pan-European Innovation Communities, is well placed to play a vital role in the design, delivery and dissemination phases of the NEB. A close collaboration between the EIT Community (namely EIT Food, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT Climate KIC and EIT Digital) in 2021 focused on new citizen engagement activities and capitalising on existing innovative solutions and scaling them to cities.  Through our activities, we have tested the application of Bauhaus principles to current challenges facing the world, such as climate, mobility, digital, health and food challenges. We have further positioned these activities in the context of the global pandemic and economic and social recovery. Finally, we examine which of the Bauhaus principles can be replaced with new ways of thinking and actively question the humanist ideas behind the movement using the Knowledge Triangle, bringing together business, academia and citizens to develop and test new concepts of future ways of living. Discover the selected projects that were conducted under two EIT - New European Bauhaus calls, The aim of this Cross-KIC NEB Calls for proposals was to work on activities where citizens and end-users are asked to identify relevant challenges of their city and empowered to co-create together potential solutions in an ideation process.  The project boosted local energy communities among vulnerable consumers of the neighbourhood of Cerdanyola, a deprived area in Mataró. Supporting an open business model for self-consumption installations in energy communities for social economy entities (commercials, technicians, mediators, ethical banks, etc.), catapulting the contribution of entities with social and environmental value in cooperation with the municipality the citizens. ECOSERVEIS has developed a business model for self-consumption energy communities based on SSC (the MONDCE project, currently ongoing), which served as the basis for the reflective process regarding access to energy in Mataró and definition and boosting of future energy communities. The EC-Boost Mataró Lab project brought energy players and citizens together, with the aspects of new initiatives arising, combined with massive sensitisation and engagement campaigns. Through the project's development, the local authority's implication has been vital to getting to know the local context. The municipality had no experience either in shared self-consumption or communitarian projects. Therefore, this project shared several business models to implement a public-communitarian collaboration. The project listed different case studies and grouped them into three different categories. The three core business models identified and suggested for the municipality to build innovative public-communitarian energy production initiatives along with citizens, including vulnerable users, are as follows:  The main objective of the Ugly Foodling project was to create awareness among young consumers about the reasons and challenges of food waste and bring them together with more experienced consumers (elderly) who spend their youth in different conditions (non-abundance of food, participation in food-producing etc.). The Ugly Foodling represents food that is still edible or still has value, but it ends up in the rubbish. The work of the co-creation event focused on changing the fate of the Ugly Foodlings towards a sustainable and inclusive ""happier end"" for all, the environment, the city and its citizens, the food producers. Four storylines of the adventures of the Ugly Foodlings at the food production site, in the market, in the restaurant and at home will be produced by the young adult participants and presented in digital format.  The project ""Lugoj: For kids, by kids"" improved the public space in the town of Lugoj, Romania, through an innovative ""grassroots"" approach by connecting pupils with the public administration. The main objectives of the ""Lugoj – For kids, by kids"" project were to identify, with the help of pupils, obstacles children face in cycling to school, using the relevant infrastructure, and co-create solutions. The secondary aim of the pupil engagement phase was to stimulate their participation and involvement in the decision-making processes of their school by forming a long-term working group to deal with school projects. The pupils and the municipality formed a powerful bond and connected through a shared vision, improving the public realm through Creation of a GIS StoryMap showcasing problematic areas of the cycling infrastructure in the town and proposed solutions. The project's main output is the visualised ArcGIS based Interactive and Story Maps, which offers the possibility to visualise in real-time the information and data collected (entered) by the students involved in the project.  This Cross-KIC NEB call will offer regions, cities or affiliated entities the possibility to select project solutions to drive a specific challenge in their urban transformation. Cities and regions can benefit from existing work aiming for immediate impact within 2021. The following projects contributed to higher use rates, improved physical facilities, urban greening, more inclusive access, and active mobility.  The container gardening project contributed to the aesthetic and functional redevelopment of a part of the University of Turin that has been unused and abandoned for years, including a waste dump. The idea is to use the paradigm of the New European Bauhaus applied to urban regeneration and the redevelopment of a place through food. The material used for building the infrastructure is completely retrieved through circular economy processes. In particular, a co-design and co-creation of a space dedicated to producing fruit and vegetables through container gardens were used. The creation of the box gardens was done by implementing a co-creation process and co-design of the area in question. The mapping of local actors was carried out, and collaborative and co-designing relationships were activated. Specifically, in addition to several visits by students, lecturers and administrative staff representing university citizenry, the project also involved citizens, elders, and a nursery school, and created a network with other urban garden initiatives in the city, as well as interacting with a social cooperative that manages urban gardens in a neighbouring area and the citizen hub that deals with the social inclusion of disabled people grouping all the leading relevant organisations. During the meetings, the spaces, management rules, stakeholder needs, inclusive design, crops, and types of plants were co-designed and co-selected. Later, the area was also cleared of 860 kg of waste. The history of the site was reconstructed, also from the point of view of the tree species that were present. The choice of plants was inspired by the stories we heard and the various testimonies of those who grew up in these spaces.   The CLIME project was designed to optimise heritage experiences to climate resilience and the recent experience of climate and connected cultural change and adaptation and inclusivity and revive 'Councils of Elders' connection with youth. The purpose is inverting the relationships between city and nature by conceptualising cities in the natural environment by providing a gamified AR mobile app, the Equinox XR, for youth, where they can ""clime"" both physically through nature and culturally as experienced by our elders. In Western culture, independent living ""devalues"" people as they age. The generation gap is highly pronounced, with the elderly being socially excluded and their knowledge and experience not visible. Therefore the main goal was to connect generations in a common goal of tackling climate change by using technology to share an experience that stretches over the lifetime of elderly citizens and benefiting from their strategies of living in rapid climate change. By mapping the narratives of the elderly, an AR tour of the city and city surroundings was designed, through which educational content on sufficiency will be adopted in a fun and recreational way. The ""Clime"" AR mobile app connect generations and give us educational content about life in the past, life before plastic, before significant climate change, about the self-sufficient life of our elders. With this mobile application, users will be able to take a tour of Pula, generate a physical map of the city of Pula based on stories and create an open database based on research.   From 2020 the Municipality of Barcelona has set the project ""Protegim les escoles"" as a high priority strategy to provide Barcelona's schools with safe, comfortable, and healthy public spaces that act as meeting places for children, their families and neighbours. By 2030, it is expected that all the 585 schools in Barcelona will offer safe and comfortable surroundings. In line with this, FURNISH emerges as an opportunity to help in this pacification. The project provided interesting and instigating interactive prototypes to stimulate permanence in these areas. These places have the potential to work as transitional spaces, connecting the urban and school environments creatively, promoting more extended stays before and after school hours, and enabling its use as extensions of classrooms and playgrounds, engaging children to play, be active and learn. The school community had tested the prototypes, and their implementation integrates the engagement of the school community in the decision-making process. Two teams were selected to develop the co-creation process and composed by Fab Labs, research groups, architects, engineers, designers and makers; they were able to produce rapid solutions to the urgent spatial opportunities of the new public space. The activities were mainly focused on the co-design and co-fabrication processes, the citizen engagement activities (including co-creation workshops, presentations and participatory construction of elements) and the assessment and impact analysis. An essential part of the design strategy for the prototype were the ideas of participation, modularity, and sustainability.  All of the granted projects had been published on the Decidum platform EIT Community New European Bauhaus website to give more visibility and outreach to them. Through the Decision platform, interested parties can participate in the process by supporting projects and giving their feedback and filling in the survey until 31st March 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was the first event of the French Presidency of the European Council, which began on 1 January 2022, and also the opening event in the Competitiveness Agenda. During the conference, high-level public and private sector panelists focused on the actions needed to secure European supplies of critical raw materials. They discussed the need for a more strategic approach to European vulnerabilities, similar to what major partners and competitors are doing. Furthermore, they examined the tools, like IPCEIs, and the funding to be effectively mobilised or developed to strengthen the resilience of European industries. As part of this event, EIT RawMaterials CEO Bernd Schäfer gave a keynote speech on the topic of how to reduce EU dependencies in raw materials. Mr Schäfer’s speech raised the issues of raw materials investment, diversification, the need for a level playing field, the circular economy, standards and regulations and the urgent need for responsible mining that meets only the highest ethical and environmental standards. European industries and research institutions are recognised leaders in everything from automation, digitalisation to best practice in mining.

eit293,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-hub-israel-boosting-innovation-ecosystems,EIT Hub Israel boosting innovation ecosystems,"An example of such exchange is the Ecosystem Summit organised by the EIT Hub in Israel, launched as part of the 2019 EIT Global Outreach Programme. The conference has become a must-attend event to discuss the latest global trends and challenges in the ecosystem world.  On December 6 2021, the agreement on Israel’s association with Horizon Europe, the world’s largest research and innovation programme with a total budget of EUR 95,5 billion, came into force after being signed by Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth and Haim Regev, Israel’s Ambassador to the EU and NATO. Over the past 25 years, cooperation between the EU and Israel has been consistently evolving, bringing many benefits along the way. Israel’s innovation processes are very agile, with a “fire-fighting” approach that deals mainly with short-term timelines. And they have proven that this works: Israel has the largest number of start-ups per capita in the world (about one per 1,400 inhabitants) and ranks first in the world in R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. One of the key ingredients of Israel’s innovation ecosystem is deeply embedded in the country’s daily reality. It lies in the sense of urgency and constraints to survive and innovate today for a better tomorrow. With the example of Israel in mind, it is exciting to see the potential when start-ups unite around a common mission. For Europe and beyond, this can be the driver that enables companies to excel and deliver truly unique and innovative solutions rapidly.  Bram Pauwels, Strategic Partnership Manager at European Business and Innovation Centre Network.  On the other hand, Europe has a long-term approach to certain societal issues. This allows European countries to be proactive rather than reactive. While the action takes longer, decisions are made in a structured, evidence-based way. From the perspective of this continuum, Europe and Israel are clearly complementary.  We represent two extremes, and knowing that the best combination tends to be in the middle, our alliance ensures that we both move forward and reinforce the best on each side. Michal Seror, Ecosystem Development Director at Start-Up Nation Central.  Europe’s goal of becoming the first carbon-neutral continent and leading the global green transition might inspire and gently push Israel’s high-tech sector to address the climate emergency. Although there are exciting initiatives in Israel such as the Climate Solutions Prize (a USD 1M prize for innovative responses to the climate crisis sponsored by KKL-JNF in collaboration with Start-Up Nation Central and the Peres Centre for Peace and Innovation), a holistic strategy by the so-called ‘Start-up Nation’ to solve the climate crisis could make a global difference.  A successful example of EU-Israel collaboration is the aforementioned EIT Hub Israel, launched as part of the 2019 EIT Global Outreach Programme. The EIT Innovation Communities involved are EIT Health (lead), EIT Food, EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT RawMaterials and EIT Digital as observers. The Hub supports European innovators in attracting Israeli customers, partners and investors and has developed powerful programmes targeting specific audiences, such as Disrupt me (European companies looking to introduce Israeli innovation) or Mission Innovation (an immersion bootcamp for European diplomats), and Connect & Experience (professional training for ecosystem leaders) which facilitates The Ecosystem Summit, the annual conference to celebrate, consolidate and expand the European-Israeli innovation community. The first Ecosystem Summit took place in 2019 and is held annually. This year’s edition set a new record with 140 participants, 20 top speakers, 6 panels, 3 breakout rooms and 19 ecosystem managers from 12 European countries (Belgium, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Czech Republic, Italy and Sweden).

The blood leaks backwards, posing a greater risk of mortality. Currently, the only option to treat this chronic condition is open heart surgery, often unsuitable for frail elderly patients. CroíValve was founded in 2016 and is a spin-out from EIT Health partner Trinity College Dublin. It has created a minimally invasive device that replaces and repairs the heart’s main valve, without the need for surgery. This solution meets a previously unmet clinical need with the potential to become available to a wider cohort of candidates suffering from TR, who would otherwise go untreated. “We met a number of partners through EIT Health. They supported us with our pre-clinical testing. It’s both a timely and costly pre-clinical test journey. Securing support from EIT Health was hugely transformational – without that, it certainly would have been far more challenging.” - Lucy O’Keeffe, CroíValve CEO  As well as HBAN, other investors that participated in the Series A funding round include Atlantic Bridge University Fund, Broadview Ventures, SOSV, Enterprise Ireland, Elkstone, Ascentifi and DBIC. The funding will support a European Feasibility Study of the CroíValve Transcatheter Tricuspid DUO Coaptation Valve System. “Start-ups such as CroíValve face a long road through clinical trials as they work to provide a solution to a chronic problem that affects so many of our elderly population. We at EIT Health are committed to supporting these revolutionary products and services to reach markets sooner so they can have actual impact on the lives of European citizens. We congratulate CroíValve on this latest round of investment.” - Leslie Harris, EIT Health Ireland-UK Managing Director Learn more about CroíValve’s solution, and track it’s journey to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The funding will help them to bring their innovative device to market in Europe and the US. BPH, also known as prostate enlargement, is a common urological disease which nearly 1 in 4 men will suffer from in their lifetime. If medication is not effective, BPH is often treated with surgery. ProVerum’s founders created ProVee as a less invasive alternative. ProVee will provide urologists with a treatment option for BPH that can be administered as an outpatient-based procedure. In 2016, EIT Health provided ProVerum with funding and local opportunities in Ireland which enabled the company to spin out from Trinity College, Dublin. We have since supported ProVerum with market validation across Europe. The team pitched at the EIT Health Summit in Barcelona in November 2016, at the Global Investor Forum in February 2017, and as a Catapult Finalist in December 2017. ProVerum went on to win funding by EIT Health as an innovation project in 2019, supporting our focus of improving care pathways. We congratulate ProVerum on this successful investment round and celebrate their potential to make a real impact on BPH care pathways. As they bring their product to market, with our continued support, ProVerum promises to significantly improve care and outcomes for those with BPH, in Europe and beyond. “This is a very exciting time for us and EIT Health has been extremely supportive in getting us to this stage.

eit300,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kics-cookbook-systems-change-nordic-innovation-strategies-sustainable,EIT Climate-KIC's Cookbook for systems change: Nordic innovation strategies for sustainable food systems,"It features EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstration concept which draws upon a decade’s worth of work on climate change mitigation and adaptation, community and innovation ecosystem development, and systems change. Funded by EIT Climate-KIC as part of its Resilient Food Systems and Diets Deep Demonstration, the book was produced in partnership with EAT, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University and the Nordic Council of Ministers. We can and must work with the strategic innovation of food systems to solve some of our greatest societal challenges. This is the fundamental proposal of the book, “Cookbook for systems change: Nordic innovation strategies for sustainable food systems.” In essence, this cookbook of strategies  demonstrates the role that a strong public innovation system can play in the drive towards sustainable food systems,  proposing a method for deliberate food system transformation—a mission-based approach—that can support people, the planet and society. But while mission-led strategies have received increasing attention in policy circles at national and EU levels, they are still rather loosely defined and there are very few examples of their implementation. Moving from intent to action has been slow as there is no existing playbook (or cookbook) to go by—resulting in mission-thinking being often overlooked in new policy proposals. This strategy cookbook will provide the ingredients—templates for developing interventions, guides for how to get started and examples of cross-cutting projects—that you can use to create your own recipes for change. To accomplish this, we offer a new, emergent way of working with complex and dynamic systems. The cookbook is intended primarily for national and regional innovation agencies, as governments have both a mandate and more authority than any other entity to lead the change needed to achieve sustainable food systems. However, because innovation ecosystems include a variety of different actors, this strategy cookbook also provides valuable insights into the roles that entrepreneurs, civil society and research organisations can play in cultivating change from the bottom up. Drawing inspiration from a Nordic innovation alliance, this cookbook suggests that the Nordic countries’ most important global contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals may not be a specific technology, business model or policy innovation. Rather, this contribution can come in the form of demonstrating how a strong public innovation ecosystem is the missing link to overcome the complex societal challenges defining our times.

eit304,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-mowoot-earns-fda-device-designation,EIT Health MOWOOT earns FDA device designation,"The medical device company headquartered in Barcelona, Spain, announced that its first product “MOWOOT II Intestinal Transit Management System” has been granted the breakthrough device designation by the FDA. With this important recognition by the USA's highest authority for medical devices the company joins a select list of companies to receive this designation since the programme began in 2016. “The Breakthrough Device Designation is a significant milestone for our company and validates our belief that our solution offers significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, per FDA requirements. Our clinical results show clear benefits for severely constipated patients, and we look forward to working with the FDA to introduce our technology to the US market as quickly as possible to improve bowel management in patients with neurogenic bowel disorders, for better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare expenditures.” Dr. Markus Wilhelms, CEO and cofounder of MOWOOT. The MOWOOT device, with its patented ‘Intermittent Colonic Exoperistalsis’™ technology, offers a novel, purely physical, non-drug and non-invasive treatment for patients with chronic constipation, a condition which affects 17% of adults in Europe. The receipt of Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) demonstrates that MOWOOT can offer significant advantages over existing alternatives for more effective and efficient management of neurogenic bowel disorder (NBD), a severe form of chronic constipation that affects up to 80% of neurological patients, such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease. Conventional solutions focus on pharmacological or invasive approaches, such as laxatives, constipation drugs, trans anal irrigation systems and solutions that require surgery, which in many cases have low efficacy and several side effects for NBD patients. In contrast, the MOWOOT device has demonstrated its safety, a high clinical responder rate, and important improvements in clinical outcomes and patients’ quality of life, in a recently published international clinical trial. “In our service we see the most severe and refractory cases, so I was sceptical about this therapy; but we have now tried MOWOOT therapy in several patients who had failed all other treatments, with substantial benefit in the majority.” Dr. Yan Yiannakou, Professor of Neuro-gastroenterology at the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust (UK) The BDD is a seal of approval for medical devices that provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The following criteria must be met for such devices: The breakthrough devices programme was created to provide patients and providers with timely access to medical devices. It offers selected companies the access to a fast-track program towards the US market entry, with priority treatment and support. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are currently evaluating a special rule that would cover a breakthrough medical device for four years starting on the date of FDA authorisation. This guaranteed access to public healthcare reimbursement would be a very positive signal to medical device manufacturers and investors alike. In medical devices, investors are extra wary of the risk posed by the FDA regulatory process and want to be assured that a company’s product has value to both patients and physicians. They also want to see a return on their investment. A BDD gives investors added confidence in a company. If the FDA has recognised a medical device company’s product as one that will advance public health and/or offer superior treatment, that company will be more attractive to investors. MOWOOT is currently running a fundraising campaign with a goal of two million Euros to expand their global market reach. Investors can support the start-up on two pan-European investment platforms: EIT Health´s own digital venture capital platform, Aescuvest, and Spanish crowdfunding platform Capital Cell.

As highlighted at the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit, there is a greater understanding of how sustainable seafood can meaningfully contribute to and be at the heart of global food systems.   At the EIT Food Aquaculture Showcase event, 12 EIT Food partners presented their aquaculture projects which are transforming aquatic farming into a more sustainable, profitable and efficient sector. EIT Food, the world’s largest and most dynamic food innovation community, is supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union.   At the event, it was highlighted that sustainable aquatic foods are an excellent source of important nutrients, with a lower carbon footprint compared to many animal-derived foods. Importantly, aquaculture also supports the livelihoods of many citizens in less-developed countries, which suggests it has a role to play in securing future food security.  EIT Food’s Aquaculture Showcase event also featured special messages from Manuel Barange, Director UN FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture, Lara Barazi, President of the Federation of European Aquaculture Producers (FEAP) and Peter Thomson, United Nations Secretary - General's Special Envoy for the Ocean.  “Our first aquaculture showcase welcomed many aquaculture experts from across Europe. Our outstanding speakers showed that we are making excellent progress in transforming the aquaculture sector into a sustainable form of food production. Although it is evident that there is also room for improvement and much remains to be done for this transformation, it was amazing to see that everyone cares about the future of our food, wants to make a difference and build a better future for all.”  Mercedes Groba, Innovation Programme Manager at EIT Food “The SDGs are one of the internationally agreed frameworks that we can unite around. Aquaculture can support the success of many of the ambitions through providing nutritious foods in a sustainable way, to benefit both people and the planet. Thank you EIT Food for playing your important role, sharing this message and showcasing innovative solutions. It was a privilege to speak at your event.”  Melanie Siggs, Director of Strategic Programmes at The Global Seafood Alliance “Innovation and technology is key to the transformation of the aquaculture sector. Technology can help to address challenges such as transparency, diversification of farmed aquatic species, depleting marine ecosystems and unsustainable fish feeds. For example, blockchain technology can be used to trace aquaculture products to its original source to increase consumer trust.”  Laura Krishfield, Senior Research Associate at Lux Research The following aquaculture projects, which tackle challenges such as food waste, sustainable production, animal welfare and education and entrepreneurship, were presented at the Showcase event: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This level of impact is an extraordinary undertaking for each city and will require profound and systemic changes. Government leadership will be critical, and actions by industry, education and research institutions, and civic organisations must align in terms of policies, governance, and how we arrange for the needed capital investments. Launched in October 2021, NetZeroCities is a four-year project designed to help cities overcome the current structural, institutional, and cultural barriers they face in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The project will enable European cities and citizens to show the way forward towards an inclusive, thriving, climate resilient and sustainable future and this will be achieved by working in: Cities will benefit from an intensive support relationship and dedicated services to achieve their net zero goals. The project supports the EU’s Mission of “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030” newly launched as part of the Horizon Europe programme. The Mission seeks to scale the activities of this project across 100 cities, and to tackle the unprecedented capital investments needed to make such a transformation possible. To achieve this, NetZeroCities gathers 33 partners from 13 countries. EIT Urban Mobility as a member of the partnership will bring its knowledge and expertise on sustainable urban mobility and transportation, as well as its strong ties to cities and network organisations in the field. EIT Urban Mobility will contribute to the call for pilots and engage with cities to understand their barriers, drivers and needs to achieve climate neutrality targets. With other NetZeroCities partners, we will direct support to cities in the scaling up of piloted and tested solutions and provide state-of-the-art expertise on mobility solutions to help cities reach climate neutrality.   By working in the implementation of NetZeroCities, we are supporting our vision of creating more liveable urban spaces, by fostering innovation and transformation to improve quality of life and decarbonisation in European cities. NetZeroCities is coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC and builds on the expertise of its partners, leveraging a vast array of knowledge and expertise, as well as access to a large network of cities throughout Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The teams will also receive funding of up to EUR 1.5 million each. Eye and vision care is both an under-innovated and underinvested area of healthcare. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study ranked vision impairment, including blindness, as the third leading cause of years lived with disability. Globally, at least 2.2 billion people around the world have a vision impairment, from which, according to the World Health Organization, almost 50% could be prevented or cured. Now in its fourth year, the Wild Card programme is part of our open innovation offering, which provides the opportunity for teams and individuals including innovators, medical professionals, and entrepreneurs from all walks of life to come together and solve pressing health challenges. Wild Card builds game-changing life science companies to break new ground in health by challenging the status quo in areas of high unmet need. Beginning with challenges that we set, the annual Wild Card programme invites talented innovators from across Europe to respond with their ideas. Successful applicants start their journey with a deep dive; putting them through their paces on everything from team formation, critical thinking, business model validation and pitching. Finally, participants pitch their solution to a panel of industry leaders to secure funding to incorporate their company and bring their solution to market. “We’re proud to announce our support for PeriVision and INVENTION, which marks our commitment to improving innovation in the field of eye and vision care. As well as EUR 3 million, we’re providing access to our cross-border, cross-discipline, expertise, and network so that we can innovate together. We hope to rapidly bring new safe and effective technologies to Europeans living with debilitating eye and vision conditions,” Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO, EIT Health. PeriVision, a team of six, from Switzerland will focus on developing a novel artificial intelligence device that will allow for faster diagnosis of glaucoma. “Glaucoma is the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and PeriVision wants to reimagine the way we detect and monitor this condition. We provide private practices and hospitals with a portable and AI-based fast visual field-testing device to optimise workflows and better manage glaucoma. The Wild Card programme helped us tremendously to understand who benefits most from our solution and how we build a sustainable business. The mentors made us look at the problem from a patient, clinician, payor, and investor viewpoint. We are now looking forward to finalising our solution and helping patients and clinicians worldwide,” Patrick Kessel CEO & Cofounder of PeriVision. INVENTION, a team of three from Sweden, will develop a natural therapeutic contact lens for the treatment of eye conditions such as myopia and dry eye. “Globally, more than 2.6 billion people have poor distance vision (myopia) and 1.1 billion suffer from dry eye according to recent WHO reports. Despite the technological advances for treating these conditions separately, millions still suffer from both conditions and are underserved as the existing treatment options are suboptimal. We are developing a Natural Contact Lens made from the same material as the human eye that can help manage myopia in dry eye patients. The EIT Health Wild Card programme helped us better understand the need and examine our assumptions towards developing a solution for addressing a major unmet need in eye and vision care,” Mehrdad Rafat, Cofounder of INVENTION. Following the announcement of the 2021 selected teams, we have launched the focus of our Wild Card challenges for 2022: early detection of cancer and mental health. Topics which were selected in consultation with medical, corporate, and financial experts. Urgent action is needed to address the impact of COVID-19 on cancer and mental health, which were both exacerbated by the pandemic. Modelling in several European countries predicts thousands of excess cancer deaths due to the disruption in diagnosis and care. Currently, 52% of people with cancer do not survive, however survival rates are generally higher when the disease is diagnosed and treated early. The Wild Card 2022 cancer challenge has been set to contribute towards innovation that can help to improve the detection of cancer earlier, when it can be more easily and successfully treated. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a considerable impact on the mental health of citizens, with a rise in the reporting of many mental health conditions. One in four people will be affected by a mental health or neurological condition in their lifetime, and around 450 million people are already suffering. The scale of the problem places such conditions among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide. The Wild Card mental health challenge aims to find solutions that can facilitate access to care as well as improve the overall outcomes of those affected.

eit309,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/new-eu-urban-mobility-framework-spur-transition-safer-and-more-sustainable-urban,New EU Urban Mobility Framework to spur transition to safer and more sustainable urban mobility,"The framework is part of the Package for Efficient and Green Mobility which includes a revision of the TEN-T regulation, ITS Directive and an action plan to boost long-distance and cross-border passenger rail services. Transportation determines how cities look like, how liveable, equitable and healthy they are.  If recommendations are taken on board, the new communication can foster more sustainable urban mobility and is a welcomed push for more action from Member States. Notably, the Commission plans to strengthen the role of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) and  publish  by the end of 2022 a recommendation to Member States on the national programmes to support regions and cities in the roll-out of effective sustainable urban mobility plans that would help achieve EU goals. Further work will be done to refine comprehensive indicators for urban mobility data collection (SUMI), improve zero emission logistics (including data collection) and the safety of micro-mobility devices. The amended TEN-T Regulation proposes to improve urban mobility in urban nodes as Member States have to ensure better connectivity and multi-modal hubs among others. SUMPs (or an equivalent “long-term, all-encompassing integrated mobility plan for the entire functional urban area,” including indicators and targets to measure progress) will be required for all urban nodes by 2025. The number of urban nodes will also increase, as all cities above 100 000 inhabitants (or capitals of an NUTS2 region) on the TEN-T will be considered an urban node if the proposal is adopted (raising the number of urban nodes to approximately 400 from the initial list of 88). According to the new TEN-T Regulation, urban nodes should also be able to collect data covering at minimum greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes, modal share for all modes, and access to mobility services. “The new urban node approach is a long-awaited one that finally puts the urban dimension at the centre of the TEN-T. Only by tackling local transport we can arrive at the ambitious 90% emissions reduction in 2050. As urban areas grow, they will continue to generate substantial traffic volumes. It is key to be proactive and pre-empt and curb bottlenecks by improving first and last mile connectivity through sustainable and innovative solutions for both freight and passenger transport.’’ Dr Maria Tsavachidis, CEO of EIT Urban Mobility The measures needed to achieve the decarbonisation of transport in cities like fleet electrification, modal shift, encouraging more active modes and better mass transit can raise costs and need step wise investments. An EIT Urban Mobility study modelling the urban mobility transition towards the Green Deal goals estimates that European cities need extra investments of EUR 86 billion in sustainable urban mobility compared to business-as-usual, leading to net benefits of up to EUR 177 billion by 2030. Of these net benefits, cities have the potential to generate EUR 79 billion in saved health costs linked to externalities avoided such as pollution and traffic accident fatalities. On average, each euro invested in the transition can generate up to EUR 3,06 by 2030 (i.e. up to EUR 2,14 in revenues, and EUR 0,92 in externalities savings).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduced under Horizon Europe, the scheme allows the EIC to give a streamlined treatment to applications stemming from projects already funded by the EIT KICs (and other eligible EU schemes) under Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. EIC and EIT have reinforced their collaboration to support the best European entrepreneurs. This will enable innovators, innovative SMEs and start-ups to receive quality support services to deploy and scale up innovations faster and with greater impact. -  Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth  The Fast Track scheme recognises that start-ups and scale-ups emerging from the EIT Innovation Communities already have a proven track record, which gives them a faster access to the EIC Accelerator funding. Subject to an identification and review process undertaken by each EIT Innovation Community, companies will be invited to directly submit their full proposal to the highly competitive EIC Accelerator without going through the initial ‘short proposal’ stage of the evaluation procedure. They can also directly benefit from three days of tailored-made coaching to prepare the full proposal. Once fast-tracked to the EIC Accelerator, applicants have up to one year to develop and submit their full proposals. This gives them time to apply to any of the regular EIC Accelerator cut-off dates throughout the year. Interested start-ups and scale-ups, which are already beneficiaries of Business Creation Programmes of the EIT Community, should contact their respective KIC for more information about the process and the relevant deadlines. The EIC and EIT are part of a wider ecosystem that the EU put in place under Horizon Europe to give Europe's entrepreneurs every opportunity to become world-leading companies. In January this year, they signed a Memorandum of Understanding that strengthened the support that the EIC and EIT are already providing to thousands of innovative start-ups and SMEs to scale up in Europe and to ensure mutual access to advisory services and networks. The EIC Accelerator offers start-ups and SMEs grants of up to EUR 2.5 million combined with equity investments through the EIC Fund ranging from EUR 0.5 to EUR 15 million.

To bridge this skills gap, the EO4GEO Alliance has been working on upskilling and reskilling EU’s workforce in the Earth Observation and Geoinformation sector, resulting in the release of the Space/ Geoinformation Sector Skills Strategy in November 2021. The strategic document’s vision is to foster growth within the sector by ensuring a workforce with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time – and defines the goals that will define a long-term action plan to address the skills needed by the sector. According to the report: “A skilled and educated workforce will enable the [EO*GI] sector to attract high value, innovative and knowledge-based businesses, adapt more readily to the challenging technological environment and respond better to societal challenges [such as climate change].” The report is a practical guide that aims to stimulate leadership in the sector, including high-level goals and strategic operational objectives for skills development. Its aim is to develop capacity and skills on Earth Observation and Geoinformation by fostering the uptake and integration of Copernicus data and services in end-user applications. The strategy further proposes skills development recommendations to unleash students’ and workers’ potential to become the innovators of tomorrow. The EO*GI sector is linked to many other domains that influence each other and are transforming rapidly (agriculture, energy, transport, local government, maritime, etc.): As a consequence, the knowledge, skills, and competencies that are required to help answer the challenges we face today need to adapt to change. EO*GI is a key sector in achieving the objectives of the European Commission’s Green Deal and the Digital Strategy, as it is leveraging data and information to enforce laws on nature protection. The work undertaken by EO4GEO addresses various levels of education to promote the use of Earth observation and geographic information in Europe and ensure that the available data is integrated into climate services for citizens, businesses, organisations and local and national authorities.

eit313,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/european-raw-materials-alliance-erma-welcomes-newly-adopted-report-critical-raw,The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) welcomes the newly adopted report on Critical Raw Materials,"Under the new proposal, the EU strategy will boost strategic autonomy and resilience in the supply of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs). Critical raw materials are vital in high technology applications for automotive, renewable energy, defence and aerospace. Securing a sustainable supply of CRMs is fundamental for Europe’s transition towards a green, digital and circular economy. We have now a consistent and ambitious package that tackles the urgency of stable and sustainable critical raw materials supply chains while at the same time ensuring Europe’s competitiveness and jobs. All forecasts predict a higher demand for critical raw materials due to the twin transition. We, therefore, pledge to enhance our efforts to make full use of the circular economy, but since recycling effects will kick in only in a mid- to long-term perspective, we also ask to increase sustainable sourcing. Hildegard Bentele, Member of the European Parliament A strong emphasis was made on enhancing both primary and secondary markets of critical raw materials as well as on securing investments in the sector in general. The European Commission was urged to ensure that CRM policies are part of national resilience and recovery plans under NextGenerationEU, that investments in recycling capacities are being made, that new finance instrument with regard to risk sharing are promoted, that former coal mining regions are targeted. Member States will play a vital role in the implementation of the report, especially with regard to speeding up permitting procedures while guaranteeing environmental and social standards. Since Member States are conducting till today independent CRM policies, it is pointed out that more coordination at EU level is needed to monitor the CRM situation. Hildegard Bentele called for increasing domestic sourcing, the need to diversify supply chains and boosting recyclingefforts in the EU. Europe’s dependence on strategic mineral resources poses geopolitical pressure. Hildegard Bentele considers that one of the prerequisites of strengthening domestic sourcing is a political framework that will enable responsible mining as well as raising awareness and sharing best practices for sustainable sourcing in Europe.  The European Commission and the Member States were urged to create an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Critical Raw Materials to strategically and sustainably plan for demand for the twin transition, covering requirements, sources of supply and (social, environmental and financial) costs. The IPCEI should cover all the relevant topics to reduce criticality and dependence, such as recycling, reuse, substitution, reduction of material use and mining. IPCEI projects will help unlock the unfulfilled potential in CRM-rich EU countries that have large untapped sources and contribute to Europe’s open strategic autonomy and resilience. As the demand for critical raw materials is growing, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) is addressing the main challenges connected to raw materials supply for Europe. ERMA was established to address the challenge of securing access to sustainable raw materials, advanced materials, and industrial processing know-how for EU industrial ecosystems. ERMA supports the adoption of the report on Critical Raw Materials by Hildegard Bentele. Our vision to diversify Europe’s supply chains, create jobs, attract investments and enable the best framework for raw materials and the circular economy are well aligned with the strategic scope of the European Parliament.  The new report welcomes the creation of ERMA. In the light of the global geopolitical situation and high dependence on producers from rich non-EU countries, ERMA’s current focus on the most Critical Raw Materials, such as rare earth elements and magnets, will support the long-term supply relationships for a huge range of small and large manufacturers in the EU and reduce the current reliance on a few non-EU countries. The European Raw Materials Alliance must be further strengthened, its projects in the field of permanent magnets now need to be implemented, and new initiatives in the area of storage and recycling need to be supported. Hildegard Bentele, Member of the European Parliament  On 30 September, ERMA issued an Action Plan “Rare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action”, which highlights the challenges related to the highly vulnerable global rare earth supply chain and provides specific actions that the EU, its Member States, industry, and innovation communities should implement to diversify EU supply chains. Among the next steps for ERMA is the development of a new action plan on Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion. The work is already ongoing under the second ERMA Cluster with a comprehensive outlook on the supply chains for green energy technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers, battery materials, alternative energy storage and conversion, materials in solar energy). The report on Critical Raw Materials underlines ERMA’s role as an ‘investment pipeline’ and supports this initiative as a great tool to unlock public and private investments for environmentally assessed and sustainable projects on Critical Raw Materials. ERMA has recently announced its plans to enable high standards in sustainability by establishing a raw materials investment fund planned to be launched in 2022. To date, ERMA’s ecosystem comprises 600 partners from universities, RTOs, trade unions, NGOs, national authorities and ministries, financial institutions, associations and industry. The new report highlighted the importance of engaging a vast network of stakeholders in the area of Critical Raw Materials. Moreover, the Alliance wants to consolidate ERMA’s role, international impact and visibility. ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and DG GROW to target specific parts of the world that are important in their strategic development agenda, such as Australia, Canada, Ukraine and the United States. ERMA welcomes new partners to work closely on CRM projects and contribute to Europe’s open strategic autonomy in the most critical and vital supply chains.

eit314,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-helping-1750-professionals-embrace-ai-healthcare,"EIT Health helping 1,750 professionals to embrace AI in healthcare","The programme series bridges the gap between healthcare experts’ education and practical knowledge in operating and implementing AI. Expanded from a summer school to a complete education programme on AI in healthcare, HelloAI has impacted over 1,750 participants in the last four years. This summer, 530 young talents and university students completed the HelloAI RIS series. HelloAI RIS targets participants from the countries included in the EIT Health Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS), to close the gap between the most advanced regions and the regions that are achieving innovation at a more moderate pace. HelloAI Profressional, the most comprehensive course available on AI application in healthcare, is tailored for experienced healthcare professionals, looking to implement AI in their roles. Close to 350 healthcare experts from all over Europe and beyond recently graduated from HelloAI Professional which EIT Health has recognised as a ‘High Quality Project’ following an evaluation by an international panel of independent experts. Healthcare is generating an enormous volume of data annually with ever-increasing numbers. Thanks to the revolution of AI, countless applications are already available to support routine clinical practice. The potential is vast, the global market for AI in healthcare, which was valued USD 6.7 billion (approximately EUR 5.9 billion) in 2020, will grow at a growth rate of 41.8% to USD 120.2 billion (approximately EUR 106.05 billion) by 2028. According to the EIT Health and McKinsey & Company report, ‘Transforming healthcare with AI’, AI has the potential to enrich and refocus the work of healthcare professionals towards their main motivation for realising their career – direct patient care. The technology will facilitate the automation of mundane tasks for healthcare professionals who currently spend up to 70% of their time on administration. Healthcare organisations must allow for fundamental shifts in how patients are cared for, and healthcare workers must leverage increasingly comprehensive pools of AI-mediated medical data to deliver better care. Yet the explosion of data, in addition to the shortage of professionals, increasing costs, access and quality concerns are raising significant major issues in healthcare. “AI has a huge potential to transform how healthcare is delivered. However, there is a tremendous gap in healthcare experts’ practical knowledge and education on operating and implementing innovative technologies. At EIT Health InnoStars, we support healthcare transformation in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, by accelerating the innovation of digitised healthcare solutions and the education of healthcare professionals, empowering them to use new generation tools.” Balázs Zoltán Fürjes, InnoStars Director, EIT Health InnoStars Education is indicated as the most important factor for fast adoption of healthcare innovations. To address the highlighted issues and narrow the skills gap in medical IT education and multidisciplinary collaboration, EIT Health and GE Healthcare, in collaboration with KTH Institute, LEITAT Technology Center and University of Maastricht tailored an extensive educational and practical programme on AI application in the medical field: the HelloAI programmes. Around 350 medical experts worldwide, from 37 different countries completed the HelloAI Professional course consisting of six live sessions, four self-learning modules, and 18+ hours of valuable content provided by the top speakers in their field. All covering various aspects of AI implementation in healthcare. “Artificial intelligence is broadly expected to drive significant benefits across healthcare systems by increasing efficiency though decreasing the operational cost to improve patient outcomes. With such exponential acceleration on AI in daily clinical work – medical professionals must educate themselves and be prepared for future disruption in the industry. AI can make healthcare data-driven, value-based, and patient-centric. I’m confident that the HelloAI initiative can equip medical professionals with the right skillset to operationalise AI for faster, more accurate patient diagnoses and reduced administrative clinical burdens in the future” Professor Mathias Goyen, Chief Medical Officer, GE Healthcare EMEA",,,,,,,,,,,,,

EIT Food is the world's largest food innovation community, supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). These FutureFoodMakers have developed a ‘Menu for Change’ of six priority demands for the food system to improve access to healthy, sustainable and affordable food, which is being presented to an audience of policymakers and food system leaders at the Future of Food Conference 2021. The six demands reflect the areas the FutureFoodMakers feel will be the most impactful in ensuring that the next generation can inherit a future-fit food system. The Menu for Change calls upon European food sector stakeholders to: Find out more about the Menu for Change here  The Menu for Change reflects new research that reveals young people across Europe want an overhaul of the global food system to protect the environment. The new research, commissioned by EIT Food, surveyed over 2,000 18-24 year olds from across the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Spain. The findings show that nearly eight in 10 young people (78%) think we need to take urgent action to make the way we produce and consume food more sustainable. Meanwhile, two-thirds (66%) feel that our current food system is destroying the planet, and that the situation is only getting worse, as 61% think the food sector has become less sustainable in recent years. Food sustainability is of growing concern for this age group, with two-thirds (64%) saying it has become more important to them in the past 12 months, while 65% think that Gen Z cares more about this than older generations. Of agriculture practices and food products, Gen Z consider fruit and vegetable farming to be one of the most sustainable options, with 74% saying they believe this to be sustainable. This is followed by growing food locally (74%), organic farming (72%) and plant-based foods (70%). Meanwhile, half of young people (50%) consider importing food to be unsustainable.  “In a crucial year for global climate talks, we need the next generation – who will be most affected by the climate crisis – to have a seat at the table in shaping a future-fit food system. We know that the world cannot achieve its goal of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees without addressing global food systems, yet food could have been more prominent on the agenda at COP26. That is why, as we look to make food a high priority in global sustainability dialogues over the next year, we have brought together 10 young FutureFoodMakers to represent young people across Europe, and make their views, needs and recommendations known through the Menu for Change.” Dr. Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food ""We – the next generation of leaders, decision makers and consumers – deserve a voice about these changes and what our future food system should look like. It is time for young people to be heard. Representing young people from across Europe, the Menu for Change puts forward our views on how the agrifood decision makers of today should be working to secure our food, our food system, and our future. Underpinning this is the universal need for social justice and inclusion. Transitioning to a better, more resilient European food system requires urgent change and innovation across the food value chain - from farmers, manufacturers, and retailers to governments, NGOs and consumers. As we use these recommendations to drive conversations with stakeholders across the agrifood sector, we must ensure no one is left behind and everyone’s voice is heard.”  Júlia Montoliu Boneu, FutureFoodMaker",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also addresses the economic and financial uncertainties and the resulting social changes. The process brought together partners such as the Edmund Mach Foundation, the Innovation Hub Trentino and the University of Trento, Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering (DICAM). The Dolomites area, comprising four territories: the Veneto Region, the Autonomous Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia and the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, is known for its high natural, artistic and cultural heritage and has been recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 2009. These landscapes attract several million visitors every year, but also experience an aggravation of extreme weather events such as landslide and debris flows, storms, heavy rains and droughts. In 2018, the region was hit by a severe storm, Storm Vaia (or Storm Adrian) which caused massive damage to the mountain ecosystem. The winds, which reached 220 km/h, knocking down about eight million cubic metres of timber, and massive rain that caused flooding, killed eleven people in two days. The storm affected the forest-timber value chain and related activities such as tourism and agriculture. This highlights the dramatic consequences that extreme weather phenomena have on the environment, the economy and people’s lives in the region. “We have been concerned for many years about how climate change is affecting our region and how nature is changing. That is why we decided to join the EIT Climate-KIC community in 2017, but we focused even more intensely on resilience after storm Vaia hit our land. This raised the issue of resilience – the community was shocked and became determined to improve adaptation measures to prevent damage of this scale in the future. This turning point convinced us to move forward with the collaboration and to join the Race to Resilience programme.” Alessandro Gretter, Senior Technologist from the Edmund Mach Foundation. The storm also brought together a sub-regional community of residents and institutions who decided to act together to repair the storm damage by planting new trees or reusing the damaged wood to make speakers or other products out of the fallen timber. The devastation caused by Storm Vaia has also prompted regional authorities and regional institutions to adopt resilience measures and develop adaptation strategies. This has led to an unusual cross-border collaboration between municipalities in the four regions, which until this point had been isolated from each other and not working together. “There has been an amazing collaboration of people from different provinces and different sectors of society like city governments, business, education, sitting around the same table for the first time, and envisioning a sustainable future together. It gave them the opportunity to talk to each other, to collaborate and to think outside the box. These climate challenges do not care about administrative boundaries. The problem can only be solved if we manage to build a relationship that goes beyond them.”  Alessandro Gretter, Senior Technologist from the Edmund Mach Foundation. The collaboration has developed a portfolio of activities focused on three main areas: forestry and agriculture, tourism and community engagement. Activities related to forestry focus on promoting long-term conservation and biodiversity while maintaining productivity, mapping ecosystem services at the local level and modeling and forecasting the impacts on forests, promoting the development of insurance scheme for the forest ecosystem services (with the pathfinder project “Holistic Resilience”). The project also focuses on promoting sustainable tourism, flexibility and sustainable management of tourist flows, and how to mitigate and compensate the impacts of tourism.  The initiative also aims to identify strategies and tools to support innovation in mountain areas, but also new technologies and new collaborations for warning systems that can reach remote areas. Current activities also focus on engaging citizens and tourists in mitigation strategies, as well as skills and capacity building among the younger generation.  Social innovation is more than relevant. Building an active community and investing in youth is forward thinking because they will become our leaders one day. Young people in the Dolomites already feel empathy for the topics of climate emergency. The idea is to involve youth from different parts of the Dolomites, not only from bigger cities but also from rural, scattered regions.  Alessandro Gretter, Senior Technologist from the Edmund Mach Foundation. Since people in rural regions are more vulnerable to extreme weather events, the project emphasises democratising climate action in non-urban areas. This requires greater engagement from the local community, but according to Gretter, there is already a big shift in mindset that is taking place over the years. In order to mobilise the younger generation and get them more involved in community building activities, educational and cultural programmes are being carried out to find talent and draw their attention to climate change. For a number of years, there has been an educational programme for young people, giving selected participants the chance to attend the UN climate change conference. This year, twelve Trentino university students and researchers had the opportunity to attend COP26. The idea is to gain knowledge and experience and upon their return to put their new ideas into practice locally. To engage people in climate action, partners in the region also organise Climathon and many more initiatives. EIT Climate-KIC is proud to be a partner of the UN High Level Champion’s Race to Resilience campaign, which is working to step-up global ambition for climate resilience in the run-up to COP26 and beyond.

eit321,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/european-raw-materials-alliance-erma-celebrates-its-first-anniversary,The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) celebrates its first anniversary ,"We are now entering an even more exciting stage as we are starting to reap the rewards of our hard work. The European Commission has welcomed ERMA’s Action Plan on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors, and we are looking forward to our close collaboration with Commissioner Breton. We see the need to ramp up investment in the sector to secure Europe’s strategic autonomy in critical raw materials for the green and digital transition. I am happy to announce ERMA’s plan to frame a raw materials investment fund in 2022. I encourage our sector to mobilise forces with us. It’s time to act! Bernd Schäfer, CEO and Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials The establishment of ERMA was announced in September 2020 as part of an Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials and the publication of the 2020 List of Critical Raw Materials. The European Commission mandated EIT RawMaterials to lead ERMA. Currently, the Alliance ecosystem comprises universities, RTOs, trade unions, NGOs, national authorities and ministries, financial institutions, associations and industry. ERMA partners bring expertise in primary raw materials, advanced materials and intermediate products, final products and recycling.      The strategic scope of ERMA entails the identification of investment cases to build capacities across raw materials value chains, from mining to recovery and product design for a circular economy. ERMA has already identified over 30 investment proposals on projects from across the value chain with a value of EUR 11 billion. We encourage you to submit your project proposal. Launched in December 2020, the first Cluster of ERMA on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors brings together nearly 400 members to deal with one of the most critical value chains for many key EU industrial ecosystems. Rare earth permanent magnets are vital for wind power, electric mobility, and communications technology; however, more than 90% of rare earth magnets are currently produced in China. Ensuring a sustainable supply of rare earth magnets and motors is crucial for the green future of Europe. On 30 September 2021, the ERMA Cluster on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors published Rare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action, a report presenting current and projected European demand for Rare Earth Elements and the urgent steps which should be taken to secure their supply. Get your copy! The second Cluster of ERMA on Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion was launched in February 2021. Our partners are working in four task forces with a special focus on supply chains for green energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolysers, battery materials, alternative energy storage and conversion, materials in solar energy. The cluster is working on the list of action points addressing the key raw materials issues of the energy storage and conversion sector, which will be presented in an action plan next year. Next steps for the Alliance After publishing the Cluster 1 Action Plan, ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for Internal Market, to integrate the outlined actions in the framework and timeline of EU policies. Alignment and integration with other activities and agenda of the European Commission are important to consider in this process. The Cluster 2 Action Plan release is another important milestone that we aim to achieve in the first half of next year. We want to make sure that we collect and process the full scope of valuable feedback from our community and other organisations outside the community. This will make the plan stronger. ERMA has also taken the lead in the newly established Task Force on Clean Tech Materials. The new Task Force will identify funding opportunities and identify eligibility criteria for projects to boost investment capacity. ERMA will continue to grow and consolidate the partnership while extending its geographic coverage. The strength of ERMA is in its ability to integrate the activities along the entire raw materials value chain and develop industries around these activities. This will continue to be the key focus area of ERMA. The Alliance wants to consolidate ERMA’s role, international impact and visibility. ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and DG GROW to target specific parts of the world that are important in their strategic development agenda, such as Australia, Canada, Ukraine and the United States. Our goal is to extend our portfolio of investment cases and continue to support high-impact projects and drive their success. Join ERMA",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit322,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-build-nature-accelerate-transition-sustainable-construction-cities,EIT Climate-KIC with Build By Nature to accelerate the transition to sustainable construction in cities,"EIT Climate-KIC is partnering with Laudes Foundation’s Built by Nature to achieve just that, working with the cities of Milan and Madrid as testbeds for innovation. Using a mass timber superstructure in buildings would not only require less steel and concrete but also deliver a lighter foundation, reducing building embodied emissions by almost a third, according to a study by EIT Climate-KIC partner Materials Economics. This presents a big opportunity for the construction sector to transition to more sustainable practices and have a positive impact on the planet and society. To support this transition, Laudes Foundation has launched Built by Nature, a multi-million euro grant-making fund and network that aim to drive forward the timber building transformation and fully decarbonise the built environment – working with nature, not against it. The initiative includes an accelerator fund to help businesses bring positive climate impact by developing solutions that scale up timber building from sustainably sourced forests. Additionally, a network is being launched that connects key actors across the built environment and forest communities through national and city networks and events. This will result in increased research, innovation and regulatory work needed to go beyond pilots and spark city-scale projects, and will amplify the stories of ground-breaking timber projects and solutions, changing perceptions around  construction with timber. The initiative includes a range of partners enacting positive change such as Bauhaus der Erde, the Centre for Natural Material Innovation at the University of Cambridge, the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA), Cities4Forests and EIT Climate-KIC. EIT Climate-KIC joined Built by Nature through its “Healthy, Clean Cities: European Cities for Carbon-Neutral Construction” (HCC EU CINCO) project, working with developers, designers, investors, asset owners and insurers, alongside policymakers and city leaders in the municipalities of Milan and Madrid to shape the market for circular and bio-based embodied carbon neutral buildings. The project integrates the systemic approach of EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstration methodology, bringing transdisciplinary, cross-cutting alignment towards shared societal goals, with the objective to: “Cities are complex systems in which policy, capital, and project scales all interact. We cannot ask cities to embrace net zero ambitions if we are not prepared to offer them the capabilities and resources to drive systems-level changes. Doing that demands that we push boundaries with businesses, finance partners, and city governments simultaneously. In this context, Built by Nature is a convening and funding power that will enable a revolution in the way we think about innovation for climate action. One of the most interesting things we are learning is that once this approach begins, it leads to actions no one could have anticipated before we started. We cannot state strongly enough that the path to net-zero carbon requires a focus on innovation shaped to learn about what we do not yet know, rather than trying to do what we already know as fast as we can.”  Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The additional support offered by the EIT Community to boost the innovation capacity of higher education institutions across Europe is fully in line with the Commission's priorities. I look forward to seeing these priorities translated into concrete actions that will help achieve our objectives of supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators that will transform global challenges into opportunities for the future."" Gioia Ghezzi, Chair of the EIT Governing Board added ‘During Europe’s recovery it is more important than ever that our Higher Education Institutions play an even stronger role in helping their students to become innovators and in turning research into concrete solutions.  Boosting innovation capacity in Higher Education is a key priority for the EIT and we already work with hundreds of HEIs through our Knowledge and Innovation Communities. It is therefore only natural that we mobilised Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem to make a systemic impact, improving entrepreneurial and innovation capacity of HEIs. This new call will increase the number of universities we support and will help us to deliver the innovations needed for a more sustainable future. The EIT HEI pilot initiative builds on the success of its first call launched earlier this year which saw close to 750 organisations from across Europe apply for support. As a result, the pilot awarded 24 projects involving 142 HEIs and 155 non-academic organisations (companies, research centres, public authorities and associations) a total of EUR 28.8 million of funding, mentorship, and access to the EIT’s innovation ecosystem.

Entrepreneurs with deep tech business ideas learn how to develop and finalise their Minimum Viable Product (MVP), establish their start-up company, and raise funds with investors. They validate their business solution at the final “Pitch Days”, where they showcase their solutions in front of early-stage investors, potential clients, and experts from the tech community. At the 2021 pitch days, out of 27 startups created during the program, 23 were selected to receive a cash prize of EUR 10,000 each. An initial EUR 5,000 tranche of support had already been awarded in May 2021, bringing EIT Digital support to EUR 15,000 each. The next step is for the ventures to attract investment from private investors: the first ten ventures that will get a commitment of at least EUR 50,000 before 21 November 2021, will be entitled to an additional prize of EUR 10,000 from EIT Digital. In the last 4 years, the EIT Digital Venture Program has invested in the creation of 93 deep tech start-ups, supporting more than 200 entrepreneurs in their early stage of  development. Many of these teams have attracted investors during or shortly after the pre-acceleration program. Revolab, a winner of the 2020 edition of the Venture Program, went in a record time of one year, from inception to closing a pre-seed round with Kilo Health, signing six-digit pre-order deals, and now expanding to the US. Other start-ups from previous EIT Digital Venture Program editions that have raised follow-on investments from private investors include Restpay, Worig, Kiimo, Roster, Ruupi and Sensomatt. EIT Digital will continue to step up its efforts to discover and support talented entrepreneurial teams to quickly develop digital deep-tech innovations.

The agreement, signed today at the UNFCCC COP26, will promote knowledge sharing and project collaboration opportunities between California’s state agencies, facilitated by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, and EIT Climate-KIC and its partners across Europe. “In the spirit of international cooperation that the UN Climate Change Conference embodies, the Office of Planning and Research is pleased to create this global peer-learning partnership with the EU’s EIT Climate-KIC. For decades the European Union and California have demonstrated climate leadership and innovation, and our team at OPR looks forward to accelerating climate action with the EIT Climate-KIC team and network.” Sam Assefa, Director of the Office of Planning and Research For the past year, EIT Climate-KIC has been working closely with the Office of Planning and Research to learn and collaborate on projects that bring together both European and Californian innovation and solutions to climate challenges. “The message from COP26 could not be clearer: we need exponential change in decarbonisation rates and strengthened climate resilience – and we need it now. This cross-Atlantic collaboration exemplifies our shared vision to take climate innovation to the next level and dramatically accelerate climate action. By bringing our innovation ecosystems together, we combine multiple solutions into rapid experimentation and acceleration loops, working in partnership with governments, local businesses and global industry, communities, and innovators, to build new economic models, new value chains and greater public/private value.” Kirsten Dunlop, Chief Executive Officer at EIT Climate-KIC The Governor’s Office of Planning and Research is the State of California’s long-range planning and research agency charged with guiding local and state climate adaptation and resilience efforts, supporting an equitable economic transition, and investing in community resilience. EIT Climate-KIC’s mission is to catalyse systemic change through innovation in areas of human activity that have a critical impact on greenhouse gas emissions (such as cities, land use, materials and finance) and to create climate-resilient communities.                        Together, OPR and EIT Climate-KIC will co-design and execute peer learning opportunities to support existing and new projects, including OPR’s Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resilience Program and the Community Economic Resilience Fund, as well as EIT Climate-KIC Healthy, Clean Cities Deep Demonstration. They will also explore new financing mechanisms to accelerate investment in areas such as building retrofits, electrification of public transport, agriculture, renewable energy, and high road industries and jobs. “Shared vision and a culture of knowledge exchange are critical to limiting global temperature increases to 1.5C. We’re already witnessing the devastating impacts of climate change in California, highlighting the urgency to support a community of global practice and exchange that can more rapidly deploy solutions here in California and beyond.” Nuin-Tara Key, Deputy Director of Climate Resilience at the Office of Research and Planning Progress on California and the EU’s climate agenda necessitates continued driving down of emissions across sectors, moving adaptation to the centre of the agenda, increasing community resilience amidst climatic events, and support for communities, cities, and regions as key implementing partners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit327,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/cop26-un-climate-change-and-eit-climate-kic-partner-establish-new-global-innovation,COP26: UN Climate Change and EIT Climate-KIC partner up to establish new Global Innovation Hub,"To achieve this, the hub will have new approaches to facilitate the development and deployment of transformative and innovative climate solutions. The hub promotes a “moonshot approach” which will assist practitioners to base climate action pledges and commitments on what science says is needed, as opposed to what is perceived as possible with current solutions and technologies. The initiative is launched by the UN Climate Change and supported by core partner organizations such as EIT Climate-KIC, the Research Institute of Sweden (RISE), the European Commission, Mission Innovation, and the Open Earth Foundation. In its recent Working Group 1 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that limiting global average temperature increases to 1.5C requires a reduction of CO2 emissions of 45% in 2030. Yet current emission reduction pledges fall far short. Unless urgent action is taken, the current level of ambition is likely to put the world on course for a 2.7C average temperature increase and ever-increasing extreme weather events. Significantly greater ambition is thus required to keep the 1.5C goal within reach. Current pledges often fall short because they are based on the perceptions of what can be achieved in the context of current climate solutions and technologies. The hub aims to support the translation of commitments and pledges into demand for climate and sustainability solutions that will drive the identification or development of innovative responses and their effective implementation. Innovative responses beyond current solutions mean that pledges and commitments can become significantly more ambitious. The hub is a digital platform that hosts (i) databases of demand for solutions as well as solutions, (ii) tools to determine the impact of climate action and (iii) a space to facilitate the financing of climate solutions. The hub sets the agenda for an expanded space of climate innovation for all practitioners. It showcases people’s everyday needs, such as mobility, access to goods and services, and social connection. The hub then fosters the development of innovative climate-friendly responses beyond any status-quo solutions such as cars or conventional power and, importantly, without focusing on one single solution in isolation. For example, instead of focusing only on the development of EV cars, the hub will promote climate innovations that challenge the need for a car in the first place. It will explore options for the design of compact and complete cities connected with low carbon public transportation that will reduce the need for mobility. It will even go one step further and challenge mobility as a need to have access to products and services. For example, it will develop solutions that replace trips to get a product or a service the same way online shopping replaced trips to shops. These solutions will enable greater climate action ambition, be aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enable the repurposing, as much as possible, of the knowledge, skills and physical assets of disrupted value chains. The solutions offered by the platform are integrated with each other to form a cluster of solutions that can include technologies, policies and regulations, business models, and financing instruments that reflect a holistic approach. Because the development of a solution is demand-driven and the solutions are integrated to form a cluster, the hub will not stockpile underdeveloped inventions as is often the case with innovation platforms.     The Global Innovation Hub will have world-class standards in line with the Paris Agreement goals for impact assessment of climate change solutions. The hub will have a physical pavilion at COP where events are organized to express demand for climate solutions or to broadcast solutions. All interested practitioners are invited to visit the hub.

The CPF found that motivation to adopt a healthier and more sustainable diet is high, and that most consumers have a good idea of what a healthier diet is. However, there are large differences in people’s ability to eat healthily and many struggle due to factors such as price, knowledge and time.   Furthermore, although most consumers report they would like to eat sustainably, it is often not a primary consideration when making food choices.  “I am prepared to adopt a more sustainable diet such as organic food if I can find it easily in stores but it’s often very expensive; only a few products can be purchased each month because of my budget, or I try to take advantage of promotions to buy more.” Olivier, FR, 54 Consumers suggested a range of solutions for building trust which can be grouped into three main areas:   Building love: Foster deep and genuine affection for (a certain) food to enhance trust.  EIT Food has been studying consumer trust in the food chain since 2018, and this is the latest report we have published on this important issue. The knowledge we gained from previous studies was used to inform the dialogue in the CPF and enabled us to focus the discussion on specific topics.   “This is an incredibly important study. We know that trust plays an important role in the food system, and we are working with consumers to explore what that means to them. We need to reconnect people with their food in order to build trust. Insights from consumers who have engaged with the CPF are helping us to identify ways of doing this. This is going to help us to future-proof our food, ensuring healthy and sustainable food for all.”  Fabienne Ruault, Public Engagement Programme Manage Download the report here  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

NetZeroCities is funded by the Horizon Europe Framework Programme, supporting the European Green Deal in building a low-carbon, climate resilient future through research and innovation. In response to the current climate emergency and objectives set out by the Paris Agreement, Europe has pledged to lead on climate action and cut its emissions by 55 percent by 2030, with the objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. As cities keep growing and increasingly represent centres of economic activity, knowledge generation and hubs for innovation and technology, their role in the climate transition is more important than ever. In a context where fast and rapid decarbonisation needs to occur, cities have a leading role to play: not just in meeting the climate goals and targets set out by international policy frameworks, but in ensuring our decarbonisation efforts are equitable and contribute to the wellbeing of European communities. To achieve this, NetZeroCities is bringing together 33 partners from 13 countries to help cities overcome the current structural, institutional and cultural barriers they face in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This will be achieved through: This will ultimately enable European cities and citizens to show the way forward towards an inclusive, thriving, climate resilient and sustainable future, and contribute to the European Union’s Mission 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 by seeking to scale the activities of this project across 100 cities, and to tackle the unprecedented capital investments needed to make such a transformation possible. Achieving this level of impact will be an extraordinary undertaking for each and every city and will require profound and systemic changes. Government leadership will be critical, and actions by industry, civil society, education and research institutions must align in terms of policies, governance and arrangements for needed capital investments. NetZeroCities is coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, Europe’s largest public-private innovation partnership focused on climate innovation to mitigate and adapt to climate change, set up by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).

Entitled Rare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action, the report outlines current and projected European demand for Rare Earth Elements and steps which should be taken to secure their supply. The EU has committed to the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. The raw materials needs to facilitate this energy transition are massive, and Europe urgently needs to secure their supply. This Action Plan outlines the steps we must take to ensure that the rare earth elements upon which the EU Green Deal relies remain available for European industry and society. Bernd Schäfer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials – the Innovation Community which manages the European Raw Materials Alliance  The demand for high energy density rare earth permanent magnets is growing exponentially. They are vital for applications like wind power, electric mobility, and communications technology, making their supply crucial to the European Union’s stated ambition to transition to a green, digital economy. While the EU is a world leader in the manufacturing of electric motors, it is almost fully import dependent regarding rare earth permanent magnets, more than 90% of which are produced in China. The Commission’s in-depth review of critical supply chains and key technologies has highlighted the EU’s high level of foreign dependency on inputs required for our green and digital transition and our continent’s resilience. The EU depends on others – mainly China – for the import of permanent magnets, as well as the rare earth elements they are made of. The European Raw Materials Alliance plays a key role in addressing these dependencies. Thierry Breton, EU Commissioner for Internal Market  The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) is addressing the main challenges connected to raw materials supply for Europe in thematic clusters. The first of these topical clusters is the ERMA Cluster on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors. With the input of more than 180 industry stakeholders, ERMA has developed the Action Plan to highlight the challenges related to the highly vulnerable global rare earth supply chain and to provide specific actions that the EU, its Member States, industry, and innovation communities should implement with the aim of triggering a disruptive change to diversify EU supply chains. The Action Plan contains 12 actions that are summarised in four key recommendations: The European Raw Materials Alliance is currently working on a second Action Plan covering materials for energy storage and conversion, such as batteries, fuel cells, solar and hydrogen and other alternative energy storage and conversion systems.

International and local organisations are called upon to take immediate action to curb a phenomenon that damages food security and harms climate change. Maximising the use of the food produced and minimising waste should be the goals of a sustainable and resilient food system. The examples offered by the EIT Community combine new technologies and straightforward ideas. The following are some of the success stories that engage in food system change on a daily basis. With the support of EIT Climate-Kic, KITRO has succeeded in developing a tool to quantify food waste in kitchens from households to professionals.  With the ambition to minimise food waste, KITRO is a fully automated system that aims to eliminate human error and perform tasks efficiently. The aim is to bring the value of food back into the focus and support companies and people that encourage this effort. “As KITRO’s use becomes more widespread in commercial kitchens, private households will also pay more attention and help achieve a “minimal food waste” society.” Anastasia Hofmann, Kitro’s co-founder. Follow KITRO on Instagram , Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn Mimica, a start-up part of EIT Food's RisingFoodStars, is one of the most promising solutions to prevent food waste. Its product, Mimica Touch, is a label that determines the effective preservability of a food product, whose shelf life for precautionary reasons - would be underestimated.     60% of wasted food is still perfectly edible. Here Mimica Touch comes in. It manages, through the temperature of the food, to establish a shelf life longer than the one on supermarket labels. A simple but innovative idea that sustainably looks to the future.  “I really believe we can inspire positive behaviour change. We don’t need to be wasting the amount that we’re wasting today. We just need to put some collaborative thought into how to make it better.” Solveiga Pakštaitė, Director and Founder of Mimica  Orbisk, yet another success story from the EIT Food family, is a start-up that minimises food waste with Artificial Intelligence through image recognition. Orbisk sets up a monitor in large professional kitchens which quantifies and selects the food that is thrown away to increase the quality and efficiency of the food production chain.        “Everybody who works in food has an opportunity but also a responsibility. We need to take care of our Earth and there’s only one thing to do, and that’s to take action,” Richard Beks, CCO of Orbisk.  Read more about what Orbisk does here  The EIT Community promotes several activities that can make everyone actively involved in bringing about change.

eit350,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-communitys-effort-healthyairhealthyplanet,EIT Community's effort for #HealthyAirHealthyPlanet,"  The International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, in its second edition, is a United Nations initiative aimed at raising society's awareness regarding the level of pollution in the air people breathe every day. It has been estimated that nine out of every ten people are breathing unclear air, causing an increase in the number of deaths related to respiratory diseases each year. Immediate action is needed locally and globally to counteract the impact that air pollution levels are having on the entire ecosystem. Human health is only one of the elements put at risk, but it certainly needs to be addressed urgently concerning the changes in respiratory habits linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. The EIT Community is leading the change with some success stories that cannot be missed on this day. With the purpose of cleaning the air from  CO2 and then reusing it, Climeworks has been part of the EIT Community since 2012 when it obtained the first grants to develop a proof of concept in the direction of a zero-carbon economy.      Nearly ten years later, Climeworks is a global leader in clearing the air from CO2 and plans to keep expanding to capture 1% of global CO2 by 2025. Indeed, after graduating from the EIT Climate Kic Accelerator business incubator programme in 2013, Climeworks has continued to build a pan-European support network that led to its inclusion on Bill Gates' Breakthrough Technologies list in 2019. Today, at the forefront of change, Climeworks is ready to make true pioneers out of all those who want to, removing CO2 in their name. If you wish to be part of the change, contribute here. Leading scientific studies indicate that by mid-century 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide will need to be removed from the air every year. Direct air capture is one solution that can help achieve this goal. In order to scale direct air capture up to the levels required, we need to start today and #actnow. Climeworks Have you ever thought that moss could save city streets from daily pollution? Thanks to Green City Solutions, a start-up supported by EIT Climate Kic since its creation, this is possible. Its devices - the CityTree -  can be found all over Europe and fit perfectly into cityscapes. CityTree is a vertical device where moss and wireless technology coexist to control its humidity and ability to purify the air.  The CityTree is a tool that monitors air quality and ensures that it is measurable and clean. Find the CityTree already available and learn more here. If you want to know the level of pollution in the air you breathe Plume Labs is the right app to get. It provides relevant data on city pollution to create awareness and action in those who use it.  Plume Labs received support from the EIT Climate Kic Accelerator and was able to become a globally recognised app and increase its team. Years after its development, the app is getting more sophisticated, covering the whole globe and providing accurate data.

eit357,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-urban-mobility-podcast-ideal-city-future,EIT Urban Mobility podcast on the ideal city of the future,"Anna Clark, President of Women EIT, describes it as somewhere greener, cleaner, quieter. Augustin Friedel, Corporate & Sustainability Strategy VW Brand at Volkswagen AG, sees it as a city where mobility is more diverse, a mixture between shared and personal transport modes and hopefully more active mobility. Mouchka Heller, Automotive and Autonomous Mobility Lead at World Economic Forum, stresses the importance of a human-centric approach. A report by the European Commission outlines these steps in making our cities smarter and greener.  Many are citing Paris as an example city of the future, with its 15 Minute neighbourhood initiative. Essentially the idea is to provide everything a person would need within a 15-minute walking distance; hence reducing the need for cars and vehicles and relying more on walking and cycling. Such an initiative would improve citizens’ health, both because of more movement and the reduction of harmful pollution from fossil fuels. And, of course, there are the general environmental benefits of fewer carbon emissions. On a different scale, reducing the need for cars would improve equality, as it becomes cheaper to move around. The initiative has proven very effective among Parisians and in 2019 alone, Paris managed to reduce car traffic by 8%.  It’s not a secret that the pandemic dramatically changed the way we move and what we need from our cities. Most of us worked from home, reducing the morning and evening commute and hence traffic. Mouchka Heller describes how our cities are currently designed around the typical 9-5 worker, which excludes many. With everyone re-thinking when and how they work, that raises the need to re-think mobility infrastructure. The NYC challenge is one example of that. Augustin Friedel talks about the importance of tailoring solutions to the specific city, rather than using a copy-paste approach. The abundance of new mobility modes which have grown rapidly over the past five years, from e-scooters to ride-sharing, means cities can adopt an à la carte approach, and incorporate what does – or doesn’t – work best for them. Mouchka Heller also highlights that our approach has shifted from owning a mobility solution to needing a service to get from A to B and then B to C and onwards, resulting in a multi-modal journey. In the above article, Imogen Pierce, Head of City Engagement and Integration at ARRIVAL, says “We’re starting to see a fundamental shift where public transport operators are not viewing other modes of transport as competitors, but more as critical elements of the overall transport system that they need to work closely with.” There is certainly a lot to be discussed about the future of urban areas and what we want them to be. The pandemic only accelerated this process by giving us a different perspective and shifting our needs and priorities. It is now up to us and the ‘designers’ of our cities to turn that vision into a reality.  In the podcast episode speakers discuss baby steps that need to be taken, as well as some challenges to achieving this vision. They also discuss whether there is good or bad mobility, and will the car ever be made completely redundant?  Learn more about EIT Urban Mobility's partnership with Y- Mobility",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit358,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-food-gen-z-demand-radical-change-food-sector,EIT Food: Gen Z demand radical change from the food sector,"The research commissioned by EIT Food, the world's largest food innovation ecosystem, supported by the EIT, surveyed over 2,000 18–24-year-olds from across the UK, France, Germany, Poland, and Spain. The findings point to a generation that is very interested, knowledgeable, and entrepreneurial when it comes to their eating habits, and especially how they link to their wellbeing and mental health.  Download the full report, Our Food, Our Food System Over half of 18-24 year olds (52%) track their food in some way, though this figure differentiates starkly across countries, rising to 65% of young people in Germany compared to just 38% in France. This suggests that Gen Z are very interested and engaged with their eating habits. The majority of this tracking (36% of young people) is focused on counting calories, however, a quarter of all young people (24%) also track the macronutrients (or “macros”) of the food they eat. These savvy Gen-Zers prefer whole, organic, and plant-based foods as some of their healthiest options, and 79% consider processed foods unhealthy. Ongoing attention to health amidst the Covid-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of the importance of this to young people, with over half (58%) saying the pandemic has made them more aware of eating healthily. Meanwhile, two-thirds (67%) say that healthy food is simply fashionable at the moment.  Despite this keen interest and engagement with healthy eating, young people feel they aren’t getting the support they need from educators, industry, and policy makers to do so. Three-quarters (75%) say they need clearer advice on how to eat a healthy, balanced diet, with two-thirds (65%) reporting they didn’t get enough education on how to eat healthily while at school. Having a trusted, reliable source of information was identified as being vital by many respondents, with just under two thirds (61%) reporting they feel it can be hard to know how to eat healthily as there is so much conflicting advice. Young people are looking for more detailed information from brands, especially when it comes to how food is made. Nearly eight in 10 young people (78%) would like food labels to have clearer information on the way food is processed, not just the ingredients, while three-quarters (75%) think food brands need to be more transparent with consumers about their ingredients and processes. Young people are taking things into their own hands and attempting to fill this advice gap themselves, with two-thirds (67%) reporting they regularly look at social media content (such as TikTok or Instagram) about healthy food and healthy recipe ideas. Over half (52%), meanwhile, say they rely on social media or their friends for advice on eating healthily. As part of this advice, young people want a narrative around healthy eating that doesn’t risk being harmful to their mental health – such as by focusing too much on calories alone. In fact, just over half of young people surveyed (55%) think that including calorie counts on food labels and menus can be detrimental to people’s mental health – a figure that rises to six in 10 in the UK (62%), France (60%) and Germany (61%). What’s more, young people don’t necessarily see low calorie foods as automatically healthy: just 54% do, while a third (34%) consider them to be unhealthy. Instead, nearly eight in 10 (77%) say young people need better advice on the link between what they eat and their mental health, a figure that rises to 82% of young women. When it comes to how to encourage young people to eat healthily, discounted or subsidised healthy food ranked highest amongst respondents (43%) – which is little surprise given that two-thirds (67%) think that healthy food is more expensive than unhealthy food. Having access to healthier options was also key for a third of respondents (37%), whether for home delivered food (such as through Uber Eats or Deliveroo) or at school, college, and university. This is being driven by a lack of existing options in food environments, with seven in 10 young people (73%) finding it difficult to eat healthily while on the go, or at their place of education or work. When considering careers in the food sector, their interest in healthy eating is leading many young people to pursue jobs in food education, innovation, and equality over more traditional routes such as hospitality or farming. Two-thirds of young people would consider taking a job in food education (66%) or food innovation (64%), the highest ranking of all roles across the food sector.  Just under two thirds (61%), meanwhile, would be interested in taking a role that improved equality of food access. EIT Food is launching a new campaign, ‘Our Food, Our Food System’ to help young people have their say on the future of food. The campaign will recruit 10 young FutureFoodMakers to spearhead a call for radical change in the food sector, tackling access to healthy, sustainable and affordable food. It is being launched during a landmark year, which will see the first ever United Nations Summit dedicated to food systems. “Young people are fundamental for the transformation towards healthy and sustainable food systems. Yet our research clearly shows that they are being let down. Across Europe, 18-24 year olds find healthy food more expensive, harder to find on the go, and lacking the information and advice they need to make informed nutritional decisions. The voice and asks of this young and dynamic food generation need to be heard by everyone across the food sector, and they need to be involved and empowered in shaping what comes next. That’s why we are launching our campaign ‘Our Food, Our Food System’, to give our young people the voice they deserve and help everyone in the food systems to understand their needs.”   Dr. Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food Read more about the ‘Our Food, Our Future’ campaign",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit359,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-project-wins-social-bond-year,EIT Health project wins 'social bond of the year',"The annual awards ceremony is designed to celebrate the leading green, social and sustainability bond deals globally. As part of an EIT Health project, the pioneering health bond scheme was designed to support the prevention of type 2 diabetes, improving the lives of citizens but also reducing costs to healthcare services. “Instead of asking healthcare budgets to cover the cost of treating people when they get sick, the health bond provides pay-outs when people improve their health through preventative measures. This approach can ultimately reduce illness and the cost of healthcare and is an example of how we need to transform our thinking and approach towards healthcare. Budgets cannot rise in line with demand, and we must move towards preventative models that are both achievable and deliver high value outcomes. I congratulate the team on winning this prestigious award in recognition for their innovative solution to an age-old problem.” Jan Phillip Beck, CEO, EIT Health The EIT Health Project was started in 2017 and involved EIT Health Partners RISE, Stockholm Region, Karolinska Institutet, IESE Business School, West Midlands Academic Health Science Network, Semmelweis University and City of Rotterdam, as well as commercial partners MSD and Apoteket. At the end of the project, the spinout company, Health Integrator, was launched, and work began to design an investment model that could provide financial rewards for good health outcomes, resulting in the bond available today. The bond is financed through a SEK 30 million loan (Health Impact Bond) from Skandia, an insurance company. If a participant develops type 2 diabetes, Skandia covers part of the cost, but if the participant is found to have reduced the risk of diabetes, Skandia receives a return of up to 10% percent of the investment. One unique aspect of the solution is that the Stockholm Region does not incur any costs in the first few years. After five years, the region would pay around SEK 23-33 million, depending on outcomes. There will also be savings if people stay healthy and do not require expensive care. Stockholm Region expects to receive up to 100% return on investment. 21,000 people at risk of diabetes are now enrolled into the programme. With the support of a personal health coach and tests, participants can buy preventative health services and products through the Health Integrator platform. Each user gets a “wallet” loaded with money to shop for selected health services such as nutritionist or smoking cessation against the plan set out with their health coach. In the short term, this leads to better health, and in the longer term, changed lifestyle habits can prevent them from developing type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, helping to prevent the increasing burden of type 2 disease, for individuals and for society. “We are very honoured to receive the award Social project bond of the year.

The company has announced the completion of a €20 million financing round. The round was led by Crédit Mutuel Equity via its two subsidiaries, Crédit Mutuel Equity Germany and Crédit Mutuel Innovation. In addition, ADVITOS received funding from the European Union’s European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund as part of the EIC Accelerator Pilot blended finance programme. The EIT Digital Accelerator has been supporting ADVITOS during this fundraising with dedicated coaching and targeted introductions to a selected pool of investors interested in their space, size and geography. This financing round is a major step in the further development of ADVITOS. It will enable us to grow much faster and seize the enormous market potential this unique and certified therapy has, not only in Europe, but globally. commented Dr. Bernhard Kreymann, Founder and CEO of ADVITOS. We have been lucky in taking advantage of the fundraising program offered by EIT Digital, and valued the expertise, persistence and outreach that the EIT Digital Accelerator team has offered to us. Providing this kind of highly competent hands-on fundraising support is a strongly needed and highly effective measure to secure and enable scaling of European deep tech innovations. added Catherine Schreiber, co-founder of ADVITOS. ADVITOS developed the ADVOS multi device (ADVanced Organ Support) to provide an integrated 4-in-1 multi-organ support therapy that enables simultaneous support of all three main detoxification organs – liver, lungs, and kidney – and corrects blood acid-base imbalances. Pilot trials in critically ill patients have shown that this therapy increased survival in severe organ failure from 20% up to 50%. Multi-organ failure causes the deaths of approximately half a million intensive care patients in Western Europe and the USA every year. This is about 60% of all deaths in intensive care units. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this number has increased to around 750,000 patients in the past year. On the other hand, conventional extracorporeal procedures such as mechanical ventilation, ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), dialysis, and liver-assist therapy only support the function of one or two organs. By treating all three organs simultaneously, and not consecutively like with existing solutions, ADVOS offers a holistic approach giving the patients a much better chance to recover. The ADVOS therapy is CE marked, recognised by international experts, and is already in use in the intensive care units of over 20 hospitals throughout Germany, including a number of leading university hospitals. The company currently employs 55 people. It has received numerous awards, including the 2020 Innovation Award Bavaria, and is listed in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards 2019. With a network of over thousand active investors in Europe and beyond, the EIT Digital Accelerator offers a comprehensive support program to fast-growing digital technology companies looking to raise €3-25 million.

The platform is supported by EIT Food, the world's largest food innovation ecosystem, supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). FoodUnfolded® offers a diverse information platform that people can read, watch, and listen to, taking the user on a journey through our food system. The journey begins with the question of where our food comes from and how it is produced, and it continues through the chemistry of food and food production, and how it can affect our bodies. FoodUnfolded® sheds light on the consequences that food production has on people and the environment, as well as providing information on the innovations and alternatives that can help us reduce negative impacts. With scientific evidence clearly documented in each article, FoodUnfolded® serves as a help and inspiration for pupils and students, as well as providing a trusted and informative source on nutrition trends for general audiences. The launch of FoodUnfolded.de is supported by an exhibition at Munich Airport, provoking travellers to think about food on the airport's largest illuminated billboards. The aim is to encourage people to think about the journey our food takes, where it comes from, and to raise awareness about the ecological footprint of everyone’s consumption habits. The exhibition of EIT Food and Foodunfolded® in the public area of Terminal 2 of Munich Airport will start on 1 June (in Level 03). Supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), FoodUnfolded® is committed to telling stories in a neutral way, ensuring an agenda-free, well-balanced approach. FoodUnfolded® only provides information on existing research, alternatives and solutions that show promise for success. With this added value of information, the platform supports its readers in questioning their own and general eating habits even more consciously. We often see the food on our plate without knowing its history - where and how it was produced and what impact the production has on people, society, and the environment. That's why FoodUnfolded® was developed - to reconnect people with the origins and future of our food.

eit375,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/building-innovative-cultural-and-creative-sectors-and-industries-secure-europes,Building innovative cultural and creative sectors and industries to secure Europe’s future,"Today, these industries are experiencing some of the greatest challenges in recent history. The causes are diverse, and they can only be tackled together. That’s why the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) will launch a new Knowledge and Innovation Community, EIT Culture and Creativity, bringing together research, education and business to enable CCSI to flourish with innovation like never before. From architecture, film, television and video games to cultural heritage, music, publishing and performing arts, Europe’s CCSI play a crucial role in our society. At the end of 2019, they represented 4.4 % of the EU’s GDP in terms of turnover and employed 7.4 million people – 3.7 % of total employment. In addition to generating growth, they are at the heart of Europe’s identity and values, creating social cohesion by establishing a shared sense of history and culture. These societal benefits as well as their economic potential mean the CCSI are capable of delivering world-class solutions to global challenges. Unfortunately, CCSI have rarely faced as many challenges as they do today.  Digitisation and globalisation especially are affecting the business of culture and creativity. Across Europe, creative and cultural organisations of all kinds are facing a lack of entrepreneurial and cross-cutting skills and are struggling to engage with new generations. Culture and creativity have strong local roots and high growth potential, but they are diverse, fragmented, and often micro-sized in terms of organisation. The COVID-19 crisis is an acute additional challenge, squeezing already tight margins and causing a 30 % job loss since the pandemic hit in 2020. If the CCSI are to survive this crisis or, better yet, emerge stronger, they need a long-term approach that aims to make the sector crisis-resistant by addressing the root causes of unsustainability. In short: a lack of entrepreneurial skills, mentoring and the room to experiment and innovate are serious obstacles on the road to success.   And that is precisely where the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) wants to step in. As Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem, we will support CCSI in not only making them more resilient and more connected industries and sectors, but also in harnessing their power to deliver solutions to challenges through our unique innovation model. To stimulate the development of innovative ecosystems, the EIT has set up Knowledge and Innovation Communities: pan-European partnerships among leading companies, research labs and higher education. These partnerships, of which there are currently eight, are dedicated to finding solutions to specific global challenges, from climate change and sustainable energy to healthy living and food. To date, the EIT Community has generated more than 13 000 jobs, EUR 3.3 billion in external investments, more than 1 170 innovative products and services and more than 3 100 graduates completing EIT education programmes.  The EIT powers innovations of tomorrow and sees the early potential in start-ups to grow and scale. To date, the EIT has supported two unicorns (privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion): Lillium –the world’s first electric vertical take-off and landing jet, and Northvolt – a European supplier of sustainable, high-quality battery cells and systems. Tapping into the potential of the creative and cultural sectors and industries, the EIT will soon be launching its ninth community, EIT Culture and Creativity, which will target the CCSI with the aim of launching innovative solutions and a new generation of entrepreneurs. Given its multi-disciplinary approach, The EIT wants to create more opportunities dedicated to innovators, learners and entrepreneurs from the CCSI.  Establishing an innovation ecosystem with the cultural and creative sectors and industries will enable them to leverage their potential together – boosting European sustainable growth and competitiveness. Innovating with the EIT could help kickstart CCSI transformation into future-proof, resilient sectors and at scale industries with the ability to tackle current and upcoming challenges.  EIT Culture and Creativity will break down barriers to innovation across boundaries, sectors and disciplines. It will accelerate the sectors’ transition to new technologies and digital platforms. And it will power new ventures and equip the next generation of creative innovators with needed entrepreneurial skills.  Are you ready to rise to the challenge?  Join our community to make a difference, forge a new partnership and innovate with the European Institute of Innovation & Technology.  To find out more about the upcoming call for proposals for EIT Culture & Creativity click here",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit380,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-innoenergy-report-micromobility-reboot-could-create-more-jobs-and-lower-co2,EIT InnoEnergy report: micromobility reboot could create more jobs and lower CO2 emissions,"The report extrapolated micromobility behaviour in the city of Munich across 100+ European cities and combined it with various, validated scenarios to create projections of the impact of a systemic electric, shared, and connected micromobility rollout by 2030. Looking at the status quo, the report identifies major hurdles around micromobility adoption like the current limitations on vehicle types, making them unfit to transport groceries, pick up children from school or accommodate parcel deliveries. In addition, short vehicle lifespans, high operational costs, regarding charging and relocation, and lack of integration into European cities’ transport systems are hampering uptake. In consequence, micromobility today accounts for less than 0,1% of all trips within cities. The initial rollout of the first generation of micromobility fleets was hastily done, with little thought put into how to best fit them into a larger mobility system. As a result, the vehicles did little to solve existing challenges such as air pollution, traffic jams, high noise levels, or increasingly crowded urban centres. In fact, this has created new problems that have hurt the perception and the business case surrounding micromobility. Jennifer Dungs, EIT InnoEnergy’s Energy for Transport and Mobility Thematic Leader, and author of the report To overcome those hurdles, EIT InnoEnergy recommends a systemic and sustainable multi-stakeholder approach. This includes a shift to higher quality components and improved serviceability – particularly motors and batteries – more local manufacturing, consequent recycling, a focus on developing and utilising purpose-built vehicles, leveraging analytics platforms for relocation and charging and implementing more favourable regulations for micromobility fleets. In addition to creating almost 1 million direct and indirect jobs (990 000), this approach could lower CO2 emissions by more than 30 million tons and save up to 127 TWh of energy consumption per year. The report estimates a EUR 111 billion increase in GDP could be realised as a result of almost one billion (999 million) person-hours saved per year due to decreased congestion – more than the combined GDPs of Malta, Cyprus, Latvia, and Estonia. In addition, 48 000 hectares of inner-city land could be freed up, equivalent to more than 4x the total area of Paris. We need to press the reset button if we want micromobility to play an outsised role in the much-needed redesign of our cities and their transport systems. Leveraging innovations like purpose-built vehicles or battery swapping stations is one part of the solution. Another one is to establish platforms enabling a structural exchange between cities and providers to help guide the process. Looking at the potential benefits for urban life quality, the environment and our economy we should all have a vested interest to support and accelerate this transition.

eit381,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-innovation-ecosystem-no-other,EIT - an Innovation Ecosystem like no other,"At the EIT, we foster innovation’s reach to power a healthier, a greener and more digital Europe. Since innovation’s reach is all encompassing, building an innovation ecosystem – the mission of the EIT - is made even more important to keep the constant flow of ground-breaking new ideas, products and services thriving. So, what does the EIT innovation ecosystem look like, and how will it support Europe and its citizens in the next seven years? An ecosystem in nature is often described as an environment made up of elements that work together to create an ‘environment of growth’. Ecosystems are multifaceted, multi-layered and are very much co-dependent: ‘every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor’.  The EIT Community, Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem, has set up an environment that is conducive to powering innovation. By connecting leading business, higher education and research organisations (also known as the knowledge triangle), we create favourable conditions for innovators, entrepreneurs, and students to spark innovation. In our ecosystem, we offer three main pillars of support: entrepreneurial education, innovation projects and business creation. Together we create a community that generates cutting-edge solutions for Europe and an environment where innovation can flourish.  The EIT innovation ecosystem has given life to a diverse set of innovations, tackling some of Europe’s most pressing societal challenges. From climate change, digitisation, sustainable energy, and manufacturing to food, health, raw materials, and urban mobility, EIT Community solutions are far reaching, and they continue to grow. To date, the EIT Community has delivered more than 13 000 jobs, EUR 3.3 billion in external investments raised by more than 3100 ventures supported, more than 1 170 innovative products and services and more than 3 100 graduates completing EIT education programmes.   However, like any ecosystem in nature, we are susceptible to a variety of elements and maintaining an ecosystem in an ever-changing world is also not easy; we have to work hard, think big, adapt and change. The EIT’s new ambitious strategy for 2021 to 2027 focuses on four main elements that reflect the needs of European innovation and will help our ecosystem thrive even more.      First, the EIT will strengthen the impact of its Knowledge and Innovation Communities. To keep an innovation ecosystem thriving, it is not enough to simply bring business, education and research partners together. What we need is to facilitate and accelerate cooperation and connection between all three.  That is exactly what happens in EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities where these players come together connecting more than 2000 partners and 60 innovation hubs across Europe. They deliver a wide range of innovation and entrepreneurship activities across Europe that fall under each of our three pillars: entrepreneurial education, business creation and acceleration services and innovation driven research projects and this support will continue to grow in the coming years.  Second, the EIT will put a stronger focus on working more closely with higher education institutions (HEI) to boost their ability to innovate as part of the EIT HEI Initiative - Innovation Capacity Building for Higher Education. Our aim is to help these institutions teach innovation and entrepreneurship by encouraging these institutions to build their capacities and develop concrete actions to increase their impact. Universities will be equipped with the right tools to support innovation across their campuses and beyond, enabling them to play a more active role in shaping and nurturing ideas, equipping students and graduates with the right entrepreneurial skills and mind-sets to springboard to success. Third, the EIT will increase our regional development efforts. Through the EIT’s Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) support is made available to target and bridge innovation gaps that exist between EU regions and Member States by connecting regional partners, sharing good practices, experience and know-how emerging from the EIT Community. It is not only about expanding the EIT Community’s innovation capabilities to more regions but also about making Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem more diverse. It is proven in nature that ecosystems with higher biodiversity tend to be more stable with greater resistance and resilience and the same goes with innovation. More diversity not only means more pan-European collaboration but it also means more women entrepreneurs leading businesses and more young girls in tech and science, another important aspect of the EIT Community’s activities. Last but not least, the EIT will also grow with two new Knowledge and Innovation Communities, one operating in the field of the Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries with a call for Proposals coming in 2021 and the other on Water, Marine and Maritime Sectors and Ecosystems.  The new EIT strategy for the next seven years is both ambitious and bold and to achieve this, the EIT has a budget of EUR 3 billion under Horizon Europe. The EIT Community is committed to taking our innovation ecosystem to the next step – to create a biome, an atmosphere where innovation flourishes across Europe and beyond. Come join us and make innovation happen!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit382,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-healths-s4dx-raises-eur-5m-digitise-blood-sampling,EIT Health’s S4DX raises EUR 5M to digitise blood sampling,"The funding comes from private investors including SARSTEDT AG & Co., KG, as well as the EIC Fund, established in 2020 by the European Commission for direct equity investment in breakthrough technologies, and will be used to help the innovative blood sampling system, which has already launched in Germany, and to scale to other markets. As many as three in four medical decisions are based on diagnostic results – often blood samples. Currently, this process is being managed manually which can lead to errors and can cause many issues including slow diagnosis, repeated tests on the patient, and wasted resources. We need to revolutionise this crucial but underdeveloped area of the healthcare value chain to bring innovation where it can have an instant and substantial impact. Dr. Hans Maria Heyn, CEO and co-founder of S4DX S4DX was formed in 2018 as part of the EIT Health Wild Card programme, which focuses on building game-changing life science companies to break new ground in health by challenging the status quo in areas of high unmet need. Beginning with two challenges set by EIT Health, the annual Wild Card programme invites talented innovators from across Europe to respond with their ideas. Successful applicants start their journey with a hackathon; putting them through their paces on everything from team formation, critical thinking, business model validation, and pitching. Finally, participants pitch their solution to a panel of industry leaders to secure a spot in the finals, at which point they pitch for EIT Health investment to incorporate their company and bring their solution to market. Since then, the start-up has developed the ‘digital human blood sample fingerprint’, a complete data-picture of all quality aspects for human blood samples from collection to arrival in the lab. Unlike current manual processes of taking blood, the data is collected and instantly reported into the laboratory whilst the patient is still present. This allows for any errors to be identified and corrected immediately, therefore not only increasing the accuracy of the data but also avoiding the need for repeat patient visits. Through ongoing support from the EIT Health programmes Gold Track and Bridgehead, the team also received access to strategic mentoring, finance, investors, and the largest European healthcare innovation network. We are immensely proud of all that the S4DX team have achieved, including the latest funding round and attention of private investors as well as the EIC. As our first ‘Wild Card’, it is encouraging to see the swift progress that has been made since we first met them just a few short years ago. We look forward to continuing to support S4DX in their journey to market. Jorge Juan Fernández García, Director of Innovation, EIT Health Read more about S4DX",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit387,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-supports-krakow-its-path-towards-climate-neutrality,EIT Climate-KIC supports Krakow in its path towards climate neutrality,"The city is taking part in EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities, and has set ambitious goals to become carbon neutral and inclusive. The past year has seen a breakthrough in the city council’s approach from siloed to systems thinking, leading to a series of experiments developed to bring the city closer to carbon neutrality. In Poland, most energy is still derived from coal, which plays an important role in heating homes but results in high levels of air pollution. The residents of Krakow were the first in Poland to realise that a massive improvement in air quality was needed, as air pollution levels were far above World Health Organisation recommendations. A joint effort by residents and local authorities led to the creation of the Clean Air Programme, resulting in a ban on burning coal and wood in homes from September 2019. The Clean Air Programme has given Krakow an appetite for greater change. In 2019, EIT Climate-KIC brought together a diverse group of local stakeholders, led by Andrzej Łazęcki, Deputy Director of Municipal Services Department and an engineer with over 30 years of experience. The group also included officials such as Andrzej Kulig, the First Deputy Mayor. The common goal of EIT Climate-KIC and the city of Krakow was to expand the city’s existing initiatives, link them together and fill strategic gaps to build a portfolio of experiments. They started with a series of meetings and workshops on systems thinking, policy innovation, and much more. This process was born out of the idea that it is crucial to have a long-term vision for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to be convinced that our actions are aimed at making a greater impact on the climate situation. Participation in this process is of strategic importance to us. When we joined Deep Demonstrations two years ago, we had high expectations for this programme and the opportunities that were presented to us exceeded our expectations. Andrzej Łazęcki, engineer and Deputy Director of the Municipal Services Department. One of the first steps Krakow took was to build a business case for decarbonisation, using the scenario analysis model offered by EIT Climate-KIC partner Material Economics. The local team worked closely together to collect and analyse data to identify the most effective ways to achieve environmental impact in a financially and socially sustainable way at a city-wide level. The analysis revealed that Krakow emits an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide each year from transport, buildings, heating, and electricity. The emerging portfolio of experiments aims to enable rapid learning and create the opportunity to scale the actions that will enable Krakow to achieve its net-zero target by 2030. The portfolio is characterised by themes that reflect critical ingredients for developing new transformation pathways for the city. These themes, which derive directly from the city’s barriers and challenges, include citizen engagement, clearer and more holistic approaches to internal municipal governance and organisation, accelerating action in response to COVID-19, and a positive decarbonisation narrative for future scaling and support. Krakow has also set a goal to increase the amount of green space in the city. The city government will take a leading role in developing and implementing the portfolio of experiments. Action is needed to strengthen the local community. Talking about a global problem is not very convincing, it is crucial to bring the problem down to the local level, to issues that residents can engage with. Andrzej Łazęcki, engineer and Deputy Director of the Municipal Services Department. Another example of experimentation in Krakow focuses on mobility and supports a city-wide shift to public transport, walking, and cycling. The idea of developing a Climate Quarter within Krakow’s second ring road in the city centre could offer the potential for decarbonising mobility. Behavioural changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the focus on cycling as part of the national recovery plan also offer the opportunity to accelerate this change. The Climate Quarter and improved cross-district bike routes will serve as a testing ground for this experiment. This could be a green turnaround for the whole city. Awareness of the climate crisis has grown tremendously in the last two years, both among residents and city officials. We have recognised this gap and are ready for far-reaching changes.

eit388,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-manufacturing-building-community-young-manufacturing-leaders,EIT Manufacturing building a community of Young Manufacturing Leaders,"New activities, meetings and competitions are planned for 2021. The current initiatives, linked to the World Manufacturing Forum, are open to 18–30-year-olds who share a passion for manufacturing, comprising both students and young professionals. Learn more about the initiative in this interview with Giulia Dimonopoli, Junior project Manager of the Young Manufacturing Leaders initiative. The long-term goal of YML international network is to create a new generation of manufacturing ambassadors that will be part of EIT Manufacturing networks, as well as bring other fellow students, young entrepreneurs, and professionals on board. We want to create a community to nurture the world’s future manufacturing talents, by providing them with information about recent trends and technologies, while boosting soft skills and growing their professional network. Through this initiative, we hope to raise awareness about the opportunities the manufacturing sector can offer, and the role the industry will play in the transition to a more sustainable, circular, and digital Europe and world.  Still today, the perception of the manufacturing sector does not always meet the reality. We want to help to challenge this perception and attract more young people to the industry and related fields of study. How will we do this? By sharing news about the recent industry trends and technologies, and new ways of working. We also want to inspire a dialogue about how the manufacturing sector will contribute to the green and digital transformation. To address these challenges, the YML offers its members access and information about various global activities, and events as well as bring opportunities for collaboration with sector experts. We are convinced that this is the starting point to nurture the next generation of manufacturing leaders, with the right network, skills, and passion to become long-term sector ambassadors. In 2020, the Young Manufacturing Leader initiative created the first five local City-Hubs in Europe and started engaging members from both EU and Non-EU countries. The first international activities were launched involving YMLs in the initiatives of the World Manufacturing Foundation: the 2020 YML Essay Contest gave the chance to five winners and three special mentions to be featured in the 2020 WM Report, together with other 50 experts from over 30 countries. Furthermore, seven YMLs were involved in the first edition of the ‘Back to the Future’ initiative becoming contributors to the Focus Groups by analysing the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing and researching possible solutions to face the pandemic challenge. In November 2020, the first edition of the YML Main Event was organised in the framework of the World Manufacturing Week, reaching more than 150 online attendees. The event consisted of an Opening Session where YMLs had the opportunity to share their experience in the network, followed by a five-day matchmaking event during which YMLs realised 38 meetings among peers, and a communication thematic workshop ‘Leadership is Influence’. For the second year in a row, the YML network is involving its members in different international and local activities. The project partners are involving YMLs in the activities of the World Manufacturing Foundation, and recently launched two open calls: A dedicated Young Manufacturing Leaders’ event to be held in October 2021 in conjunction with the World Manufacturing Week – 18-22 October. Over the coming months, the community will also launch a Mentoring Programme involving both universities and companies, and an Innovation Contest giving the members a possibility to put their knowledge into practice. Moreover, the local City-Hubs are currently organising various thematic webinars on focusing manufacturing innovation-related topics. Raising awareness on gender equality and inclusivity in manufacturing is also a key objective of the 2021 activities to enlarge the manufacturing talent pool. The Young Manufacturing Leaders project (YML) aims to create an ambassadors’ community of young people, with an interest in the manufacturing sector. The objective is to nurture and inspire the community with information as well as supporting them in organising events and activities to spread awareness about modern manufacturing. The project is led by Politecnico di Milano, together with six other partners: Chalmers University, Czech Technical University in Prague, Tecnalia, TU Braunschweig, IMH Advanced Manufacturing Campus, University College Dublin, University of Porto and the World Manufacturing Foundation. The World Manufacturing Foundation is also the organiser of the World Manufacturing Forum, an annual meeting with international manufacturing experts and stakeholders to discuss the last trends and innovations of the sector.

This report will help the urban mobility innovation community to better understand the scope of the mobility living labs movement in Europe, the shapes and forms of these labs, their added value for the mobility transition, and the barriers and opportunities they are facing. The in-depth analysis presented in this report focuses on the following topics: Download the full report Since 2006, the concept of the living lab is recognised by the European Commission as a key tool for open innovation. Living labs have spread over Europe in various waves, first focusing on new ICT tools but later also extending to other fields, such as sustainable energy, healthcare, safety, and mobility. Nowadays, newspapers are full of news on living labs, promoting networks of living labs recently created, and covering European projects that organise their activities within the living labs setup. The present report illustrates the operational setup, local urban mobility strategies, as well as the goals of the main key stakeholders that have led in practice to a large variety of urban mobility living labs in Europe. The key elements of living labs – active user involvement, multiple-stakeholder platform for innovation in real-life contexts, multi-method, and co-creation approach – are completely aligned with EIT Urban Mobility’s vision and mission. This mission covers improving people’s quality of life by creating more liveable urban spaces through innovation and transformation in urban mobility, decarbonising transport and making Europe’s economy and the transport sector more competitive. Therefore, living labs are a key strategic instrument within EIT Urban Mobility to boost the uptake of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions and accelerating the transition to scale by engaging directly with the citizens and the local community, and all stakeholders in a real-life environment.

The initiative is perfect for 8-12-year-olds and everyone who wants to learn about raw materials for modern life. Your phone is with you for a few years of your life, but did you know it had already experienced a lot before it reached you? Equally, after you stop using it, your phone’s story is far from over. The lifecycle of your phone has a big impact on the planet. Your phone contains raw materials – the minerals and metals inside. But where do these raw materials come from? And what happens when you recycle your phone? Minerals, metals, and advanced materials are essential for modern technologies. Did you know there are more than 40 different materials in a smartphone? Each material has its own complex supply chain. Often, the minerals used to produce components for your phone, like the battery, are mined outside of Europe. Currently, Europe is highly dependent on the supply of minerals and metals coming from developing and emerging countries. Some materials for your phone come from politically unstable countries with limited environmental and workers’ health and safety regulations. This is why the CERA, innovation project, supported by EIT RawMaterials, is developing a certification process for raw materials to ensure the materials we need for modern technologies are sourced through a sustainable value chain.      Explore the life of your phone Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) or e-waste, includes computers, TV sets, fridges, and mobile phones. It is basically any old, discarded, or no longer in use electrical or electronic equipment that requires a power source, either electric or battery/accumulator power. According to the Global E-waste Monitor (2020), approximately 53.6 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in 2019. It is estimated that the amount of e-waste generated will exceed 74 million tonnes in 2030. Thus, the global quantity of e-waste is increasing at an alarming rate of almost two million tonnes per year. But there is something you can do. There is good news: the recycling rates for materials in batteries are increasing. That means that we can extract a larger proportion of the raw materials to reuse them. Recycling electronic devices to extract the raw materials is a difficult process. It takes a lot of energy and complicated work. Companies around the world are inventing new and simpler recycling processes to recycle phone batteries. To help our planet, we encourage you to check the WEEE4Future project. You can use an e-waste calculator to discover which appliance materials can be recycled and the potential emissions saved. And if you live in Germany, Italy, Ireland, or Slovenia, you can check for e-waste collection points near your home to recycle your old devices and give the valuable materials in your phone a second life!

eit391,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-launch-new-report-ai-health,EIT Health launch new report on AI in health,"The report concludes that AI and digital solutions are urgently needed, with healthcare workforces already straining to meet demand due to increasing populations and people living longer. This pressure is set to increase given estimations that by 2050 one in four people in Europe will be over the age of 65 and will likely have complex healthcare needs – which means only a proportion of additional years will be spent in good health. Progress in medical science has raised life expectancy, however as longevity increases, healthcare systems face increasing demand, with patients having more complex needs, costs rising and the workforce struggling to meet demand. Without major structural and transformational change, healthcare systems will become unsustainable, and the European promise of universal healthcare will be threatened. Building on a series of roundtables exploring the topic ‘Healthcare Workforce and Organisational Transformation with AI’, this new report identifies a range of focus areas that need to be addressed at an EU and national level, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to maximise the potential of AI and technology in healthcare. The outcomes of the AI Think Tank Report have given us clear and consistent messages on how to drive AI and technology forward within European healthcare systems. We already know that AI has the potential to transform healthcare, but we need to work quickly and collaboratively to build it into current European healthcare structures. The challenge of the pandemic has undoubtedly helped accelerate growth, adoption and scaling of AI, as stakeholders have fought to deliver care both rapidly and remotely. However, this momentum needs to be maintained to ensure that benefits to healthcare systems are embedded long-term and help them to prepare for the future– something which will benefit all of us. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO at EIT Health Key recommendations from EIT Health include improving collaboration and exchange of best practice across the EU, building on existing networks and infrastructures to support AI integration, improving education and skills, and developing value-based financial models that incorporates AI and acknowledges the longer-term cost-saving. At a wider EU level, EIT Health is pushing for a more robust data infrastructure for Europe, to ensure member states and healthcare systems can share data, allowing experts to track diseases, diagnose more quickly and develop new and improved AI-based solutions. The advances in AI and technology can be of immense benefit to current healthcare systems and allow front-line workers to spend more time on patient care. Data from a joint EIT Health and McKinsey and Company published in 2020 highlighted that AI automation could help alleviate workforce shortages, accelerate the research and development of life-saving treatments, and help reduce the time spent on administrative tasks. Activities that currently occupy between 20 to 80 percent of doctor and nurse time can be streamlined or even eliminated by using AI. But, for these benefits to become embedded within healthcare, existing systems will need to undergo significant change. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of AI in some areas, but the broad impact remains sparse. Countries and regions are fragmented in their approach, so too are start-ups and the healthcare industry, and this is hindering uptake. Looking ahead, EIT Health will continue supporting institutions to adapt, and can play a key role in upskilling and reskilling the healthcare workforce. Key to this will be facilitating the much-needed transparency and collaboration between innovators and practitioners that will support the successful scaling of AI across European healthcare, as well as engaging policy makers on legislative changes needed.

Not only because urban mobility is something many people use to manage and shape their daily lives. Far more is at stake. Our current over-reliance on cars to get around cities has many negative effects on urban populations. These include noise and air pollution, the risk of accidents and the privatisation of public space, to name but a few. Mentioned circumstances require changing systems of urban mobility to allow people and goods to move affordable, fast, comfortably, safely and cleanly, but at the same time enable cities to reclaim public space from cars to make cities better places for people to live, work and play. Therefore, at EIT Urban Mobility, the mission is to accelerate change towards a sustainable model of urban mobility for liveable urban spaces, and eventually achieving three societal impact goals: As the leading European Innovation Community for urban mobility, EIT Urban Mobility fosters integration by bringing together the key players across the whole value chain of mobility. It facilitates collaboration between cities, industry, academia, research and innovation and puts the challenges facing cities at the centre of all its activities. By breaking down the silos between the different players in urban mobility and ensuring a central role for cities and citizens, EIT Urban Mobility aims to have a significant impact on the ground. New innovative ways of moving around the city will greatly improve people’s quality of life, free up public space and give a significant boost to the competitiveness of Europe’s mobility industry. Creating forefront knowledge and breakthrough concepts for sustainable urban mobility and attracting the best European talent to this critical and strategic area will make Europe a leader in urban mobility. EIT Urban Mobility’s Strategic Agenda 2021-2027 defines the objectives, goals and strategic priorities, and outlines how EIT Urban Mobility works towards their realization within all its programme areas. Furthermore, the document gives an overview of the scope of the key actions and activities, mode of operation, how EIT Urban Mobility engages with stakeholders on a local, national, European and global level and how it delivers on impact as well as financial sustainability within the Horizon Europe programming period.

eit394,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-supported-peptomyc-starts-human-trials-universal-cancer-therapy,EIT Health supported Peptomyc starts human trials of 'universal cancer therapy',"Building on the proven preclinical efficacy and safety of the Omomyc cell-penetrating mini-protein in mouse models, and Peptomyc’s successful development of this compound for the treatment of several tumour types, this latest milestone represents a greatly anticipated ‘leap’ in clinical research, and an important step forward in becoming the first-ever clinically viable and direct inhibitor of Myc. Myc is a protein that plays an important role in the survival and proliferation of cancer cells, and therefore attacking it could prove successful in combating a number of different cancers – it could become a so-called ‘universal cancer treatment’. However, Myc has been largely considered ‘undruggable’ because it lacks effective binding pockets on its surface, in other words, it was thought that potential treatments would have nothing to ‘grab onto’. Myc has been considered an ‘undruggable’ cancer target for many years. We have previously shown that Myc blockade has an excellent therapeutic effect in several mouse models, with mild side effects that are well tolerated and reversible. Now that we have received approval to initiate our early phase clinical trial, we can further progress in testing the safety and efficacy of our Omomyc-based therapy for the benefit of those who matter most – our patients. Dr Laura Soucek, Co-Founder and CEO of Peptomyc Laura set up Peptomyc as a spin-off (a company born out of another; typically, a research institution) of the Vall d´Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) and the Catalan Institute of Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), determined to prove cynics wrong and demonstrate that Myc inhibition holds great promise that can be translated into benefits for patients. Peptomyc has been supported by EIT Health throughout its journey, benefitting from vital financial and business support to enable the new start-up to flourish. Access to EIT Health’s vast network meant Laura received bespoke strategic advice from internationally renowned consultants, gained training on engaging with investors, and had the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with founders of other start-ups. Ultimately, the network enabled Dr Soucek to progress towards clinical trials and build an evidence base to demonstrate the potential of her therapy. We’re extremely proud of Laura and the entire team at Peptomyc for their tenacity and commitment in finding and proving novel methods for new, safe and effective potential cancer treatments for patients with cancer. We all well know what a devastating disease cancer is, and sadly most of us have been affected in some way. EIT Health remains dedicated to supporting scientists, clinicians and entrepreneurs to accelerate the fight against cancer with innovative products and services. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health Approximately twenty patients with advanced solid tumours across various cancer types, whose disease has progressed despite previous treatments, will be enrolled in the phase I study. This clinical trial will be carried out at three Spanish hospitals across Barcelona and Madrid. Read more about Peptomyc",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit396,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-community-launches-joint-circular-economy-calls,EIT Community launches joint Circular Economy Calls,"Transitioning to the Circular Economy is one of the main objectives of European society right now. Moving to more circular economic models promises a much brighter future for the European economy. This will allow Europe to rise to the current and future challenges of global pressure on resources and increasing insecurity of supply. Pumping resources back into productive use, cutting waste and reducing dependence on uncertain supplies is a direct route to improving resilience and competitiveness. By helping to decouple economic growth from resource use and its impacts, it offers the prospect of sustainable growth that will last. EIT Community will be one of the key stakeholders ensuring this important objective for European society. This will only be achieved with a coordinated and efficient collaboration among the different EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities to ensure a greater impact from the collaboration. EIT RawMaterials, EIT Digital, EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Food, EIT Manufacturing and EIT Urban Mobility have created a joint action to strengthen the collaboration of internal and external activities related to the Circular Economy. The Circular Economy action includes two specific calls described below. Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) is a tool designed to help innovative environmental technologies access the market. It consists of the verification, on a voluntary basis, of the functional and environmental performance of technology by qualified third parties, through tests of controlled quality. The end product is an ETV Statement of Verification published on the ETV website and used in business-to-business relations. This enables technology owners to document the reliability of their claims and differentiate them from competitors, and it helps technology purchasers identify innovations that suit their needs. ETV is implemented by accredited Verification Bodies in three technology areas: The call is open to any partner and start-up of participating in the EIT Community (EIT RawMaterials, EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Food, EIT Manufacturing and EIT Urban Mobility) with a technology included in any of the previously defined areas that has been supported in any ongoing or finished demonstration project. A webinar defining main aspects of the call and ETV requirements will be organised on 29 April from 10:30 to 12:00. The webinar will include a presentation of the Circular Economy project and call description, a detailed presentation of ETV main requirements and finally a presentation of the new ETV Secretariat; the webinar will also include a specific final session for questions. Further details can be found here. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the economy, steering our economy towards a more circular model. However, their small size means that they face unique challenges on the path to closing loops and improving resource efficiency. Some of those unique challenges can be linked to lack of company environmental culture, financial support, adequate legislation, innovation legislation and support mechanisms, information and many others. The six EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communities involved in this initiative are a diverse set of publicly and privately funded bodies uniquely positioned to tackle the above barriers for the circular economy adoption by SMEs. The overall aim of this call is to enable the joint competencies and capacities of the EIT Community to help solve a more systemic circularity in an orchestrated effort as well as possible specific approaches towards circularity in SMEs.

They bring together diverse teams from across the ‘Knowledge Triangle’ in one specified physical location and provide the focal point for a KIC’s activity in that area. Geographical proximity is essential for facilitating interactions among KIC partners within a geographical area. This decision was initiated earlier in 2020 and resulted in an extensive search for suitable collocation opportunities that could foster the goals of both Copenhagen-based teams. Eventually, EIT Urban Mobility provisional office site at BLOXHUB was chosen as the preferred joint solution. Copenhagen BLOXHUB provides access to a vibrant community of innovators consisting of 350 companies, research institutions, organisations, and municipalities working towards sustainable urbanisation. In this environment, both teams are confident that a strengthened cross-KIC collaboration will lead to innovative and leading-edge results benefiting the ‘knowledge triangle’ communities. EIT Urban Mobility’s new office collocation with EIT Climate-KIC has resulted in over 40% cost savings and will lead to greater resource efficiency allowing us to cut down on wasted space, as well as the furniture and equipment costs.  Next to financial savings, the co-location will allow for enhanced cross-KIC collaboration through the planning and organisation of joint activities, harness the power of  networks, and enhance visibility for each of the collocating KICs as well as the EIT Community in the Nordic and Baltic region.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit398,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-foods-c-sniper-project-fighting-against-campylobacter-poultry,EIT Food's C-SNIPER project fighting against Campylobacter in poultry,"Campylobacteriosis is the most frequent food-borne illness in Europe, with  220 682 reported cases in 2019 and an estimated associated cost of EUR 2 400 M per year. Consumption of chicken meat contaminated with the bacteria Campylobacter is considered the most common route for human infection. Current control measures are mostly based on the use of antibiotics at farm level, which contributes to the spreading of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter strains. Although some phage-based products against other food pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella are already on the market, there is a lack of Campylobacter-specific products. C-SNIPER is an EIT Food funded project delivered by five European organisations (AZTI, Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research PAS, University of Turin, Phage Technology Center GmbH and O.R.A. Società Agricola), that seeks the development and validation of a natural antimicrobial to help reducing the prevalence of Campylobacter in the farm, slaughter and/or processing poultry and to be integrated into existing production and processing hygiene protocols. C-SNIPER provides an alternative to antibiotics which, being highly specific against a single genus of bacteria (Campylobacter), is harmless to plants, animals, and humans, as well as to the rest of the surrounding natural microbiota. Moreover, this solution makes it possible to control the spread of this pathogen without affecting the appearance and quality of the final product. According to the results obtained in a survey conducted by C-SNIPER among poultry producers and consumers, 90% and 85% of respondents respectively were prone to accept bacteriophages as a standard biocontrol measure in food production and processing. However, Campylobacter remains largely unknown to the public. Therefore, within the project, different educational materials have been developed, such as videos and infographics, to raise awareness. These materials explain what the main source of contamination is and how the risk of infection can be minimised in the domestic environment, as well as familiarise consumers with the safety, efficacy, and ubiquity of bacteriophages, thus strengthening the anti-Campylobacter strategy.      The C-SNIPER project will contribute to the growth of the EU poultry sector by improving animal health and poultry meat safety, consequently reducing public health expenditure, and improving food safety in Europe. Moreover, it will help to increase consumer protection and their confidence in the quality and safety of poultry products.

This is a good example of how EIT Urban Mobility contributes to making urban spaces more liveable for the benefit of European citizens. The EIT Urban Mobility’s business acceleration services enabled Vianova to strengthen its connection with AMAT (Agenzia Mobilità Ambiente e Territorio), a mobility and environment agency owned by the municipality of Milan, and to investigate the possibility to pilot the Vianova technology in Milan. In October 2020, EIT Urban Mobility invested EUR 45.000 in Vianova to implement a pilot in Milan together with AMAT. The data platform developed by Vianova consists of a digital layer between cities and connected transportation services, enabling better integration and collaboration between the two. It will now be fully scaled to supervise shared mobility services in Milan, such as e-scooters, bikes, mopeds and shared cars. While doing this, Vianova will also provide digitisation of all regulations of AMAT and it will work on the development of an audit feature to verify operators’ compliance. The pilot has already kicked-off and it will run throughout 2021, including the platform customisation to the needs of the city of Milan and the integration with the city’s shared mobility operators. Thanks to the collaboration with Vianova, the city of Milan will be able to equip itself with a useful tool to better monitor the demand for shared mobility and plan specific interventions to ramp up the mobility offer with new services. This will allow to achieve the goals of EIT Urban Mobility to integrate user-centric mobility services and products and give a significant boost to the market growth. Valentino Sevino, Director of Mobility Planning and Monitoring Area at AMAT Vianova, a French start-up based in Paris and founded in 2018, is one of the leading European data platform providers for enabling cities to manage connected, shared, and autonomous mobility in the urban public realm. Some facts: 15 major European cities are using Vianova; 25 mobility operators integrated; EUR 500 000 revenue generated in 2020; 70 000 vehicles supervised/day; 2M rides/month; 100M data points ingested/day. Vianova has been part of several programmes supported by EIT Urban Mobility: it was granted EUR 15 000 for technology and market validation under the EIT Urban Mobility Accelerator programme running from July to December 2020, followed by its participation in the GoGlobal programme, which promotes start-ups’ global outreach by connecting start-ups to the EIT Urban Mobility network and ecosystem.

eit404,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/understanding-market-validation-eit-food,Understanding market validation with EIT Food,"EIT Food's Business Creation offer While entrepreneurs and start-ups spend a lot of time, energy, and money on their idea or technology, they typically neglect to understand the needs of their customers and therefore, develop and supply a product or service for which there is no market demand. Market validation is the process of identifying whether there is a market for your idea. It involves gaining insights from the key market(s) your technology or product aims to serve including industry or other prospective customers, end-users, and other stakeholders. This helps to ensure you develop the right product for the right customer. As such, market validation helps to establish early in the commercial journey if your business model is viable. If you discover your idea is in fact not commercially viable, this gives you the option to get out early i.e. ‘Fail Fast, Fail Forward’ or pivot towards something where there is market demand, before too many resources are wasted. A lot of funding is required to take your technology from concept to commercialisation and therefore it takes time to regain this investment before a new product or service returns revenue from customers. Investors will therefore want to see evidence of market validation in your business plan because they do not want to invest in a product or service that is not commercially promising. Therefore, undertaking market validation demonstrates that you are not only reducing your risk of failure but reducing this for your investors as well. Market validation requires you to talk to potential customers, end-users, and domain experts. Validation is about listening and gaining valuable insights and it enables you to test your assumptions and find out the following:  The Seedbed Incubator helped Crover reach their target customers, of farmers and grain merchants, for their grain storage monitoring solution. The EIT Food Seedbed Incubator programme will help you overcome your market validation challenges, including: A successfully completed market validation project will greatly improve the probability that your technology gets to market to solve real customers’ problems.

We import lithium for electric cars, platinum to produce clean hydrogen, silicon metal for solar panels. 98% of the rare earth elements we need come from a single supplier: China. This is not sustainable. So we must diversify our supply chains. And at the same time, we must invest in circular technologies that re-use resources instead of constantly extracting them. This is the goal of our Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials. This is why we have proposed to create a European Raw Materials Alliance. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) was announced on 3 September 2020 as part of the Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials and the publication of the 2020 List of Critical Raw Materials. EIT RawMaterials manages the Alliance and is committed to contributing to the achievement of the objectives set by the EU Green Deal as raw materials are indispensable drivers for the transformation from the brown to the green economy. Raw materials play a vital role in the revival, autonomy and resilience of Europe’s industrial ecosystems. The European RawMaterials Alliance has grown to over 450 members, from Greenland to Australia. Over 100 investment cases are currently being evaluated, and we are committed to creating sustainable, responsible and resilient value chains to boost Europe’s green and digital transition. Bernd Schäfer, CEO, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials Metals, minerals, and advanced materials are the key enablers for a globally competitive, green, and digital Europe The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) contributes to ensuring reliable, secure, and sustainable access to raw materials. ERMA’s vision is to secure access to critical and strategic raw materials, advanced materials, and processing know-how for EU industrial ecosystems. ERMA aims to make Europe economically more resilient by diversifying its supply chains, creating jobs, attracting investments to the raw materials value chain, fostering innovation, training young talents, and contributing to the best enabling framework for raw materials and the circular economy worldwide. Raw materials are the key enablers of the transition from the linear to the circular economy. Besides its role in boosting investments in the raw materials sectors and increasing EU’s resilience, the European Raw Materials Alliance is a funnel for recommendations on specific actions that are economically, socially, and environmentally sound and responsible, to the benefit of the whole community. Massimo Gasparon, ERMA Director The Alliance involves all relevant stakeholders, including industrial actors along the value chain, Member States and regions, trade unions, civil society, research and technology organisations, investors, and NGOs. By 2030, ERMA’s activities will increase the production of raw and advanced materials and address the circular economy by boosting the recovery and recycling of critical raw materials.

They have to decide how to use resources to advance their civilisation while dealing with the consequences of their decisions. They can invest in research, education and entertainment, and have to be mindful of the health, happiness and prosperity of their community. The higher the level of emissions players generate, the greater the challenges they will face, as all game scenarios are based on real climate data and scientific research. Just like in the real world, their cities may then encounter heatwaves, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and/or the spread of new diseases. Every action taken has consequences, positive or negative, on the planet: everything is governed by the climate emergency. Change Game allows people to learn, while playing, about many aspects of climate change, even if they are not very familiar with its impacts or with strategies to reduce emissions. Players do so by managing the production and consumption of energy, water and food, while coping with natural disasters. They also have the opportunity to adopt innovative solutions, to exploit the technologies of the future, to influence people’s behaviour while interacting with nearby cities and to face scenarios that we already see happening in the real world. Eleonora Cogo, Senior Scientific Manager at the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change (CMCC) Change Game represents the complexity of the climate system and its interactions with humankind and natural ecosystems. To translate this complexity in an accessible way, teachers and educators can use accompanying materials, which can help them foster a better understanding of the underlying assumptions that govern the climate change process. Scientifically grounded, the video game aims to encourage a debate among players about what innovations are necessary to create resilient and zero-emission societies.      Developed by Melazeta Srl, Change Game aims to leverage the potential of videogames to process climate-related information in a fun, educational and interactive way that will increase climate literacy among children (age 12 and up) and young adults.

Director of Business Creation at EIT Health, Dr. Kurt Höller, said: This new tool is very exciting. It gives the start-ups we work with an opportunity to showcase themselves, and the partners and investors we work with the chance to browse promising start-ups in their fields. It also allows the public to see how we are supporting European entrepreneurs and businesses to grow and thrive. The tool is hosted by Dealroom.co, an Amsterdam-based start-up data and research platform which uses a combination of manual research and automated tools to identify and process relevant company information and insights. The company tracks data on over 1.2 million start-ups worldwide, and the EIT Health start-up databse tracks the slice of those start-ups which have engaged in an EIT Health programme. EIT Health will be in good company as Dealroom.co also provides its services to governments and several other large-scale ecosystems. These include; UK (Tech Nation), France (La French Tech), Berlin (Senate), Netherlands (TechLeap), Amsterdam (StartupAmsterdam) and over a dozen other hubs across Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit413,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/farmers-most-trusted-group-within-food-sector-says-report-eit-food,‘Farmers as the most trusted group within the food sector’ says a report by EIT Food,"Download the EIT Food Trust Report 2020 A study of 20 000 consumers across 18 European countries reveals trust in the food sector has increased over the course of 2020, yet the majority of consumers don’t consider the sector to be working in the public interest. The EIT Food Trust Report surveyed 19 800 consumers from 18 European countries to measure trust in the food system and confidence in food products. The study was conducted by a consortium of pan-European academic partners including the University of Reading, the European Food Information Council (EUFIC), Aarhus University, KU Leuven, and the University of Warsaw. The report shows that consumer trust in all parts of the food sector has increased, and with it the confidence they have in food products, with overall increases of between 3% and 8%.      Of all players within the food sector, farmers are the most trusted by the public, with two-thirds (67%) of European consumers reporting that they trust farmers compared to just 13% that do not. Trust in both government agencies and food manufacturers, however, has lagged behind, with less than half of consumers across all countries (47% and 46% respectively) stating that they trust these groups. Meanwhile, over a quarter of consumers (29% and 26%) actively distrust government authorities and manufacturers respectively. When it comes to confidence in food products themselves, consumers believe that food safety, on the whole, has improved, with an 8% increase from 2018 in those agreeing that food is generally safe, to a total of 55%. In the UK, this rises to 74%. Likewise, just three in 10 consumers (30%) are confident that food products are generally produced in a sustainable way - meaning environmentally friendly, resource-efficient, and ethically responsible, compared to 42% that consider them to be unsustainable. As the global population moves towards 10 billion by 2050, we need innovative technologies and collaborative approaches from farm to fork to deliver accessible and healthy food products in a sustainable way. The EIT Food Trust Report shows that there are clear opportunities for the food industry to demonstrate how it is acting in the public interest and meet consumer demand regarding health and sustainability. Professor Klaus Grunert, Department of Management at Aarhus University Ultimately, to create a future-fit food system, we must put consumers at the centre of the development, production, distribution and promotion of food. Many of our EIT Food projects work directly with consumers to increase transparency, thereby empowering healthy and sustainable food choices.

Read more about the EIT-EIC cooperation and watch the press briefing Prior to last week’s signing, EIT Health and the EIC have been working on a plan to join forces, offering promising European start-ups a blueprint for cohesive engagement with opportunities offered by both organisations. As the largest healthcare innovation network in Europe, EIT Health is focussed on building a pipeline of promising health start-ups through training, network-building, early-stage funding, and project collaborations, as well as providing the necessary ecosystem in which they can flourish. The EIC is set to be the largest early-stage equity fund in Europe, designed to crowd in investments from venture capital and other impact investors – while not focussed on any one sector, health is on the EIC agenda. We know that we have a multitude of talented people and bold ideas here in Europe, but in today’s landscape it is not enough to simply have the funds, you must have the know-how in order to bring healthcare products to the market. The services of the EIC and EIT Health are highly complementary to this, offering innovators the opportunity to access funding, training, and networking at the right time – all of which are crucial ingredients that do not stand up alone. We look forward to working closely with the EIC to offer a cohesive journey for Europe’s talented healthcare entrepreneurs that can help to put innovative and impactful solutions into the hands of those in need. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health The complementarity of EIT Health and the EIC is already evident, given the support that many European healthcare start-ups have received from both organisations in previous years. The formal partnership can begin as soon as the submitted EIT Health proposal is approved by the EIC, which is expected in the coming weeks. The synergies to be offered will ensure a higher-powered European support framework allowing promising start-ups to begin, grow and scale, all while remaining in Europe.

On the one hand, one can identify the increasing quality and ambitions of Slovak founders, as well as increasing interest and support for open innovation initiatives from corporates and universities. On the other hand, start-ups and innovation initiatives are starting to have a more concrete, sector-specific character and cannot be put into a single category anymore. The formation of these specific communities may represent a turning point and a tremendous opportunity for the Slovak innovation ecosystem. Sector-specific communities of entrepreneurs, corporates, and researchers can be better positioned to retain and attract talent, create meaningful connections between start-ups, corporates, and universities, or make the regional Research and development (R&D) base more attractive and investable. They can generate more tailor-made support for entrepreneurs by aggregating valuable sector-specific knowledge, streamlining growth opportunities, and engaging the local or regional economies. If well supported and nurtured, sector-specific innovation communities can drive the growth, competitiveness, and attractiveness of Slovakia’s regional economies. This report puts five emerging innovation communities to the forefront of a wider discussion: healthcare, climate resilience, fintech, digital and creative, and mobility. The list is of course not exhaustive and offers a slightly simplified overview, but this publication hopes to ignite a discussion on the subject.

The virtual platform hosting EIT Urban Mobility’s first annual Summit welcomed 2 284 multiple logins, 74 exhibitors, gave the floor to 71 speakers on 9 and 10 December, and 38 speakers on 11 December for the Partners Networking Day, which was only open to partners and on invitation only. All in all, technology allowed the EIT Community once again to embrace the extended urban mobility ecosystem from a distance and to exchange insights and views on how we can contribute to make sustainable urban mobility a reality. To go fast, you should go alone, but to go far, you should go together. We believe that there is no other way than going fast together to go far. Maria Tsavachidis, EIT Urban Mobility Chief Executive Officer In the morning of 10 December, participants had the privilege to be the first to hear the Director General of the European Commission for Transport and Mobility, Henrik Hololei, debating about the EU's Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy that had been adopted the day before by the European Commission, which will pave the way towards mobility compatible with the European climate-neutrality ambition. A strategy supporting urban mobility and making cities more liveable and citizens' lives easier, as Henrik Hololei stated during the institutional session. To make all this possible, further collaboration on urban mobility between the public and private sector is needed, as Karima Delli, Chairwoman of the TRAN Committee at the European Parliament, stated. This session has also been the occasion for Mohamed Mezghani, Secretary General of UITP, to describe his vision for the way we will move around in 2030: people in cities will be moving less, move more locally and mainly walk in cities, while the speed limit will be 30 km/h, with less privately-owned cars, and the road will be shared with public transport. Participants also had time to reflect on how our unexpected guest of 2020, COVID-19, has impacted our lives and the ways we understand mobility and safety in urban spaces. Throughout the Summit, participants learned more about how entrepreneurs and start-ups have become this year’s heroes by working on developing solutions that could neutralise the spread of the virus. Keep reading about the topic The Summit allowed participants to explore also the views of young researchers on urban mobility. The researchers that are putting their ideas at the disposal of creating solutions that help organisations build more efficient and sustainable means of urban mobility. And participants learnt from others who have implemented successful strategies on urban mobility, which will enable cities to provide better mobility opportunities to their citizens. The golden closing of these very thrilling days was the InnovaCity Awards Final. Innovacity is a two and a half-day hackathon-style workshop providing participants with the essential skills of design thinking and the opportunity to apply these skills while working to solve the biggest mobility challenges. Amongst all the candidates, it was HelsinKey who won the Innovacity Awards. HelsinKey helps restore people´s trust in public transport with a user engagement platform combining elements of storytelling, communication, and community interaction. The EIT Urban Mobility Summit 2020 is now behind us. This year has taught us how important it is to be connected. Therefore, the EventsAir platform where the EIT Urban Mobility Summit was hosted, will remain open for some more days, so you will be able to continue to interact with other peers.

Furthermore, an extensive user survey was conducted in the cities of Munich, Copenhagen, Tel-Aviv, Budapest, Barcelona and Stockholm and data were collected for informing about the typical usage forms of e-micromobility, useful for decision makers and urban planners. Best practices and results of e-micromobile integration potentials have been identified and analysed with calculations and visualisations. Proposals on how transport, and particularly public transport, can be strengthened and made more attractive if e-micromobility is integrated into the traffic systems of European cities in an appropriate way have also been put forward. Specific safety aspects of e-micromobility, including an analysis and understanding of main safety problems and priorities have been established based on accident frequencies, severities and suitable measures and techniques/technologies for safety improvement were derived. Finally, a conference was organised by UnternehmerTUM on 12 November 2020 which disseminated results of the MOBY project. The specific conditions and solutions in the field of e-micromobility have been mapped. The analysis consisted of two parts, first the regulatory, planning, financial conditions for usage of these new transport modes were assessed, then the mobility-related requirements including user needs and travel behaviour were discovered.

Read the full report In this report, an in-depth review of research and statistics to illustrate how e-micromobility has become an integral part of urban mobility systems. The report argues that e-micromobility should be seen as a new mode of transportation, that responds to widespread demand for multimodal urban transport. In this way, micromobility could constitute an important part of an attractive alternative to private motoring and fossil-fuelled vehicles. In line with the above, this study provides examples of current best-practices of e-micromobility in European cities (including Tel Aviv), as well as examples of the problems and complaints that the principles of e-micromobility have been met. As a silver line, this report will present a toolkit for regulations, policies, etc. that will help release the potential of micromobility as a vital part of sustainable, intermodal urban transport.

This project is supported by EIT Climate-KIC in partnership with the Danish Technological Institute, WeThinkNordic, Arkitema and COWI. The whole event was recorded, relieve the launch here We are proud to present NoMu Wood, and we hope that it can be the catalyst for change amongst municipalities in Norway. The platform will give Nordic municipalities a great grounding in wood construction and LCA knowledge and equip them to lead the charge in the low-carbon construction revolution. Anders Vestergaard Jensen, Project Manager of the Nordic Wood in Construction Secretariat at EIT Climate-KIC With an abundance of sustainably sourced timber, infamous architectural prowess and some of the world’s most ambitious climate targets, the Nordics are well-positioned to play a central role in the coming low-carbon revolution in construction: wood. Through local procurement, municipalities have the power to drive local supply chains towards timber construction, support local bioeconomies and cut carbon emissions in the construction sector — all while creating beautiful and healthy places to live for their citizens. NoMuWood aims to provide the resources to enable municipalities to make that transition. By gathering resources and information to guide them through the process, NoMuWood gives Nordic Municipalities interested in building with wood everything they need to get started. The platform also includes a case library with numerous and varied examples of wooden buildings from around the region and offers guidance from the idea and tender stage to the end of life. With life cycle analysis (LCA) playing an increasing role in assessing the carbon impact of different construction materials, the platform is also home to an LCA e-learning tool. Seven online training modules give municipal actors the skills and knowledge they need to work with LCA through the tendering, design, and operation phases, and how wood buildings perform under these analyses.

eit429,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-foods-wevaluefood-project-engaging-next-generation-european-consumers,EIT Food’s WeValueFood project: engaging the next generation of European consumers,"Where does our food come from? How does food affect our health? And our planet? Knowing the answers to these questions are crucial to overcome the major problems our society is facing today in terms of obesity, food waste and the impact of our food system on the environment. Read on to find out how the WeValueFood project engaged and empowered the next generation of European consumers to make improved food choices. In Iceland, project partner Matís designed the Krakkar Kokka (Kids Cooking) programme, through which primary and lower secondary school children learned about the United Nations’ global goals, food traditions, local resources and sustainability through play and education. This ‘infotainment’ method aims to increase children’s knowledge about regional food production and raise their awareness of responsible consumption behaviour and sustainable production methods. As part of this programme, children went on field trips to primary food producers in the area and gathered raw ingredients in the wild. Afterwards, they learned how to cook these ingredients and had a chance to eat what they prepared. These trips were documented so children all over the country could learn from them. For this purpose, children themselves were involved in making the videos, with the help of their teachers. Via the Krakkar kokka Instagram, children and their parents, as well as local food producers can learn about local food resources and how to prepare them. Another infotainment approach was the ‘Food in space’ day. Children between the age of 12 -15 years old learned about the history of space travel, food and food circulation in space, our senses, and how our perception changes in space. Children participated in several practical exercises focussing on our senses and food in general and within the context of space. In Finnish and Polish schools, the project partners the University of Helsinki and the University of Warsaw, introduced the Finnish food educational tool called ‘Trip to the store’. This initiative aimed to increase the interest and understanding of third-fifth grade pupils regarding food. Children were educated about the origin of food and healthy eating. The idea was that by raising young people’s interest in food, their awareness and appreciation of food also increased. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, trips to the stores were conducted virtually. Via a remote connection, children had the opportunity to speak to a store manager and to go online grocery shopping. By doing this, they have learned where the products in a store come from, which bread is the richest in fibre and which food products are domestically produced. Besides the store visits, children also visited a goat farm and enjoyed an online chat with a farmer. Lesson plans for these and over 350 other educational tools can be found in a decision support tool, called Database for Educators: Choices for Incorporating Food (DECIFood). DECIFood can be used by educators across primary, secondary, and tertiary educations levels, to help them retrieve and utilise suitable resources about food education, based on defined criteria selected by educators. Access the DECIFood tool In the UK and Spain, young food-savvy consumers, called Food Champions, were recruited to inspire their peers through sharing food-related knowledge on social media and school networks. In this way, the Food Champions contribute to a society that is more knowledgeable and discerning about the origin of food and how it affects our health and planet. At Queen’s University Belfast, a group of students who were already highly engaged with food matters, received training and support from communication experts on how to share evidence-based information, to amplify their voice online, and to engage with followers. The students communicated the value of food through social media and peer-to-peer activities, empowering their existing networks to make healthy lifestyle choices. Another group of students, more disengaged with food issues, participated in a parallel programme aimed to develop their food skills. Through online workshops and cooking classes, students learned about topics such as food waste, food labels, and food safety. In Spain, IMDEA Food and the Food Science department of the University of Madrid (UAM), fostered a network of Food Champions. These Food Champions included food and science graduates, and they were encouraged to attend online events addressing nutrition and health-related topics as well as to create their own social media channels and communicate about such topics. The Food Champions were inspired to build a meaningful connection with their audience, combining a flair for communication with a robust background in food and health science. In the video below, the Spanish Food Champions Madres Cientificas, CocinaCorreCome, beFEEDus, Fermentilandia, introduce themselves and their social media channels, the reason why they decided to join the WeValueFood project, and their project activities.    The WeValueFood project is a two-year Grand Challenge project funded by EIT Food, aimed to educate, engage and advance the young Europeans’ knowledge and appreciation of food, thereby empowering the next generations to make the best choices about the food that they eat. The project involves 12 European partners from education, academia and industry, and communication sectors. WeValueFood ran from 2019-2020 and was led by Queen’s University Belfast.  For more information on the project, please visit the dedicated page Discover more about EIT Food",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit430,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-rawmaterials-corrosion-prediction-software-tools,EIT RawMaterials: Corrosion prediction software tools,"Corrosion is a disease to materials and poses a significant risk to many industrial facilities and structures such as pipelines, storage tanks, boilers, heat exchangers, and other equipment and systems. Overall, corrosion is one of the critical materials failure mechanism in industry and annually responsible for costs amounting to trillions of euros. In the EIT RawMaterials up-scaling project 'CorTools', corrosion on-line monitoring and prediction software tools are developed to respond to the needs of raw materials industry. We need to understand the behaviour of construction materials of tanks, containers, pipes, mixers, i.e. stainless steels in the operation conditions. In this project, we focus on raw materials processing conditions and are creating a materials selection tool, a virtual expert and corrosion on-line monitoring solution. Elina Huttunen-Saarivirta, Research Professors, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd The unique Cortools consortium: Boliden Harjavalta Oy, DMS, Ferritico, Outokumpu Stainless AB, Metso:Outotec, Tecnalia, ZAG and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, enables the co-creation and industrial validation of the tools. For the industrial project partners, the developed tools enable more than 1 M€ annual savings through the prevention of corrosion failures. For the European raw materials industry in whole, the project may allow billions of euros in savings. The software tool will make it easier to support our technical marketing and sales. The tool will decrease the need for time-consuming corrosion testing and it will be easier for the industry to choose the most optimum stainless steel grade as construction material. Lena Wegrelius, Head of Corrosion, Outokumpu Stainless AB Collaboration across the whole industrial value chain is carried out in the project to cover multiple dimensions (laboratory, pilot, operational environment) in the tool prediction capabilities and thus facilitate market penetration of the software tool. The use of digital on-site measuring technologies and computer modelling will connect various operational scales, therefore contributing to an improvement in material- and energy efficiency of the raw materials processing industries. The corrosion on-line monitoring and prediction software tools provide the raw materials sector yet another footstep towards digitalisation. Another giant progress is the link to artificial intelligence (AI). In this project, AI is used in computational modelling. Furthermore, a remote collection of on-line monitoring data allows later for the hidden causalities in the project conditions (e.g. mineral quality in hydrometallurgy) and the detected corrosion rate to be disclosed with the aid of AI. The software tool is developed by the project partner Ferritico. We make use of the available data when creating this virtual expert. Industries have huge sets of experimentally measured corrosion data and this is a big source of information and motivation to develop a machine learning tool. We are predicting failure events based on all of the available features instead of developing complex physical or chemical models of corrosion. Satish Kolli, Materials Informatics Engineer, Ferritico The user needs are twofold. First, a materials selection tool, a “virtual expert”, that allows for evaluation of a corrosion risk of materials under various operation conditions emerged. Based on machine learning, this “virtual expert” finds the safe operating conditions for a given material and estimates the lifetime of materials in specific conditions. Second, on-line corrosion monitoring systems in industrial facilities reveal the actual corrosion rate of the materials and makes it possible to evaluate the remaining lifetime of the components.

eit431,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-digital-entremo-deploy-remote-monitoring-device-hungarian-hospitals,EIT Digital: ENTREMO to deploy remote monitoring device in Hungarian hospitals,"In less than six months, a team of five EIT Digital Master School students went from successfully winning a high-profile European hackathon to incorporating their start-up, Entremo, where more than 20 people are currently contributing. Entremo is about to deploy their main product, a wristband to remotely monitor the vital signs of patients, in hospitals and nursing homes in Hungary. Entremo’s journey within EIT Digital is testimony to how teamwork, talent and entrepreneurial spirit can quickly generate results. It all started with a group of friends passionate about using technology to improve people’s health and wellbeing, all of them involved in different EIT Digital Master School programmes: Data Science graduate Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo, teamed up with Márton Elodi (Human Computer Interaction and Design), Miklós Knebel (Autonomous Systems), Levente Mitnyik (Embedded Systems) and Peter Danos (Visual computing and communication). Together with another friend, motion graphic designer Kristóf Nagy, they formed Team Discover, a group of developers which successfully took part in several hackathons in the last two years. They received a special EIT Health award at the Hack the Crisis Hungary hackathon in early 2020. In April they went on to win the European Commission #EUvsVirus hackathon’s Healthcare category with a prototype of their 3D-printed remote monitoring device.      The device originally came in the shape of ‘smart glasses’, worn by patients to check parameters such as body temperature, oxygen saturation, pulse and respiratory rates. The measured data is then made available to the medical staff via an online platform. As a result, instead of one patient, nurses are able to check on dozens of them at the same time. Then things started moving fast. In mid-2020, EIT Digital Innovation Factory launched the ""DATA against COVID-19"" initiative, with the objective of quickly developing digital tools to fight back the pandemic. The EUvsVirus award had given the team significant international exposure and put them on the radar of companies and institutions, so they quickly found four partners: ELTE-Soft, MOHAnet and Eötvös Lorand University from Hungary and InnoTractor from the Netherlands. The activity was selected by the Innovation Factory and received EUR 500 000 of support from EIT Digital. Later, the Entremo team decided to pivot their product, dropping the ‘smart glasses’ shape for a more convenient and practical wristband, with similar features but better usability. The glasses were more invasive, and they also might be in the way of oxygen masks for COVID patients. In addition, people are used to having watches on their hands 24/7, so that doctors can get analysis from night activities as well. Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo All the other missing pieces ended up falling into place. We've been developing our product with the four partner companies for the past six months and it's been quite a hectic journey; there were so many new experiences that we went through. But I’m happy to say that now we have all the pipeline ready: from the measuring device to its communication with the data collection hubs, and then the communication of the data collection hubs with our servers, up to pushing the data from the servers to the display of the medical staff . Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo. Right now, the team is 3D printing the first batches of 50 devices which will be used in the first two product deployments in Hungary, scheduled in December, with two other Hungarian pilots planned for January. Entremo is currently looking for investors to further scale the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The battery regulations proposed by the European Commission on 10 December highlights the need of minimising both the social and the carbon footprint of the battery industry. The national strategy is supported by companies across the value chain as well as universities and environmental organisations. Last week a proposal of the new battery regulation was adopted by the European Commission. The proposal is ambitious – it aims at minimising both the carbon footprint and the social footprint of the batteries. This is accelerated by the European Battery Alliance, launched by EU Commissioner Maroš Šefčovic in 2017, with the aim of building a sustainable battery value chain in Europe. The Swedish strategy for a sustainable battery value chain shows how actions in Sweden will contribute to the European battery industry development. The development of sustainable battery production is not only important for achieving climate goals, but also enables the emergence of a competitive industry that creates growth and jobs throughout the battery value chain. The big demand for electrification in the transport sector and industry processes have made battery manufacturing a bottle-neck. Sustainably produced batteries can become the next big Swedish industry expansion. Svante Axelsson, National Coordinator for Fossil Free Sweden In Bloomberg NEF´s ‘Global Lithium-Ion Battery Supply Chain Ranking’ Sweden is projected to climb from number 10 to number 4 by 2025, only lagging behind China, Japan and the U.S. Sweden has a strong position, with access to raw materials, cheap and fossil-free electricity, expertise and policy instruments that promote continued electrification with high environmental requirements. In addition, Sweden has strong actors along the entire value chain, from recycling and mining to the manufacture of active materials, complete battery cells and battery packs, to applications in the automotive industry as well as in the power system. The national strategy for a sustainable battery value chain is developed by the government initiative Fossil Free Sweden in cooperation with EIT InnoEnergy who also developed the foundation of the European Battery Strategy for the European Commission. The strategy is supported by actors from the entire value chain from the Swedish mining industry to the battery-cell producer Northvolt, vehicle manufacturers like Volvo Cars, Volvo Group and Scania and electricity distributor Vattenfall as well as universities and environmental organisations. Sweden is already today an integral part of the European battery ecosystem, but there is room for development in many parts of the value chain and here the strategy can be an important tool. We are impressed by the commitment of everyone involved and look forward how the example of this strategy work can be used as a role model for other European countries to follow.

The European Green Deal, for example, is intended to propel Europe towards a 55% cut in emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. As the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said in her 2020 State of the Union speech, the EU Green Deal ‘is about making systemic modernisation across our economy, society and industry’. The EIT Climate-KIC community aims to stimulate exactly that kind of systemic change, leveraging the power of innovation, as outlined in the EIT Climate-KIC 2019-2022 strategy, Transformation, in Time. This report offers a snapshot of EIT Climate-KIC 2020 portfolio of innovation projects. The projects selected range from transforming Europe’s most visited square kilometre in the City of Amsterdam into a green district, to replacing soy in animal feed or finding ways of ensuring forests and their ecosystem services against extreme weather events. They include policy innovations, such as a framework for climate-friendly materials; and integrated technological innovations, like a solution to verify land-use changes at scale using artificial intelligence combined with satellite imagery, augmented with drones and other sources. These are projects that address several of EIT Climate-KIC’s 12 impact goals and in many cases engage multiple leverage points for change. Although this collection shows a significant diversity of ideas and approaches, these 59 projects are only a part of EIT Climate-KIC whole innovation portfolio.

eit437,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-project-developed-service-flood-risk-mapping,EIT Climate-KIC project developed a service for flood risk mapping,"Cities are expected to experience more frequent and severe flooding, due to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events many Europeans are vulnerable to their impacts. Future projections are not reassuring either, since the combination of climate change with other factors, such as the increase in population concentration and permeability of soil in urban environments, is further contributing to the risks associated with flooding. Cities must act quickly by planning and re-designing with climate projections in mind and provide concrete steps to create more resilient urban spaces. Flood risk information is an essential element of urban planning: it can be used to make informed decisions about climate adaptation strategies that promote economic growth and boost wellbeing, while at the same time mitigating risks.  SaferPlaces, a project co-financed by EIT Climate-KIC, coordinated by GECOsistema Srl and developed together with research institutions such as Fondazione Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) and Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam (GFZ), universities, such as the University of Bologna and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, and private companies such as the Meteorological and Environmental Earth Observation (MEEO), aims to contribute to the creation of dedicated tools for decision-making and the design of urban regeneration interventions, both necessary to mitigate the risks associated with climate change. More about SaferPlaces The project aims to create a climate service to assess the risks and dangers of rain, river, and coastal flooding in urban environments. In order to improve urban flood-proofing, new resource-effective tools are needed to support data-driven climate services, and resilience and adaptation in our cities. The use of innovative climate, hydrological, hydraulic, topographic, and economic modelling techniques allows relevant stakeholders to examine current and future climate scenarios which will help inform the appropriate means to plan, design and build safer and more resilient communities. As part of the project, an online platform has been developed, providing information to support climate adaptation plans in cities and providing different simulations of possible flooding scenarios. These scenarios provide an excellent basis for collaboration among all actors involved in urban planning and flood management, such as public authorities, engineers, civil protection agencies and insurance companies. These actors can use SaferPlaces’ results to identify the best risk reduction and climate adaptation strategies, but also to calculate the economic benefits of different mitigation options. The SaferPlaces platform is currently operational for four pilot case studies: Rimini and Milan (Italy), Pamplona (Spain) and Cologne (Germany). To date, most of the project’s activities have been focused on Rimini, a city potentially exposed to coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and increasingly intense storm events, and home to the largest urban regeneration project in Italy, called ‘Parco del Mare’, or Sea Park. The Rimini Sea Park ‘Parco del Mare’ aims to improve the environmental and landscape conditions of the seafront promenade in the area of south Rimini Sud. In addition, it increases the resilience of the entire community in the face of climate change, providing protection against torrential rains and sea intrusion. ’Parco del Mare’ is considered a Nature-Based Solution, a concept used by the European Commission to define all those interventions inspired by nature, which provide environmental, social and economic benefits and at the same time help to increase urban resilience to climate change. The SaferPlaces platform carried out a detailed analysis of the potential damage associated with different scenarios of coastal storm flooding, torrential rains, or exceptionally high sea level. The effect of the sea park as a tool for the prevention and mitigation of flood damage was also evaluated. After evaluating the cost-benefit ratio of Rimini’s ‘Parco del Mare’, the amount saved with this adaptation far exceeds the expected investment. The sea park is therefore efficient and economically sustainable, which in addition to the regeneration and aesthetic improvement of the new sea promenade, will protect the entire city from future flooding generated by climate change. The SaferPlaces team is hoping to expand to two other pilot case cities, Pamplona and Cologne. The potential of this climate service is enormous for the many countries and cities around the world that are increasingly threatened by the danger of flooding. Given the success SaferPlaces have seen, combining climate scenarios with urban mapping, risk assessment and economic impact modelling has great potential to be extended to other types of climate risks, such as heatwaves in the future.

In addition, the Strategy for Sustainable and Smart Mobility promoted by the European Union to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050 will be addressed. Visit EIT Urban Mobility Virtual Summit 2020  EIT Urban Mobility is a European knowledge and innovation community consisting of over 150 leading companies, cities, universities and research centres. The community, supported by the EU´s European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), started in January 2019 and 2020 has been its first year of operations, during which it has financed a total of 76 international projects and supported 61 start-ups, with an investment of over EUR 27 million. Nearly EUR 5 million have been allocated to fund 11 innovation projects as part of the exceptional COVID-19 Crisis Response call to address urban mobility challenges posed by the pandemic. As part of EIT’s Crisis Response Initiative, these projects directly contribute to the European Union’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the projects are CDClean, a disinfectant to eliminate COVID-19 which is currently being tested in the Barcelona metro and bus network. This is an initiative promoted by Ferrovial, global operator of sustainable infrastructure, and could be applied in airports, bus, metro and railway stations throughout Europe as of January 2021. Another notable project is InclusivEBike, through which safe electric bicycles are being developed and tested for vulnerable people to avoid risks related to COVID-19 in public transport. The bikes are being tested in Bilbao (Spain) and Bergamo (Italy).  In Milan, Europe´s first large-scale shared taxi service to supplement the city´s public transport and address the impacts of COVID-19 is being rolled out through CITY RESTARTS.  This initiative strives to increase access to safe and affordable public transportation, provide additional income for taxi drivers, mitigate the increased usage of single occupancy private vehicles, and thus reduce the overall environmental impact of the mobility system.   Among the initiatives related to COVID-19 is also FutureMob, a project led by the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (AMB), and also implemented in Hungary, which aims to contribute to the improvement of air quality in cities through active mobility and guiding citizens in taking COVID-19-safe mobility decisions using a gamification approach. Through an online application, citizens are informed about current challenges related to health, teleworking and shopping locally, advising them at the same time about possible clean and active means of transport they can use and guiding them with taking COVID-19-safe mobility decisions.  Looking ahead to next year, Maria Tsavachidis, CEO of EIT Urban Mobility is clear that It will be crucial to maintain the momentum and support cities in their transition towards green and affordable mobility and liveable places for all, in addition to taking into account that the transition towards sustainable mobility and liveable places must be inclusive and affordable. This has been an exceptional and financially very challenging year for many of our partners but the pandemic has accelerated the development of EIT Urban Mobility as an organisation and as a community. To recover from COVID-19, cities more than ever need support from the ecosystem around them. We have doubled the number of partners year-on year from 2019 to 2021 and we will be engaging 230 partners from 26 countries by next year. We are diversifying our city base, adding smaller and medium sized cities, such as Debrecen and Saint Germain-En-Laye, which now account for almost 40%. Maria Tsavachidis, CEO of EIT Urban Mobility Representatives from Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Serbia and Slovenia, which have recently joined EIT Urban Mobility through the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS), will also participate at the Summit. EIT Urban Mobility’s Regional Innovation Scheme is designed to boost the ability of countries classified as modest or moderate innovators by the European Innovation Scoreboard to enhance the local innovation ecosystem to support innovation in urban mobility by sharing good practice and expertise. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three different channels are available: Discover EIT Urban Mobility Academy By releasing its first MOOC ‘Designing the cycling city’, co-developed with HumanKind, Competence Hub put the spotlight on sustainable urban planning and on tactical urbanism. This course is directed by Lior Steinberg and George Liu, two strong cycling activists and recognised academics. It provides insightful knowledge on how to design cities to be more cycling friendly. This five-week course explores the best practices in bicycle infrastructure design and how to bring these elements to your own city and home context. It also includes a final design project that enables participants to develop a plan for transforming the street of their choice. Register for the course The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly driven change in cities for more sustainable means of urban mobility. In collaboration with RMIT University, the EIT Urban Mobility WebTV has travelled to London, Barcelona and Milan to discover three agile approaches to tackle the COVID-19 challenge. These initiatives provide interesting examples of how tactical urbanism, the use of low cost, short term, and scalable solutions to initiate long term changes in cities, has been successfully used by cities over the past few months. The Barcelona Superblocks are also another good example of tactical urbanism. In a series of five videos, Salvador Rueda, one of the founding fathers of the Superblock concept, explains what these traffic-free neighborhoods are about and what they can achieve. This ambitious model has inspired many cities around Europe, such as Brussels. The Minister of Brussels-Capital Region in charge of Mobility, Public Works and Road Safety, Elke Van den Brandt, explains how the ‘Good Move’ project is transforming mobility in Brussels. In Stockholm, the ‘Future Streets’ project enabled the temporary redesign of three streets close to schools to give more space back to people. Interviewed for the WebTV, Dan Hill, Director of strategic design at Vinnova and Tobias Nordström, CEO and Urban Planner at Spacescape, explain how the project also included the children of the schools at an early stage in the design process.

Over 74 students are currently enrolled in the Master programme and 100 students have completed the PhD which focuses on innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and leadership. Students who have successfully passed an EIT-labelled educational programme will be provided with the skillset to create a real impact in business and address major food system challenges. From January 2021, recruitment is open for the next cohort of entrepreneurs set to develop cutting edge solutions to societal problems. Interested participants can find out more via the EIT Food website. Both programmes are supported by over 15 leading European universities which support a diverse network of Pan-European students. Discover more about the EIT Food Education Programmes This major achievement demonstrates the commitment of EIT Food Education and their Partner Network to develop and implement highly innovative, relevant programmes to nurture top talent that will drive positive impact throughout the food system. The EIT Label clearly signals to employers that the graduates from the programme are equipped to act as innovators and respond to societal challenges. They have the entrepreneurial and technical skills to imagine and drive innovations towards a world where everybody can access and enjoy sustainable, safe, and healthy food, with trust and fairness from farm to fork. We are already welcoming the EIT Label Review for next year and are hoping this is only the starting point of having our other programmes awarded the EIT Label too. Dr Maarten van der Kamp - Director of Education at EIT Food The Programme ‘Master in Food Systems’ (MFS), developed by six participating universities, is an integrated graduate degree programme organised by academic institutions and industrial partners from across the EIT Food partner network. Its goal is to prepare students to drive a future transformation of the food system. The MFS programme promotes a deep knowledge of the food system as an integrated value chain by providing students with the opportunity to study consecutively at three academic institutions which provide distinctly different semester blocks, each one of them focusing on specific areas of the food system. This is coupled with partner-mentored activities and thesis work jointly offered by pan-European industrial partners. Currently, six universities are participating, which include: University of Madrid, Queen's University of Belfast, University of Warsaw, University of Reading, University of Turin and University of Hohenheim. I consider the network one of the biggest advantages of the programme and I plan to continue to make use of it long after I graduate. The Master also made me realise that it’s a huge advantage to gain knowledge across many fields, rather than being a specialist in only one area. The course gave me the ability to look at things from a different, broader perspective and allowed me to assume the position of ‘dot-connector’ - so finding relationships between stakeholders and between seemingly unrelated things to better solve problems. Rieke Sproten - Belgian student in the Master of Food Systems Programme The Global Food Venture Programme supports highly qualified PhD students from across Europe to transform their research into a viable business in the Food and AgTech space. The programme fosters the entrepreneurial growth of doctoral students working on challenges in the Agrifood sector. Young innovators gain essential business creation skills and knowledge through a bespoke six-month curriculum of training bootcamps, mentoring, corporate site visits, global networking events and pitch competitions. In this period, they are supported by top coaches and technology experts from EIT Food partners and have the unique chance to explore key innovation ecosystems in Europe. Currently, the following partners are involved in this course: Autonomous University of Madrid, IMDEA Food Institute Madrid, Queen's University of Belfast, University of Warsaw, Aarhus University Denmark, EPFL Swiss Polytechnic Federal School, ETH Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich, University of Leuven, Technical University of München and Technion Israel Institute of Technology  The Global Food Venture Programme was an amazing experience from the beginning; coaching helped me through all the steps. The Programme improved my entrepreneurial mindset, and my project had an organic evolution.

One of the most promising joint projects has received a comprehensive grant from EIT RawMaterials to continue the work of reducing energy and resource use in the global mining industry. The innovation relates to flotation process technology and holds good potential when it comes to reducing energy and water use in this part of the mining flowsheet. Flotation is a key, water-intensive area in mining where valuable minerals are separated from other materials. For FLSmidth, a key player in the joint project, this is part of the MissionZero journey that will enable the mining industry to move towards zero water and energy waste by 2030. The new flotation process is called RFC – Reflux Flotation Cell. The RFC technology has potential across various commodities and flotation applications. The opportunity presented by the EUR 5.4 million grant will accelerate the commercialisation of the technology. It will also allow for further development and optimisation of the RFC, hopefully expanding the energy and water saving potential of flotation solutions. Manfred Schaffer - President of Mining at FLSmidth The consortium behind the project is led by FLSmidth and includes two mine sites, KGHM Polska Miedz Spólka Akcyjna in Poland and Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) in Sweden; two universities, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Helmholtz Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf University; the Swedish Environmental Research Institute and several external advisors. The University of Newcastle in Australia and Professor Kevin Galvin, will act as external advisors. To Manfred Schaffer, President of Mining at FLSmidth, the project proves the deep value of the global companies joining forces with customers and academic institutions alike to find new and more sustainable paths forward for the mining industry. We each have our strength, experiences and competences working within mining. A project like this shows the benefit of us all joining forces and combining competences to break new ground in mining technology. I firmly believe that the solutions to the environmental challenges we are all facing must come from technology. I am delighted that we, together with our partners, can deliver a solution that helps in achieving this goal. Manfred Schaffer - President of Mining at FLSmidth A total of EUR 5.4 million was awarded (EUR 2.8 million to FLSmidth) by EIT RawMaterials, the largest consortium in the raw materials sector worldwide, through a competitive application process.

Find out more and register About 1 500 participants had already registered by the beginning of the event, said Alexander von Gabain, EIT Health Supervisory Board Chair, in remarks to open the Summit Series on 24 November 2020. He took the opportunity to reflect on EIT Health’s growth in the last five years, and its current direction, which he noted is aligned with the mission of Horizon Europe. It is now time for strategic integration and consolidation to set the right impact by transforming healthcare systems, and to utilise the entire network which we have available in Europe. Alexander von Gabain - EIT Health Supervisory Board Chair Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health, shared his thoughts on the challenges and opportunities facing EIT Health as a network of healthcare innovators. As COVID 19 is painfully showing us again, population health is the very backbone of our society, of social cohesion and, ultimately, economic prosperity. So, of course COVID has tested our health systems, but it has also sparked digital innovation and, maybe most importantly, transformative thinking, showing us what’s truly possible when we collaborate. Jan-Philipp Beck - CEO of EIT Health All sessions in the EIT Health Summit Series are recorded, so if you miss anything, you can watch it online. The panel topic for the opening day was Implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare: Success Beyond the Buzzword, which was moderated by EIT Health’s director of innovation, Jorge Juan Fernández. He noted that EIT Health’s extensive work with activities that involve AI encouraged research and discussions, as well as the publication of EIT Health’s report on ‘Transforming Healthcare with AI’. Panellists Dr Bertalan Meskó and Dr John Halamka agreed that AI will not replace clinicians but rather those clinicians who use AI will replace those who do not. Dr Meskó, director of The Futurist Institute, maintained that AI will relieve administrative burdens, allowing medical professionals to spend more time focused on patients. Dr Halamka, president of the Mayo Clinic Platform, noted that by analysing raw data from patient monitors in the home, AI enables remote medicine. It delivers the same quality and the same outcomes at a lower cost in non-traditional settings. By 2030, the Mayo Clinic will see a significant expansion in the amount of care delivered at a distance in non-traditional settings, and we will train the next generations of professionals to do this.

eit450,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-rawmaterials-supports-promising-innovation-projects-businesses-recycling,EIT RawMaterials supports the most promising innovation projects and new businesses on recycling,"Raw materials are essential to securing the transition to green energy technologies, growth and sustainable consumption. Hence, the European Green Deal recognises access to resources as a strategic security question to fulfil its ambition. Considering the materials needs of a growing world population, recycling will have to evolve from a side stream to a major pillar of raw materials supply. Currently, recycling rates of some base metals are higher than 50%. However, many crucial elements are almost completely lost in the value chain. This is particularly the case for Critical Raw Materials, where many of them have recycling rates below 1% and production from primary resources often comes with large environmental footprints and socio-economic issues. EIT RawMaterials fosters the shift from linear to circular economy. Raw, processed and advanced materials, from primary and secondary sources, are the backbone of Europe’s economy. Bernd Schäfer - CEO of EIT RawMaterials EIT RawMaterials supports projects and new businesses that scale up and introduce new technological solutions on recycling and circularity. These are aimed at driving the process of transformation, improving both the amount and quality of raw materials recovered from end-of-life products, industrial residues, tailings, and urban and landfill mining, while addressing sustainability and decarbonisation. Supported and currently ongoing projects in this area include: The European industrial ecosystems have a great potential to build on and to further develop disruptive solutions, which are addressing the Circular Economy needs. However, the European Union’s economy still loses a significant amount of raw materials due to lacking recycling capacities as well as transportation and transaction inefficiencies. In addition, current waste streams are confronted with inadequate collection systems and sub-optimal sorting and recycling performance. End-of-life products must be considered as a resource for another cycle, while losses and stocks of unused materials must be minimised and valorised along the value chain as well as from a design perspective. Bernd Schäfer -CEO of EIT RawMaterials EIT RawMaterials carries out different activities to accelerate innovation in new technologies and to promote developments that support the raw materials industry. EIT RawMaterials’ work is based on partnerships between industry, research institutes and universities, and is built on three pillars: acceleration, matchmaking and networking, and the RawMaterials academy.

The competition is designed for entrepreneurs and early stage agri-food start-ups who can help transform our food system, making it healthier, more sustainable, and more trusted. On November 10, the Innovation Prizes competition concluded with the Grand Final in which 17 finalists competed for the prizes of  EUR 10 000, EUR 15 000, and EUR 25 000. The Final was judged by a panel comprised of top agri-food experts and investors: Thomas van den Boezem, Business Creation and Investment Manager at EIT Food, George Coelho, Partner and co-founder at Astanor Ventures, Marcin Czarnecki, FMCG Food industry expert, and Michela Petronio, Vice President at Blu1877. The jury had an extremely difficult task of choosing three winners among 17 excellent finalists. Here are three innovative companies who, in the jury's opinion, develop the most promising and impactful solutions for the food system: SoluBlue is an innovative food packaging material that extends shelf life and is also fully biodegradable. Additionally, in SoluBlue packaging, food does not rot but gradually dries over months, providing a second life for fresh food in cooking, or as animal feed. The packaging is also home compostable, biodegrading as quickly as the food it contains. SoluBlue’s next step is to conduct market tests with food producers and retailers on extending shelf life and compostable aspects of their solution. Microbe Plus company developed a bioproduct that protects plants from pathogens and at the same time stimulates its growth. It is an activator for plants. The multi-strain combination of beneficial microbes significantly improves plant health. Microbe Plus offers tailor-made biological solutions designed to minimise losses in key crops caused by the presence of pathogens and maximise farms profitability. Thanks to their eco-friendly bioproduct, farmers can decrease the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers. Microbe Plus goal is to offer farmers safe, environmentally friendly, and affordable bioproducts for plant protection. Thanks to that farmers can provide safe and nutritious high-quality food to consumers. For the next season Microbe Plus is planning field experiments on major crops in order to optimise their bioproduct. Thermosolar Hive is a unique beehive and therapy device utilising sunshine to solve the biggest honeybee problem. Beekeepers can stop using chemical treatment and produce honey without residues. Moreover, the hive supports the colony, colonies become stronger and this significantly increase honey production. What is next for Thermosolar Hive?

eit454,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/european-raw-materials-alliance-presents-implementation-steps-secure-raw-materials,European Raw Materials Alliance presents implementation steps to secure raw materials supply,"An impressive number of over 300 partners from industry, research, government institutions and civil society came together to discuss how Europe’s raw materials supply can be secured to enable the EU’s green and digital transition. The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) will focus on increasing the EU’s resilience along particularly critical value chains. ERMA plans to employ an agile process to swiftly examine and approve concrete investment projects, backed up with suitable EU financing. Without reliable and sustainable access to raw materials, the Green Deal and the EU’s competitiveness are at stake. ERMA's most important task is to secure raw materials supply in Europe by identifying investment opportunities for sustainable and socially responsible access to raw materials in Europe from primary and secondary sources.  Bernd Schäfer - CEO of EIT RawMaterials, in charge of the European Raw Materials Alliance At the kick-off meeting, an investment process coordinated by EIT RawMaterials was presented as well as an investment update, where a current status of 23 investment cases have already been given priority. Those cases could reach a significant volume of up to EUR 10 billion, covering rare earth/magnets, raw materials for energy storage and conversion and others for materials contributing to other industrial value chains, in more than 14 European countries. ERMA partners are invited to submit potential investment projects to strengthen domestic sourcing and improve the supply of secondary raw materials through resource efficiency and circular economy. The alliance focuses on the first step on rare earth for magnets and motors as well as advanced materials for energy storage and conversion while addressing the potential of other base metal activities. Rare earths are indispensable to most industrial ecosystems in the EU, including renewable energy, defence, and space. Although once discovered and commercialised by European scientists and engineers, their production is currently almost entirely dominated by China, with a market share of 80-100% depending on the sector. ERMA aims to strengthen the domestic supply chain for rare earths and permanent magnets. Possible investment cases include brown- and greenfield mining addressing various aspects of the circular economy including recycling, processing, and product design. The success of the European energy transition is based on the availability of solar and fuel cells or batteries. However, these green technologies are currently heavily dependent on imports of high-purity advanced materials. ERMA, therefore, supports the domestic production of, for example, ore concentrates and primary and secondary cell-grade energy storage materials. This way, gaps in the battery value chain in Europe can be closed. Concrete investment scenarios range from greenfield mining to processing and refining to provide input material for battery, solar and fuel cell production. Since the presentation of the EU Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials and the launch event in September, ERMA has attracted a growing number of public and private sector stakeholders. Speakers at the kick-off meeting included Thierry Breton (EU Commissioner for Internal Market) and Maroš Šefčovič (Vice-President of the European Commission), and industry representative.

This year’s edition of Climathon will be hosted completely online and will be made up of 100 ideathon events lasting from eight to 72 hours happening simultaneously across five continents. Many of the teams are determined to bring to life ideas that can contribute to a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In Zurich, Switzerland, for instance, teams will try to answer the question ‘In the context of COVID, what can we do tomorrow?’. Whereas in Cali, the most populous city in southwest Colombia, participants will create concepts on how to better manage the waste generated by COVID-19 such as gloves, face masks and eye protection. Cities and their citizens are already experiencing the devastating and damaging effects of climate change. As centres of scientific, technological, cultural and social identity and innovation, cities are also the places and spaces where opportunities for creating change can have the greatest impact. Climathon is designed to empower citizens to make a change in their own cities. By offering people a platform where they can come together in their own community to put forward innovative ideas to local decision-makers, Climathon provides citizens with an opportunity to design the future. Climathon 2020 will once again bring together extraordinary and courageous minds, determined to make change happen, and I’m really looking forward to seeing the ideas that emerge from this collaboration. Kirsten Dunlop - CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Since the first Climathon, which took place in the run-up to the historic COP21 negotiations in Paris in 2015, the event has grown to be the world’s biggest international climate change ideathon.

Learn more about aescuvest According to the World Health Organisation, there are around 60 million people with diabetes in Europe and, if their condition is not managed correctly, sufferers are likely to become progressively ill, affecting their quality of life. Over time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves. Emperra GmbH E-Health Technologies has developed the ESYSTA digital health technology which aims to support patients in recoding their blood glucose values and adhering to their treatment plans. We combine all the important tools for recording, monitoring and evaluating diabetes treatment and to make them digitally available to patients and doctors using wireless connectivity. Nevertheless, the technology is very easy to use, which was especially important to us with regard to older patients. Following initial success with institutional investors, Emperra is taking part in a public financing round on EIT Health-supported aescuvest.eu, which specialises in the healthcare sector. The crowdfunding platform, which was launched jointly by EIT Health and aescuvest in August 2019 with a campaign for Surge-on-Medical, marked the start of a new means of public venture funding in Europe.

The programme aims to help a cohort of cities across Europe, including Madrid, accelerate their transitions towards carbon neutrality and climate resilience. Find out more about EIT Climate-KIC's Deep Demonstration projects In 2020, EIT Climate KIC and EIT Digital joined efforts in Madrid city to enhance its Healthy, Clean Cities collection of connected innovative products and services (or portfolio of experiments) with digital support. With the assistance of the Centre of Technology Innovation for Development of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (ITD-UPM), the City Council of Madrid is working closely with EIT Climate KIC to design and implement a portfolio aimed at accelerating the city’s transformation towards carbon neutrality by 2030. This cross-KIC activity is working with Madrid, Amsterdam and Leuven, three cities selected for prototyping the city functions and services necessary for an adaptive and resilient future. The activity addresses fundamental issues of citizen engagement and governance and aims to establish a framework to incorporate key elements for transition, which will enable cities to properly asses and understand the ecological and human value in cities, encompassing issues such as time value, health value, cultural value and social cohesion. In close collaboration with 'challenge owners' (the mayors, community leaders and other stakeholders involved in the Deep Demonstrations), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are focusing their efforts on City Data Space, which are cloud data and service marketplaces that allow for acquiring, storing, and publishing data. The uniqueness of City Data Spaces is that it brings together public, private, and social data on key decarbonisation activities, which is crucial not only to ensure better resource use and less emissions, but also to strive for sustainability through smarter urban transport networks, upgraded water supply and waste disposal facilities, and more efficient ways to light and heat buildings. The KICs issued a joint call for proposals last June for the design and implementation of City Data Spaces for Madrid, including the following aspects: Four projects were selected for the quality and relevance of their proposals. Those projects are: On 21 September, EIT Climate-KIC and EIT Digital held a kick-off meeting of the selected Madrid City Data Spaces projects. The meeting gathered representatives of the KICs, the City Council of Madrid, the ITD-UPM and the project partners. The four projects will work in a coordinated manner over the next months to explore synergies and maximise efforts towards their common goal of providing Madrid City Council with the necessary data to develop and support their portfolio of experiments within the Healthy, Clean Cities Deep Demonstration and contribute to their current sustainability and climate strategies. Madrid City Council will work closely with the four projects, as well as with EIT Climate-KIC and EIT Digital to ensure the projects’ development is aligned with Madrid City Council expectations and needs.

The 19 start-ups hail from 10 European countries and will use the funds to further develop their solutions addressing health challenges such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The strong results come following concern that the COVID-19 pandemic would severely impact investment in start-ups, leading to cash flow challenges. Recognising the risk to young companies, EIT Health injected EUR 5.5 million in May 2020 into 11 European start-ups to alleviate the financial shock posed by COVID-19 in its Start-up Rescue Instrument. After a challenging spring when health care investors were focused on the operative and thus financial impact of COVID-19 on existing portfolio companies, the investment landscape has improved considerably since summer and new financing rounds are being closed again. I’ve been privileged to participate in the EIT Health community and in investment rounds of start-ups from its network, including Tubulis GmbH, and have seen the positive impact of EIT Health first-hand. Valentin Piëch - Managing Director at VP Venture Partners The start-ups reporting funding of over EUR one million in quarter three include: It is always fantastic to see start-ups go on to attract external fundraising rounds following our support – this is the ultimate goal for us at EIT Health as we focus on developing and maturing promising start-ups and making them attractive to commercial investors so that they can continue to grow and flourish.

The EIT Jumpstarter is an award-winning entrepreneurial training programme designed to support teams in commercialising their innovative technological ideas. EIT Jumpstarter participants were enthusiastic to collaborate with EIT Manufacturing in solving a multitude of manufacturing challenges while creating viable business models. Over a duration of five months, teams participated in the EIT Manufacturing RIS online Bootcamp, presented their ideas to experts and peers in a pitch day, and received targeted advice and mentoring in local training. Participating teams prioritised, tested, and validated critical business assumptions, and received expert advice on immersing in their local start-up ecosystems and approaching suitable incubators. The three local training organised by EIT Manufacturing RIS took place by INESC TEC in Porto (PT), University of Tartu (ET) and Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (SK). In total, the EIT Innovation Communities organised 18 local training in locations throughout Europe.      The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) within the context of its Regional Innovation Scheme (EIT RIS), selected more than one hundred teams to participate in this year’s EIT Jumpstarter, an award-winning entrepreneurial training programme designed to support teams in commercialising their innovative technological ideas. In the context of the EIT Jumpstarter, every year, Knowledge and Innovation Communities of the EIT (EIT KICs) join forces to support teams and their innovative and promising ideas with a greater focus on the ones coming from EIT RIS countries, modest or moderate innovating European countries.

eit470,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-launched-new-online-magazine-branch,"EIT Climate-KIC launched the new online magazine, 'Branch'","A mix of longer-form writing, short profile pieces and artwork, Branch explores the potential for the internet to become a more just, inclusive and sustainable space. The magazine is the result of a collaboration between EIT Climate-KIC, Mozilla Foundation and online community Climate Action.tech. Creating change requires all kinds of practices, art and design, professional development, civic participation, policy and advocacy, imagination and positive visions for our future. This magazine is our small attempt to gather what inspires and challenges us and to publish that in the open. Michelle Thorne - Branch Managing Editor and contributor, Senior Program Officer at Mozilla Foundation According to Nature, even before we pivoted to our screens so fully in 2020, uptake, information and communications systems accounted for two per cent of the world’s carbon emissions. The authors point to the music video for the hit song ‘Despacito’ by Luis Fonsi feat. Daddy Yankee, which has five billion views on YouTube, and argue that to generate this kind of energy would take either 850 000 barrels of oil or 93 wind turbines running for an entire year. In the first quarter of 2020, Facebook reportedly removed 2.2 billion fake accounts, with each active profile estimated to account for 281 grams of CO2 – the same carbon footprint as a medium latte. And in 2019, the average user living in Europe scrolled the equivalent of 180 meters a day, exposing themselves on average to 1 700 carbon intensive - but ultimately ineffective - banner ads per month.  In an effort to interrogate and understand the climate impact of technology better, the team behind Branch invited 25 people to share their vision for an internet that is instead a positive force for climate action. Contributors range from developers and designers to activists and artists, and content varies from advice on direct action to green daily professional practise to more profound systemic approaches to dismantling power structures and making a just, clean internet a reality. For deeper change to happen, internet professionals must understand the underlying structural issues of the climate crisis and its inequalities. We must go beyond tech solutionism and towards intersectional climate justice work. Going forward we see the need to further develop interdisciplinary practices and tools for greening the internet. We strive to connect sustainability to root causes and inequalities experienced at different intersections - gender, race, class, ability, and so on. Chris Adams - Branch Editor, from Climate Action.tech In making the magazine, the team was careful to ensure the online proposition lived up to the ideals of a sustainable internet, following a GOLD framework - Green, Open, Lean and Distributed - inspired by more mainstream accessibility principles in web design. We know that technology isn’t neutral, so we set out to embed the values of a more sustainable, just internet into our own website design and development. The digital realm, and the internet in particular, can be a silent killer for the environment. It can feel sustainable because the damage is less visible and graspable, but oftentimes the opposite is true. However, with Branch we are motivated by joyfulness instead of fear, and we’re using aesthetics as an entry point towards systemic change through a sustainable and just internet.

Held in Israel, Spain, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, and the UK, the EIT FAN aims to make Europe the go-to innovation hub for the world’s most promising agrifood start-ups by sparking start-up corporate partnerships. The fourteen finalists were selected from a group of 60 agrifood technology start-ups participating in the 2020 EIT FAN programme. The finalists were selected by an experienced panel of investors, industry experts and entrepreneurs based on their positive impact on our food system as well as their economic viability. The selected finalists offer solutions to various challenges inherent in our food system today. More specifically, the selected start-ups are focusing on functional foods and health, alternative proteins, sustainable agriculture, and harnessing side streams. The selected finalists clearly demonstrate that transforming our food system in a positive way and one that is economic viability are complementing each other and not contradicting. Christoph Mandl - EIT Food Accelerator Manager Over a four-month acceleration period, these start-ups, selected from a record number of applications, have had access to tools, connections, mentors and expertise to help them succeed. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme was held mostly online. We all miss social interactions and face to face conversations which you would normally find at our accelerator events. But at the same time, we experienced that delivering the programme online lead to more targeted interactions, thereby allowing start-ups to form close ties with relevant actors in the European and global agrifood space. Christoph Mandl - EIT Food Accelerator Manager Start-ups have faced an increased level of uncertainty and market volatility during COVID-19. At EIT Food, we believe that innovation holds the key to fixing our food system so that it is healthier and more sustainable for all.

These developments have confirmed our vision to bring healthcare into people's homes, augment traditional medical care outside the bricks-and-mortar clinical setting, and empower patients to take control of their own health. Our new investors bring tremendous value to the table, supporting our continued growth in Europe, and helping Sidekick to continue to expand its operations in the US. Dr. Tryggvi Thorgeirsson - Sidekick CEO and Co-Founder Sidekick will use the proceeds for validation and development into new therapeutic areas, as well as to drive product development forward to increase its lead in patient engagement and retention, and to further position itself as the preferred provider to expand pharmacotherapies. The company will also focus on continuing to improve health outcomes with other healthcare stakeholders. Sidekick was identified by EIT Digital through its flagship pan-European competition for deep tech scale-ups in the digital space, the EIT Digital Challenge, and was among the 10 winners in the 2019 edition of the contest. As part of the prize, Sidekick joined the EIT Digital Accelerator to support its international growth.  Since January 2020, Sidekick has been actively supported by the EIT Digital Accelerator's fundraising experts in launching and coordinating this round, which generated extremely strong interest from multiple international investors very early on in the process and which was reinforced by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

	Here is a short summary  of the most interesting take-aways from the day. Cycling has had a new boost in COVID-19 times as public transport ridership has dipped. How can we take advantage of this and keep up high levels of cycling in the future? This coupled with more new results on the high socio-economic benefits of cycling projects (11% internal rate of return. New study 8-11%, up to 25-28% IRR with new health benefit values) makes it the ideal time to take the conversation forward and continue supporting cycling as a serious mode of transport in cities. Jeppe Rich, Professor at DTU Management, has in the following days been quoted in the Danish media with these interesting findings regarding socio-economic benefits, that might increase the political willingness to invest in bike related infrastructure even more. Behavioural change is hard, and any measures for behavioural change need to be adapted to the local circumstances. This was once again reiterated in this session. For those of us working in mobility, we need to understand how we make the “good” choice the easy choice. Open and local co-working space in the suburbs of Stockholm has proven to be very popular as an intermediate between working from home and commuting to workplace. Is this the beginning of the re-vitalisation of suburban areas? More than half of our time (up to 70%) in public transport trips is used on walking or waiting, and 80% of impression is visual. Therefore, increasing focus on building nice surroundings influence how time is perceived​. Things are moving fast in the field of electromobility. Electric roads, Vehicle to Grid, electric buses and trucks are no longer future technology but are here today. Now the issues are how to scale, while adapting advances in technology and plan and manage a large-scale electric vehicle introduction. We are a long way to electrified transport today with only 5% of fleet electric. Autonomous driving has the last decade or two been 2-5 years away, and most likely still is also a decade from now. Technology is still far from being ready. But nevertheless – get prepared. Mobility labs as way for cities to promote and enable future mobilities. ​ COVID-19 has caused a dramatic change to traffic patterns, with congestion levels still significantly and consistently below pre-COVID levels across the world. However too early to tell if this will be the 'end of traditional working hours'. Keep reading here The whole event was recorded, discover the outcomes here",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit476,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-digital-interview-eit-digitals-chief-innovation-officer-chahab-nastar,"EIT Digital: interview with EIT Digital’s Chief Innovation Officer, Chahab Nastar","Bringing innovations quickly out of the labs and into the market is a critical element to remain competitive. EIT Digital is convinced that venture creation and scaling is the right answer to such rapid innovation cycles, because it takes the agility, commitment, and focus of entrepreneurial minds to manage the high pace of innovation. At EIT Digital, we support venture creation through two main instruments. The first one, our Innovation Factory, brings together organisations from all over Europe to launch deep tech ventures as the vehicle of their innovation. The second instrument is the Venture Programme. It supports teams of entrepreneurs from the so-called RIS countries to launch their Minimum Viable Product and establish a venture in record time. In both instruments, EIT Digital provides matchmaking, incubation, and financial support. In return, EIT Digital holds equity in the created ventures, contributing to our sustainability strategy. One example for the Innovation Factory is the SARA Social Robot. This robot helps care institutions and hospitals to improve care recipients' quality of life and provides support to alleviate caregiver-staffing shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic led to visit restrictions for families and friends of care recipients and SARA was able to serve as a communication link in these difficult months.  Other examples include LMAD, who operates autonomous last-mile delivery robots, and PeasyPay, a payment system based on biometric identification. Recently we announced the outstanding results of the 2020 Venture Programme. Among the 28 start-ups launched, Polish payment start-up Restpay stands out with a Business Angel investment received directly at the end of the programme. The eHealth start-up Amygdala from Bosnia and Herzegovina is another success story that will continue its growth as part of the H+ Innovation Programme implemented by the InsurTech Hub Munich (ITHM) and the Medical Valley Digital Health Application Centre. We have indeed. One example is the application of physical tokens for COVID-19 contact tracing. We are currently running four pilots in different settings across Europe: in the Nordics, in the UK, in Benelux and in Italy, with deployments planned by the end of the year. Another great example is a 3D printed remote monitoring device that can measure vital signs of corona patients. The device enables nurses to safely monitor multiple patients at the same time. This innovation was developed by a group of EIT Digital Master School students, who won the EU-run hackathon, joined up with EIT Digital partners, and now receive our support to develop their Minimum Viable Product to hit the market. The saying goes that ‘In every crisis lies an opportunity’. That is especially true for tech ventures in the current crisis, because digital is at the heart of the 'new normal' – work from home, Software as a Service, or remote monitoring and maintenance, to name a few examples. The new normal calls for new innovations and new champions to emerge. Our Accelerator is there to support them in a hands-on way. While these days it has become harder for individual scale-ups to meet the right international customers and investors, that is precisely what our Accelerator team makes happen, thanks to a distributed team of business developers and fundraising experts and their pan European network of customers and VCs.  Examples of scale-ups that have joined us recently include MIPU, an AI technology for the digital industry, or Flynex, a drone platform for industrial surveillance. This week, we also communicated about the success of CashDirector, an AI-enabled Digital CFO for SMEs. The outcome of our 2020 EIT Digital Challenge scale-up competition is another indicator for the unbroken interest in our support. The record-breaking number of 403 scale-up applications is a clear sign that digital entrepreneurs are working hard and are seeking support also – and especially – in times of a pandemic. I am looking forward to the final event on November 12, where the top 20 scale-ups will be showcased. Discover more about EIT Digital",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new collective is based on the idea that climate change can best be tackled if different groups from one city or region join forces to find solutions to their specific problems. Clyde Rebuilt was formed by Climate Ready Clyde, an existing group of 15 local organisations, and EIT Climate-KIC, the EU’s climate innovation agency, that specialises, among other things, in identifying innovations to help regions both slow down climate change and deal with it. Clyde Rebuilt will give organisations across the Glasgow City Region a process in which they can voice their ideas, test those ideas and see whether they will work at a scale that can make a big difference. We intend to move from gradually improving our climate resilience to making larger shifts more quickly. James Curran - Chair of Climate Ready Clyde That means switching focus from stand-alone projects like concrete flood walls to more systemic solutions that might couple river restoration with wetland creation, flood forecasting and warning systems, and new insurance mechanisms. Regions are a bridge between the local and national, so let’s start here. Ellie Tonks, Project Lead at EIT Climate-KIC The project is co-funded by Climate Ready Clyde and EIT Climate-KIC, and managed by Sniffer, a Scottish sustainability charity, with climate-and-culture experts at Creative Carbon Scotland and climate-change finance experts at Paul Watkiss Associates. Clyde Rebuilt is part of EIT Climate-KIC’s ‘Resilient Regions’, a programme that aims to help representatives from affected regions in Europe come up with concrete and connected projects to prepare for, recover from, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In Glasgow City Region, Climate Ready Clyde and EIT Climate-KIC are now identifying a first set of projects, scheduled between 2021 and 2023, and are planning to use the success of this approach to attract support to extend the programme to 2030. The next decade of innovative projects will help support a ‘green recovery’ by building a more resilient economy and society, creating a flourishing Glasgow City Region with benefits in increased health, equality and income for its citizens. Clyde Rebuilt will have the potential to make a significant contribution to the Scottish Government’s Second Climate Change Adaptation Programme – even more crucial now that the world is aiming for a green recovery after COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented global crisis which has fundamentally changed every aspect of our lives, but the climate emergency has not gone away and must be central to our recovery from this difficult time. We will only meet our climate goals by bringing together the talent that we have and by working together, and this exciting development by Climate Ready Clyde puts the Glasgow City Region in a great position to help lead Scotland’s fight against climate change, and will contribute to our wider ambitions for the Clyde corridor, reflected in the ‘Clyde Mission’ approach being developed across Scottish Government and partners.

This Cross-KIC workshop organised by EIT Urban Mobility (Innovation Hub North), EIT Food and with the participation of EIT Climate-KIC and EIT Health, spent two sessions in September 2020 thinking of the future of sustainable logistics and food supply, and what role the EIT’s Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KIC) might have in shaping this.   The workshop was held as a side event of the La Futura conference.  The starting point was understanding the direction for EIT Urban Mobility and EIT Food for the timeframe 2030. We at EIT Urban Mobility are working on our strategic agenda, but what is clear is that we want to work for a sustainable urban mobility, in terms of environmental, social and economic sustainability, based on the needs of cities. Henrik Morgen - Director of the EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub North   Andrew Carling, Director of Strategic Programmes at EIT Food presented EIT Food’s vision and strategic objectives. The direction of travel for these KICs is ambitious and points towards a healthy, sustainable future, but how can the KICs leverage the power of their organisations and community to help achieve this?  Read more about EIT Food During two sessions, the workshop used three workshop techniques to engage participants to discuss on this topic. Participants worked on identifying trends, developing scenarios and designing impact pathways, based on the visions and strategic objectives of the KICs.  Through animated discussion, participants identified impact pathways that sought to promote societal and industrial change through e.g. education, tools/ framework development, and product innovation. All scenarios that were developed focused on transitioning towards sustainable food and logistics systems. However, much discussion focused on to what extent consumer behaviour (e.g. dietary preferences) and food production would support or hinder this change. A key tension highlighted was whether technological innovation, in the form of digitalisation and automation of supply chains and logistics could be managed and regulated effectively to promote sustainability and not solely economic growth. Over 100 trends were identified by participants, the top trends (key drivers) were related to food innovation, technology, people and society, and sustainability.  This workshop was a first step: we want to look forward and see how we can work together with other KICs, and also as EIT Urban Mobility in understanding how we can best have impact in helping to create sustainable city logistics.

This culminated in the creation of the Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) handbook that describes the key steps health care providers can take to fully realise the opportunity presented by VBHC. Across Europe, the number of patients requiring care is rising exponentially and costs are growing. This challenge is exacerbated by inefficiencies: the World Health Organisation and the OECD estimate that 30% of health care resources are wasted on avoidable complications, unnecessary treatments or administrative inefficiencies. More treatment should not be the goal of health care, better health should always be the driving force. EIT Health has been repeatedly asked by different health care providers and institutions in Europe to play a leading role beyond the traditional conferences and training programmes. The launch of the HVC Forum aims to discover what makes HVC projects successful and share those successes among those who can drive transformation in their own organisation to ultimately benefit patients, providers and health care systems. Jorge Fernández García - Director of Innovation at EIT Health The forum will provide support for those in the health care industry to drive change within multi-stakeholder, multidisciplinary organisations, offering: The HVC Forum will include a library of case studies from HVC pioneers across Europe, in order to gather lessons learnt and inform future activity. There will also be training opportunities to provide a strong and well-tailored curriculum for health care professionals; patients, citizens and carers; and policy makers. The Forum is set-up in partnership with both academic and institutional organisations with the aim of leading efforts in high value care in Europe whilst remaining strategically connected to other international initiatives. With an extensive network of innovators backing the initiative, there is vast experience that can be leveraged to further these aims. The High Value Care Forum will be guided by a dedicated Advisory Board representing all relevant stakeholders. With hands-on experience of transformation towards high-value care, this group will be instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the High Value Care Forum. Their practical knowledge will be central in supporting the development of the initiative to make sure the Forum will have a real-world impact. Christina Åkerman - Senior Advisor at EIT Health EIT Health’s aim is to provide an innovative and sustainable approach to patient-centred care that provides improved yet cost-effective health care improvements – benefiting everyone involved.

Today, the European Commission, represented by Vice President Šefčovič and Commissioner Breton, launched the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), with the presence of other EU Institutions, national Ministers, industry, unions and civil society organisations as well as key industry stakeholders. The new alliance has been established in recognition of the critical importance of raw materials to the EU’s security, sustainability and industrial leadership. If Europe is to deliver a Green Deal, a digital transition and remain a leader in future technologies, it faces a significant increase in demand for critical raw materials. The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) will identify barriers, opportunities and investment cases to build capacity at all stages of the raw materials value chain, from mining to waste recovery. In a first phase, the alliance focuses on the most pressing need, which is to increase EU resilience in the rare earths and permanent magnets value chains, as these are vital to most EU industrial ecosystems. In addition to rapidly rising demand driven by electric vehicles and energy storage, demand for rare earths critical for products like wind turbines could increase ten-fold by 2050. Later, it will expand to address other critical and strategic raw material and base metal needs, such as Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion. Our strategic foresight shows clearly that the demand for critical raw materials is only going to rise, especially given the ongoing transition towards a green and digital economy. The pandemic has also highlighted the criticality of raw materials for our recovery. To secure a sustainable supply of raw materials we need to join forces across Europe, as we have done for the EU Battery Alliance. The European Alliance on Raw Materials will mobilise industrial and innovation actors, Member States, regions, the EIB, investors and civil society – to help build our capacities and investment cases along the entire value chain, from extraction to processing and recycling. This will in turn strengthen our resilience and boost our open strategic autonomy. Maroš Šefčovič - Vice President of the European Commission The European Raw Materials Alliance is an important step in strengthening the industrial ecosystems that depend on raw materials. The Alliance will accelerate the green and digital transition by reinforcing value chains, diversifying supplies and involving all willing partners in implementing the necessary actions. We invite all stakeholders, civil society organisations, researchers, companies large and small, Member States and regions, and to help us achieve these objectives. Thierry Breton - Commissioner for Internal Market The alliance is already supported by over 150 stakeholders across multiple industrial sectors and value chains. The alliance is open and will mobilise all industrial and innovation actors, Member States, regions, the EIB, investors and civil society. Supporters are asked to sign a declaration, committing to ERMA’s shared vision, and to actively contributing to the alliance’s work. The Alliance is managed by EIT RawMaterials, the world’s largest knowledge and innovation community in the raw materials sector. Raw materials will play a vital role to the revival, autonomy and resilience of Europe’s integrated industrial ecosystems. With the European Raw Materials Alliance, we have a true European answer based on the knowledge and expertise of more than 150 stakeholders/partners. Together we can turn Europe’s raw material dependency into a major strategic strength for our continent, while continually applying the highest environmental and social standards. We are honored to manage the European Raw Materials Alliance, which will drive diversification of sustainable supply and help make better use of the resources available within the EU. Bernd Schäfer - CEO of EIT RawMaterials ERMA’s launch is part of a wider action plan on critical raw materials presented by the European Commission early in September, aimed at bolstering Europe’s resilience. Metals, minerals, and raw materials are vital to most European industries, including renewable energy, automotive, consumer electronics, defence and aerospace. Reliable, secure, and sustainable access to raw materials is a precondition for Europe’s Green Deal, digital transition, and the continent’s future industrial competitiveness and innovation capacity of Europe. At present Europe is highly dependent on raw materials from countries with less stringent environmental, social and human rights standards, and less stable economies.

eit501,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-rawmaterials-king-netherlands-opens-new-plant-delfzijl,EIT RawMaterials: King of the Netherlands opens new state-of-the-art recycling plant in Delfzijl,"Developing raw materials into a major strength for Europe – Purified Metal Company (PMC) has made an important contribution to the vision of EIT RawMaterials in opening the first recycling plant for contaminated steel scrap worldwide. Guest of honour, His Majesty the King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, welcomed numerous guests and solemnly opened the plant, underlining the importance of the issue: a sustainable Europe is no longer a mere idea, it is already taking shape. A sustainable use of natural resources is the basis for a prosperous European economy. Across the globe, primary raw material sources are depleting, while the amounts of industrial waste and end-of-life-products are rapidly increasing. These waste streams contain valuable raw materials that can be extracted to meet the growing demands from global industrial production and consumption. PMC is the first company in the world with an environmentally friendly and economically feasible method to recycle contaminated steel scrap into high-quality raw materials for the steel industry. Thereby the newly constructed plant makes a valuable contribution to the decarbonisation of the EU‘s steel industry: it will save 150 000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the production of steel from iron ore. Those CO2 savings equal the annual emissions of 45 000 passenger cars. The idea of PMC was born in 2011. The combination of steel with hazardous substances can be found in various steel objects, such as valves, railways, tubes, bridges and heating devices. Without PMC, those objects are cleaned, provided this is economically feasible, and then sold as raw materials or as end products. If cleaning is not possible, the material is disposed of in landfills. In this way, entire trains disappear underground. Through the new process developed by PMC, substances such as asbestos are broken down into harmless components and the steel scrap is converted into a new premium raw material - high-quality Purified Metal Blocks (PMB). The hermetically sealed factory guarantees the safety of people and the environment during processing and transport. Only tried and tested techniques are used, which have already clearly proven their reliability in other areas. On its way from start-up to technological leadership, PMC received support from EIT RawMaterials, the largest innovation community in the raw materials sector worldwide. Amongst others, EIT RawMaterials provides funding and entrepreneurship coaching to early-stage start-ups, with a focus on idea-to-market. With this experienced supporter on the side, the former start-up grew into a well-established Small and Medium Enterprise (SME). In 2017, PMC was even nominated for the EIT Venture Award, recognising the most promising entrepreneurs and innovators in Europe. Considering the materials needs of an exponentially growing world population, recycling will have to evolve from a side stream to a major pillar of raw materials supply if we want to protect our planet and make business sustainable. PMC is taking an important pioneering role here and for us as EIT RawMaterials it is exciting to be able to support such valuable innovations on their way to the market. Bernd Schäfer - CEO at EIT RawMaterials It was an intense process to connect the right parties to our ambitious plan for a circular solution for contaminated steel scrap. We are very grateful for the contribution of EIT RawMaterials that helped the success of this project. Jan Henk Wijma, Nathalie van de Poel and Bert Bult - Co-founders of PMC The recycled steel by PMC is a high-quality raw material that can be used by steel manufacturers to produce new steel products. Therefore: every kilogram of Purified Metal Blocks processed saves 1 kg of CO2 because the steel is not produced from iron ore. Not only does PMC thus solve a waste problem: it also lowers CO2 emissions by 50% at factories that produce steel from the blocks of PMC compared to factories that make it from iron ore. The European Parliament’s ‘Green Steel for Europe’ Pilot Project (GREENSTEEL) supports the EU towards achieving the 2030 climate and energy targets and the 2050 long-term strategy for a climate neutral Europe, with effective solutions for clean steelmaking. In this regard, the opening of the PMC is an important step in the EU’s mid- and long-term strategy to decarbonise the steel industry and the EU’s effort to secure raw materials and foster a circular economy.

(Though we have certainly made these points many times!) Collaboration, systemic change and citizen engagement are other buzzwords and entreaties, and Google Alerts for ‘systemic change’ are starting to get much more copious, and interesting, including this article in the Financial Times – Building back better requires systemic shifts. Is it possible to overcomplicate the big picture stuff? Are incrementalism and technological innovation the straw man of systemic change? It’s easy to think so, but intention and systems impacts matter. Systemic change is required when efforts to change one aspect of a system fail to fix the problem. The whole system needs to be transformed. Systemic change means that change has to be fundamental and affects how the whole system functions. Systemic change can [in some cases] mean gradual institutional reforms, but those reforms must be based on and aimed at a transformation of the fundamental qualities and tenets of the system itself. Micha Narberhaus from Virtual Teams for Systemic Change For this reason, ‘stories’ of systemic change can be thought of as episodic ‘case studies in motion’, certainly at this point in our journey towards systemic change. So how do we decide which interventions have ‘systems impacts’ and which perpetuate negative patterns or introduce new ones? How can we understand which combinations of innovations – across education, technology, art, finance, procurement, citizen engagement and other relevant levers of change – offer a fast track to emissions reductions, economic health and social justice? EIT Climate-KIC has set up a framework for working with Europe’s most ambitious cities, to help the community map and understand the interacting local and big picture systems that drive unwanted outcomes in cities, vision new futures together, and build portfolios of joined-up innovations aimed at place-based transformations. Milan, Madrid and Amsterdam are just three of the fifteen cities in the first cohort of EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities. Join EIT Climate-KIC CEO Kirsten Dunlop and the city partners online at #EURegionsWeek on 20 October 2020 to hear some early insights from these ‘case studies in motion’ and to register your interest in joining the programme’s second wave, as a funder of ambitious systemic change or as a city government.

eit506,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-project-wins-horizon-impact-award,EIT Health project wins Horizon Impact Award,"The European Commission has today announced that the EIT Health project MACH is a winner of the prestigious Horizon Impact Award. The awards are designed to recognise and celebrate societal advancements through research and innovation. The 'Mobile Autonomy for Children in end stage Heart failure' (MACH) project is an international collaboration between RWTH Aachen University and Uniklinik RWTH Aachen, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle University and Berlin Heart GmbH to develop and launch a mobile driving unit for the EXCOR® ventricular assist device, a blood pump to assist a failing heart. This programme successfully brought together experts from academia, healthcare and industry to work towards a common goal – to improve the lives of children waiting for a heart transplant. Professor Carina Benstöm, Project lead The EXCOR® Active driving unit provides mobility to children with end-stage heart failure waiting for a heart transplant. Children can spend months and sometimes several years in a hospital waiting for an organ. The goal of this project was to reduce the stress impact of a long term hospitalisation on children on the waiting list and their families, by offering them mobility and autonomy in their daily lives in the hospital environment. Children who have been very sick need to recover, build up muscles, explore and play. The new mobile device helps make this possible. During the waiting time for a donor heart, these young heart patients are looked after by a team of dedicated nurses, intensive care doctors, surgeons, cardiologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, play leaders and psychologists who help the family to cope and to become experts in their child’s care.  Patients and families were given a voice in the project through interviews discussing how to make their experience more positive. The device and the new learning platform will benefit the family as well as the child waiting for a donor heart. Dr Emma Simpson from Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital The Berlin Heart EXCOR® Paediatric is the only Ventricular Assist Device approved worldwide for short to long term support in children of all ages with heart failure*. This project supported development of a smaller, lighter and more mobile driving unit with a longer battery time by switching from a compressor technology to piston drivers, which are lighter and quieter. Since attaining CE Mark last year, the “EXCOR Active” has supported the first patients in Germany. At Berlin Heart, we understand that patient-centred innovation requires close collaboration between engineering, health care professionals and end-users. Sven-Rene Friedel We are happy to see the positive impact of the EXCOR Active recognised by such a prestigious award. Dr Ares K. Menon, Managing Director of Berlin Heart The EUR 10 000 prize money from the award will be donated to projects such as a facility that supports families staying near their hospitalised children in Munich and key initiatives with long-term benefit to patients at Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. *Access to some or all mentioned products may be restricted by country-specific regulatory approvals.

eit508,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-digital-supported-peasypay-european-solution-biometric-payments,EIT Digital supported PeasyPay: European solution for biometric payments,"The system was first rolled out in Budapest and is currently being piloted in Guadalajara, Spain. Slovenia and the UK will follow. No wallet, smartphone or credit card needed. European customers will be able to enter a shop, choose what they want and pay without having any of the above with them. PeasyPay, incorporated in Hungary, is letting people pay by just showing their faces and taking a picture of the palm of their hands, making the whole process faster and more convenient. PeasyPay was launched by EIT Digital within its Innovation Factory, where a number of EIT Digital Partners come together to launch a deep tech venture into the market. The project’s codename is “Pay with a Smile” and it is within the Digital Finance portfolio of the EIT Digital Innovation Factory. The partnership behind the initiative includes two Spanish partners, Ci3 and Liberbank, two Hungarian ones, E-Group and OTP Bank, and Slovenia’s AV Living Lab.  “The system is composed of three elements,” PeasyPay’s product leader Csaba Körmöczi explained, “a smartphone app for the customer (used only during registration), a smartphone app for the merchants, and the payment terminal”. Digital profiles of the customers’ palms and faces are created through the app (available on both Android and iOS) by taking a selfie and a picture of their palm with their mobile’s camera. Afterwards, they have to register their bank card details on an integrated, secure payment gateway. The actual in-store payment process is implemented by using a special point-of-sale (POS) machine, equipped with cameras and facial recognition software that scans customers’ faces and palms and compare them to the biometric template created in advance. In the case of a match, the payment is authorised, and the amount charged to the credit card registered in the payment gateway of the corresponding PeasyPay account. The combination of face and palm scanning solves the issue of mismatching a person, as facial recognition systems’ accuracy degree can vary significantly depending on the person, software and situation. The PeasyPay solution has also been designed to be fully compliant with all European regulations, especially GDPR and national data protection laws. Under GDPR’s provisions, the processing of biometric data for uniquely identifying purposes is not authorized, unless the data subject has given explicit consent for a specified purpose. Another factor that makes the startup’s technology stand out from the competition is that other payment solutions are fully dependent on a proprietary infrastructure and ecosystem, whereas PeasyPay is based on an open system; any bank and any merchant can join. The PeasyPay solution has been operational in Budapest since December 2019 - with a break in the spring due to the pandemic - in a coffee shop frequented by the tech-savvy employees of the city’s second district. OTP Bank and e-Group are joining forces to spread PeasyPay further in the Hungarian capital: a marketing campaign will engage members of the local hospitality industry and retail sector. A pilot use case of PeasyPay, targeting the city’s food, retail and hospitality industry, is currently ongoing in Guadalajara, Spain. The trial started in July, in four small shops located in the city centre, and is being extended to other businesses. In total, 25 proximity shops (bakeries, butcher’s shops, grocery stores, cafés, bookstores, print shops, and herbal shops) will be participating in the Spanish pilot. The plan is to make the PeasyPay solution available in department stores as well. More pilots are planned elsewhere. In the UK, the system is being set up to let taxi drivers seamlessly pay the fee to enter Glasgow Airport’s parking area. In Slovenia, the pilot will take place in a restaurant. During the pilot phase only customers based in Hungary, Spain, Slovenia and the UK will be able to download PeasyPay from their local app store. By the end of the year, the app will be rolled out globally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

GlyCardial Diagnostics (Spain) develops early diagnosis of cardiac ischemic events to reduce the impact of the disease on patients’ lives. They received funding for a project focused on the development of a novel diagnostic test for the early detection of cardiac events. This is important because early detection can make a huge difference in patient outcomes. GlyCardial wants to meet their research needs by using existing health data and biobank samples, more specific serum samples and anonymised clinical history data of cardiology patients. Digital Health Healthinn:Rehand (Spain) is developing the first tablet solution to allow for the rehabilitation of hand, wrist, and fingers while also supporting decisions taken by healthcare professionals. The company received funding to access clinical data related to the recovery of injuries and surgical interventions in hand, wrist, and fingers, from thousands of patients. Such data, which the firm will also use to understand their product demographic, is accessible in Scandinavian quality registers. Radiobotics (Denmark) is developing algorithms for automatic and more-accurate analysis and description of routine medical x-ray images at hospitals, with a focus on musculoskeletal radiology. Radiobotics will use the funding for further work on a product to automate analysis of radiographs of the hip. The machine learning model has been developed and needs exposure to real-world data in order to ensure generalisability and allow product validation.

It aims to reduce dependency on third countries by strengthening domestic sourcing as well as improving resource efficiency and circularity while promoting responsible sourcing worldwide. ‘The Commission intends to develop and implement these priority objectives and the action plan with the help of the Member States and stakeholders, in particular the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials and the Raw Materials Supply Group. It will also draw on the support and expertise of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Raw Materials.’ Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials: Critical Raw Materials Resilience, European Commission Communication 3 Sept. 2020. The first concrete action will be to establish a European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA). After its official launch later this month, ERMA will focus on increasing EU resilience in the rare earth and magnet value chains, as this is vital to most of EU industrial ecosystems. Over time, the alliance will expand to address other raw, advanced and critical raw materials. We need to turn Europe’s dependency on raw materials into a major strength for Europe. EIT RawMaterials is the leading European industry partnership that will take an active role in achieving the outlined objectives of the European Raw Materials Alliance through our extensive expertise in delivering innovation to the raw materials market and securing raw material supply along the strategic value chains. Bernd Schäfer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials. The Raw Materials Alliance will bring together a variety of stakeholders, including industrial actors along the value chain, Member States and regions, trade unions, civil society, research and technology organisations, investors and NGOs. The Raw Materials Alliance is planned for launch end of September. Being the key enablers for a globally competitive, green, and digital Europe, raw materials have become increasingly decisive to improve EU industrial value chains strategically – such as for e-mobility, magnets, renewable energies, aerospace, defence and digital applications. In addition, they are critically important to implement the United Nation’s Agenda 2030 for the Sustainable Development Goals and to achieve the goals outlined in the European Green Deal, the renewed industrial strategy for Europe as well as in the EU Recovery Plan. EU is largely dependent on raw materials from countries with lower environmental and social standards. Therefore, it needs to diversify its supply and make better use of the resources available within the EU – applying the highest environmental and social standards to that effect. Today’s updated list of CRMs combines raw materials of high importance to the EU’s economy and of the high risk associated with their supply. Being subject to a periodic review, the update adds 4 new critical raw materials to the list making it 30 in total.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the umbrella of ""DATA against COVID-19"", EIT Digital launched an extra innovation activity call to support innovators developing digital innovation solutions in the battle against Corona. This call resulted in 87 proposals from all across Europe, of which 9 got rewarded with EIT Digital support. Selected activities receive a co-investment from EIT Digital, with a return on investment expectation. EIT Digital Master School students sent in a proposal for such an innovation activity, encouraged to do so after winning the EUvsVirus award in April. Mandatory to any EIT Digital Innovation Activities is working together with multiple EIT Digital partners. The students’ team found ELTE-Soft, MOHAnet and Eötvös Lorand University from Hungary and InnoTractor from the Netherlands interested to work with them in this innovation activity. The total funding for this project is 500.000 euro coming from the partners and EIT Digital. Peter Lakatos, who is graduating from the dual degree EIT Digital Master School programme Data Science  at the EIT Digital partner universities Eindhoven University of Technology and KTH,  is now officially the activity lead of the solution. And he is happy. 'We were really happy that we got it, it is an exhilarating opportunity. This is going to be the first real adventure that has received funding. We are happy with the partners we have found, and we are going to learn so much!' Besides one team member, motion graphic designer Kristóf Nagy, the other team members also study at the EIT Digital Master School. These include the second year students Márton Elodi, also co-founder of Vern Insurance Technologies, who studies Human Computer Interaction and Design at the EIT Digital partner universities Aalto University and KTH, and Miklós Knebel who studies Autonomous Systems (Technische Universität Berlin and Aalto University). The other two EIT Digital Master School students are in their first year of study: Levente Mitnyik (Embedded Systems, KTH and Eindhoven University of Technology) and Peter Danos (Visual Computing and Communication, KTH and Aalto University). Visit EIT Digital Master School Within the coming six months the Innovation Activity team is tasked to develop a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Lakatos says the MVP should be tested in real life scenarios in hospitals and clinics. 'Our goal is to have our first customers by end of 2020 and having secured partnerships with for example hospitals and governments.' Currently, they have a prototype of a 3D printed remote monitoring device that measures key values which nurses regularly need to check on corona patients. The measured data will be available via a platform to track progress. 'Instead of one patient, nurses can then check about hundred patients at the same time from a safe distance using less protected gear', explains Lakatos in a video about the prototype.    To get to an MVP, the solutions will be built up from scratch again, says Lakatos, who is also co-founder of the startup SpotYet. They want to take into consideration all the feedback they received from medical experts after their first prototype and talking to the new partners. The device the team is planning to create is going to be developed for broader medical purposes than just the Covid-19. 'COVID-19 will hopefully go away, hence we also want to satisfy the need for remote monitoring beyond this virus.' Roberto Prieto, Chief Education Officer of EIT Digital says to be very proud of the Master School students’ team. 'We are very proud that we can support these Master School students with the further development of their COVID-19 solution. These students illustrate exactly the goals of EIT Digital: educate, innovate and accelerate. They are turning their technical know-how into a business solution that is addressing a huge societal problem.'

The term comes from the recognition that transport has increasingly been treated as a service, in line with broader economic changes that put an emphasis on the service sector and in a subscription model for the renting of goods, rather than ownership. There is general agreement that public transport is the backbone product of any MaaS offer. However, considering the increase of digitalisation, the need to have a more flexible and safer transport, the introduction of new mobility services normally offered by private companies, and the pressure to have more liveable urban spaces, MaaS would help to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure and help enhance sustainable mobility including public transport planning. In our Mobility Talks’ episode 5, EIT Urban Mobility will invite a high-level panel of international experts and will guide a constructive discussion on the three most important challenges of MaaS: With the support of Factual, an innovation and strategy consultancy focused on mobility, we will share insights about the current situation of Maas in Europe. Three relevant start-ups in MaaS in Europe will present their MaaS solutions for urban mobility’s challenges and experts coming from public administrations will share with us their ideas on how MaaS will revolutionise transport and mobility in the very near future. The webinar will take place on 17 September between 15:00 to 16:30h CET.

According to Grape Inventory’s CEO, Maria, Grape is... ...on a mission to make homes free of food waste and help people save money while saving our planet. Grape Inventory is being built by a team of visionaries who want to drive real change. Their ambition is to become a pioneer of consumer grocery analytics and lead the way in digital food tracking. In order to tackle the food waste problem, Grape Inventory’s team developed an automated grocery inventory solution, which scans shopping receipts, tracks expiry dates of products purchased and notifies users when items are approaching expiry. By these means, Grape Inventory empowers users to decrease household food waste and make clever purchase decisions. Grape Inventory utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to create a seamless user experience. The team members met during their studies at the EIT Digital Master School in Helsinki two years ago. They came from different technology interests and therefore enrolled in different courses (Cloud Computing, Autonomous Systems, Human Computer Interaction etc.). Ferran notes that: The EIT Digital Master School diversity of courses helped us to form a team with complementary skills. Even before the Master School, I wanted to become an entrepreneur. Thanks to the Master School, I met likeminded people who were excited about joining forces on a common entrepreneurial journey. The EIT Digital Master School equips its students with entrepreneurial skills, helping them to become the new generation of tech and business leaders. Javier adds: The crucial factor to become interested in the startup world was the EIT Digital Master and Summer Schools’ stimulating environment, the Startup Experience classes and the contagious effect of being surrounded by people (mentors, professors, entrepreneurs) with a strong business mindset. Kacper recalls that they first teamed up to participate at various hackathons across Europe. The team won the “Best Financial Data Solution” challenge at a Nordic Health Hackathon and was one of the top teams at HackYeah, a hackathon aimed at developing solutions which are applicable in the fight against the effects of COVID-19. The idea of building a digital inventory was born during these weekend competitions. Eventually, the EIT Digital Venture Program gave the team the chance to take the decisive step towards its MVP, thanks to its two months pre-acceleration program delivered by Krakow Technology Park and the support of experienced business development and sales mentors. As Maria puts it: With its structured goal and milestone set and its ambitious and challenging agenda, the EIT Digital Venture Program helped us to work on the needed partnerships with charities and broaden our network. The financial support was the right fit to our needs at this stage of development of our startup. We are now finalizing the testing of the solution and are getting ready to launch it in Q4 of 2020. Grape Inventory is looking to join forces with grocery stores, zero-waste advocates, charities and businesses who share a mission of fixing the broken food system.

PMC is the first company in the world to provide an economically viable and environmentally sound alternative for recycling contaminated steel scrap and turning it into raw material for the production of high-grade steel. Delfzijl has been chosen as a location after a careful selection process. To realise the factory, different research phases have been completed together with internationally known and leading organisations that are specialised in the field of asbestos inventory, metallurgy, waste collection and engineering. Different proven technologies are combined such as sub-atmospheric pressure units, a steel scrap sheer, induction furnaces and casting machines. This is part of the unique and patented PMC process. Moreover, the process has been investigated technologically and proven by the University of Aachen, a world-wide recognised institute in the field of the steel industry. EIT RawMaterials has supported PMC with Booster funding, and our team is looking forward to joining the opening ceremony in Delfzijl. Steel scrap contaminated with asbestos, or various hazardous components like mercury, PCB’s or chrome VI can be found in all aspects of our society. Thanks to PMC’s unique, circular process, this contaminated steel scrap can now be recycled to clean premium raw materials for steel plants. Moreover, PMC patented technology forms the heart of a truly circular process that solves a long term environmental problem and social hazard. With PMC’s truly innovative technology, for the first time in history, it is now possible to convert hazardous steel waste in a clean premium raw material in an economically sound way. The end product of the unique and circular process of PMC is a clean, premium raw material for steel mills. The Purified Metal Blocks (PMB) are produced in a batch of 20 tons with known chemical composition and can be delivered to the customer per container. The PMB’s have no dirt and a high density. For these reasons, the process of steel mills is much more efficient. Every kilogram of PMB’s produced saves 1 kg of CO2 because steel is not produced by iron ore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poland, as the main coal producer in the European Union, faces a huge challenge in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, 95 per cent (61.6 million tonnes) of coal production in Europe came from the country. EIT Climate-KIC and the Silesian Metropolis believe that for coal regions like Silesia, the challenge of the transition could be turned into an opportunity. EIT Climate-KIC laid the groundwork for regional transformation in 2019 through Rybnik360, a project that aims to change the industrial ecosystem of the city of Rybnik to meet the climate change challenge by jointly designing (together with the inhabitants and other actors operating in and around the city space) a vision of the city’s future. Situated in the Silesian province, Rybnik, which is infamous for its high air pollution levels, is surrounded by more than ten active coal mines. The cooperation with the Silesian Metropolis is the next major step to accelerate the transition and support the entire region in achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The Silesian Metropolis brings together 41 municipalities and is home to 2.3 million residents and 240 000 businesses generating approximately eight per cent of Poland’s GDP. The cooperation will support the member municipalities’ initiatives to limit the impact of climate change. It will also support the creation of new jobs, the development of the regional infrastructure, the effectiveness of local administration, as well as the dialogue and cooperation with residents, local businesses and civil society. The cooperation aims to strengthen the position of the Metropolis as a leader of change in the field of environmental protection, for instance by working together on transportation, policy innovation, governance in public administration, and building alliances with a diversity of partners. Our mission is to bring together the most ambitious climate stakeholders in Europe across countries, cities, and regions. The Silesian Metropolis takes an open and innovative approach to combating climate change. We strongly believe the cooperation is a milestone on to the way towards climate neutrality of the region Magdalena Dul-Komosińska, EIT Climate-KIC’s CEE Region Director The cooperation will encompass a broad array of services, such as the implementation of deep changes in the labour market, more effective work of public offices, cooperation with residents, entrepreneurs, and other groups, as well as social relations, city facilities, transport and the overall planning of the regions’ future. Leveraging the knowledge and experience of EIT Climate-KIC experts, we are well positioned to work towards energy transition and our end-goal of climate neutrality by 2050. It is the right thing to do from an economic standpoint, as the natural resources of fossil fuels are limited. Therefore, we must think about the future in which the next generations will live. We strive to shape the inevitable change wisely and carefully to build a safe, modern, well-organised, and liveable region Grzegorz Podlewski, Vice-President of the Management Board of the Silesian Metropolis",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For Mahima, it was really important to work with a company that resonates with the vision for ‘innovation and research’. Viable Cities has a perfect blend of research and innovation in a progressive environment that Mahima found very attractive. Their ongoing projects vary from theoretical studies to actual development of testbeds and platforms, in collaboration with other technology companies. Tell us a bit about your role at viable cities. I am the master thesis intern and I engage constantly with the Jarfalla Kommun (a local municipality in Sweden). I am performing feasibility study for a ‘P2P (peer-to-peer) energy sharing project’ in the Jarfalla municipality. I weigh the pros, cons, barriers and drivers to implement P2P energy sharing, similar to the project being implemented in the nearby Orebro municipality. Most of my analysis involved conducting interviews and studying the existing projects as a main source for data collection. How did EIT InnoEnergy Masters prepare you for this role? I am grateful to EIT InnoEnergy and my supervisor, Olga Kordas, Programme Coordinator for MSc Energy for Smart Cities. During the first semester, we had a whole course on Smart Cities and Climate Mitigation Strategies which was taught by Olga. During the classes there were many practical examples of the work done by Viable Cities that gave me a better understanding of where we are now and what problems we still have to deal with. With her help, I got the opportunity to work at Viable Cities. Furthermore, the EIT InnoEnergy Career Centre has been very helpful in terms of understanding the visa requirements and helping students out with finding companies for thesis and moving to new countries for internship. Has this been a fulfilling experience? I had 2 things in my mind that I wanted to achieve from my master thesis: Meaningful research work: Completely done! My thesis will be useful for Jarfalla municipality to make calculated decision on the implementation of P2P sharing project. So, I am happy that my work is not just relevant but has some meaning to it. Networking: Due to covid-19, I couldn’t spend much time with the team at the office, but in the limited time we spent, there were many meaningful discussions which I really enjoyed. I felt engaged in the conversations. Apart from this, with all the interviews that I conducted during the study, I was able to develop some rapport with the interviewees and I am happy with that too. Any encouraging words for future students who want to take this path? Choose the thesis or internship that you love! If you don’t have a choice of topic, choose the company you really aspire to work for. Think long term, something that you’re sacrificing now should reap you a benefit later. It takes time to find the right company with the right topic and you just don’t have to think about thesis only in the second year. If you are a non-EU student and have to travel to another country for thesis, it is definitely better to start early!   By Malavika Venugopal, EIT InnoEnergy Master School student",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I felt hope because I could see a real collective desire for change. There was hope in the faces of people young and old; hope that maybe their calls for a more sustainable future would be heard and acted upon. At the same time, I felt this deep sadness because I knew that by tomorrow everyone would have returned to their everyday lives, Pasieg de Gracia would have been cleaned and our emissions levels would still be the the same. I realised that what we need is a way to use our collective energy to make a concrete difference. I thought about ""How can everyone contribute to a better future?"" and after some time I realized that everyone across the whole spectrum has: a little spare change. When combined these little investments from our large movement could add up to a lot of money! Thus, the idea for Seeds was born. Seeds is the first renewable energy Financial Technology (FinTech) app using crowdfunding to enable users to invest in projects with as little as their spare change. It connects the user’s credit card, then when they make a purchase, the transaction is rounded up to the nearest euro and that spare change is automatically invest in a project of their choice. The app also shows the carbon offset equivalent of the investment so that users can go carbon neutral on a weekly basis. Seeds provides a way to align investments with environmental concerns. It also enables users to earn money by utilizing these painless micro-investments to build a savings while knowing where their money is going and the impact it’s creating! As part of the EIT InnoEnergy Master in Renewable Energy programme we have had the opportunity to develop this idea over the course of the last year which has been a great runway to work through the complexities of executing it. As we are gaining momentum, we are receiving additional mentoring through not only from EIT InnoEnergy and the GC Index but also from ESADE’s eWorks accelerator. Fortunately, after completing our studies together, our team has built the comradery necessary to rise to the challenge of founding a company. While our idea isn’t specifically focused on engineering, we wouldn’t be able to identify market gaps and execute this concept without a thorough understanding of the energy industry. After learning the complexities of analyzing the energy system; learning finance and banking isn’t that challenging with a team of truly talented individuals. As our team separates to our second-year universities, our plan is to use this as an opportunity to spread our vision, take the time to develop the app and establish the partnerships necessary to launch a pilot project. Our goal is to make this dream a reality and take Seeds on full-time post-graduation. We have a bold vision for a pan-European platform that creates a virtuous cycle of investment by the masses which can accelerate the energy transition while returning the profits to the people. By using crowdfunding, Seeds has the power to democratise and decentralise finance in a revolutionary way that is more representative of society.

The new venture will accelerate the production capacity of low-carbon batteries in southern Europe to meet growing demand for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Production in Verkor’s first Gigafactory is scheduled to begin in 2023, with a capacity of 16 GWh of battery cells which will increase to 50 GWh in line with market dynamics. The facility will require an initial investment of €1.6bn and will create more than 2,000 direct jobs while supporting thousands more in its supply chain and ecosystem. The search for 200+ hectares of land is already underway. Verkor was founded in response to the growing gap between the expected demand for batteries and the committed and planned European supply. Indeed, the expected growth in demand this decade will require two to three Gigafactories in France alone. The European industrial ecosystem is therefore compelled to establish a sustainable and indigenous European battery supply chain, which in turn will reduce reliance on imports. France’s affordable and low-carbon electricity, prominent automotive manufacturers, leading energy providers, and its demonstrated industrial prowess make it the ideal location for Gigafactories in southern Europe, a region which falls short of such projects when compared to northern and central Europe. Our team is made up of industrial entrepreneurs who have accumulated vast experience in the field, especially in battery-cell manufacturing. We are multinational and growing fast with the addition of new talent from all over the world. We are working in an agile, fast-follower mode to bring locally manufactured, low-CO2 battery cells to the market...combined with the expertise of our strategic partners, I am confident that we are aligning the winning conditions to start the construction of a highly efficient manufacturing Gigafactory in 2022, deliver our first cells in 2023, and stepping up of  industrial activities, key to accelerating low carbon mobility in Europe. Benoit Lemaignan, the CEO of Verkor The first Verkor Gigafactory will help bridge the gap between Europe’s planned demand and currently forecasted European supply in this decade. Verkor’s unique value proposition on manufacturing optimisation and excellence is welcome. The strategic partnerships they are building make us confident that Verkor will deliver. Coupled with the Covid recovery, the initiative will further accelerate the French and European battery value chain, from mining to recycling, and boost the growth of hundreds of businesses across France and Europe...Anchored in our work with the European Battery Alliance, we are on a mission to achieve a sustainable battery value chain in Europe. By locating the site in France, we can produce batteries with a carbon footprint nearly four times lower than that of China. France also boasts a highly-skilled workforce and industry players across the entire value chain. Diego Pavia, CEO of EIT InnoEnergy Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, brings its industrial expertise and strong links into the existing battery supply chain in Europe. It will help Verkor build and execute optimised and sustainable operations that leverage IOT & Industry 4.0. “We are excited to support Verkor’s creation and share our technical and manufacturing expertise. This brings together the best of energy management and industrial expertise to build green, competitive batteries as part of our commitment to help the European transition to electric vehicles,” said Christel Galbrun-Noel, Mobility Segment President at Schneider Electric.

eit526,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/building-resilient-societies-eit-health-alumni-hackathon,Building Resilient Societies: EIT Health Alumni Hackathon,"Over the course of 8 hours, more than 40 participants, competed for a EUR 3 000 cash prize from EIT Health and a tailored product lab from N3xtcoder. A package designed to help them take the next steps in their health entrepreneurial journeys with solutions that deliver what really matters to European citizens. The goal of this hackathon was to scale early stage projects that offered inclusive innovations for a healthier, more caring European society. At a time where our global society is combatting an international pandemic, EIT Health’s goals to support stronger healthcare systems are now more prevalent than ever. In particular, those activities which integrate and build upon the contribution of empowered citizens and patients. The EIT Health Alumni Hackathon is the proof bringing together creative minds always pays off. This is the opportunity for Alumni to harness their talent and work together on developing innovative ideas and inclusive solutions for a healthier society. Urszula Bogatynska, Jury member, EIT Representative to the EIT Alumni Board Five projects were selected to be scaled throughout the day. Each was paired with a carefully crafted interdisciplinary team made up of entrepreneurs, innovators, students, health professionals, and patients, all eager to put their creativity to the test, and claim victory in the first ever EIT Health Alumni Hackathon. The five projects selected to compete included: I was working with a start-up called Via, helping those to navigate the grieving process from the passing of a loved one. With a growing conversation about mental health and the ubiquity of life online, Via was a very relevant and exciting project to work on. I was really impressed by the variety of skills that we had in our team; web development, UX designers, legal experts, and engineers. It was great to see everyone fall into place, taking a role that they had some expertise in and outputting some amazing work. Ben Hayward, Mission Desgin at Aerospacelab. Participant of Team Via EIT Health firmly believes that societal impact is constructed from the connection between innovation and society and measured against what really matters to people. Building on EIT Health’s commitment to Citizen & Patient Engagement, the inclusion of citizens and patients, and taking heed of their recommendations and experiences, was thus central to the hackathon. This provided an invaluable level of insight and expertise to the teams, as members were able to understand the outcomes that matter to their target audience, learn from lived experiences, and understand how working with patients’ is essential for good intentions to become impactful and successful businesses. Keeping the patient in mind is crucial when solving such problems. Ultimately, they will be the end beneficiary of this solution. Patients have been through these health problems and experienced all their symptoms and consequences. If our end goal is patient health and quality of life, it is only logical to include the patients at as many points within the design cycle of the solution. I was glad to see that projects included patients not only in the research phase but also in the ideation, design, and prototype. Nour Maalouf, Medical Doctor, Participant of Team Kiora The Hackathon was held entirely on Discord, a tool originally intended for online gamers, but which offers many of the functions required for an online hackathon such as this. The multiple chat functions allow teams, most of whom have never met each other and live hundreds of miles apart from one another, to work together effectively towards a common goal. The Hackathon was a great experience and opportunity to promote patient involvement in health innovation'.
		Phil Collis (European Heart Network Patient Representative) Each team presented their initial idea to the external jury panel at the very start of the day, highlighting the key aspects of their project and outlining the challenges they would like to work on. At the end of the 8-hour sprint, the five teams then presented their ideas once again to the jury, this time focussing on the developments made throughout the day and reflecting on the new perspectives they gained through teamwork in such as short space of time. From prototype apps, to functioning websites and bootstrapped data analysis tools, the jury had a lot of results to assess. In the end the decision was unanimous: Team Canary Sentinel were declared the winners! Their project is based on creating an affordable, personalised early warning system to monitor for early signs of COVID-19 symptoms with the use of a phone camera. The winning team worked on three clearly defined work packages throughout the day: The hackathon allowed for inclusive co-creation of e-health solutions. It also gave the opportunity for designers, coders, and entrepreneurs to understand the experience, the needs and the expertise of patients and citizens before designing solutions. This experience could be a beginning of a 'new way of doing business'. The challenge lies in creating a culture of patient and citizen partnerships, establishing the leadership and organisational context required to foster engagement, and building bridges between the highly technological digital culture, the still largely academic medical knowledge and the experiential patient knowledge. Anne Schweighofer, Jury member, CEO of the Patient Conseil The winning team: Canary Sentinel have already entered into discussions with N3xtcoder to design the perfect product Lab to take their idea forward. They will have access to all of N3xtcoders team of marketing, coding, and business development experts, and will be further supported by an additional EUR 3 000 from EIT Health. Already in June, Canary Sentinel met with a Data Security Expert Alistair, iOS Expert Marius, and Software Engineer Jennifer from the N3xtcoder team to discuss how best to advance the project. Over the course of a series of weekly sprints, the team will now work on developing a more advanced protoype.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit528,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-led-policy-innovation-taskforce-mobilises-cities-deliver-responses,EIT Climate-KIC led  Policy Innovation Taskforce mobilises cities to deliver responses to climate crises  ,"Are cities ready, willing, and able to respond? Can their leaders and citizens embrace the kind of aggressive innovations needed for them to act on the climate emergency? With the right framing and context, transformative policy measures can deliver climate mitigation and resilience in cities. Achieving this will require a novel approach, one based on careful experimentation and testing on the ground. We need to innovate quickly to learn what we do not yet know how to do. We must experiment and test our best ideas, using a rigorous method for getting results in the time we have. This premise led EIT Climate-KIC and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM) to combine their efforts and convene a global taskforce to invent the policy innovations we need cities to test.  -Thomas Osdoba, Director of Healthy, Clean Cities programme at EIT Climate-KIC. The taskforce met in early June and will be working throughout the next year. The initiative intends to use real-time testing by cities to shorten the deliberation cycle to develop insights quickly and enable the emergence of more refined or advanced policies. The taskforce includes 19 high-profile experts from a wide range of international climate and sustainable development-focused organisations. EIT Climate-KIC’s experiences on the ground reveal cities generally have high-level policy goals for long-term decarbonisation of mobility and/or energy systems, usually by 2040 or 2050. These goals, consistent with the Paris Agreement, often lack the specific policy instruments required to achieve these targets. Even with continued calls for greater urgency in our efforts to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, little is in place – even among cities which lead on climate action – to achieve outcomes more quickly. The Policy Innovation Taskforce will move beyond reporting on ‘best practices’ in favour of moving towards an agile mode of policy invention and co-creation, systemically rethinking policymaking by cities. The inventions produced by the taskforce need to be tested in the real world and in real-time as quickly as possible. - Nikhil Chaudhary, Cities Advisor at EIT Climate-KIC. The Global Covenant of Mayors and EIT Climate-KIC will draw insights and strategic lessons from this experimentation to inform even better policy ideas. There will be tightly knit feedback loops of recommendations and learning between pilot cities and the taskforce within this process. The target cities and urban/climate policymakers willing to step up to this challenge are 15 cities EIT Climate-KIC is currently working with across Europe through its Healthy, Clean Cities programme. The 15 cities working with EIT Climate-KIC’s Healthy, Clean Cities programme are the primary target of this policy innovation experimentation. These cities are taking the first step in building a global movement of cities working more urgently to achieve the same impact in this single decade, in keeping with recent calls from the United Nations to move more aggressively to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Once road-tested and refined within this group of cities, GCoM will lead the process of engaging mayors and city practitioners across their 10,000 signatories and 14 Regional Covenants. GCoM also plans to expand the reach of this initiative through a series of consultations through their innovation-focused programme, Innovate4Cities, and with representatives of 25 national governments affiliated with Mission Innovation. While the pandemic and climate emergency are daunting challenges for cities, innovative opportunities are opening that previously would have been unthinkable from a policy perspective. Under these circumstances, the initiative has identified a range of crucial policy areas relevant to cities globally, which include: The seven areas listed above create a starting point and will continue to evolve as recommendations are developed and new challenges are uncovered. Moreover, the initiative will explore the interdependencies and interlinkages of policy issues, in service of advancing systems innovation in policymaking. The virtual meeting gathered multiple perspectives for considering the needed policy innovations. How to classify the overlapping policy areas and consider them holistically was one of the major focal points. One key takeaway was to strike the right balance between deep-dive ‘technical’ domains and embedding cross-cutting issues like resilience, governance, finance, citizen engagement and equity. The problem in my view is that climate action is often considered in isolation. Climate action is contingent on industrial policy, it is contingent on how we build homes and plan our communities and so on, so we must think about it holistically.” – Sophie Howe, Future Generations Commissioner for Wales We need to think about the ‘how’ – how do we approach change. There will be a need for an alignment of leadership and vision in all domains that are affected: governments, citizens, companies, NGOs. All these actors will need to be included structurally in a governance model, one that is driven by a common ambition. This could avoid exclusion and provide a broad platform for change and space for interaction and shared opinions. – Mohamed Ridouani, Mayor of the City of Leuven Several members also stressed the need for urgency in framing innovative policy responses in a post-COVID-19 world. The speed and uncertainty of the current times have brought an additional emphasis on themes, such as systemic risks and resilience, climate-related co-benefits of economic recovery, demand for new governance models, and decision-making. In the coming months, the taskforce’s work shall proceed through smaller sub-committees and will zero in on developing solutions for specific policy challenges. Moving ahead, the premise is that the first set of policy recommendations may not be perfect for all cities. But the act of experimentation, co-design and collective learning will lead everyone to better inform the next generation of policies. Watch this space.

eit530,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-innoenergy-worlds-first-zero-carbon-lithium-extraction-project-start-germany,EIT InnoEnergy: World’s first zero carbon lithium extraction project to start in Germany,"Vulcan’s “Zero Carbon Lithium” project will be realised in the German part of the so-called Upper Rhine Rift, in the states of Baden-Wuertemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.  The region contains Europe’s largest lithium resource and one of the largest worldwide. Batteries are a key technology of our time. Driven particularly by the demand of the e-mobility sector, Europe’s share of global battery cell production is forecast to reach almost 15% by 2024, overtaking the US and Asia excluding China. By using that momentum to accelerate the development of the European battery value chain, we are making our economy more resilient to future crises. The CO2-neutral development of our own lithium deposits is a crucial building block for a sustainable and strong European battery industry and will bring us significantly closer to meeting our 2030 climate goals. By further investing in Vulcan, and the other lithium mining projects, Europe could cover most of its anticipated lithium demand from regional resources.  -Christian Müller, CEO of EIT InnoEnergy, Germany, EIT InnoEnergy will be supporting Vulcan Energy Resources in bringing this strategic project to fruition. In addition to direct financial support in the six figure range, EIT InnoEnergy will be assisting Vulcan in raising further capital, helping to establish connections to companies in Europe’s battery supply chain as well as relevant political actors, and assisting them in building their management team and selecting qualified employees through its vital growth phase. Horst Kreuter, co-founder of Vulcan Energy Resources, said: “Our goal is to play an integral role in enabling a zero-carbon future by decarbonizing the currently high carbon production footprint of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. We have therefore carried out a very thorough global search for the perfect location – and found it. Not only does the Upper Rhine region contain one of the largest lithium reservoirs globally, it is also within a few hours reach to many of the World’s leading auto manufacturers, and many other industrial players, all of whom have a hugely growing demand for emission-free lithium. We see a massive chance for the region to become one of the key centres of the European battery industry itself, which would result in the creation of thousands of secure and highly qualified jobs.” Vulcan will pump hot lithium-rich brine up to the surface, then use the renewable electricity and heat to drive lithium extraction using its proprietary technique, with excess renewable energy as a saleable by-product that can be fed back into the grid. As a result, the carbon footprint of the production process could even be negative.  The resulting lithium shall then be used in a number of ways, most notably in the production of lithium-ion batteries to meet the massive demand from the automotive and other sectors. Commercial operations are targeted to start to produce lithium hydroxide in time for the large increase in expected industry demand in Europe during the first half of the decade. Over time, production volumes are expected to massively increase. Europe is already the fastest growing lithium-ion battery production centre in the world, with zero local supply of lithium hydroxide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit531,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-participated-circular-economy-online-event-un-high-level-political,EIT Climate-KIC participated in the circular economy online event at UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development,"The HLPF annual meeting is the core United Nations platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Usually hosted in New York City, it was held online this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cliona Howie presented examples on how EIT Climate-KIC is working to leverage collective knowledge and expertise to ensure that the post-COVID-19 recovery is aligned with climate and SDG commitments. ''What we are offering on the ground is system innovation as a service to help Europe deliver a transformative green recovery'' said Howie. Systemic change, she added, is “a shift from ‘singular interventions’ – which might provide amazing solutions in a single place, at a single time, for a single thing – to something that is really addressing the complexity of the global climate challenge.”
	“As we plan an economic recovery, it is critical that we look beyond the easier, carbon-intensive options. The answer lies in circular, systemic solutions that will transform our society in an unprecedented way,” said Howie. In practice, EIT Climate-KIC designs cross-cutting holistic programmes (so called Deep Demonstrations) based on the needs, demands, and contexts of a certain ecosystem. The aim of the “Circular, Regenerative Economies Deep Demonstration” is to help challenge owners – which can be public authorities at the national, regional or city scale, but also entire value chains – “understand what a circular transition looks like, how they would implement it, how they would even start pulling it together, how they would meet objectives that really help them to design a resilient sustainable future, all while meeting very pressing climate targets,” explained the expert. The approach aims to identify the scenarios, pathways and available options for system change consistent with a 1.5-degree future. It is already being tested in many places around the EU including in Slovenia, where nine ministries are working together with EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Raw Materials and the EU’s Joint Research Centre on 17 inter-connected programmes across multiple levers of change from education to policy, consumer behaviour, innovation support and capacity building. “Slovenia has been an incredibly exciting journey thus far and we’re really looking to implementing on the ground very quickly,” said Howie.

eit534,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-rawmaterials-booster-grant-aquainsilico-commercialise-wastewater-treatment,EIT RawMaterials Booster grant for AquaInSilico to commercialise wastewater treatment software,"AquaInSilico Lda has been granted EUR 60 000 EIT RawMaterials Booster funding to develop further its software tools to optimise wastewater treatment. The grant from EIT RawMaterials Booster will allow AquaInSilico to build on its collaboration with a leading European environmental, water and waste management group to commercialise its software tools to remove phosphorus from wastewater in a more environmentally friendly and effective way than existing methods. The recovered phosphorus can then be sold for use in fertilisers. AquaInSilico Lda is a portfolio company of Frontier IP, a specialist in commercialising intellectual property. AquaInSilico’s technology is attracting interest because several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Austria, are introducing stricter regulations that require large treatment plans to recover at least 50% of the phosphorus for use as a biofertiliser. This is causing utility problems because current methods use expensive and environmentally unfriendly chemicals to bind the phosphorus or biological processes that, although cheaper and more sustainable, do not work more than 45% of the time properly. AquaInSilico’s wastewater treatment software uses a mathematically-modelled biological approach to improve phosphorus removal, based on understanding and controlling the operating variables that result from biological and chemical processes. As a result, the process reduces the use of chemicals and energy and the risk of environmental harm from phosphorus leaching into waterways from wastewater sludge. AquaInSilico is a spin-out from Portugal’s NOVA University, NOVA School of Science and Technology (“FCT NOVA”) and is the fourth spin-out resulting from Frontier IP’s growing presence in Portugal. As the sophisticated algorithms the company is developing are based on a deep knowledge of biological and chemical processes and are able to understand and predict how they unfold in different conditions, they can detect possible problems, often before they can be diagnosed by humans. As a result, the technology has broad applicability, with the potential to allow companies, such as oil groups, brewers, pulp, paper, steel makers, food processing and waste recovery businesses and municipal wastewater treatment plants, to tune and adapt their treatment systems more effectively. It is expected to save them up to 25% of their operating costs. AquaInSilico’s software also supports the improved recovery of other valuable and recyclable products in addition to phosphorus, such as ammonia, biogas, and fine chemicals that can be used in biofertilisers, bioplastics and biofuels. The company believes this could result in new sustainable technologies in future. AquaInSilico was established to develop and commercialise the research of Dr Jorge Santos, Dr Mariana Matos and Professor Maria Ascensão Reis of FCT NOVA. This team had developed several research projects in environmental and industrial bioengineering in collaboration with several worldwide industry players.   We are very happy for this EIT RawMaterials Booster grant, which offers us the opportunity to speed up our technology readiness level and reach the market with a solution that recovers critical raw materials from waste to new bio-based products. Dr Jorge Santos, Co-Founder at AquaInSilico AquaInSilico has been making good progress in collaboration with its industry partners, progress reflected and validated by the award of this grant to commercialise the technology.

Meanwhile, Restorative Neurotechnologies, which was accelerated through EIT Health Headstart support, announced that they would be receiving EUR 1 million from a group of four investors that includes CDP Venture Capital Sgr. Following the team’s entry into the EIT Health open innovation Wild Card programme in 2019, iLoF (Intelligent Lab on a Fibre) was formed and €2 million in investment in addition to a mentoring package was provided to develop the company and solution. Honing in on the repeated clinical trial failures in neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, the solution aims to improve the process of clinical trial screening and speed up drug discovery in diseases with little, or no, treatment options. In addition to the recent boost from M12 and Mayfield, iLof has attracted the attention of the biotech world, with its cofounders being named in the 2020 Forbes 30 under 30 Europe list in the science and healthcare category. Additionally, the team are finalists in the M12 Female Founders Competition. It is fantastic to see iLoF go from strength to strength following their formation as part of the EIT Health Wild Card programme. Wild Card was created to discover and develop highly talented individuals who can come together to form new companies that break ground in areas where solutions to challenges remain undiscovered. Effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are desperately needed yet continue to evade us – innovation in the research process to find new strategies in tackling such diseases will have significant impact, not to mention scientific value. We look forward to continuing working with iLoF and supporting them as they advance in their journey Jorge Juan Fernández García, Director of Innovation, EIT Health Challenges surrounding current clinical trial processes are significantly hindering the discovery of potential treatments in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, including difficulties in recruiting and retaining participants. iLoF’s solution uses biophotonics (the use of light-based technologies for the purpose of studying biological tissue, cells and cellular processes) and AI to develop non-invasive methods of screening patients for clinical trials, and aims to accelerate the drug discovery process and make it more economically viable. This investment will be crucial to our mission of accelerating personalised treatments for patients all around the world. Our platform technology is growing rapidly and is already being deployed with leading hospitals and biotechs around the globe, expediting the discovery and development of new therapeutics for neurogenerative diseases. By 2021, we aim to enrol a large-scale clinical trial as a precise, non-invasive pre-screening tool for Alzheimer’s, bringing us one step closer to our goal of making the patient’s journey much more humane and convenient, while drastically transforming the whole process into a more efficient and flexible experience for the industry Luis Valente, CEO of iLoF Restorative Neurotechnologies, a start-up based in Italy, develops ground-breaking treatments for stroke survivors and other patients with neurological disorders. According to the World Health Organization, around 1 billion patients suffer from neurological disorders worldwide. This problem has an impact on the quality of life, health systems and income capacity of patients and their caregivers. Restorative Neurotechnologies addresses this challenge with a wearable device and accompanying software that allows cognitive stimulation through digital rehabilitation exercises. At the core of the solution is Mindlenses, a pair of special glasses equipped with prismatic lenses that deviate the visual field to the right or left. The research team found that the deviation induced by the prismatic lenses is detected by the brain, which puts in place a compensatory mechanism capable of stimulating the rehabilitation process. The Restorative Neurotechnologies team was granted EUR 40 000 and networking support through EIT Health’s 2019 Headstart programme. Prof. Massimo Oliveri, head of the team, noted the importance of that support: “Access to a competition such as the acceleration programmes of EIT Health, specifically designed for biomedical businesses, allowed us to complete the development of our product.” The team also closed a EUR 110 000 SocialFare seed funding round in 2019. Now, one of the new investors, CDP Venture Capital Sgr – National Innovation Fund, will provide further support for all phases of product development and scale-out. The fund, 70% owned by CDP Equity (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Group) and 30% by Invitalia, aims to support and promote Italian innovative start-ups in the Southern part of the country through the Southern Business Fund. We are amazed by the pace of the development of the team coming from Palermo. This is yet another great example of a start-up from more progressing regions that is highly skilled, motivated and successful Chiara Maiorino, EIT Health InnoStars Regional Manager for Italy Consorzio ARCA, the coordinators of the EIT Health Regional Innovation Scheme Hub in Italy, have been collaborating with Prof. Oliveri and his team for several years. 'We supported the group as a tutor for the preparation of their business plan, and supported them in participating in the EIT Health InnoStars Awards in 2017 and then in the selection process of the SocialFare Accelerator which, in 2018, led them to start a second spin-off, namely Restorative Technologies,' said Fiammetta Panto of Consorzio ARCA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Call was designed to fast-track product or service solutions that could have a significant and immediate impact to the challenges brought about by COVID-19 on the agrifood sector. The funding is being awarded to 13 projects in total, made up from consortia representing 52 global organisations. Lead organisations include the Technical University of Munich (TUM) from Germany, INL from Portugal, SwissDeCode from Switzerland, Wasteless from Israel, UNIBO from Italy, Matis from Iceland, Rikolto from Belgium, UCSC from Italy, Queen's University Belfast from Northern Ireland, and SmartRetail from Belgium. As part of the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT)’s Crisis Response Initiative, this activity directly contributes to the European Union’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the leadership of the EIT, EIT Food and its other Knowledge Innovation Communities (KICs) have been able to deploy these COVID-19 Response Calls at an unprecedented speed, ensuring that industries across Europe are being supported in their time of need. The COVID-19 Rapid Response Call for Innovation was launched in May 2020 alongside the COVID-19 Bridge Fund, which was designed to support startups that have been adversely affected by the pandemic. The total available amount awarded to EIT Food is EUR 10.25 million for both funding opportunities. Implementation of projects started in early July 2020, a mere 6 weeks after the call was launched. The COVID-19 Rapid Response Call for Innovation focuses on supporting three food system specific challenges that EIT Food is currently tackling: Further details on all of the fund recipient projects are available on the dedicated COVID-19 pages on the EIT Food website here. An impressive number of high-quality applications were assessed as part of EIT Food’s COVID-19 Rapid Response Call for Innovation, and we are very pleased with the final 13 that were chosen. They demonstrate the ingenuity and dedication of the agritech community in a time of great uncertainty and disruption, and we are as committed as ever before to supporting their resilience - as well as that of the wider European Food System. We look forward to the implementation of these urgently needed innovations to help the sector collectively respond to the pandemic and rebuild our economy sustainably Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food In August 2020, EIT Food will also announce the recipients of the COVID-19 Bridge Fund, which will help ventures adapt to the crisis and continue critical innovation activities whilst bridging the gap so they can secure follow-on funding. The aim is to provide timely financial support of between EUR 200 000 and EUR 500 000 to a select number of agricultural and food ventures that address one of EIT Food’s key focus areas. By deploying a rapid response mechanism, all EIT Crisis Response activities will be completed by the end of 2020 to help Europe recover. These funding initiatives come on top of already-launched initiatives from across the whole EIT Food partner community to support the European food system through the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has included the launch of ‘Robin Food’, a soup brand in Belgium with EIT Food partners (and now a COVID-19 Rapid Response Call for Innovation recipient) that is using fresh surplus vegetables from farmers, and aims to distribute 20 000 litres to vulnerable families through food banks and social grocers. With learnings from the Robin Food program, similar initiatives are already being rolled out across other regions in Europe. In Spain for example, EIT Food has announced the ‘Los Salvacomidas’ (The Food Savers) initiative to provide over 60,000 healthy lunch boxes to children in need affected by the COVID crisis. EIT Food is also helping to improve the knowledge of the public by launching a free online course that is exploring how agrifood supply chains are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

eit538,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-rawmaterials-closing-material-loops-petrit-t-turning-industrial-side-streams,EIT RawMaterials: Closing material loops with Petrit-T – turning industrial side streams into acoustic panels and cement,"To move society toward a circular economy and reduce society’s use of virgin raw materials, industry by-products (side streams) have to be treated as products as well. This has been the objective in the Min-Pet project (2016­–2019) where the use of a mineral side stream, Petrit-T, has been upscaled as a raw material for acoustic panels and cement. We have been successful in defining a method for scaling up the use of geopolymer Petrit-T as a raw material in acoustic panels. Currently, we are collaborating with a company developing a process for using Petrit-T in producing acoustic panels. Björn Haase, Manager Non-metal Products at Höganäs AB Björn Haase is responsible for Höganäs’ work with side streams and has been occupied with developing and producing environmentally friendly geopolymer materials for nearly ten years. However, finding potential applications for side streams has not always been simple. Björn is a pioneer in the field, and his insistent efforts and cooperation with other companies are one of the main reasons why Höganäs manages to use so much of its side streams. When I visited the University of Oulu in Finland a handful years ago and heard what they were doing there I got the idea of using Petrit-T as a raw material for inorganic polymers. Björn Haase In the Min-Pet project, the main focus has been to scale-up the use of the inorganic binder raw material to yield geopolymer-based materials as well as cement. Both the ceramic-like geopolymeric material and the cement has multiple uses in many applications including concrete elements, foamed concrete, thermal insulation material, and as a low-temperature ceramic. EIT RawMaterials and the partners involved have played a major role in supporting this development. It was difficult to gain support for the use of side streams ten years ago, but nowadays circular economy and industrial symbiosis are a frequent topic of conversation. We have been able to evaluate, compare and develop the geopolymer as a new raw material thanks to EIT RawMaterials. Björn Haase At the world’s biggest metal powder manufacturer Höganäs AB’s production plants all over the world  vast quantities of byproducts (side streams) are produced. The company tries to ensure that as much as possible of this material is used as a new raw material in its own production processes or by other industries. In 2019, approximately 80 per cent of Höganäs’ side streams were used. The company aims at increasing usage of side streams to 85 per cent by 2020 and 95 per cent by 2026. By successful commercialization of the Petrit-T foam geopolymer, up to 20 000 tonnes of side stream can be used in Höganäs alone. Side streams from Höganäs can replace materials that are otherwise blasted out of rock for use in roadbuilding, for example. Höganäs is part of the circular economy in that we provide industries with raw materials from our side streams and largely use scrap as a raw material in our own production processes. The more side streams we can use in society, the less virgin material is needed. Björn Haase The Min-Pet project has brought together key players in the European raw materials sector; four research units (University of Oulu, KU-Leuven, VTT and ZAG), two companies specialized in the circular economy and waste valorization (Dansk jordstabilisering and Destamatic) and large industry (Höganäs). The consortium covers the whole value chain from the producer to the end-users, complemented with research institutions. We are successful in pursuing technical development and projects that the entire steel industry can benefit from thanks to cooperation with companies in the steel industry and other industries. We also link together industries that do not normally come into contact with one another. Slag asphalt for the asphalt industry and water treatment with slag for the water treatment industry are just a couple of examples of successful projects of this kind. Björn Haase Despite the simple manufacturing process of geopolymer materials, careful science and engineering is required in designing the reactions. Alkali-activation for several waste streams has been commercialized in several countries worldwide highlighting the technical feasibility of the concept and the core technology. Being a platform technology, alkali-activation can be applied to a wide range of different markets starting from sustainable concrete, to railroad sleepers, and high-end fiber composites One challenge involves assessing which side stream materials are suitable for which customers. Extensive analysis work is required in this regard. We have a number of products from our side streams, but we have to come up with new options the whole time. This is why we carry out extensive sampling procedures in order to analyse and control the qualities of our material and work out the industries for which the material might be useful. We have to be innovative and constantly think along new lines. Björn Haase The technology upscaled in the Min-Pet project can be used to valorise other similar industrial side streams as well, such as fly ashes and slags. There are roughly 60 million tons of inorganic industrial side streams that are landfilled in EU per annum, highlighting the need for these kind of upscaling projects. Björn Haase As the concept of utilizing industrial side streams using alkali-activation will be applied to an ever-widening number of applications, for example, molding, extrusion and fiber reinforcing, it will enable ever-higher returns to the European raw material sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit539,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-virtual-wild-card-hackathon-kicks,EIT Health Virtual Wild Card Hackathon kicks off,"The EIT Health Wild Card Hackathon began on 1 July with a packed agenda for the 45 participants who came together online to find new solutions in women’s health and digital therapeutics. Now in its third year, the EIT Health Wild Card programme builds game-changing life science companies to break new ground in health by challenging the status quo in areas of high unmet need. Beginning with two challenges set by EIT Health, the annual Wild Card programme invites talented innovators from across Europe to respond with their ideas. Successful applicants start their journey with a hackathon; putting them through their paces on everything from team formation, critical thinking, business model development and pitching. Finally, participants pitch their solution to a panel of industry leaders to secure a spot in the finals, at which point they pitch for EIT Health investment to incorporate their company and bring their solution to market. 'The Hackathon is a very exciting phase of the Wild Card programme – it’s where we see highly talented individuals come together with complementary skill sets, where initial ideas are transformed into game-changing and viable business ventures, and where participants go from entrepreneur to CEO-in-waiting,' said Jorge Juan Fernández García, Director of Innovation, EIT Health. 'Beyond the excitement, we are also reminded that we are here with a serious purpose – we simply must do more to drive advancements in women’s health and take advantage of the possibilities afforded to us by digital therapeutics. We look forward to discovering and developing the very best talent that can help us to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe.' Women’s Health: Women’s health has historically been under-recognised, and understanding of women’s health conditions and solutions to treat them have been slow. Women in Europe live, on average, 10 years in ill health with cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health conditions being the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Women are generally underrepresented in medical research, and are significantly more likely to have an adverse reaction to medication than men. Digital Therapeutics: Although a relatively new field of healthcare, digital therapeutics hold great promise in revolutionising current medical practice, particularly in therapeutic areas where traditional medicine has fallen short. With an ageing population in Europe and many healthcare systems under strain from the demand caused by aging and non-communicable diseases, new ways of treating and managing patients must be found. Defined as evidence-based therapeutic interventions to treat, manage or prevent a disease or condition using software programmes, digital therapeutics can be used independently, or combined with existing interventions to optimise patient care and improve outcomes. The participants will be coached by 20 leading mentors from Europe and beyond, pitching their final solution on the 10th July to the judging panel. Selected teams will be incubated by EIT Health and awarded up to two million euros each of EIT Health investment at the end of October to develop their company and solution. Past winners include Abtrace and Smart4Diagnostics, who were named winners in 2018 and have since launched their products onto the market; and iLoF and PIPRA, who were winners in 2019 and continue to develop their products. EIT Health is in the process of finalising the challenges that will be posed to Europe’s innovators as part of the 2021 Wild Card programme.

eit541,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/pandemic-hitting-nursing-homes-saras-robots-are-growing-demand,"With the pandemic hitting nursing homes, SARA's robots are in growing demand","The SARA robot, developed as part of the ""Social & Autonomous Robotic Health Assistant"" innovation activity of EIT Digital, led by Bright Cape, was one of the main attractions at the EIT Digital Conference in Brussels last year. SARA Robotics, the start-up created to commercialise it, has made many progresses since then. It has already signed up three Dutch care institutions as customers, Zorggroep Elde Maasduinen, tanteLouise and Het Laar and, with the COVID-19 pandemic shining a spotlight on the wellbeing of elderly guests of nursing homes and on the shortage of staff there, its services are in growing demand. As visitors were no longer allowed in those institutions, we had a lot of requests, from our customers but also from other facilities, asking if it was possible to use the robot to help clients have some form of communication with their friends and relatives. So, we built the option to video call via SARA and we also explored more options such as the uploading of pre-made videos or photos which can be viewed by residents at any time, even without an Internet connection Emmy Hendriks, Product Manager of SARA Robotics The start-up also set up a promotional campaign, ""SARA stays over"" (SARA blijft slapen), allowing care institutions to borrow the robots for free for one month, to get some support out of it and test its functionalities. 'We just wanted to do something good for the residents of those facilities and, at the same time, it was a nice opportunity for us to showcase our innovation and see if these care homes would be interested to pursue a longer collaboration,' Hendriks explained.    As of June 2020, more than 100 Dutch institutions subscribed for the SARA stays over campaign, as can be seen at a glance on a map created by the startup and shared on social media. 'It's worth stressing that, while indeed the coronavirus pandemic contributed to raise the attention on the shortage of nursing staff in care homes and on the quality of life of their clients, the problem has already existed for quite a long time and it is not going away anytime soon,' SARA's product manager said. In ageing European societies, the number of elderly people as a percentage of the overall population is constantly increasing, while fewer and fewer people choose to become healthcare professionals. Care institutions and hospitals, therefore, are facing serious staffing shortages and heavy work pressure has proven to be related to poor quality of care and to incidents such as medication errors. The robotics assistants developed as a result of this EIT Digital innovation activity and commercialised by SARA Robotics provide a turnkey hardware and software solution for care institutions and hospitals to improve care recipients' quality of life and provide support to alleviate caregiver-staffing shortages. For instance, the SARA robot can support elderly people suffering from first-stage dementia to perform specific exercises designed to improve their mental and physical fitness and delay entering the second, more acute stage of the illness. The robot can also play games, support music therapy and perform repetitive tasks, such as reminding staff and clients of certain events and checking the client's wellbeing. For now, SARA Robotics aims at commercialising the product almost exclusively on the Dutch market. Starting next year, the startup will expand its reach by enabling different kinds of robot hardware systems to run the SARA software, and it will try to enter the European and the United States markets. 'Hopefully next year we will create another map of SARA's presence in care institutions, and we will pin all these pointers across the globe,' Hendriks said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit542,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-drives-plan-pay-health-not-illness,"EIT Health drives plan to pay for health, not illness","A start-up launched through an EIT Health Innovation Project has signed a five-year agreement with the Stockholm Region to help people at risk of type 2 diabetes remain in good health, while leading a revolution in the way we think about paying for healthcare. Instead of asking healthcare to pay when people get sick, the health bond originally envisioned by the Health Integrator start-up provides pay-outs when people improve their health through preventative measures. This approach can ultimately reduce illness and the cost of healthcare. The Stockholm Region is now pioneering the new model in partnership with the Swedish bank SEB and the insurance company Skandia, who provide a unique financing instrument, and Health Integrator, who are responsible for the initiative and the development of the digital platform. A two-year EIT Health Innovation Project called the Health Movement was started in 2017. It involved EIT Health Partners RISE, Stockholm Region, Karolinska Institutet, IESE Business School, West Midlands Academic Health Science Network, Semmelweis University and City of Rotterdam, as well as commercial partners MSD and Apoteket. As part of the Innovation Project, the spinout company Health Integrator was launched, with the aim of strengthening the conditions for healthier individuals and preventing non-communicable diseases. Work began on an investment model to provide financial rewards for good health results, resulting in the model now launched. This system transformation would never have happened if we had not received support for our innovation project through EIT Health at an early stage. They dared to invest in something innovative that was based on future systems Fredrik Söder, CEO, Health Integrator Initially, up to 925 Stockholmers at risk of developing type 2 diabetes will be offered the use of Health Integrator’s digital health platform and app for five years. With the support of a personal health coach and tests, participants can buy preventative health services and products through the Health Integrator platform. Each user gets a “wallet” loaded with money to shop for selected health services. They can also pay by credit card or use their employer’s healthcare allowance. In the short term, this leads to better health, and in the longer term, changed lifestyle habits can prevent them from developing type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. The increasing burden of type 2 disease, for individuals and for society, can be prevented. “With Health Integrator, we want to give individuals the right conditions to succeed in changing their living habits in a sustainable way. With health tests, support of coaching conversations – together with a health pedagogue and a tailor-made ‘basket of solutions’, based on the individual’s conditions and needs – the chances of success increase to consume health,” said Health Integrator’s Fredrik Söder. The project is financed through a SEK 30 million loan (Health Impact Bond) from Skandia, an insurance company. If a participant develops type 2 diabetes, Skandia covers part of the cost, but if the participant is found to have reduced the risk of diabetes, Skandia receives a return of up to 10% percent of the investment. One unique aspect of the solution is that the Stockholm Region does not incur any costs in the first few years. After five years, the region would pay around SEK 23-33 million, depending on outcomes. There will also be savings if people stay healthy and do not require expensive care. Stockholm Region expects to receive up to 100% return on investment. One reason why Stockholm Region has confidence in the Health Integrator is that it has been proven effective in a clinical study. “Few apps have been scientifically evaluated, but the Health Integrator app has been tested in a randomised controlled study of just over 200 people,” says Ylva Trolle Lagerros, Chief Physician at the Overweight Center in the Stockholm Region, a researcher at the Karolinska Institute and leader of the pilot study. “After three months we were able to see statistically significant differences in health variables such as waist size and blood pressure between the group that used the Health Integrator app and the group that did not receive the app.” It is fantastic to see how EIT Health’s Partners, through Health Integrator, a project we have supported for several years, are now driving the development of health bonds. It is an exciting development that shows how social value can be created through disease prevention and provide significant cost savings for healthcare Erik Forsberg, Managing Director of EIT Health Scandinavia Last year, Health Integrator participated in EIT Health Headstart, an EIT Health Accelerator programme that assists start-ups with product and service verification. With Headstart support, Health Integrator was able to refine the packaging of its service and develop a digital health platform for consumers. In the long term, the solution can be made available in other regions and reach a wider group that is ready to pay for itself. “In a next step, we think that our service will be paid directly by the user or through the employer’s health care allowance and insurance. By offering different arrangements and payment solutions, we can make it easier for users to consume health and thereby avoid healthcare consumption” said Fredrik Söder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first edition of the Venture Program was launched in 2018 with two partner accelerators (ABC Accelerator in Ljubljana and Found.ation in Athens). It covered 10 Balkan countries and graduated 13 ventures. In 2019 the program expanded to 27 ventures with 2 new editions run by Startup Wise Guys in the Baltics and BGI in Lisbon.  This year, despite the COVID-19 situation, five regional editions run simultaneously, by adding an edition in Poland with Krakow Technology Park. EIT Digital is ready to invest more than €500,000 to support the winners. In uncertain times, the EIT Digital Venture Program is a committed and startup-friendly partner for entrepreneurial teams in a pre-MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and pre-company early stage of development. The program pivoted to be held fully online, attracting more and more mixed teams from different innovation ecosystems, making location barriers disappear and helping talents to easily connect and complement their skills. Several of the selected teams address issues raised by the Covid-19 outbreak. The 33 entrepreneurial teams that joined the program come from 14 European countries. They have each been awarded a financial support of €5,000 and are currently engaged in the pre-acceleration programs with the objective to quickly move their MVP forward and establish their company. Depending on the quality of their MVP and on whether they have managed to incorporate on time, they will be able to receive an additional €10,000 Prize that can be increased up to €20,000 for those that have also managed to attract a third party investment.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit546,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/citizen-activation-essential-europe-meet-its-climate-ambition,Citizen activation is essential for Europe to meet its climate ambition,"The debate on how to achieve ambitious climate targets is often dominated by a technocratic discourse centred around developing new technologies to “solve-it-all.” Only a small minority of resources and attention goes towards those who have to live with the new paradigm: Citizens. Therefore, their role in shaping their own future is limited. EIT Climate-KIC has been working on activating citizen participation in climate action for a decade with programmes like Climathon, Young Innovators and Pioneers into Practise. Drafting lessons from this experience, the organisation suggests embedding the European Climate Pact in wider systems transformation activities. EIT Climate-KIC is already working on a systems innovation approach where citizens and communities can act within larger and orchestrated transformations. Launched at the end of 2018, the Deep Demonstration projects have unveiled how critical new models of community and governance are to addressing the climate emergency. The European Climate Pact is a broad initiative launched by the European Commission as part of the European Green Deal. It aims to give everyone a voice and space to design new climate actions, share information, launch grassroots activities and showcase solutions that others can follow. In its contribution to the consultation on the future Pact, EIT Climate-KIC highlights the importance of including groups that are currently under-represented in the climate conversation, as well as empowering citizens and decision-makers to collaborate to build a more sustainable future. It also suggests that the European Climate Pact should address and support a systemic and portfolio-based approach, new models of transition governance and new financial mechanisms unlocking new sources of funding.

During the three days (3-5 June) of this global conference, almost 5,000 people from 185 countries attended one of its 60 sessions. Additionally, the live broadcast of the sessions received over 77,000 views and reached 50 million people on social media.  The emergence of zoonotic diseases (infectious diseases transmitted between humans and other animals) like COVID-19 have links to deforestation, and food production and consumption, revealing a responsibility to transform our food and land systems to secure human and planetary well-being. This has instigated a global conversation on how to “build back better” as well as a call for a green recovery plan. The current health crisis acted as an important frame for the conference. Relevant to this frame, EIT Climate-KIC presented its strategy for European climate action, Transformation, in time. The strategy describes how EIT Climate-KIC plans to catalyse systemic change through innovation in areas of human activity that have a critical impact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience: Land use, materials, cities and finance. Leveraging his expertise on landscapes, Daniel Zimmer moderated a panel on how strong alliances can achieve a sustainable future. The session’s main insight was that human and environmental rights, trustful multi-stakeholder partnerships and taking strategic risks are key to scaling landscape programmes in the coming years. The full session may be viewed here. In her session, Pernille Martiny Modvig reminded the audience that Europe is in a state of climate emergency and that the EU Commission President Van der Leyen, as early as November 2019, called for a systemic response. She added: “COVID-19 has shown us we are capable of reacting quickly, comprehensively and systemically in response to the crisis as a society.” She referred to the usefulness of the lessons learned from managing the health crisis, to address an “emerging food crisis due to climate change and biodiversity loss.”  Understanding the speed of climate action so far has been insufficient, Martiny Modvig told the audience that, in order to act six times faster to reach zero-emissions in time, it’s necessary to change the traditional approach to innovation towards a systemic one.  Martiny Modvig described food systems as incredibly complex, saying you can’t create lasting change by simply adjusting the pieces along the value chain. If we are to create fair and resilient change, we need to consider that farmers, retailers and consumers alike will be affected and this will have social, political, financial and cultural implications. Martiny Modvig’s full sessions may be viewed here and here. Both Daniel Zimmer and Pernille Martiny Modvig are involved in EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstrations, Landscapes as Carbon Sinks and Resilient Food Systems & Diets respectively. These programmes act as demonstrators of the organisation’s strategy, Transformation, in time, and were designed to meet the increasing demand for EIT Climate-KIC’s role as an orchestrator of systems innovation. EIT Climate-KIC’s systems innovation model uses a balanced portfolio of interventions—across education, technological innovation, citizen engagement, policy, finance, etc.—to catalyse fast decarbonisation and drive climate adaptation.

That was the idea of the EIT Food Consumer Engagement Lab organised with seniors in Extremadura (Spain), an experimental initiative based on the concept of “Design Thinking”. Over two sessions, a group of 20 seniors met with a selection of stakeholders from the agrifood sector, including Inura (The University of Extremadura Institute of Agronomic Resources), food businesses Iberitos and Lider Aliment; Hinepa - Asociación Internacional de Atención a la Persona, and the innovation agency Brain CO. The encounter produced amazing results. Just a few short months later, the group created and brought to market two new, gluten-free products: a tuna and piquillo pepper pâté and a cream of ceps with truffle. As well as idea-sharing, the process of bringing forth the two new products involved a viability and market study, during which another six product ideas fell by the roadside. The two selected products are being brought to market by Iberitos, as producer, and Lider Aliment, as Spar retailer, and are currently available at eight supermarkets across Extremadura: in Badajoz, Mérida, Almendralejo, Castuera, Don Benito, Villanueva de la Serena and Zafra. As the creators explain, tuna and piquillo peppers is an unusual combination on the market, but not in Spanish homes. It is both tasty and healthy, with the advantage that it is “more practical than making it at home”, allowing cooks to “cut down on ingredients and food waste”. The cream of ceps with truffle has been designed to pair with meat, as a “little treat” for lovers of intense flavours. Both products are supplied in glass jars, which make it easier to check their preservation status and are also reusable, testimony to the growing environmental awareness among seniors. The products hit the shelves in late March, under the Iberitos brand and carrying the EIT Food label. Eduvigis Campos, one of the seniors who took part in the experience, described the sessions as “very interesting and enjoyable”, adding that they provided an opportunity to share her cooking skills and food habits with others. It was also a “break from routine”, something that she described as “very important to keep the mind and the body active.”  The pilot experience took place simultaneously in Spain, Portugal, Poland and Lithuania. Based on the success of the project, EIT Food now plans to replicate it in another six countries this year: Italy, Greece, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the UK wants to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050, almost all of the country’s 29 million homes need to be improved, meaning 1.8 homes need to be retrofitted every minute between now and 2050.   Primarily funded by EIT Climate-KIC, Accelerator Cities supports towns and cities in developing their own home retrofit programmes; helps coordinate action between them—including sharing best practices, lessons learned, evidence and resources; supports a coordinated approach in respect of links to financial institutions and funding opportunities; encourages greater partnership between industry and NGO groups on home retrofit; and helps to coordinate cities’ engagement with central government on this topic. Boosting the rate of home retrofits will provide crucial support for health and well-being, accelerate the transition to net-zero and create jobs in all parts of the country. To help achieve this, UKGBC has brought together city and combined authority partners: Birmingham City Council, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, the Greater London Authority, Leeds City Council and the West Midlands Combined Authority. A range of other expert stakeholders are also on board including the Active Building Centre, Bioregional, Energy Saving Trust, Green Alliance, Otley Energy, Places in Common, RetrofitWorks and UK100.  John Alker, Director of Policy & Places at UKGBC said: “There is a critical need to improve the nation’s health, reduce carbon emissions and create long-lasting economic benefits. Home retrofit is a triple-win that supports all three goals. Although central Government still holds many of the keys to unlocking this, cities and local authorities are stepping up to play a crucial leadership role. Accelerator Cities is all about supporting and enabling greater coordination between local government on home retrofit. The project will help city and local authorities as they grapple with issues such as householder engagement, skills and finance—helping to build an evidence base, learn lessons and share common approaches.” Learn more",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit560,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-supported-climeworks-raises-over-eu67-million-expand-its-carbon,EIT Climate-KIC supported Climeworks raises over €67 million to expand its carbon dioxide removal capacities,"This is the largest private investment into direct air capture to date. The funding will help to drive forward the company’s scale-up roadmap and expand its carbon dioxide removal capacities. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by over a third since the Industrial Revolution began. These emissions have already increased global temperatures by around 1°C since pre-industrial times. There are two ways of dealing with CO2 emissions today. The first one is not emitting them in the first place: We can do so by reducing our consumption, using current technologies more efficiently and shifting to low-carbon technologies. The other option, which comes in addition to the first one, is to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the air. We are very thankful for the long-term commitment of our investors, who shared our vision of a climate-positive world from the very beginning. This financing round will take Climeworks to the next level and help us make an ever-bigger contribution to reversing climate change. We aim to inspire one billion people to remove carbon dioxide from the air—and this investment will contribute to achieve that goal Christoph Gebald, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Climeworks Founded by engineers Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher, Climeworks is one of the global leaders in carbon dioxide removal. The company’s patented technology captures CO2 directly from the air using clean energy. The air-captured carbon dioxide is then either returned to earth, stored safely and permanently away for millions of years, or it is upcycled into climate-friendly products such as carbon-neutral fuels and materials, fertiliser for greenhouses or bubbles in your fizzy drinks. The Climeworks direct air capture technology runs exclusively on clean energy, and the modular CO2 collectors can be stacked to build machines of any size. The successful financing round takes the Swiss company, which went through EIT Climate-KIC’s Accelerator programme in 2012 and 2013, another step closer to achieving its vision of capturing one per cent of global CO2 emissions by 2025. This new round of funding brings the total sum invested in Climeworks since it was founded in 2009, to over CHF 120 million and will be used to expand Climeworks’ carbon dioxide removal capacities, help to further scale and optimise the direct air capture technology and make it accessible to more stakeholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit562,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-backed-start-gets-funds-sleeping-robot,EIT Health-backed start-up gets funds for sleeping robot,"A robot that helps people get to sleep without medication woke the interest of a Dutch investment fund, which put significant growth capital into Somnox, a sleep-aid start-up that has been accelerated by several EIT Health programmes since 2016. Somnox announced on 19 May 2020 that Health Investment Partners (HIP) would provide the investment to complete the start-up’s Series A round of funding. Series A funding is the first venture capital round of funding for a start-up and a major milestone that indicates a company has a credible path to success with a viable product. Somnox’s product is a soft robotic designed to help people sleep better. At bedtime, a person “spoons” with the device, which synchronises with the user’s breathing and helps them achieve a steady rhythm, a technique that has been shown to encourage sleep. The device senses when a person wakes up and helps to regulate their breathing so that they fall back asleep again. Other sleep aids include sounds – the device can play white noise or tell bedtime stories – and control of temperature and light, to make sure the user does not oversleep. Users can change the settings with a smartphone-based app. The device has developed broad interest from the large group of people suffering from insomnia, and the start-up already has 4,500 customers. According to an announcement from Somnox, the investor HIP noted the value of sleep for strengthening our immune system, which is especially important during the current pandemic. Beginning in 2016, the year in which they launched their start-up, Somnox has been supported by several EIT Health Accelerator programmes, including: Somnox was also presented to the media through a 2017 EIT Health event for journalists held in Paris. Somnox was launched by a team at Delft University of Technology, an EIT Health Core Partner. Co-Founder Julian Jagtenberg said his effort to find a way to help his mother deal with insomnia led him to start a company that has proven successful. “The new capital will enable us to accelerate our growth worldwide,” according to Jagtenberg.  We can scale up faster to achieve our mission of helping 100 million people sleep better in 2030.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit563,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-reassess-our-values-new-normal,EIT Climate-KIC and partners reassess our values in the ‘new normal’,"Under the Long-termism Deep Demonstration, we have dedicated an area of action to understanding how we can rethink notions of value. 2020 brought promises of a new decade of action, but it turned into a drastic respite from the pace of life. The world slowed down, and our way of life changed as a result of COVID-19. Health has become a priority and we are already seeing the effects of this pandemic affect our global and our local economy. Governments are now scrambling to balance lockdown with stimulus packages to curb the effects of the inevitable recession. We have rapidly changed the way we live, how we move, how we socialise and how we eat. What is emerging is a ‘new normal’—a reevaluation of what society values. We might eventually need to “reassess the values that guide us in reorganising our society.” We haven’t built resilience in our system. Our current society is fed by short-term cycles of supply and demand, built on relatively young economic theories of Keynes, neoliberalism and growth paradigms. When the demand drops, our economy suffers. This fragility has only served to emphasise the importance of building a sustainable and resilient society—one that can minimise the effects of covariate shocks, and also sustain its basic core after the shock has passed. Examples are already coming out of people finding value in other forms—such as singing on balconies, acts of welfare such as helping with their shopping but also in the ultimate dilemmas of supporting life which have brought Italian doctors to tears. None of these could be measured in monetary costs and benefits. For years now, society has been mounting a reaction to achieve long-term safety in the face of climate upheaval. It’s diverse and unevenly distributed. it grows at the edges of society: In ecovillages, local currencies, neo-municipality cities and so on. These experiments are so efficient they can survive in a short-term economy, while still taking care of the long-term Alberto Cottica – Edgeryders What’s more, our investment in building resilience and sustainability into our system means that the benefits may not be realised now. Many of the investments needed for mitigating future impacts and shocks that climate change will bring, such as investments in infrastructure, energy and property, will require long-term orientation. Considering long-term impact is critical to unlocking resources today for climate action. Also we need an economic and financial system that can appropriately allocate the resources needed and unlock the financial flows for remedial and preventative climate action. Money—our basic currency for exchanging value—has become the fundament for accumulation of wealth, which perpetuates cycles of short-term gain and returns. Value is the basis on which our current financial system has accumulated its wealth—to release the needed capital to invest into climate action and sustainability, we must experiment with redefining notions of value by looking at new money paradigms and alternative value creation that can allow people to define, express and exchange what they value and therefore how we invest. Some examples of the positions we want to explore are looking at the role of the gift economy and inheritance, as well as how incentives can work over time. Our design partners are experimenting with or would like to experiment with ways to rethink notions of value: Edgeryders Edgeryders is working to extend the space of economic models that are conceivable and deployable. Conceivable: As Edgeryders puts it: “It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism. But if we do not go beyond TINA (There Is No Alternative), we have to carry on business-as-usual. This will kill us all.” Edgeryders therefore uses techniques from modelling, speculative fiction, economic history, anthropology and design to broaden the space of “conceivable economies.” Deployable: As argued above, there’s already a “mutant population” of economic agents that operate in the current economy, while aspiring to a more long-termism one. Edgeryders learns from these agents, in order to come up with policies to thrive and grow further. ETH Zurich ETH Zurich supports mass experimentation in two directions: First, they enable independent incentive systems that allow and push for mass innovation for climate change mitigation. Such systems are bottom-up and democratic like regional currencies, and beyond that, allow entirely new incentive designs to cater to community needs for maintaining common-pool resources.  Second, novel solutions like basic income, personal data markets, etc., are too urgently needed to leave to institutions to mull over for years. ETH Zurich’s technology allows communities to experiment with these new schemes for real, today. These communities should not need to wait for permission by governments or banks to help themselves if they can. In the spirit of open source development, ETH Zurich wants competition in such projects and in the underlying financial systems powering them. IOTA The generation of value is rooted in networks of trust and shared definitions of value. Today’s economy is characterised by globally distributed, centralised networks that work towards a unidimensional objective: Maximising shareholder value. Together with financialisation and increasing automation, this leads to externalities, inequalities and fragile societies. The opensource IOTA protocol aims to remove friction in the transaction of value and information between diverse actors by creating digital trust. Together with ETI Climate-KIC, the IOTA Foundation is exploring how convergent technologies such as the Internet of Things and Distributed Ledgers can empower people with a permission less infrastructure to engage in peer-to-peer economies to collaborate on creating value in their communities and in harmony with the natural systems they inhabit. Decentralised networks of trust and information will be the backbone of a long-term sustainable, resilient economy based on pluralistic notions of value. Clearly, if we want to radically change our financial systems, we still have a long way to go. Through our systematic and innovative approach within Deep Demonstration Long-termism, we look at a wide range of challenges and possible solutions. We give our community and other interested parties the space and resources to test and scale up these solutions. Examples of what we focus on with this Deep Demonstration are: While many humans insist democratic principles are best suited to govern collectives, the design of our money system is blatantly undemocratic. Instead of a mono-dimensional, monopolistic system of money, we need to consider multi-dimensional incentives to create more robust financial systems and we need decentralised communities rather than monopolies to create and distribute currencies. Above all, the new system needs sustainability to be baked into its core design by removing externalities as much as possible Marcus Dapp – ETHZ University We’d like to get in touch with parties from Europe and beyond who want to innovate with us. Would you like to receive more information about the possibilities? Please email us    The Deep Demonstration Long-termism focuses on changing mindsets and devising ways to stimulate long-term thinking. Only this way will we achieve sustainable behaviour, and make impactful investments in sustainability possible. Using a proprietary methodology, we design various systematic interventions within entire ecosystems. It has been proven this methodology leads to actual climate, economic and social impact. Together with a consortium of expert partners, this Deep Demonstration focuses on five areas: The focus of the work up until now has been designing for interventions that can incentivise behavioural and mindset change throughout society, deliberately widening the lens from the financial sector after a key realisation that such systemic impact can only be realised through a holistic and systemic approach within our social systems, as short-termism is essentially rooted in concepts of human identity, sensory capacity, language and power structures, and institutions. 2° Investing Initiative, Centre for Systems Solutions, The Culture Initiative, Dark Matter Labs, Edgeryders, ETHZ University, FFRC Turku University and UNESCO, Influence Map, IOTA Foundation, Luvent Consulting, Red Cross Climate Centre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit564,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-launches-guidance-value-based-health-care,EIT Health launches guidance on Value-Based Health Care ,"EIT Health has launched a new framework for achieving Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) to improve patient outcomes and reduce waste of healthcare resources. Designed with insights from established pioneers in the field and laid out in a practical handbook, the framework describes key steps healthcare providers can take to fully realise the opportunity presented by VBHC. Unlike traditional volume-based healthcare provision, modelled on fees for-products or services, VBHC provides a methodology for measurable healthcare outcomes that make the biggest difference to patients, while driving cost efficiencies within health services. The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that around 30% of resources currently spent on healthcare are wasted on avoidable complications, unnecessary treatments or administrative inefficiencies. Tackling this waste head on, the publication from EIT Health aims to kick-start change towards measurable value, in order to support more sustainable models for healthcare. The new EIT Health publication “Implementing Value-Based Health Care: Handbook for Pioneers”, includes an “Implementation Matrix” with a clear and structured framework for healthcare providers to follow. The Matrix details five key steps to help healthcare providers activate and accelerate VBHC: 1) recording; 2) comparing; 3) rewarding; 4) improving; and 5) partnering. It outlines how to measure and maximise the outcomes that matter to patients, and addresses the main challenges, such as lack of standardised outcome data and resistance to change. Read the handbook Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health, explains the need for this work: “In recent years, there has been a growing interest in VBHC in the health community in Europe; however the focus has been on why it is the way forward, rather than how we effectively implement such a change. This is why we created this framework, to provide an in-depth guide on how health care managers and practitioners can orient efforts and resources towards necessary transformation. Currently, many of Europe’s health care systems measure the wrong things, which can lead to inefficiencies in cost, time and resources, not to mention the impact on the patient. Metrics focus on volume rather than patient outcomes, and this is simply unsustainable for health care systems. At EIT Health, we are uniquely placed to connect successful pioneers in the field with those just starting out, and to share tools and best practices to help measure outcomes to drive this cultural shift within Europe’s health care systems.” Development of this EIT Health handbook has been directed by Professor Gregory Katz of the University Paris School of Medicine and achieved in collaboration with esteemed experts from across leading European organisations. The new framework is based on several VBHC case studies from some of Europe’s leading healthcare providers, including: Uppsala Academic Hospital, which reduced the number of unnecessary ambulance dispatches by 17%; Basel University Hospital, which improved the median time from stoke symptom to treatment onset by 14%; and NHS Wales, which identified that in 19% of cases, high-cost cataract surgery had no real impact on a patient’s activity limitations in daily life. According to Professor Gregory Katz: “Today in Europe, VBHC pioneers are choosing to take bold action to measure, compare and improve patient outcomes. This momentum is mainly building from the bottom up, through entrepreneurial initiatives. As care results vary tremendously between therapeutic approaches and medical teams, transparent outcome benchmarks enable the detection of medical innovations and the reduction of inappropriate care. There are good reasons to be impatient for improving health care through VBHC, but there are also reasons to be humble. VBHC is still in its infancy, and successful implementation takes time. Becoming a VBHC early adopter opens the opportunity to learn proactively and spearhead high-value care.” The handbook was commissioned by EIT Health under its Think Tank thought leadership forum, which explores the most pressing topics for the health of Europe and its citizens. The EIT Health Think Tank brings healthcare leaders together, across disciplines and borders, to prepare the ground for life-changing innovation and identify the next opportunity for a transformation in how healthcare is delivered. The launch of the handbook marks the first in a series of activities being launched by EIT Health that are designed to support a step-change in the provision of healthcare and to integrate VBHC as the new norm across Europe.

Since January, seventeen new start-ups have been welcomed into EIT Manufacturing’s business creation funnel and are now getting support to scale up their activities. Some of these start-ups have already been identified as high potential European Gazelles, with high-growth and international scaling potential. According to Wolfgang Kniejski, Senior Business Creation Manager, several of the start-ups share some common denominators: A focus on critical assets in the production network, and continuous improvement and monitoring of the communication between humans, machines, and ERPs systems as well as workflows. The innovations include several technological challenges that our manufacturing companies are facing, such as real-time perception and manipulation systems for robots, efficient shop floor management, Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality systems for intuitive work instructions as well as cybersecurity solutions for industrial IoT only to name a few. Wolfgang Kniejski, Senior Business Creation Manager, CLC Central, said: Our role is to understand their specific needs and support them in accessing European markets and international customers. We have already kicked-off the initial support actions, such as supporting them with concrete lead generation and networking. EIT Manufacturing helps the entrepreneurs to take their business idea to the next level, providing hands-on advice and support for lead generation, access to key decision makers, as well as inviting the start-ups to various networking and match-making events. As a first step, some of EIT Manufacturing’s partners are starting to engage with the identified startups, in order to explore future joint projects or use cases, such as for Artificial Intelligence or supply chain solutions. In these cases, EIT Manufacturing may already have information about a pressing technology challenges disclosed by industrial company or partner, and acts as an intermediary between the start-ups, and potential buyers or customers. EIT Manufacturing’s regional co-location centers are also co-operating with start-up ecosystems in Germany,  Poland and the Netherlands, to name a few. Eight of the start-ups nurtured by Co-Location Center Central have already been accepted in a catalogue and will be presented to potential buyers coming from German industrial companies at a match-making event organised by Gründerallianz in mid-June.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit566,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/applications-open-startups-fight-cope-water-scarcity-southern-europe,Applications open for startups that fight to cope with Water Scarcity in Southern Europe!,"Deadline: 07/06/2020 Although there are still people that perceive water scarcity as something alien to Europe, the data shows that this issue is one of the main challenges that the continent will have to face in the coming years. A third of Europe is already suffering water stress situations with drought in Greece, Portugal or Spain, as well as difficulties in other countries like Germany, according to The European Environment Agency (EEA). With the objective of bringing innovative solutions for this reality, EIT Food will select a total of 30 startups -presented in Italy, Greece and Spain- that seek to cope with water scarcity. The call, which will be held for the first time this year, is already opened through this link and ends the 7th of June. EIT Food, along with EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Manufacturing and EIT Raw Materials, intends to support innovators to reach the market with technologies and services that prevent and mitigate water scarcity, as well as the overuse of water. Startups working with social innovation tools/solutions are also invited to apply to this call, in particular, those focused on raising awareness, water governance, learning strategies and methods to save water, and organizational solutions to manage water more efficiently. The aim is, without a doubt, to increase the competitiveness in Southern Europe through innovative solutions tackling water scarcity and drought, as well as its over usage, with the aim to move towards a sustainable water economy (water-efficient and water-saving). To that purpose, solutions that – from the thematic categories of agrifood, climate, raw materials and manufacturing- give answer to one of the significant challenges detected by our Body of Knowledge, -a group of 16 experts working on the identification of the main issues affecting water scarcity- will be selected. These challenges are: The 30 selected startups will have to be already a legal entity or in very advanced process to set one, and cannot be older than 3 years, neither have generated more than €1M in revenue in the last year and raised more than €500k in equity-based funding.  They will have access to a training and mentoring circuit that will end with the presentations of their projects and an economic prize-giving for the six best participants. The applicators must be resident, citizen or legal entity based in the next countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Faroe Islands, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, Republic of North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine. The itinerary is created for the companies to develop their business and competitive skills, with the aim of incrementing business opportunities, find investors and have their solutions hit the market, in order to impact on the society. The 30 selected startups will participate in a 3 step programme: training, mentoring and competition. It will start the 25th of June of this year, with a virtual training in business study cases in which business and mentors will be networking. Between June and October mentoring sessions will be developed in order to advise each project in the achievement of the identified obstacles. Finally, between September and October the ´InnoWise Challenge Labs’ will be held in three countries: Italy, Greece and Spain. In each of the countries ten startups will compete in the different countries that can apply for the call, showing their solutions. The winner of each country will receive 10.000 euros and 5.000 the second, with six startups awarded in total, and these will be used for investments in machinery, the production of the first product runs, developing consumer tests or the payment of licenses and industrial propriety.  The ‘InnoWise Challenge Lab’ in Spain will be held the week of the 24th of September in Malaga during the Smart-Agrifood congress, the Italy one will be celebrated the week of the 12th of September in the Fiera del Levante, and the Greece Lab will be vinculated to the Green Deal in Athens, which dates are still to be confirmed.

Click here for more information and to apply for the 2020 edition. All of us who have grandparents or elderly relatives have had some experience with pressure ulcers - a medical condition caused by long-term bed rest. In truth, it is a health problem that could be avoided, according to Mohammad Amini. And he does not just talk about it but leads a team that has invented a product to predict the risks. “Both my grandparents died while suffering from pressure ulcers,” says Mohammad Amini, the Team Leader of SensoMatt. That was the point when he first started thinking about a solution. Since pressure ulcers affect not just the elderly, but also disabled people and other patients lying in hospitals, it is a common medical problem that needs treatment. ""My grandparents were old, but the pressure ulcer phenomena and the pain caused by the wounds made me think about why there is no reliable solution to alert and forecast,"" he says. Last year, Amini and his uncle started to develop their solution. It contains hardware and an AI-based structure for prediction. ""After I talked with a friend of mine about AI development, we started to produce our MVP [minimum viable product], and then enrolled in the EIT Digital Venture Program due to a friend’s recommendation.” The scope of EIT Digital's Venture Program is nothing other than helping ideas like SensoMatt’s reach markets and customers. The team had the first ideas and a basic prototype in 2019. Then, with the help of EIT Digital and its partners' experience, they found a way to grow. With their help, they are taking the invention to the areas of use: hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. SensoMatt is a multiplatform solution. It contains a thin smart sheet, that can be placed under any kind of mattress, and an AI-driven cloud system processing all earned data. The sensors in the sheet track the real-time pressure distribution. The AI-based algorithm analyses this data and pressure ulcers can be detected or predicted. During the EIT Digital Venture Program, Amini and his team developed a unique, affordable and reliable device that is suitable to use not just in hospitals but also in homecare. The company is in negotiations with Portuguese and Belgian medical centres. CHwapi, the Belgian medical centre, is one of the investors in SensoMatt, having provided €100,000. Even if the motivation behind the development process is a heart-breaking life event for Amini, many people could benefit from this device.

Click here for more information and to apply for the 2020 edition. Being hospitalised with a serious illness is hard for everyone, but for a child it is even more shocking. Knowing the treatment plans in place and familiarising oneself with the medical world can help to reduce anxiety. To make this process easier, Serious Games for Health gamifies the learning and curing paths for children. Blood collection, chemotherapy, and physiotherapy are just some of the frightening medical procedures that can affect a child. Just as it does for adults, a serious illness makes them fearful and the lack of information can cause anxiety. Serious Games for Health intends to be a new strategy to enhance therapeutic adherence and health literacy. The focus is on decreasing hospitalisation rates by increasing physical activity and decreasing anxiety among people struggling with specific diseases  Hernâni Zão Oliveira, founder of Serious Games for Health  “Our solution transforms the way we deal with sickness and treatment through engaging, interactive and easy-to-use methods,” says Zao. The games he develops address topics like therapeutic adherence, fear of hospitalisation or specific treatments, and reducing anxiety related to illnesses. Additionally, there is a focus on education, as teaching patients about their medical conditions is crucial. Converting a treatment plan into a course of games makes the process more fun and less intimidating. The prototype was made for paediatric oncology, and after several tests and plenty of interviews with doctors, nurses and parents, the results are trustworthy. Patients recorded lowered anxiety levels in the examined children at a Portuguese hospital. They got new information from the game about their illness and it made them more comfortable during the treatments and medical tests. Based on these promising results, Zao is planning more as well as different games for several other medical issues. Since playing these games does not require any special equipment, just a smartphone or a tablet, they can be applied as part of the medical routine. Although the first use case was about treatment of an illness, the developer says that prevention is important too. Thus, one of the main applications is to provide education about different medical conditions. With the help of EIT Digital’s Venture Program, Zao finished the test period and recorded informative interviews, while building up connections with Portuguese medical institutes and universities. In the fast-growing healthcare gamification market, Serious Games targets serious and exercise game categories for therapeutic and educational purposes. The startup aims to reach patients, caregivers, hospitals, healthcare centres, and some health tech companies and large pharmaceutical companies. With a strong base built up by the first project, HOPE, and several rewards like Astellas Oncology C3 Prize or Portuguese National Participatory Budgeting, Serious Games looks more than promising, and shows great potential for investors.

eit576,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/transformative-policies-climate-challenge,Transformative policies for the climate challenge,"To meet the scale and urgency of the climate emergency, business-as-usual in government won’t suffice. The IPCC report, which sets out what we need to do to keep global warming under 1.5°C by the end of century, has made it clear that we no longer have the luxury of time—change must happen now, across multiple sectors, and governments must adapt too. This climate challenge demands that we rethink the institutions, norms, beliefs and values that underpin our current governance structures and approach to policymaking. Rather than continuing to place our hopes in incremental improvements to the work done by governments and public authorities, we need to foster a rich culture of innovation and experimentation within government. And we need to work with communities to bring them along on the journey. To stand a chance of responding to climate change, policymaking must become innovative, inclusive, radical—transformative. How can we make this happen? Over the past year, I’ve been part of a team at EIT Climate-KIC, Europe’s largest climate innovation agency, that has been addressing this question. Funded by the EU, EIT Climate-KIC is pioneering the fast action needed to keep climate change under 1.5°C. We believe that multiple systems need to change simultaneously if we are to achieve a just, climate resilient society founded on a net zero-carbon, circular economy, and we have set up testbeds to put this into practice. Our Deep Demonstrations are just that: Eight large-scale pan-European initiatives made up of a coordinated portfolio of projects designed to trigger systems change. These initiatives—from Just Transformations to Resilient Regions and Long-termism—follow our systems innovation methodology, in which we collaborate with design partners on ambitious systems-level challenges that are identified by “challenge owners” such as city mayors, regional leaders, government ministers, citizen leaders and CEOs of major companies. While most of the Deep Demonstrations are in the early stages, the work we have done with Slovenia shows what we can accomplish. The Slovenian government has embraced the radical, holistic approach that underpins our Deep Demonstrations, and their parliament has passed a motion adopting our proposal to become a fully circular economy. This collaboration is a part of our overall vision for the Deep Demonstration model—to trigger rapid decarbonisation and enhanced resilience across Europe. Policy and governance innovations are a crucial component of the Deep Demonstrations. Collaborating alongside cities, regions and national governments that are interested in experimenting with a variety of innovative policy and governance approaches, we are moving from ideation to implementation. In preparation for designing these experiments, we have actively sought those at the coalface of policy and governance innovation for the climate challenge. Over the last year, we spent time in conversation with a diverse group of practitioners, including a forward-looking UK city councillor, a young political activist working within a progressive US think tank, a leader from the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change, several European academics, a pioneer of regulatory sandboxes in a national regulator and a policy expert involved in citizens’ assemblies. We wanted to find out how they define policy and governance innovation—what is it, and what is it not? Are there barriers to success and, conversely, are there key characteristics of a transformative climate policy innovation? Several themes emerged from the interviews, and drawn together here they outline the features of a successful policy innovation initiative. Every single person we interviewed told us that it is essential to centre the needs of the whole community (and not just the most politically engaged sections) when developing policy experiments. The negative effects of climate change will be greatest amongst the most vulnerable, and low-income populations, young people, immigrants (and others) in our communities may be overlooked during policy design. Interviewees spoke about the richness that comes from welcoming new opinions and collective intelligence to the process, and they emphasised how much governments can benefit from this cross-pollination. By starting from a place of “doing with” the community, rather than “doing to” them, real and lasting transformative changes—with representation at the heart—are possible. Innovative approaches that foreground how policy is made require us to meet people where they are, creating a space for discourse and engagement in the rigour of the design process. The end result is that the policy output will be capable of facing the complexities of real life. Our conversations really underscored that bringing the community along the journey as holistically as possible is directly proportional to the success or failure of an initiative, so it is crucially important. The community focus also links to how innovative policy must respond to concrete problems with an approach that is deeply in sync with the cultural, historical and sociological context of the area. What can be considered an “innovative” or simply an effective policy will vary from place to place, so a rich understanding of this background is needed before you even begin designing policies. And although cities and regions do often take inspiration and learn from each other, adapting and spreading successful solutions, the solutions that stick are those that address a community’s real challenges rather than just chasing a trend. In a time of increasing disillusionment with government, and facing a need for transformation on an unprecedented scale, it is incredibly important to bring the public along on the policy-making process and to give them reasons to be involved. Their input must serve a purpose and carry weight. New approaches to policy, if done well, can empower communities, giving citizens concrete experiences of catalysing change and demonstrating that policy can work for them and that their voices can make a difference. I was inspired by this article about the UK citizens’ assembly on climate, as it shows how ordinary people—many who weren’t originally interested in climate change—were drawn into the discussion, given tools to understand the science, and were then able to construct robust recommendations that will be fed back to government. Several interviewees pointed to narrative building and storytelling as a crucial component in fostering changes in behaviour and mindset, helping people to imagine what is possible. It’s also a powerful way to work through the various barriers to successful policies. For example, it can be used to foster community interest and engagement, pulling in a rich variety of actors. It could also help to build political will. This is especially important for a complex, “wicked” problem like climate change, where people may feel completely powerless to create change. Sweden’s Viable Cities program, which helps Swedish cities become carbon neutral by 2030, has even hired a chief storyteller to build a compelling narrative around the project and to connect people to the reality of climate change on an emotional level. According to chief storyteller Per Grankvist, “to reach the program’s mission, storytelling is believed to be a key to get people engaged enough to change their behaviour and norms.” Co-design is central to the endeavour, with stories from citizens, public servants and other stakeholders layering to create a comprehensive framework for understanding the various perspectives, needs and concerns from the groups, thus creating a foundation to engage people further. One central learning that emerged through the course of our explorations was that, if we are to create a space for policy innovation and experimentation to flourish, it is vital to innovate around governance processes and structures themselves. While it might be possible to experiment with new policies within a traditional bureaucratic and political structure, chances are it will be a struggle. The Vancouver EcoDensity program, launched in 2006, is an example of this. It aimed to increase density in low/medium dense urban areas along transport corridors in order to reduce urban sprawl and make the area more liveable, green and efficient, but the program’s traditional governance model and inability to respond to extensive public concerns seriously impeded the success of its original vision. So there is an exciting piece of work to be done around building new skills and mindsets in the public sector, fostering cross-governmental collaboration, new ways of including citizens and stakeholders in policy design processes, and new policy co-development, experimentation and implementation mechanisms. Looking at current governance set-ups, our interviewees highlighted the following problems: Public sector innovation has of course been widely discussed in recent years, and Apolitical has some great pieces that delve into actions and solutions. I also enjoyed the ideas in this article about building internal cultures within government departments to foster innovative thinking and comfort with experimentation. It isn’t an easy thing to solve for, but as Steven Stone, chief of UN Environment’s Resources & Markets Branch, points out, openness and curiosity can be such a powerful driver of change. Talk to peers and colleagues—find out if others are curious about working differently and start to build a community to champion the change you want to see. The effects of climate change cut across specialisations and sectors, and bringing people with varied backgrounds and expertise together can surface surprising new ideas to test. EIT Climate-KIC would really love to hear about your experiences  from the innovative policy and governance space, especially if you’ve been addressing the climate challenge.

eit579,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/battery-venture,EIT Climate-KIC supported TWAICE raises EUR 11 million for battery venture,"EIT Climate-KIC supported TWAICE, a Munich-based battery specialist, has raised EUR 11 million from early-stage VC investor Creandum and existing investors Cherry Ventures, UVC Partners and Speedinvest. The funding will be used to scale TWAICE software and power internationalisation efforts to contribute to the availability of sustainable mobility and energy solutions. Get the best of the EIT’s news once each month In just under two years, TWAICE has grown from a university research project into the top battery analytics software, attracting a diverse and global customer base, and investments. Cherry Ventures, UVC Partners and Speedinvest already invested EUR 3.2 million as part of an earlier seed round. We are very happy to have Creandum, an internationally recognised investor, onboard now. They share our vision of an analytics platform for e-mobility and renewable energies. Michael Baumann, Managing Director and Co-Founder of TWAICE TWAICE’s software creates a unique 'digital twin' of battery systems. It can be used to make precise analyses and predictions about the ‘health’ of each energy storage device. By using field data in combination with physical and data-driven battery models, TWAICE closes the loop between product development and application. But, even more so, the software also allows for new opportunities such as predictive maintenance and warranty extension. Operational failures can be detected—and prevented—in real time. The trend towards more comprehensive electrical strategies by major mobility and energy players is driving TWAICE’s success. Due to increasing pollution regulation, manufacturers have put greater emphasis on developing electric, emissions-free vehicles and, as a result, efficient batteries. The increasing popularity of lithium-ion batteries on the energy market is also accelerating the Munich-based company. Stationary storage units for example are used to avoid increased grid fees or to stabilise the grid. However, due to their cost and complexity, batteries are especially challenging regarding significant test scopes during development, a lack of transparency about their condition, and remaining lifetime during operation. The market is rewarding us for our mission to build the leading global team for battery analysis. Dr. Stephan Rohr, Managing Director and Co-Founder of TWAICE In recent years, the company has established itself as the market leader for battery analytics and has won leading customers from the automotive industry to truck manufacturers and power tool suppliers. The combination of in-depth battery knowledge, a scalable cloud platform, and machine learning is unique. With rapidly rising electrification in the mobility and energy sector, the battery market is at an inflection point. TWAICE predictive analytics solution unlocks a tremendous amount of value along the full battery lifecycle. We were impressed by the deep battery expertise of the team, the sophistication of their analytics platform and rapidly growing customer demand. We’re thrilled to support the team along their journey to further scale and expand to new markets. Peter Specht, Principal at Creandum The customer portfolio of TWAICE mainly consists of two sectors: energy and mobility. Energy companies use the software primarily for stationary energy storage systems. In the mobility sector, TWAICE enables manufacturers and fleet operators to improve both the development and use of lithium-ion batteries as well as to extend the batteries’ service life. The TWAICE software provides customers with more precise information about the processes taking place in the batteries during use. This way, operators of electric vehicle fleets, for example, can reduce their operating costs through predictive maintenance and achieve an increase in battery life of up to 25 per cent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit581,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-rawmaterials-advanced-training-mining-industry-professionals,EIT RawMaterials: advanced training for mining industry professionals,"Practical training and learning over the mining value chain are among the key components of lifelong knowledge building of mining experts and recognised as a challenge in the development of sustainable mining sector. However, it’s not so easy to find meaningful training opportunities, with the possibility of hands-on experiences of the multiple activities taking place in an operating mine. The EIT RawMaterials-supported MINETRAIN project was launched in 2018 to evaluate the potential of the shortly-closing Pyhäsalmi mine in Finland as an educational and training underground facility, and thus, prolong the utility of the existing modern mine site by introducing new business opportunities. One of the major objectives of the project is to produce and test practical training programmes for mining professionals at the Pyhäsalmi mine. Pyhäsalmi facilities enable training in all disciplines related to the overall mine value chain with the opportunity to test both skills and equipment in an authentic environment. Hence, the project has potential in providing education for sustainable management of any phase of mining operations. In summer 2019, MINETRAIN launched its first pilot course with 45 professionals from all over the globe joining an online course. Fourteen people were then selected for one-week practical training at the Pyhäsalmi mine site in August 2019. The course was developed to cover topics across the whole lifecycle of a mine. The course received the highest possible evaluations from the professional learners. Professionals emphasised the significance that the practical onsite training had for them. MINETRAIN gave meaning to the theory and improved the understanding of the bigger picture of mining at the various phases of the mine life. It was a great experience to learn different ways of doing mining and know more about the latest technology related to the care of the environment. At the same time thinking of networking, it was really helpful to meet miners from all around the world. The next MINETRAIN course will focus on new mining technology and will be held in summer 2020. After an online module, professionals will be able to use the latest equipment at Sandvik test mine in Tampere, Finland. MINETRAIN is a three-year project funded by EIT RawMaterials. The coordinator of the project is Oulu Mining School/the University of Oulu and TU Freiberg and partners are Pyhäsalmi Mine, Outotec, Sandvik, Normet and Schneider Electric.

eit582,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/raw-materials-global,EIT RawMaterials solving global cross value chain challenges of raw materials,"Raw materials have been, are and will continue to be the bedrock of the global economy. There is a complex value chain here, starting with the exploration, mining, processing and production of raw materials, all the way through to their being sold to consumers. There are human and automated processes, developed and developing countries, and a variety of tolerances working together here in the face of a whole host of ethical, environmental and social considerations. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials The decision-makers within industrial enterprises are obliged to verify the origins of the raw materials used for their products far more stringently. These days, the issue of sustainability can have a major influence on people’s decisions to buy products. Governments and communities are setting legal parameters. NGOs are taking a critical look at the countries of origin and at the supply chain as a whole. The modern-day consumer gives consideration to product origins and environmental aspects not only when it comes to food, but also increasingly with regard to clothing, electrical goods and the entire area of mobility. This is prompting companies to take a stance and to review their ethical, environmental and sustainable footprint. Get the best of the EIT’s news once each month In the past, this was left to the individual market players to address themselves – each and every exploration or mining company, every mineral processor, every shipping company, every manufacturer or service provider had to monitor their own internal or external standards. And they had to do so in a range of areas such as corruption, environmental impacts, labour conditions, child labour, social issues and corporate governance. The result which has evolved over time is an inefficient, inconsistent and fragmented landscape of raw material certification standards in which sustainability is defined differently from country to country, from mineral to mineral and from organisation to organisation. This hampers transparency within the supply chain and the verifiability of the parameters at a time when sustainability is evolving from being a cost factor to being an investment that is crucial to success. This was the starting point for the CERA innovation project. In terms of tonnage, around three quarters of all imports to the European Union are raw materials, the majority of which come from developing countries. We in Europe and in Germany therefore bear a particular responsibility for the conditions under which raw materials are mined. It’s all about observing standards, verifying the legality of mining and safeguarding investments, and about operational reliability and environmental impacts. A first step was taken in this regard with the adoption of the EU Regulation on conflict resources. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials According to Dr Klossek, a great deal more will be achieved with CERA. He added that it will be possible for the origins of raw materials to be unequivocally proven with the aid of a standardised analytical and comprehensive certification system which guarantees the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the exploration, mining, processing, trading and production of all mineral raw materials. Guarantees based on audit processes which can be scrutinised externally and covering the entire value chain – much like “well to wheel” considerations for the environmental footprints of fuels, we need a 'mine to product' consideration of raw materials. The Certification of raw materials (CERA) EIT RawMaterials is co-financing the development of the CERA standard and is supporting the introduction of the network to the mining community and to all other raw material-related sectors. It is also assuming three important roles. As an innovator, we are actively supporting technological developments that will help us achieve our goals, such as “fingerprinting” based on the analysis of trace elements and the use of blockchain software to verifiably track trade and transport routes. As an incubator, we are ensuring that such technologies make it to market maturity. We promote young companies, offer networking between researchers and businesses, and see to it that innovations are embraced sooner. Because it is a lot easier for us as a large network to achieve what an individual company, university or research institution is perhaps not able to. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials One of the CERA partners is one of its initiators DMT, which has close to 300 years of experience in the area of raw materials. Another is TÜV NORD CERT, which has great expertise regarding the existing certification and auditing systems. In turn, these two companies collaborate with the mining university Montanuniversität Leoben in Austria, the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the independent non-profit research centre RISE SICS in Sweden, as well as with companies such as LTU Business AB, likewise based in Sweden. The partners on the Advisory Board such as Fairphone and Volkswagen AG are, of course, just as important, as they ultimately represent the customer side of raw materials trading. Basically, any company is welcome to join us as a partner when we establish the CERA Association – the more companies that get involved, the sooner we will achieve the necessary market penetration and therefore also the desired level of transparency. Because only if we provide reliable information can the consumer make informed decisions regarding their manufacturer or product preferences. CERA will make this possible in Europe for the first time. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit583,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/ai-healthcare,EIT Health and McKinsey & Co. release report on AI in healthcare,"A new report from EIT Health and McKinsey & Company exposes an urgent need to attract, educate and train a generation of data-literate healthcare professionals, and to up-skill the current workforce in order to fully realise the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 'Transforming healthcare with AI: The impact on the workforce and organisations', a Europe-wide report published on 03 March 2020 explores the impact of AI on healthcare practitioners, as well as the implications and obstacles for scaling AI in healthcare organisations and systems. The report includes a survey of 175 people on the frontline of healthcare delivery, and interviews with 62 decision-makers, and is complemented by macroeconomic analyses from the work of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). Subscribe now to the EIT’s monthly newsletter Along with exploring the effect AI will have on the future of European healthcare and its workforce, the report highlights the need to define new organisational models and skillsets that healthcare professionals will need to support the adoption and scaling of AI. It also outlines the new types of talent that the healthcare sector will need to attract. The report finds that basic digital skills, biomedical and data science, data analysis, and the fundamentals of genomics will be critical, if AI and machine learning is to penetrate healthcare services. These subjects are rarely taught alongside traditional clinical sciences systematically. And so, through no fault of their own, today’s healthcare workforce is simply not yet equipped for the adoption of AI. Jorge Fernández García, Director of Innovation at EIT Health Download the EIT's AI report The incentives for healthcare systems to embrace these changes are clear. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that by 2030 the world will be short of 9.9 million doctors, nurses and midwives, which adds further urgency to address the challenge of already overburdened health systems. Supporting the widespread adoption and scaling of AI could help alleviate resource capacity shortfalls both now and in the future, for example, by streamlining or even eliminating administrative tasks, which can occupy anything between 20 and 80 percent of a healthcare professional’s time, according to the WHO. Being at the forefront of healthcare innovation in Europe, we are seeing an increasing number of tangible, impactful and exciting AI solutions created. However, we must couple the generation of new technology that can relieve some of the pressure on healthcare services, with the ability for it to be integrated into care delivery. Now is the time for us to address the gaps, so that Europe does not fall behind in the application of AI. Jorge Fernández García, Director of Innovation at EIT Health Besides upskilling, better involvement of healthcare professionals in the early stages of AI development was also identified in the report as a key need. Of the healthcare stakeholders interviewed for the report, 44% said they had never been involved in the development or deployment of an AI solution. AI has enormous potential to improve productivity and efficiency in health systems and make them more sustainable – but more importantly, it has the potential to deliver better health outcomes for patients. It can do so in many ways, from enabling more preventive care, to allowing healthcare practitioners to spend more time on direct patient care. This joint report provides guidance for decision-makers to define their level of aspiration on AI and develop and implement the right approach for their organisation or health system. Dr. Angela Spatharou, Partner at McKinsey & Company Decision-makers interviewed for the report emphasised the need to develop scaling up training and suggested that national health systems should work together with healthcare professionals, academia and industry in order to support healthcare providers, in particular those who are not large enough to deliver such programmes alone. They also emphasised the importance of ensuring AI is ethical, transparent and trustworthy. This new report provides a unique view on the state-of-play and prospects of AI for healthcare in Europe, covering areas including: strengthening data quality, governance, security and interoperability, implementing a robust change management strategy, addressing issues around regulation, policy-making and liability, redefining funding and reimbursement models and criteria for investment, and designing how disciplines can work better together to improve quality.

Peak load conditions, taking place when multiple users are accessing a website application concurrently, can be a nightmare for IT departments: crashes and slowdowns in these situations, are far too common and even a limited 2-hour crash can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost revenues. Typically, such issues are linked to a new product release, breaking news or a sales opening which causes a significant and sudden increase in traffic. A resilient and scalable system, in these circumstances, can make all the difference between failure and success. Some successful companies have measured the exact impact of performances on their business: Amazon estimates that only 100 ms latency equals -1% in sales, whereas the BBC saw a 10% decrease in users because of a 1-second latency. Gatling’s load-test-as-code approach and its interoperability make it possible to perform load tests very early in the development lifecycle and to automate them. Moreover, Gatling promotes a collaborative approach of load testing within organizations, involving all their departments, from IT to Marketing. Today, everyone talks about scalability. But you can’t scale your business if your app is not scalable. Don’t let your app become a victim of its own success: test it!  Paul-Henri Pillet, Gatling co-founder and CEO Gatling brought major changes in the load testing industry since it was created in mid-2015. Today, it has customers on 5 continents and doubles its revenues each year. 'Gatling has an impressive proposition: a superior technology bundled with a disruptive approach. They are enabling developers to test as they code, making it suddenly possible to fit with Agile and Continuous Delivery models which are so critical for those websites and apps facing massive numbers of visitors such as e-retail, media and banks,' said EIT Digital’s business developer Gilles Allain.  The scaleup’s R&D efforts target the latest trends in the tech world, including HTTP/2 support, load tests for Internet of Things, integrations with most of the cloud providers of the market (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack-based providers), integrations with Kubernetes and with most of the developers’ tools (source repositories, build tools, continuous integration solutions). 'We have become the reference solution for load testing, thanks to our investments in R&D over the years. EIT Digital will now help us strengthen our position in our existing markets and open new markets in Europe and beyond! This shall confirm our position as a tech leader in the following years,' said Paul-Henri Pillet. The EIT Digital Accelerator provides tailor-made growth support for European tech scale-ups by helping secure international customers and raise capital. In 2019, the programme was recognised by UBI Global as a World Top Public Business Accelerator in the World Benchmark Study 2019-2020, and ranked Top 4 Accelerator Brand in the Startup Heatmap Report Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, the amount of extractive waste is increasing drastically together with concerns related to the environmental effects of mining. The mining industry can achieve more eco-efficient and selective raw material production by enhancing the utilisation of side streams and mine waste. Subscribe now to the EIT's monthly newsletter Innovation project Morecovery aims to enhance the eco-efficient and sustainable use of natural resources creating a modular recovery process service package for hydrometallurgy and water treatment. The project will demonstrate that the modular pilot plant with selective metal recovery processes will work on a larger scale at target sites. Also, the organic adsorbents will be tested for efficient applications in semi-passive drainage water treatment and REE and base metal recovery. After this project, the water treatment pilot plant will be upscaled and proved to work in larger-scale process and adsorbent testing at hydrometallurgical process sites, widening significantly the current business opportunities. Organic adsorbents, e.g. biochars will be proved to be efficient in large scale hydrometallurgical processes and mine waste drainage treatment, becoming a useful part of the side stream utilisation and circular economy. The metal recovery processes at target sites will be enhanced in critical raw materials recovery. The modular recovery process service package including lab-scale services and a mobile pilot plant will be a powerful tool in developing utilisation and cleaning of mining side streams.

eit588,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/innovation-safety,EIT Digital-supported innovation on security of citizens tested in Helsinki,"Innovation developed by EIT Digital and its partners is always aimed at promoting and improving European values and quality of life standards. In the Digital Cities focus area, one of the key targets is increasing the feeling of safety and security of citizens. A pilot which was conducted in Helsinki at the end of last year has shown how this can be achieved. HexaLight, an IoT based lighting system designed to create an illuminated path for better navigation and wayfinding, was tested in the Hyväntoivonpuisto park of the Jätkäsaari neighbourhood in November 2019, the darkest time of the year in Helsinki. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter The system was developed in the context of the Get Home Safely innovation activity, led by Technical University Berlin’s CyPhyLab and including Forum Virium Helsinki, Aalto University, Fraunhofer HHI, Telecom Italy and Fluxedo as project partners. With HexaLight, the lights act as navigation devices which brighten or change colour as the pedestrian approach them: this increases the feeling of safety in dark areas, which generally people perceive as potentially more dangerous. The knee-high lights are also designed to be cosy and visually appealing, making the district more atmospheric and improving the overall pleasantness of the area. The project has been piloted in Helsinki, Berlin and Matera. The Hyväntoivonpuisto location in Helsinki was selected based on responses to a survey and workshop conducted among the district’s residents in the spring. The lights were meant to be networked and personalised at the same time: during the test period, in fact, residents were able to download the Skýra mobile application to their phones to change the colour of the park lights to fit their preferences. The results were positive. The lights delighted and created a sense of security. Heidi Heinonen, Project Manager at Forum Virium In addition to making people feel safer, the system could be leveraged by other stakeholders. Through the system, facility operators and security agencies, for instance, could gain in-depth insights of movement patterns in specific areas, especially in the evenings and at night. In other future scenarios, these smart and connected lights could also be used by city administrators or event organisers to monitor crowd movements in busy areas and to guide, if necessary, people to a less congested route.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit589,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/water-scarcity,EIT's Knowledge and Innovation Communities tackling water scarcity in Southern Europe,"Four of the EIT's Knowledge and Innovation Communities – EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Food, EIT Manufacturing and EIT RawMaterials – supported by the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme – have joined forces to build knowledge and overcome current barriers to tackle water scarcity in Southern Europe through innovation. Subscribe now to the EIT's monthly newsletter Flooding and water scarcity in Europe will increase in the coming decades if the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change are not met. Several studies, including a Joint Research Centre study released in 2018, have looked at the impact of the changing climate, land use and water usage on Europe’s water resources. It is known that Southern European countries – particularly Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Turkey – are projected to face increased water shortages. Significant reductions in groundwater recharge are estimated for Spain, Portugal and Greece, with negative impacts on the environment and water availability for irrigation. Increasing droughts will lead to water scarcity and reduced hydropower potential in the Mediterranean region. This is likely to have a knock-on effect in agriculture, energy, transport and food security. With global freshwater consumption on the increase, European economies are being asked to tackle water scarcity by boosting resilient infrastructure, moving towards more circular economics and by enabling multi-stakeholders governance, as these will determine the competitiveness of the European water industry. Therefore, water plays a central role in how societies mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. A holistic approach considering water, the biosphere and the anthroposphere is required to provide sustainable agricultural and economic systems that will allow EIT Community to decelerate climate change, protect us from extreme weather events, and adapt to the unavoidable at the same time. In 2020, the Knowledge and Innovation Communities will be establishing a group of experts on water scarcity in Southern Europe, delivering focused entrepreneur challenge labs for start-ups and organising the EIT Water Academy for water scarcity challenge education. The Knowledge and Innovation Communities will also be running the EIT workshops with public bodies and other stakeholders across different regions and communication activities to reach out to citizens and interested stakeholders, engaging in external events and with the media to raise awareness about water scarcity for citizens. In the upcoming weeks, EIT Community will be looking for experts including not only researchers but also policy-makers, representatives of NGOs, wider civil society organisations and private industry in who can provide valuable contributions to the multi-stakeholders perspective that we need to tackle these societal challenges. A call for experts will be launched soon – stay tuned! Although EIT Community shares one continent, European countries are divided because of disparities in innovation performance. This has resulted in the classification of European countries in two main groups—innovation leaders and strong innovators versus moderate and modest innovators. One reason for lower innovation performance is weak linkages among the key players—businesses and research institutions and academia, as well as between the private and public sectors, including a systematic approach towards innovation. As a response to this challenge, the EIT RIS was introduced. The EIT RIS is designed for EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries in Europe who are modest and moderate innovators, and where Innovation Communities have few or no partners. Strategically, the Scheme is an additional offer to these countries to facilitate their engagement with the EIT Innovation Communities. The Scheme’s aim is to facilitate the access to services and programmes offered by the EIT Innovation Communities. Each Innovation Community cooperates with local innovators – individuals such as students, researchers, entrepreneurs, and organisations such as SMEs, universities, research labs, regions, NGOs and cities. The EIT Innovation Communities involve the local players in education, business creation and acceleration activities, as well as innovation-driven research.

It provides the next step in our transatlantic collaboration with MIT’s Catalyst programme for the needs-based solution development, amplifies the opportunities offered by the Medical University of Lodz E-Lab, and sets start-ups up to be eligible for EIT Health’s Scale-up programmes. What advice would you give to the undecided applicants who are looking for acceleration but are not sure which programme to choose? Those start-ups which are evaluating whether they should join an accelerator, and if so, which one to join, should ask themselves these questions: Is my product or service ready for commercialization? Do I have enough bandwidth in my team to productively participate in the programme? Who are the mentors in the accelerator programme? Do they represent the expertise and industry knowledge I need to actually advance my products? What are my specific customer acquisition goals in the next four months, and how can the Reactor help me achieve them faster? How can companies as GE Healthcare accelerate the CEE region together with the support of EIT Health? What does cooperation with EIT Health mean for you? The representatives from the partner Universities, GE Healthcare’s organisational department and its Research and Development teams, independent experts and business coaches provide teams with holistic advice. Experts from GE Healthcare provide crucial insight, real-world examples and advice on commercialising healthcare products. Their input covers topics like marketing, sales, building distribution networks and supply chains in detail, and with in-depth knowledge of the current trends. The company’s Medical Imaging Engineering centre is located in Budapest, Hungary and Health Venture Lab has previously demonstrated the ability to involve both technical and commercial experts across the organisation. Through HVL’s Reactor, motivated teams can engage industry leaders such as Attila Ferik, GE Healthcare’s Senior Engineering Director. GE Healthcare is also dedicated to integrating its efforts with other EIT projects. This means sharing knowledge, human capital (business and expert coaches and start-ups) and resources to amplify each programme’s value. GE’s experience with market-leading industry practices gives the participating teams a comprehensive exposure to the innovative thinking in corporate environments, market intelligence and state-of-the-art technology development. The prestige and reputation of the corporate’s brand presence have also attracted a higher quality of partners and participants to its accelerator programmes, resulting in a competitive and motivating start-up cohort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to meet these demands, it has been estimated that 220% more water and 43% more crop land will be required if current dietary trends continue. EIT Food Seedbed Programme 2020 However, the agri-food sector is already facing growing competition and scarcity of land, water and energy for food production which will affect the ability to produce this food. This lack of available resources is expected to be exacerbated by climate change, where up to 40% of the world will develop unfamiliar climates with completely new combinations of temperatures and seasonality of rainfall. As a result, these changing weather patterns are expected to disrupt food availability, reduce access to food and affect food quality and safety. Where food is constrained, prices may rise and this introduces a greater risk of food fraud.  Simultaneously, around one in three people are already suffering some form of malnutrition, whether that be hunger, micronutrient deficiency, overweight or obesity, whilst one billion people suffer from ‘hidden hunger’.  It is evident that EIT Community needs to reconsider how people produce, distribute, value and consume food. In particular, innovations in technology are forecasted to play an important role in transforming the food system and achieving global food security for future generations. The EIT Food Seedbed programme supports technology and business-savvy agri-food entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and early-stage startups who are looking to validate their minimum viable product and test their assumptions through a unique customer journey discovery programme.  Sign up now to the EIT newsletter Now open for 2020 applications, EIT Food Seedbed Programme is designed to address a number of key food system challenges that are urgently facing the global population by supporting state-of-the-art agri-food technologies across the entire food chain, from farm to fork.  These technologies should have the potential to create productive, nutritious, safe, sustainable and transparent food systems which contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and teams should have a minimum viable product that is demonstrable to customers. We’re particularly interested in the strength and experience of teams that apply, what their motivations are and how prepared they are to be an entrepreneur. A diversity of kinds of people is always a strength, as is complementary skills and a history of working together successfully.  On a practical level, applicants should not have received more than EUR 50 000 investment in relation to the development of their idea.  As described, in order to achieve global food security for future generations, innovations in technology will play an important role in creating more trusted, sustainable, safe and profitable food systems and businesses.  In particular, extensive data-enabled technologies are becoming more accessible and affordable - driving a revolution in how the food system operates, connecting stakeholders in the food chain and consumers in new and innovative ways to make the food chain more efficient and productive, reduce resource use and waste and open the door to new food chain collaborations and partnerships.  Although not an exhaustive list, EIT Community encourages applications that fall within one of the following areas: The Seedbed team is especially excited by the solutions and rising levels of investment around food waste, as well as IoT and AI solutions for the agri-food sector - for instance, in solutions for smart farming.  And on a broader note, it will be great to see how the diversity and inclusion initiatives that EIT Food is supporting in entrepreneurship are translated across the portfolio of programmes into stronger teams and groundbreaking  innovations.   Apply before 15 March 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit593,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/food-industry,EIT Food: Can we trust the food industry?,"Answer the following question – Does the food industry produce healthy and sustainable food for me to eat? 1. Yes 2. No 3. I’m not sure Have you chosen your answer? Read the post to help you decide. For most of us it is important that EIT Community can trust the food that people eat. EIT Community wants to know that the food is healthy, is produced sustainably and is safe for the consumption. However, a recent FoodThink study has found that almost half of consumers who frequently buy food for their households do not trust the food industry to do the right thing, and nearly a quarter actively distrust it. Sign up now to the EIT newsletter However, the food industry is made up of many key players, so who are they whom consumers trust? EIT Food’s TrustTracker recently asked 11 000 consumers across 13 European countries to rate their levels of trust in farmers, food manufacturers, retailers and authorities. They found that: As such, it is evident that consumers have different levels of trust for different actors within the food industry. While the industry has a long way to go to overcome low consumer trust, projects like the EIT Food TrustTracker are giving consumers a voice to express their views and concerns. EIT Food TrustTracker When buying food many people consider different things. For example, many of us think about how healthy the product is, how much it costs, where it was produced, and how fresh it is, among many other factors. EIT Food asked consumers across Europe whether they trust the food industry to meet their needs. Watch the video to hear what they had to say:  Many consumers explained why they do not trust the food industry. For example, one consumer suggested that 'selling is the only thing the food industry is interested in', while another explained how their need for affordable and high-quality food is not being met. However, others suggested that the food industry is meeting their needs. One consumer believed that 'we receive high-quality food', while another felt that food producers are making 'a bit more effort to be transparent about ingredients'. Buying food that is healthy and sustainable is important to many of us and there are signs that the food industry is listening to what consumers want. For example, more people are demanding plant-based proteins that are believed to be healthier and more environmentally friendly than animal-based proteins. EIT Food asked consumers what they thought about the future of protein, as alternative proteins and even insects start to emerge on the supermarket shelves. Watch the video to hear what they had to say:  Many consumers believe the food industry is starting to offer alternatives to animal-based proteins which are both healthy and sustainable. For example, one consumer explained, 'I’ve tried so-called vegan burgers, some of them are really tasty', while another commented, 'if insects are available in supermarkets…then I would definitely buy them'. However, not all consumers were convinced. For example, one suggested that insect-based and plant-based proteins did not sound appetising while another consumer admitted that 'insects scare me a little'. While it appears that many consumers are cautious about eating alternative proteins, the industry is listening to the consumers who do want to see more plant-based and insect-based options on offer, suggesting they are considering the health and environmental implications of what they produce. Despite efforts to deliver healthier and more sustainable food to consumers, the industry still needs to adapt. For example, the EIT Food TrustTracker found that there is a lack of transparency and openness from the industry which causes high levels of consumer distrust. Consumers want to know more about where their food comes from and what is in it. For example, many want to be able to trace their food back to its source and have a clearer understanding of the ingredients included. Some believe that a more digitalised food production process would ensure a more open and transparent journey for food, from fark to fork. EIT Food asked consumers whether they believed a digitalised food system would help them make more informed food choices. For many, they believed an increased digitalised food industry where people could see the journey of their food from farm to fork would be useful when determining what foods to buy. Do you agree? As consumers, EIT Community can shape the future of the food industry. EIT Community can do this by:",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potential of digital transformation needs to be translated into the successful implementation of these new technologies in the raw materials industry. On 11 February 2020, the kickoff meeting of the EIT RawMaterials-supported project AMICOS was held in Trento, Italy, at the premises of the research centre Fondazione Bruno Kessler, leader of the project.  AMICOS (Autonomous monitoring and control system for Mining Plants) is a new project awarded almost EUR 2.5 million over three years by EIT RawMaterials. The main project’s objective is to support the digital transformation of the raw materials industry with an innovative asset management solution that will increase the market adoption of digital technology in mines. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter AMICOS end-to-end solution is composed of three main concepts:  Digital mines use technologies developed by the so-called Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) for more efficient, sustainable and safer operations. Most of these innovative and emerging technologies are included in AMICOS. The project's main objective is to offer an end-to-end solution that enhances the monitoring of mining operations. Special focus is placed on improving tailings dams and pipeline monitoring, as well as on the predictive maintenance of mining equipment, such as conveyor belts. We are going to be working with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, drones, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, advanced data analytics, and decision-making tools based on Artificial Intelligence, to name a few.

eit596,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/exponential-technologies,EIT Climate-KIC supports exponential technologies through acceleration of start-ups and projects,"EIT Climate-KIC supports a small selection of exponential technologies through acceleration of start-ups and projects focused on electric flight, cleaner jet fuel, and carbon capture and re-use. Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected to double in the next 20 years— to 8.2 billion air travellers—the emissions of the travel industry alone will exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people don’t realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2—equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the target—a 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levels—is still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Along with these reforms, EIT Community also needs bold, technological innovation to get off fossil jet fuel. EIT Climate-KIC has invested in a number of exponential technologies, such as electric helicopter taxi Volocopter and five-seater electric jet Lilium, which are paving the way towards the aviation industry’s dream: Electric flight. It will be a while before full-sized commercial aircraft go electric. Battery technology is not yet advanced enough to power planes for the distances they cover and weight they carry. Fuel is still 40 to 50 times more power-dense. With the average plane 100 times heavier than a mid-sized car, batteries need to become much more compact and more powerful per kilogram. However, there are already some promising experiments, with the first commercial electric flight flown by Harbour Air in December 2019. As EIT Community innovates its way to electric flight, alternative fuels can help to cut emissions. EIT Climate-KIC has supported SkyNRG—a pioneer in sustainable aviation fuel—in developing a supply chain for a fuel made from waste oils, including used chip fat. SkyNRG are developing a factory in Groningen to supply KLM and German multinational SHV Energy that will be Europe’s first facility to produce and supply sustainable fuel and bio propane. The fuel will lead to an 85 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions and will also reduce nitrous oxide and fine particulate matter. Although there is a similar amount of CO2 emitted during the flight, as the fuel is a chemically identical hydrocarbon, using waste oil and residues that would otherwise be destined for landfill eliminates the emissions from drilling, transporting, processing and refining fossil fuels. The ideal would be using CO2, water, and renewable electricity to create hydrogen, because it’s zero-emission and the waste product is water. But that technology is not yet ready to be scaled up Maarten van Dijk, SkyNRG’s managing director Creating and supplying sustainable biofuels, such as the one SkyNRG has developed from waste oils, takes 8-10 years from the lab stage to production and hundreds of millions of euros. But van Dijk is not deterred by detractors who say alternative fuel development is too slow, or that it distracts attention and investment from electric flight. We need it all. First we have to reduce the amount of fossil fuel needed with everything we can do. Reduction of demand, smarter flying, better taxing. Then, electric! The more electric, the better. Then, we need to substitute whatever share jet fuel has left with sustainable fuel. That’s it. Maarten van Dijk, SkyNRG’s managing director",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The event was held by EIT Climate-KIC in partnership with the Crowther Lab, ETH Zurich.  It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter The first-place cities project from Penang focused on improving social resilience, as well as nature-based solutions to reduce the heat island effect. The winning citizen project from Estonia, Woola, tackled waste by replacing e-commerce packaging with sheep wool. Both winners will receive a cash prize to invest in their project and ongoing technical support from the EIT Climate-KIC network.  It’s incredibly exciting and an honour for Penang to be the first city winner of the Global Climathon Awards. There are places in the world where the climate in 2050 will be vastly different from what it is today. Penang is one of these cities—this is the challenge. We believe that our nature-based approach can make a real difference to the lives of Penangites, who are already regularly suffering the impacts of extreme weather, including flooding, heat stroke and heat stress. Our research will begin with climate-resilient species of trees that can help cool our communities and prevent flooding, and we also hope to raise awareness and increase understanding that climate change impacts have to be tackled in the hearts of our cities. Sofia Castelo, Think City The real value of winning this award is in the recognition. It gives us a lot of credibility and a capital boost to test out our solution. We know that the planet’s resources are finite, and we have to rethink how we approach materials and waste. Businesses are using the wrong kind of materials, 96 per cent of it isn’t recycled and it takes a huge amount of energy to produce. We think sheep’s wool is an ideal solution—our project is shock proof, heat proof and totally compostable. When we’re talking about climate change, raising awareness is always good, but a practical solution is always better. Anna-Liisa Palatu, Woola Global Climathon Day took place in October 2019. A record-breaking 6 500 participants took part, with 24-hour hackathons taking place in 56 countries spanning four continents.

By raising worldwide awareness, improving education and catalysing personal, collective and governmental action, they work together to reimagine a world where millions of people are saved from preventable cancer and access to life-saving cancer treatment and care is equal for all.  Through life changing innovations, the EIT Community is taking part in tackling this challenge. Discover two of our EIT Award winners and how they are fighting cancer.  The protein Myc is found in most human cancers and plays a significant role in the growth of new tumours. It is difficult to attack with drugs due to its location in the nuclei of the cells and its role in the division of healthy cells.  Peptomyc relies on peptides, another fundamental component of the cell, to create therapeutics able to fight these Myc proteins. Peptomyc's peptide-based solution is a new treatment option for cancer options. The treatment is non-toxic, does not cause resistance, improves life-expectancy among patients, and can be used in combination with standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy.     In 2018, Laura Soucek won the first EIT Public Award. Peptomyc has received support through three different EIT Health programmes. The company had access to a vast network of support, which provided the company with funding and helped their innovation advance into clinical testing. The Stockholm3 test is a blood test that increases the detection of aggressive cancers by 20% and, at the same time, reduces the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice. Stockholm3 also identifies men with aggressive prostate cancer with low PSA values, which is crucial for early detection. By reducing unnecessary biopsies and treatment by more than 50% and mortality by up to 20%, Stockholm3 has a significant positive effect on society by reducing individual harm from over-diagnosis, mortality and overall healthcare costs.     EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3.

The word that perfectly describes the year 2019 for Metalshub is 'growth'. The digital metal marketplace was able to grow to EUR 100 million of legally binding contracts concluded over the platform, a fivefold increase compared to the EUR 20 million achieved in 2018. Metalshub was founded in December 2016 with the mission to provide innovative technology to make it easier to buy and sell metals. The company celebrated its second launch anniversary in December 2019 and completed 24 months of platform operations without any technical down-time. Meanwhile, the adoption of Metalshub has been faster than expected. Already more than 650 companies from 66 countries are using Metalshub to buy and sell 17 product categories, such as molybdenum, manganese or chrome. Using the Metalshub platform enables Magotteaux to conclude contracts digitally. This is an opportunity for Magotteaux and our partners to create a more efficient workflow. Lucas Netto, Group Supply Chain Manager at Magotteaux Another highlight of 2019 was the development of the multi-delivery feature. The feature was well received by the users and companies such as MAT Foundry Group which have used it to conclude all of its 2020 annual contracts exclusively over Metalshub. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter It takes team effort to deliver such impressive growth, so it is not surprising that also the team of Metalshub has grown considerably: While in January 10 team members were working towards the shared vision, the team grew out of the office twice in the following months and had to move into bigger ones. In the new headquarter in Düsseldorf at 'Platz der Ideen', there are now 24 colleagues from 10 different countries. They work together in order to achieve the common vision: to create the leading global marketplace for metals and become an innovation leader in the metals and mining industry. In 2018, Chromo Invest and Point Nine along with a number of business angels invested EUR 3 million in Metalshub’s seed financing round. At Point Nine we are looking for founders who show a deep understanding of the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. Frank and Sebastian have lived the problem and have proven that there is a large business around addressing the pain points.

The results were presented in a workshop held on 7 February 2019 in Huelva, Spain. The aim of RED_SCOPE is to asses the technical and economic feasibility of a new process to maximise wastewater recovery of a copper smelter. The project led by Atlantic Copper will enable optimal use of raw materials within Europe and will contribute to the European Commission’s current strategy on the Circular Economy. As part of the RED_SCOPE innovation project, a near zero liquid discharge (NZLD) pilot plant was designed, installed and operated to assess the feasibility of recovering most of the aqueous effluents generated in the Metallurgical Complex of Atlantic Copper. The recovered water, of adequate quality to be used as process water, can be sent back to the factory, reducing the consumption of fresh water and, therefore, the Water Footprint. In addition, as a consequence of the recovery of clean process water, a dry residue in the form of saline crystals is generated, which is currently under evaluation. SUEZ has developed the design of the water resources optimisation project. The project began in 2017 with pre-feasibility studies and laboratory tests followed by the design of the pilot plant carried out in 2018. Furthermore, different technologies were installed along with the pilot tests carried out for five months. By 2019, the implementation study and the final validation of the project were planned.

eit606,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/slovenia-circular,Slovenia adopts EIT Climate-KIC circular economy proposal,"The initiative is one of eight Deep Demonstrations launched by EIT Climate-KIC, which together offer a test bed environment for the ambitious, '1.5-consistent systems transitions' called for by IPCC reports, activists, national and European policy. Here is the full interview with Kirsten Dunlop, CEO EIT Climate-KIC. There are people taking it seriously and the world is definitely not starting from scratch. At the end of 2019, for example, I was invited to present a vision of innovation and systemic change to the parliament of Slovenia. It marked a milestone in our 18-month engagement with the country, which has involved close cooperation with seven Slovenian Government Ministries, EIT RawMaterials and the Joint Research Centre.  Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC That day, the Slovenian parliament passed a motion to adopt an EIT Climate-KIC-led proposal called 'A Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia.' The proposal commits the country to becoming a fully circular economy. That means essentially no new virgin materials. Moving away from traditional linear economic business models and transitioning to closed-loop systems has been defined by the Government of Slovenia as one of the country’s strategic development priorities and an important building block of the carbon-neutral, prosperous and smart future. Business-as-usual isn’t delivering the pace and scale of change needed. Through this proposal and on-the-ground Deep Demonstration, the country is embracing an unprecedented cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach, which seeks to marry different disciplines and work across boundaries, silos and departments.  Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Its overall goal is to position Slovenia as a European leader in harnessing the transformative power of circularity to decarbonise its economy and transform communities while promoting wellbeing and prosperity for all Slovenes for decades to come. It’s a great example of a country embracing the benefits and opportunities of radical, structural transformation for a 1.5 degree world. Really groundbreaking. Averting catastrophic global temperature rise will require deep and holistic transformations in every country. For example, a recent report by Material Economics calculated that circular approaches could help to reduce CO2 emissions from materials production in the EU by almost 56 per cent by 2050. In many ways, the process that led up to that moment in parliament (when our proposal for a Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia was adopted) is the design phase of ‘doing systemic change. Over 18 months, EIT Climate-KIC engaged challenge owners in Slovenia (government ministries and sector leaders), to articulate an ambitious intent for transformational change, and to build demand for a systemic approach. We worked with them to identify constraints and opportunities, frame the problem space, and map relevant systems. And then there is the painstaking work among challenge owners to connect funding and programmes across ministries, and so forth. Get all the EIT's news once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Implementing the change (i.e. building and managing the portfolio of projects and programmes, and learning from it) comes next. Slovenia’s plan here centres around driving circularity in five main areas: The programme of work is focused on three pillars for National Circular Economy Transition, working together to decarbonise Slovenia’s socio-economic system through circular economy principles: A dedicated vehicle called the Slovenian Center for Smart and Circular Transition will serve as the beating heart and physical centre of the entire Deep Demonstration, bringing together the different stakeholders and opening up activities to the wider public. EIT Climate-KIC will provide orchestration services in Slovenia, and help to design a broad-based portfolio of interventions that combine budgets and programmes across old siloes—covering various combinations of technology, policy, education, entrepreneurship, regulation, social innovation, citizen engagement and financial innovation. We will connect this project into our wider community of innovation actors and initiatives across Europe. You can read more about the detailed working plan in this article by Cliona Howie, EIT Climate-KIC’s Head of Circular Economy. No, because many of the solutions we need are not simple technological substitutions or single-point interventions. While we may be able to make 1.5 work on a spreadsheet, we don’t know yet how to make change spread on the ground. On top of this, the context and conditions for achieving 1.5 will continue to change. Uncertainty is the new normal. There is every reason to feel bewildered by the complexity, uncertainty and urgency of the challenge we face. The big question is—do we have the right frameworks in place, for rapid testing and learning about what does work, and for rapid scaling, in a context of uncertainty? Deep Demonstrations of whole systems change are one of these frameworks.  Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Definitely. We need to get communities, organisations and national economies onto a 1.5C footing, quickly. Learning how to achieve this is the real innovation of our time. For example, if we want to achieve climate impact, traditional models of funding and politics need to change. In this respect, Slovenia is embarking on an incredibly bold experiment, connecting ministries and funding to break down siloes, and to capitalise on the benefits of circularity. In addition to creating frameworks for collaborative investment, innovation and learning, we also need to broaden the scope of innovation to include finance, regulation, education, governance as well as non-unusual innovation suspects, like the creative arts, community and social movements.  Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstrations  (i.e. advancing innovation across these multiple fronts at the same time in a joined-up, holistic way) can help us identify combinations of actions and investments that lead to pace and scale. So, yes, we need a new model of innovation to catalyse systemic change. The innovation we really need right now is systems innovation. Slovenia recognises the need to treat all people as stakeholders in this change. There is a big focus on communities, well-being and long-term prosperity. The government’s approach will activate: Local communities, civil servants, students and younger generations, teachers and other change agents, researchers and academics, non-governmental and non-profit organisations, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, associations and other representations of interest, Strategic Research and Innovation Partnerships (SRIPs), start-ups, SMEs and companies, as well as economic clusters. “Consider carbon-free mobility in cities. A huge amount of technical work has been done already to develop alternatives to the combustion engine. Every day, we get better at building electric cars or hydrogen buses. But we’re less good at reducing demand for individual car ownership or driving a switch to zero-emissions buses. A holistic approach forces us to answer a list of other questions as well, like how to create more cycle lanes, increase video conferencing, source local ingredients, build pedestrianism into a city’s health strategy, and so on. In Slovenia, systemic innovation will tackle material production and waste flows across the key economic systems and value chains mentioned above. It will also use training, education and capacity-building to create change agents, to foster life-long learning and to disseminate insights and good practices as widely as possible, and it will use innovative policy initiatives and experiments to ensure enabling conditions. We are running seven other Deep Demonstrations, eight in total, covering: Cities, food, landscapes as carbon sinks, circular regenerative economies, just transitions in coal and heavy industry regions, maritime hubs, long-termism and resilience. Over 30 different locations are involved across Europe. Our long-term goal is for the Deep Demonstration model to help trigger rapid decarbonisation and strengthened resilience across Europe. Many of our current project partners come from EU member states eligible for EIT’s Regional Innovation Scheme. To accelerate impact in these areas, we are integrating our approach with EU Instruments on smart specialisation, on national climate and energy plans, and on coal regions in transition. In Silesia, Poland, for example, we are working on coal transitions, while in Cyprus we’re working with the government on the decarbonisation of shipping. Our impacts framework includes an evaluation and learning capability that draws on structured sense-making and frequent calibration of our overall portfolio of projects. It’s our desire that decision-makers have actionable intelligence and knowledge at their finger tips. Beyond EIT Climate-KIC and our partners, we also want others to follow our journey and benefit from our learnings. To that end, we are committed to reporting transparently on our Deep Demonstration programme as it unfolds. Whatever the solutions to Europe’s climate emergency, innovation has to be at the heart of them. The beauty of a systems approach is that it harnesses innovation in all its different forms and channels them towards simultaneous actions on multiple fronts. In our view, this is the fastest route to the transformation that we so urgently need. The global problem of climate change cannot be solved one start-up or one technological breakthrough at a time. Only by changing whole systems and whole economies will we create the low-carbon world we all want to see.  Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC",,,,,,,,,,,,,

eit610,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/batteries-storage,EIT InnoEnergy becomes BeePlanet Factory shareholder,"BeePlanet Factory is the most recent Spanish start-up to be accepted into EIT InnoEnergy’s Highway programme. In 2030, the International Energy Agency forecasts 125 million electric vehicles on the road. Each battery will have an average life of 10 years, then they will need to find a second life; that is where BeePlanet comes in. BeePlanet is committed to the circular economy, they have already closed agreements with Nissan, and are currently reusing batteries from Nissan Leaf models. The start-up provides energy storage solutions by developing the proper application for each battery following its initial use in a passenger vehicle. Although the batteries are no longer perfectly suited to the requirements of a motor vehicle, this need not relegate them to the scrap heap. Instead, they can be put to such alternative uses as large-scale energy storage to optimise the grid, small-scale energy storage for self-consumption in public and private buildings and alternative vehicles with lower performance specifications, such as forklifts, golf carts, bicycles, etc. The start-up is focused on spreading the word about the endless possibilities of reusing EV batteries to not only make the EV business case more profitable, but to reduce the cost of energy storage at domestic and commercial installations. We want to consolidate our stationary product line launching to the market two more products. The first one is based on the reutilisation of the complete battery pack and the second is a rack solution, to cover a range of storage solutions from 17 kWh to over 200 kWh. Jon Asin, CEO, BeePlanet Factory EIT InnoEnergy’s role has been key since they joined this project, providing not only funding but also strategic contacts and a global vision for the complete energy storage value chain. Their support to the project has been a great help to consolidate BeePlanet brand as one of the market leaders for second-life batteries in Europe Jon Asin, CEO, BeePlanet Factory BeePlanet was recently recognised as the best start-up in the Environment and Energy area at the Expansion Awards, a renowned competition led by the Spanish newspaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit611,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/ai-prostate-cancer,EIT Health start-ups: AI system effective in diagnosing prostate cancer,"On 08 December 2019, the Lancet Oncology published the results of a study demonstrating the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) system in diagnosing prostate cancer in tissue samples. The system was developed by the team behind Stockholm3 and OncoWatch, two projects supported by EIT Health. Find out more about Stockholm3 The study, involving the same team and led by Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, showed that the AI system had considerable accuracy in determining whether a sample contained cancer, and in estimating the length of the cancer tumour in the biopsy. Furthermore, the AI system was comparable with 23 international, leading uropathologists in determining the Gleason score, the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer. Our AI tool has the potential to reduce the workload of uropathologists, allowing them to focus on the most difficult cases and at the same time act as a safety net to improve quality. It also has the potential to speed up diagnostics and reduce costs for healthcare services. Martin Eklund, Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet The Karolinksa team launched the blood-based prostate cancer diagnostic test called Stockholm3 in 2017. Stockholm3 doubles the number of aggressive cancers that are identified, whilst also reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice with PSA. Stockholm3 is currently used in clinical practice in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3 and the new AI system, OncoWatch through network and financial support. As part of the development of OncoWatch, the AI system will be validated in 2020 in a nine-country multicentre study to assess its performance across different labs and in a wider range of digital pathology scanners. A first CE-marked product is expected to launch by the end of the year. There is a high demand for improved tools in prostate cancer diagnostics and we have proven that we can take new innovative tests to the market. The Stockholm3 test was used in more than 20,000 men in the Nordics alone in 2019, and I believe that our new AI system, OncoWatch, will also have strong uptake Martin Steinberg, Project leader for EIT Health-backed OncoWatch Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in Europe, with approximately 450 000 new cases each year. Early diagnosis and treatment of aggressive prostate cancer is crucial to survival. Prostate cancer blights the lives of a large number of men in Europe each year, and despite the advent of new and innovative diagnostics and treatments, we still see too many men die from the condition. Prostate cancer is often treatable with early diagnosis and effective treatment, and AI represents a large opportunity to complement existing medical expertise within the diagnostic process. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health 'The results of the study demonstrate the exciting developments that are happening in the field of AI, and how the technology can be applied to medical practice to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe. EIT Health is proud to support both the Stockholm3 and OncoWatch projects in the development of improved diagnostic tools to tackle prostate cancer,' added Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
eit612,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-battery-startup,Innovative battery start-up joins EIT InnoEnergy,"AC Biode is developing the world’s first standalone alternating current battery using a so-called  ‘biode’, which has both the characteristics of an anode and a cathode. The alternating current battery is more efficient, safer and about 30 per cent more compact than regular batteries, which use direct current (DC). We are going to use existing materials and production lines but switch from direct current to alternating current. All the batteries in the world are direct current. At the moment when you charge a battery, the power source comes from alternating current and the battery is direct current. The majority of motors, such as in electric cars or drones, are alternating currents. So you lose up to 35 per cent of electricity. We can reduce the loss.

eit613,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/start-up-safety-mining,EIT RawMaterials supported start-up is increasing workers' safety and mining assets integrity,"EIT RawMaterials supported start-up, SpacEarth Technology, has developed Mines-In-Time (MIT), an automatic solution for real-time monitoring of ground displacements, applied to mining operation and allowing to increase workers’ safety as well as mining assets integrity. The system is designed to monitor rock mass during mining operations, and is integrated in a traffic-light Decision Support System (DSS) to avoid risks and cost related to mines collapse. The solution was validated in relevant environment on the micro-seismicity data recorded at Garpenberg mine (Boliden Group, Sweden), the world’s most productive and automated underground zinc mine (1 250 m depth). Mines-In-Time solution addresses the following: Mines-In-Time is based on four dimensions Local Earthquake Tomography (4D LET) methodology and is able to analyse both natural and induced micro-seismicity due to mining operations. This technique is a unparalleled upgrade of the traditional ambient noise analysis and time-lapse 3D LET, since the addition of the fourth dimension (time) allows a real-time monitoring of ground deformation related to the stress variation and provides an instant alert in case of risky conditions, using data provided by the existing networks of seismographs already installed in most of the mining sites (no extra hardware to be installed). For this reason, MIT is the only Decision Support System and early warning systems for mining able to dynamically forecast rock deformations and provide an alert in case of critical conditions. Mining companies and service providers will benefit from the MIT outstanding advantages: SpacEarth Technology, a spin-off of the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), founded in 2014 and supported by the EIT RawMaterials Booster to develop applications for the mining industry. Moreover, SpacEarth has direct connections with Bolden Group and LKAB mining companies, DMT and IMS service providers and the Luleå University of Technology working on seismic hazards in mines. SpacEarth start-up was initially supported by the EIT RawMaterials Start-up and SME Booster 2016 and 2017. The EIT RawMaterials Booster supported the delivery of a market study for the mining sector including direct contacts with client prospects. As a result, the company achieved a higher technology level, and this boosted the technology attractiveness from the industry. Mines-In-Time will be further validated through 2019 and 2020 thanks to a recently established one-year contract between SpacEarth and Boliden. The constant, competent and thorough support of EIT RawMaterials Innovation Hub South was crucial to bring our business idea into the market. The seismic hazard in the mines is strongly related to the stress changes and the condition of the rock mass (fracturing process with time). That is why monitoring of these two factors is important to foresee the changes in the seismic hazard. MIT is a valuable tool that could give important information about the changing stress and rock conditions – it can be used for large volumes.

The mill is a prototype of a new ultra-fine grinding mill for the liberation of high-value particles met in platinum-group metals containing ores, copper ores or other polymetallic ores with fine dissemination of mineral phases. This mill consumes 20-30% less energy compared to similar established mills and increases ore liberation with at least 20% less locked ore at same particle size. Professor Urs Peuker at Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg and leader of the RoStar project The RoStar prototype has proven to increase the operation period with 50% before maintenance is needed. Additionally, the maintenance itself is 50% faster compared to similarly established mills, due to an optimised rotor-stator geometry and improved wear resistance through a modular construction of the mill housing. The RoStar mill offers an answer to the forthcoming challenges already seen in fine milling trends. Tangible applications are opened in re-grinding-flotation circuits, tailings re-processing as well as in enabling access to future deposits containing valuable or critical materials. Professor Peuker  The mill will be a vertical fine grinding mill, where gravity forces enable a higher filling level than in horizontal mills and a hydraulic pressure on the grinding beads. The new improved design of the Mills Rotor/Stator system was launched into the market in the year 2018. Deliverables of the RoStar innovation project will be a containerised pilot plant, a fine milling process with very low energy consumption.

eit621,https://eit.europa.eu//news-events/news/eit-health-integrated-healthcare-improve-care-reduce-costs,EIT Health: integrated healthcare can improve care and reduce costs,"Ursula Redeker is Spokeswoman for the Management of Roche Diagnostics GmbH. She is also a member of the EIT Health Supervisory Board, a member of the Board of Trustees of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region and shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board of ABB AG.  EIT Community has a fairly segmented approach to the provision of healthcare today. As patients, EIT Community sees doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and many other healthcare professionals helping us to maintain or regain good health. They must plan together, treat patients together, and talk to one another, a dynamic that often needs to be continued in the long term, particularly for chronic diseases. This becomes a challenge when processes, regulation and mindset are not all focused on integration of care. The growth in medical knowledge necessitates increased specialisation, which is valuable but results in fragmentation that requires a challenging level of governing infrastructure and reimbursement principles. Integrating healthcare to provide seamless end-to-end care will reduce costs by optimising interfaces, reducing redundancies and avoiding communication breaks and information gaps. It will improve outcomes by making information easily available and providing constant feedback loops for all involved in care. It will enable truly personalised care. And it will help to shift the focus from treating disease to maintaining health, thereby promising both better healthcare and reduced costs. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member Some of the main challenges that I believe EIT Community must address in order to develop, nurture and scale integrated care models across Europe include: Tackling all of these challenges is, of course, no small task. While EIT Community may still be some years away from total reform, EIT Community is seeing pilots testing integrated healthcare on a regional level or focused on a disease. One example is the 'Gesundes Kinzigtal' model (GK) in Germany, where healthcare within a local community has been organised as an innovative integrated care system. The GK model focuses on three key principles: better population health, improved experience of care, and reduced per-capita costs. The results of the GK model clearly demonstrated that patient satisfaction and population health can be improved while decreasing the overuse of health services and medicines. In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation project iPDM-GO is improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation project iPDM-GO is improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform that integrates diagnostic results with relevant medication and personal information – to help patients and their doctors achieve better short- and long-term outcomes. Controlling blood glucose levels is a highly complex process and a major task for patients. Although monitoring and treatment are readily available, staying within the required blood-sugar range remains a challenge. Providing individual feedback loops and continuous information for patients and doctors can help avoid long-term complications and associated pain and cost.   Another EIT Health project, called SeizeIT, is addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection. Currently, seizures are being reported with a patient diary, or are measured during hospital stays. This provides a lot of room for seizures to be underreported, but accuracy is relevant to establishing optimal care. By providing a discreet device that patients can wear at home, SeizeIT is working towards a reality where all seizures can be detected. This will improve patient lives and help medical professionals understand more about the condition, and improve treatments available.  The variety of healthcare systems across Europe share some common challenges. Integrated healthcare is one of those. EIT Health offers an opportunity to explore pilots and innovative approaches to achieve this vision. Let’s use these opportunities to create improvements that provide the best value for citizens and patients. Visit the EIT Health website",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The programme, which will implement the latest discoveries in efficient materials recovery methods, will see the construction of a pilot battery recycling plant, followed by a full-scale version at Northvolt’s site in Skellefteå in 2022. The EIT InnoEnergy investment supports Northvolt’s target of using 50% recycled materials in all its new battery cells by 2030. The announcement comes just two days after the European Green Deal highlighted the importance of circular economy initiatives to 'mainstream' sustainability throughout European policy. This is a landmark investment and one that has a mission critical role to play in addressing climate issues. Europe’s energy transition relies on creating a local, competitive and sustainable battery value supply chain that can support the electrification of the transport, power and industrial sectors. As battery volumes are expected to increase drastically, it will be doubly important that, as an industry, we do everything we can to reduce their manufacturing footprint. Diego Pavia, CEO at EIT InnoEnergy 'As such, greener battery technologies are a cornerstone of a sustainable future, and we are actively seeking to invest in technologies that can unlock economic and environmental benefits. Better technologies mean we can manufacture much more with less, using recycled raw materials and less energy', added Diego. The aim of using 50% recycled materials by 2030 will be achieved through a gradual build-up in capacity. The pilot plant will process 100 tons a year, while the full-scale unit initially will look to recycle 25 000 tons of battery cells a year. At present, much of Europe’s recyclable battery materials are thought to be exported abroad for reuse in countries such as China and Korea. We are very pleased to have the continued support of EIT InnoEnergy as we take this next step in developing our blueprint for sustainable battery manufacturing. Our partnership with EIT InnoEnergy has been vital in getting us to where we are today; not only has it provided investments, it has opened doors for us across Europe. Peter Carlsson, CEO Northvolt Northvolt’s programme builds on two years of research where, in conjunction with researchers at Chalmers University, Sweden, it has optimised the process design for hydrometallurgical treatment. The process allows for more efficient recovery of valuable metals including lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt.  This latest investment brings EIT InnoEnergy’s total capital contributions to Northvolt to EUR 9.3 million, following an earlier investment of EUR 3.5 million three years ago. Both investments help EIT InnoEnergy unlock the estimated EUR 250 billion annual European battery market, identified by the European Battery Alliance. Northvolt is just one of several battery supply chain start-ups EIT InnoEnergy supports, and it has resources to support more. Earlier this autumn, EIT InnoEnergy issued its first ever global call for start-ups across the entire sustainability value chain. Following strong growth within the storage market, EIT InnoEnergy expects this call to attract a significant number of new storage innovations. Read more about Northvolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes, it does so on the street, but more often, it happens when the owner is recharging the lithium ion battery.  A mismatched charger won't always turn off automatically when the battery's fully charged, and keeps heating up.  Or, the highly flammable electrolyte inside the battery's cells leaks out of its casing and ignites, setting off a chain reaction."" These bikes when they fail, they fail like a blowtorch,"" said  Dan  Flynn, the chief fire marshal at the  New  York  Fire  Department. "" We've seen incidents where people have described them as explosive   incidents where they actually have so much power, they're actually blowing walls down in between rooms and apartments."" Brooklyn: 374  East 9th  Street @ FDNY operating at a 3  Alarm  Fire in a 3 story private dwelling with extention to adjoining building pic.twitter.com/o Cs3 V I39 S Q    NYRRT (@ NYRRT)  April 21, 2022 A fire in  Brooklyn in  April was traced to a faulty e-bike or e-scooter battery that ignited and gutted two houses. And these fires are getting more frequent. As of  Friday, the  FDNY investigated 174 battery fires, putting 2022 on track to double the number of fires that occurred last year (104) and quadruple the number from 2020 (44).  So far this year, six people have died in e-bike-related fires and 93 people were injured, up from four deaths and 79 injuries last year. In early  August, a 27-year-old  Venezuelan immigrant, identified as  Rafael  Elias  Lopez- Centeno, died after his lithium ion battery caught fire and ripped through the  Bronx apartment where he was staying.  Carmen  Tiburcio, a neighbor, said  Lopez's aunt told her he had tried to escape through the front door, but the bike was in the way.  Instead, he took refuge in the bathroom, where he tried to fill up the bathtub with water to protect himself from the flames.  But the smoke got to him, she said."" He didn't make it,""  Tiburcio said. "" His lungs were very bad."" Another danger to delivery work Many, if not most, of the fires in  New  York involve e-bike batteries owned by restaurant delivery workers, who work long shifts, traveling dozens of miles a day."" The bikes tend to get beat up, subjected to the elements,""  Flynn said. "" They're not really made for our streets."" The longer the batteries are used, the more time it takes to fully recharge them, and it can take up to 8 hours.  That in turn makes it harder for owners to keep on eye on their batteries the whole time they are plugged in, which is key for safety. Enlarge this image toggle caption  FDNY  FDNY In addition, new batteries are costly, and the temptation to opt for a less-expensive refurbished battery for much less money is great   especially for couriers who make an average of $12.21 an hour after expenses, according to a survey by  Los  Deliveristas  Union, an advocacy and membership organization. Several e-bike owners interviewed by  NPR in  New  York  City said they were aware of the risks batteries posed, and took measures to reduce them."" A lot of guys have four, five, six bikes in their apartment and they swap out chargers for different bikes when it doesn't belong to that bike,"" said  Rafael  Cardanales, who lives on the  Lower  East  Side. "" You can't just use any charger, you know."" Musfiqur  Rahman said that when he first got into the delivery business, he bought two new  Arrow brand batteries   for $550 each.  He did it specifically to avoid fires."" As far as  I know, this brand never get involved in this kind of incident,"" the 27-year-old  Bangladeshi immigrant said. The  FDNY says most batteries are so destroyed by fire when they inspect them that they can make no conclusions about which brand is safer than another. The  FDNY has begun posting videos on social media warning about the dangers of recharging lithium ion batteries. Living in close quarters E-bike related fires have occurred elsewhere, such as  London,  San  Francisco,  Michigan and  South  Florida.  But nowhere does concern for them appear to be as high as in  New  York, perhaps because of the prevalence of apartment living   and also the prevalence of ordering take-out. While restaurants sometimes store bikes overnight for employees, fewer people are now working for particular restaurants and many more for themselves, using apps like  Door  Dash or  Uber  Eats to connect with customers.  And these couriers often don't have any other place to store and recharge their e-bikes except in their apartments. That, in turn, creates a fire hazard not just for the workers, but also for their neighbors.  This summer, the  New  York  City  Housing  Authority proposed banning e-bikes and batteries from its 2,600 buildings.  But the proposal created an uproar, and officials have not gone through with it. Enlarge this image toggle caption  Matthew  Schuerman/ NPR  Matthew  Schuerman/ NPR City councilmembers have proposed their own solutions.  One bill, for instance, would ban the sale of used batteries within city limits.  Another would require all batteries to be sold to be approved by a national testing service, such as  Underwriters  Laboratories.  Mayor  Eric  Adams recently announced he would direct $1 million to create hubs for delivery workers with charging stations and other amenities   though they would likely be used during the day and not provide overnight charging. Councilmember  Gale  Brewer, who sponsored the legislation that would outlaw the sale of used batteries, says she recognizes that new batteries could be prohibitively expensive to delivery workers."" They do, you know,  God's work, so to speak, because  New  Yorkers like to have food delivered,"" she said. "" So now the question is how do they get the new batteries that are not going to cause fires?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rystad forecasts prices will stabilize at around €31 per MWh by 2030, which puts the LCOE of existing gas-fired plants closer to €150 per MWh.“This is still three times more than the LCOE of new solar PV facilities. For gas-fired plants to continue being competitive, gas prices would need to fall closer to €17 per MWh and carbon prices would need to fall to €10 per tonne, which is currently unthinkable,” the company said in a statement.Popular content“Gas will continue to play an important role in the European energy mix for some time to come, but unless something fundamental shifts, then simple economics, as well as climate concerns, will tip the balance in favor of renewables,” said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of power at Rystad Energy.If gas funds were invested in renewables instead, Europe could replace gas with solar and onshore wind power generation by 2028, when total capacity would reach 333 GW, Rystad forecasts. This estimate assumes a weighted average capital cost for the technologies of €1.3 per watt, as well as a two-year pre-development phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Credit: Adapted from ACS Energy Letters 2022, DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01969As climate change intensifies summer heat, demand is growing for technologies to cool buildings. Now, researchers report in ACS Energy Letters that they have used advanced computing technology and artificial intelligence to design a transparent window coating that could lower the temperature inside buildings, without expending a single watt of energy.Studies have estimated that cooling accounts for about 15% of global energy consumption. That demand could be lowered with a window coating that could block the sun's ultraviolet and near-infrared light—the parts of the solar spectrum that typically pass through glass to heat an enclosed room. Energy use could be reduced even further if the coating radiates heat from the window's surface at a wavelength that passes through the atmosphere into outer space. However, it's difficult to design materials that can meet these criteria simultaneously and can also transmit visible light, meaning they don't interfere with the view. Eungkyu Lee, Tengfei Luo and colleagues set out to design a ""transparent radiative cooler"" (TRC) that could do just that.The team constructed computer models of TRCs consisting of alternating thin layers of common materials like silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide or titanium dioxide on a glass base, topped with a film of polydimethylsiloxane. They optimized the type, order and combination of layers using an iterative approach guided by machine learning and quantum computing, which stores data using subatomic particles. This computing method carries out optimization faster and better than conventional computers because it can efficiently test all possible combinations in a fraction of a second. This produced a coating design that, when fabricated, beat the performance of conventionally designed TRCs in addition to one of the best commercial heat-reduction glasses on the market.In hot, dry cities, the researchers say, the optimized TRC could potentially reduce cooling energy consumption by 31% compared with conventional windows. They note their findings could be applied to other applications, since TRCs could also be used on car and truck windows. In addition, the group's quantum computing-enabled optimization technique could be used to design other types of composite materials.More information: High-Performance Transparent Radiative Cooler Designed by Quantum Computing, ACS Energy Letters (2022).

But the SUV is at the low end of Edmunds.com’s list of prices for electric vehicles sold in the U.S., where the average cost of an EV is around $65,000.Hitting a price around $30,000 and a range per charge close to 300 miles is key to getting mainstream buyers to switch away from gasoline vehicles, industry analysts say.“You’re kind of at that sweet spot,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. “You’re basically at the price point that everyone is clamoring for.”ADVERTISEMENTAuto industry analysts say that if the Equinox makes efficient use of interior space with plenty of cargo and passenger room, and if it is styled similar to current gas-powered small SUVs, it should be a hit in the most popular segment of the U.S. auto market. About 20% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. are compact SUVs.“It’s a perfect vehicle for a lot of different users, whether it’s a small family, maybe an empty nester,” said Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, a Detroit-area consulting firm. “You’ve got space to haul things, but it’s easy to drive.”A $30,000 EV that checks all of the boxes is just a little above the price of a comparable small gas-powered SUV. The Toyota RAV4, the top seller in the segment and the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that isn’t a pickup, starts at just over $28,000.Until the last few years, electric vehicles were either expensive and aimed at affluent luxury buyers, or cheaper but with limited travel ranges. For example, a base version of Tesla’s Model 3, the lowest-price model from the top-selling EV brand in the U.S., starts at more than $48,000. A larger Tesla Model X SUV starts at over $120,000.ADVERTISEMENTThe only EVs with starting prices under $30,000 (including shipping) now are versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt. Both are smaller than a typical gas-powered compact SUV. The Mini Cooper Electric, Mazda MX30 and Hyundai Kona Electric are in the $30,000s, according to Edmunds.Kia’s Niro EV, Hyundai’s Ioniq 5, Ford’s F-150 Lightning pickup, the Volkswagen ID.4, Kia EV6, Toyota b24x, Ford’s Mustang Mach E, Audi’s Q4 e-tron, the Subaru Solterra, Polestar 2, and Tesla Model 3 all have starting prices in the $40,000s.GM may find it difficult to keep the Equinox price around $30,000, largely because minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and nickel that are key components of batteries have been rising fast. There’s a finite number of mines and increasing demand as nearly all automakers introduce new EVs.ADVERTISEMENTDrury says that even if GM is able to keep the Equinox starting price around $30,000, demand likely will be high enough so the company builds mainly higher-priced versions. And some dealers have been marking up EVs beyond the automaker’s sticker price due to high demand. In the first half of the year, U.S. EV sales rose 68% from the same period a year ago, to nearly 313,000.Some EVs could get a whole lot cheaper in the U.S., too, with federal tax credits starting next year of up to $7,500 that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act . But meeting federal requirements may be difficult.The vehicles and batteries have to be assembled in North America, and the new law phases in requirements that battery minerals and parts have to come from the continent. Most minerals such as lithium, a key battery ingredient, are now imported from China and other countries.The Equinox checks the North American assembly box. It will be made in Mexico. The company won’t say where the battery will be made, but GM has announced three joint-venture battery factories in the U.S., including one that’s operating already in Warren, Ohio.ADVERTISEMENTFrom there, GM is working on meeting the other criteria for getting the tax credit. “We’re really working through the rules and the regulations right now,” said Steve Majoros, vice president of marketing for Chevrolet. “We think it’s all lining up nicely, but more details to come on that.”Majoros hinted that it may take a couple of years to meet all the government’s requirements to get the full credit as GM takes more control of its supply chain for EV parts.The Equinox EV, Majoros said, is longer, wider and a bit shorter than the gas versions of the same vehicle. GM used new interior packaging methods to create comparable passenger and cargo space to the gas Equinox, he said. The relatively small price difference between the two should get many customers to consider EV over gas, he said.“It does a lot of things right,” Majoros said. “So when it does that, the (sales) volume follows.”ADVERTISEMENTGM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will overtake Tesla as the nation’s largest seller of EVs by the middle of this decade. The Equinox EV is a step toward that.“We think it’s going to be one of the products that’s really going to help that mainstream adoption really take off in the marketplace,” Majoros said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The record-breaking combination of a shorter charge time and more energy acquired for longer travel range was announced today (Oct. 12) in the journal Nature.“The need for smaller, faster-charging batteries is greater than ever,” said Chao-Yang Wang, the William E. Diefenderfer Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State and lead author on the study. “There are simply not enough batteries and critical raw materials, especially those produced domestically, to meet anticipated demand.”In August, California’s Air Resources Board passed an extensive plan to restrict and ultimately ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars within the state. By 2035, the largest auto market in the United States will effectively retire the internal combustion engine.If new car sales are going to shift to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), Wang explained, they’ll need to overcome two major drawbacks: they are too slow to recharge and too large to be efficient and affordable. Instead of taking a few minutes at the gas pump, depending on the battery, some EVs can take all day to recharge.“Our fast-charging technology works for most energy-dense batteries and will open a new possibility to downsize electric vehicle batteries from 150 to 50 kWh without causing drivers to feel range anxiety,” said Wang, whose lab partnered with State College-based startup EC Power to develop the technology. “The smaller, faster-charging batteries will dramatically cut down battery cost and usage of critical raw materials such as cobalt, graphite and lithium, enabling mass adoption of affordable electric cars.”The technology relies on internal thermal modulation, an active method of temperature control to demand the best performance possible from the battery, Wang explained. Batteries operate most efficiently when they are hot, but not too hot. Keeping batteries consistently at just the right temperature has been major challenge for battery engineers. Historically, they have relied on external, bulky heating and cooling systems to regulate battery temperature, which respond slowly and waste a lot of energy, Wang said.Wang and his team decided to instead regulate the temperature from inside the battery. The researchers developed a new battery structure that adds an ultrathin nickel foil as the fourth component besides anode, electrolyte and cathode. Acting as a stimulus, the nickel foil self-regulates the battery’s temperature and reactivity which allows for 10-minute fast charging on just about any EV battery, Wang explained.“True fast-charging batteries would have immediate impact,” the researchers write. “Since there are not enough raw minerals for every internal combustion engine car to be replaced by a 150 kWh-equipped EV, fast charging is imperative for EVs to go mainstream.”The study’s partner, EC Power, is working to manufacture and commercialize the fast-charging battery for an affordable and sustainable future of vehicle electrification, Wang said.The other coauthors on the study are Teng Liu, Xiao-Guang Yang, Shanhai Ge and Yongjun Leng of Penn State and Nathaniel Stanley, Eric Rountree and Brian McCarthy of EC Power.The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force and the William E.

The material forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools. This offers the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, resulting in a material with magnetic properties similar to those of rare earth magnets.One of the most promising alternatives for permanent magnets is tetrataenite, an iron-nickel alloy with an ordered atomic structure.

This offers the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, resulting in a material with magnetic properties similar to those of rare earth magnets.In the 1960s, tetrataenite was artificially formed by blasting iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, which allowed the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking. However, this technique is unsuitable for mass production. “Since then, scientists have been fascinated with getting that ordered structure, but it’s always felt like something that was very far away,” Greer says.In the 1960s, tetrataenite was artificially formed by blasting iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, which allowed the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking.

But when Ivanov looked closer, he identified the tetrataenite.According to the team, phosphorus allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years. They were able to accelerate tetrataenite formation by between 11 and 15 orders of magnitude by mixing iron, nickel, and phosphorus in the right quantities. This meant the material was able to form over a few seconds in a simple casting.According to the team, phosphorus allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years.

Eight cars in total were tested, with one test reaching speeds of roughly 143 miles per hour, according to the report.A video posted to Twitter by a Chinese journalist shows the vehicles floating — albeit bumpily — along the track:Xinhua says the tests were run by government transportation authorities to study safety measures for high-speed driving. But Deng Zigang, one of the university professors who developed the vehicles, told the state news agency that using magnetic levitation for passenger vehicles has the potential to reduce energy usage and increase the vehicles' range.That could be useful for the electric vehicle industry's issues with ""range anxiety,"" or when consumers fear they won't be able to complete a trip in an electric vehicle without running out of power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While this may suggest supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said module capacity expansions are slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, catering to the trend of n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing.Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW this quarter, most of which can be attributed to two facilities bringing 23 GW online.Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily due to a major provider retiring its multi-crystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in Q2 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW.Module production reached 324 GW in Q2. CEA forecasts this may expand 20% by the end of the year, reaching 400 GW.Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production, with most others operating at the cell and module link in the supply chain. “With growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,” said CEA.The report said suppliers are working to optimize wafer sizes after the industry standardized 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The “182 mm Plus” (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce “white space” caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The “210 mm Reduced” (210R) reduced wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced.Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds.Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingot, 42 GW of cell, and 50 GW of module capacity. By end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively.“Policy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,” said CEA in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

What if we could apply this technology to miners in the EV industry, creating a full circle sustainable supply chain?BHP’s Jansen potash project is expected to be the largest of its kind, with initial capacity forecasts of 4.3 to 4.5 Mtpa.Potash is often found in fertilizer and is a rich source of potassium, a mineral essential for our health. Since potassium is not produced by the body naturally, it must be consumed through food. Potash is the most commonly used potassium fertilizer, but over 70% is based on conventional underground mining that uses heavy-duty equipment to extract it.Although underground mining can release half the CO2 emissions of open-pit mining, the company is taking it further by introducing several battery electric vehicles.Normet Canada, the mining company behind the project, was awarded a new contract to use battery electric vehicles at the Jansen potash project, including 10 underground EV loaders and one electric tethered loader.With these heavy-duty electric vehicles, BHP says the Jansen project is forecast to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% compared to the Saskatchewan potash mine.The electric vehicle deliveries are expected to begin in March 2023 and run through 2024, which will work perfectly as the miners aim to start production in 2026.Like potassium is critical for humans, electric vehicles also require certain minerals such as lithium and nickel. These miners are looking for ways to build on the momentum electric vehicles are establishing in reducing carbon emissions, completing a complete sustainability supply chain. Several companies are now working to make this a reality.Normet electric mining equipment (Source: Normet)Miners using electric vehicles can complete the sustainability supply chainAlmost every automaker has set its intentions to scale production of its electric vehicles to meet the growing demand for zero-emission cars while setting carbon reduction targets.For example, GM is going all-electric by 2035, Ford looks to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026, and Volkswagen plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2035, while North America follows.Tesla, only selling electric cars, continues breaking records with 343,000 EVs delivered in Q3 on its way to producing 20 million annually.However, getting to these numbers will require mining. A few companies have already begun working to build a sustainable EV supply chain.Snow Lake Lithium outlined its plans in February to develop the world’s first all-electric lithium mine, one of the most critical minerals used to build EV batteries. The mining company’s CEO said at the time if you are going to mine for these resources that will be used to protect the environment, then obtaining them must also be done in a sustainable matter.The company is working with Meglab, an electrical equipment provider and mining solutions company, to make the dream a reality.There are operations around the world working to reduce emissions in the mining sector. In July 2021, Opibus (now ROAM) converted a Toyota Land Cruiser fitted with an electric powertrain to use a mining vehicle.Miners using electric vehicles can significantly reduce the heat and carbon exposure they typically experience with diesel-powered equipment. Furthermore, EV mining technology can cost less as it requires less ventilation and cooling.The point is, as the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, companies are figuring out ways to build on the momentum EVs are establishing in reducing emissions. If miners get on board, it will come full circle, creating a complete sustainable EV supply chain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also uses a length scale input to characterize the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration.“The convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,” the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production.Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08.“Increasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilized in agrivoltaic systems,” said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. “That could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.”Popular contentThrough the modeling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelized cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters. With two-meter spacing, the LCOE was $0.33/kWh, and with 11 meters it was $0.36/kWh.The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modeling in the study “Technoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,” recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.Other recent proposals for using convective solar module cooling include packing PV panels in close proximity, and taking wind direction and module inclination into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renewable microgrids, on the other hand, are not so simple, with their suite of controls, software, and asset coordination. But the beauty of renewables is that fuel is free and already available on-site, even in remote disaster areas.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has now published a description of the improvised controls that saved NREL during its own outage, which could make microgrids easy and low cost where they are needed most.The publication, titled ""Unleashing the Frequency: Multi-Megawatt Demonstration of 100% Renewable Power Systems with Decentralized Communication-less Control Scheme,"" describes a microgrid approach that sidesteps the central controller—an expensive and complicated component—and its reliance on communications, instead using native controls of battery, solar, and wind systems.""NREL's approach makes it possible to assemble devices into a microgrid without arduous configuration, relying on just renewable energy and amateur electrical experience—perfect for recoveries in a pinch,"" said Przemyslaw Koralewicz, NREL engineer and co-developer of the communication-less method.A low-cost recovery resourceWhen NREL experienced a surprise power outage, the laboratory had few options for recovery: No microgrid controller and no preconfigured setup. Just a large battery, solar panels, and wind turbines. Other campuses—or districts, neighborhoods, and homes—could find themselves in similar circumstances, and during an outage is no time to be fumbling with complicated configurations. Like NREL, communities can now implement a resilient microgrid off the cuff, using controls that exist on essentially any energy resource.While microgrids are an apparent answer for recovery and resilience, the costs of a controller present a barrier to communities. In 2019, NREL found that microgrid controllers have a mean cost of $155,000/megawatt, potentially putting resilient microgrids out of reach for vulnerable areas.Besides costs, controllers introduce a tangle of communications and system settings, often opaque, proprietary, and designed to suit particular scenarios. These features can be useful for minimizing energy use and costs, but recoveries often call for a quick-and-ready option. NREL's method prioritizes fail-safe startup, foregoing elaborate programs and communications in favor of exceedingly basic controls, while still allowing more advanced designs to be built on top.Developers of the communication-less microgrid method observe the NREL Flatirons Campus' battery energy storage systems. Credit: Dennis Schroeder, NRELHow does it work?NREL's scheme is decentralized—the devices do not exchange data or issue commands (i.e., they are ""communication-less""). Instead, devices self-regulate using system frequency as the common language. In short, a battery or other power source forms the grid by supplying power at a set frequency. Other generators like solar panels and wind turbines follow the grid by watching frequency and changing their power accordingly.The method is nothing too new—so-called ""droop"" controls are familiar in standard fossil fuel generators—which is part of the appeal. The NREL researchers showed that the method works with 100% renewable energy, can be scaled, and is feasible with most any energy device.What is innovative is that NREL's method frees the grid frequency from a tight 60 hertz (Hz). Unbound by mechanical rotation, the microgrid frequency can take a wider range. In fact, that range is precisely how the devices coordinate without communicating: As frequency rises past 60 Hz, generators reduce power. At even higher frequencies, the generators reduce their power further, rebalancing the frequency around 60 Hz. The system self-stabilizes, never overcharging the batteries or underserving the loads.If this sounds more difficult than a diesel generator, it might be. It still requires some device programming and parameter setting, which are detailed in the report.""NREL's method is the very first step in a design that could become the standard for fail-safe microgrids,"" Koralewicz said. ""Our communication-less method could be natively configured in future devices or possibly certified for easy access by operators. With standardized adoption, microgrids of any type—military bases, hospital backups, even networked districts—could count on an unfailing foundation to their day-to-day operations.""The frontier of renewable energy systemsAt the frontier of power systems, engineers are addressing the technical matters of operating the grid with mostly renewables. Outstanding questions relate to inverters, which are the power electronic devices that interface renewable energy to the grid, and particularly, how inverters can form the grid in ways that fossil-based resources traditionally have. The UNIFI consortium is taking on the inverter challenge with the combined effort of dozens of research institutions, led by NREL.NREL's communication-less method is one example of a grid-forming strategy, the sort that will be needed as systems push toward higher levels of renewables. In proposing the method, NREL is breaking ground into some of the trickier topics that confront UNIFI and power systems everywhere, such as how to handle grid protection and which controls should be essential on grid-forming devices. The authors approach these questions in the report, offering one direction that future energy systems can take on the path to decarbonization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}Researchers have passed the 30 per cent efficiency barrier with silicon solar cells for the first time by combining them with the so-called “miracle material” perovskite.A team from various universities and institutes in the Netherlands made the breakthrough with a tandem solar cell that compliments traditional silicon-based cells – which have an energy conversion efficiency of around 22 per cent – with the widely-acclaimed properties of perovskite.The researchers said that achieving greater than 30 per cent efficiency with the four-terminal tandem device marked “a big step in accelerating the energy transition” and would improve energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependency.“This type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93 per cent of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device,” said Dr Mehrdad Najafi from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).“This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.”Perovskite has been hailed for its potential to transform an array of industries, ranging from ultra-high-speed communications to renewable energy production.The researchers behind the latest solar cell record now hope to commercialise the technology to achieve a widespread roll-out.“Now we know the ingredients and are able to control the layers that are needed to reach over 30 per cent efficiency,” said Professor Gianluca Coletti, program manager of Tandem PV.“Once combined with the scalability expertise and knowledge gathered in the past years to bring material and processes to a large area, we can focus with our industrial partners to bring this technology efficiencies beyond 30 per cent into mass production.”The results were presented at the World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion (WCPEC-8) in Milan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites692,https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/us-installs-record-solar-capacity-as-prices-keep-falling/,US installs record solar capacity as prices keep falling,"This week, the US Department of Energy's Berkeley Lab released its annual analysis of solar energy in the US. It found that nearly half the generating capacity was installed in the US during 2021 and is poised to dominate future installs. That's in part because costs have dropped by more than 75 percent since 2010; it's now often cheaper to build and operate a solar plant than it is to simply buy fuel for an existing natural gas plant.The analysis was performed before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains many incentives and tax breaks that should expand solar's advantages in the coming years.Solar, by the numbersIn terms of large, utility-scale solar installs, the US added over 12.5 gigawatts of new capacity last year, bringing the total installed capacity to over 50 gigawatts. Texas led the way, with about a third of the total capacity added (3.9 GW) going online in the Lone Star State. Combined with residential and other distributed solar installations, solar alone accounted for 45 percent of the new generating capacity added to the grid last year.AdvertisementThat growth showed up in figures on how much energy solar supplies. Five states now receive more than 15 percent of their electricity from solar power, including Massachusetts and Vermont, with California receiving 25 percent of its electricity from the Sun.Solar's expansion has largely been driven by falling costs. The DOE estimates that the price of building a solar plant has been dropping by an average of about 10 percent a year, leading to a fall of over 75 percent since 2010. That has left prices averaging about $1.35 for each watt of capacity in 2021. Large-scale plants benefit the most, with projects over 50 megawatts costing about 20 percent less than those under 20 MW.The drop in prices is causing some somewhat odd trends, driven by the fact that it's becoming increasingly economical to install large facilities in states that don't get as much sun, like Maine, Michigan, and Wisconsin. As a result, the past several years have seen the average incoming energy at newly constructed facilities (measured as daily kilowatt-hours per square meter) drop by about 20 percent.That has helped cause a large spread in what's called the capacity factor, which is calculated by dividing the amount of energy produced at a facility by the maximum energy it could have generated if it produced 24 hours a day. The median capacity factor of solar plants in the US was 24 percent, but outliers were as low as 9 percent and as high as 35 percent. As prices continue to fall, this spread may become more pronounced, with more plants at the low end of the range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

other news sites695,https://newatlas.com/energy/aeromine-rooftop-wind/,Rooftop wind system deliversthe energy of solar per dollar,"Aeromine says its unique ""motionless"" rooftop wind generators deliver up to 50% more energy than a solar array of the same price, while taking up just 10% of the roof space and operating more or less silently. In independent tests, they seem legit.Distributed energy generation stands to play a growing part in the world's energy markets. Most of this currently comes in the form of rooftop solar, but in certain areas, wind could definitely play a bigger part. Not every spot is appropriate for a bladed wind turbine, though, and in this regard, University of Houston spinoff Aeromine Technologies has designed a very different, very tidy form of rooftop wind energy capture that looks like it could be a real game-changer.As with traditional wind turbines, size is key. So while Aeromine's wind energy boxes take up a relatively small footprint on your roof, they're still pretty bulky. The wings themselves are maybe 10 feet (3 m) high, at a rough guess, and looking at the latest imagery they're now sitting on top of boxes that might add another 6 ft (1.8 m) or more to their height – so they're no shrinking violets. On the other hand, they don't create the noise, or the constantly moving visual distraction of a regular, bladed turbine, so they may prove to be less unwelcome in populated areas.They work differently too – kind of like a set of race-car spoiler wings sandwiched together facing each other, with a round pole in between them. Angled into the wind, these stationary wings generate a low pressure vacuum in the center of the device, which sucks air through perforations either in the wings themselves or in the round pole, which also aids in accelerating the ambient airflow over the wings.(rendered image) the design places a couple of racecar spolier-like wings in a sandwich orientation, to create a low-pressure vacuum that sucks air through from below. The turbine is thus kept out of harm's way AeromineSo where's the turbine? Depending on the installation, it can either be at the bottom of that central pole, surrounded by a duct, or in more compact designs that sit right down on the roof instead of up on top of a box, the fan can be down in the roof of the building itself, in a pipe connecting either to that central pole or to hollow chambers in the perforated wings. Either way, the wings create a low-pressure zone, air is sucked through a tube to fill that low-pressure zone, and Aeromine places a relatively small, cheap internal propeller (perhaps 36 inches/91 cm in diameter) in that tube to run a generator.It's very quiet, very safe and very cheap to build; you don't need any fancy materials like carbon fiber, there's nothing special about the fan itself, and the whole thing comes apart for transport and a relatively simple construction process on site.Aeromine hasn't yet nominated a standard capacity for its devices in their latest iteration – indeed, we had to go digging to find much information at all about the device. But in a solution presented to the AFWERX Reimagining Energy challenge in January 2021, these units were each rated for 5 kW – pretty close to the output of a typical 21-panel, household rooftop solar system. Multiple units can of course be run along the leading edge of a building, spaced around 15 ft (4.6 m) apart, and each unit in this (now outdated) AFWERX challenge promised to generate around 14.3 MWh annually. Just for perspective, my 6.5-kW home rooftop solar system makes somewhere around 9 MWh a year.Aeromine Wind-Harvesting Unit, installed as a pilot trial on top of BASF's manufacturing facilities in Wyandotte, Michigan. We expect the large box at the bottom will disappear in commercial applications, with the air intake and turbine running below the roof line AeromineThe potential here is pretty clear; solar and wind work well in a complementary fashion. Solar's only generating during the sunniest hours, wind can be 24 hours but is totally dependent on conditions. The small rooftop footprint of an Aeromine system makes it possible to cover the rest of the roof in solar panels, then get some on-site battery storage happening and run a decent-sized business more or less off the grid.So what are the downsides? Well, these things need to be installed in spots where the wind direction is pretty constant, because they don't angle themselves to catch a breeze – and they probably never will, since they're designed to be such a cost-conscious machine. Their height might make them a visual or civic planning issue in some areas, and what's more, they'll cast shadows, which will block the sun from reaching rooftop PV panels unless the building is oriented such that the sun comes from one side and the wind from the other. So there's certainly going to be a limited number of places where they'll work optimally in a hybrid system.But that's about it at first glance. They're certainly cheaper, hardier, safer and less intrusive than windmill-style designs, and they offer a highly-accessible way to introduce reliable wind energy into a distributed power system.(Rendered image) Many Aeromine units can be run together, with proper spacing, and there's plenty of rooftop left for solar panels to run a hybrid system AeromineBefore getting too excited about any strange new wind energy tech, it's always worth revisiting Mike Barnard's excellent checklist to weed out dodgy wind power claims. Written in 2013, it's as relevant as ever today as more and more money flows into clean energy tech.Aeromine fares well against the Barnard test. With the University of Houston behind it, it has also submitted its gear to the gold-standard Sandia National Laboratories for testing – indeed Sandia has been involved directly in the development. It claims to harvest no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of the Betz limit of potential wind energy.A technical performance analysis prepared in partnership with Sandia, using wind tunnels at Texas Tech University, states that ""by sweeping a large area of wind with a reliable design, AeroMINEs overcome the challenges that have plagued other distributed wind solutions and have hindered distributed wind from playing a significant role in energy markets."" The report also notes a boost in energy extraction, coupled with some aerodynamic instability, when the airflow reaches the device from higher angles of attack.Aeromine motionless wind unitAeromine says that BASF is testing the system at its manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan – although it doesn't say how many units have been installed, or of what capacity. Hunting through the satellite overlays in Google Maps, it seems that the pilot test unit in the video above is situated right here, judging by the unique markings on the roof – but the satellite image isn't recent enough to show the wind power system, so we can't figure out much more.We expect this extra-tall unit sitting on a box is simply a temporary prototype designed to be super-easy to add and remove, where the final product will sit flush against the roof and have its piping and turbine installed under the surface. We wish Aeromine would be more forthcoming in its marketing.Either way, despite the limited information the company is willing to release at this point, this looks like it could be an impressive step forward for distributed rooftop wind energy. We hope Aeromine proves capable of scaling this tech up and making a serious contribution in the race to zero carbon.Check out a short video from Sandia below.R&D 100 Winner 2021: AeroMINE — Stationary Harvesting of Distributed Wind EnergySource: Aeromine via PR Newswire",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doubling the 2021 rollout rate of renewable generation will realise the ambitions identified in this plan.”BZE chief Heidi Lee says that as well as using existing technologies, the plan’s target is supported by more than 50 companies who are “already getting on” with the job.“Australia has doubled its rollout of domestic solar generation over the past five years and our plan now requires us to double down on utility solar, wind and energy storage,” Lee says.“If we take this approach to other renewable technologies we won’t just meet our legislated emission reduction targets, we’ll go well beyond them.”On “carbon drawdown,” the plan looks to initiatives that remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as revegetation, the use of pyrolysis for biomass and the protection of ecosystems and existing carbon stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, you may notice a significant difference this year as emission-free electric school buses roll out across the United States. One of the nation’s leading school bus manufacturers, Thomas Built Buses, just achieved a major milestone with help from its Virginia-based dealer Sonny Merryman — Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley electric school buses have now driven more than 500,000 miles.Electric school buses are designed for a cleaner, sustainable future. Not only do they produce zero emissions, but they are also more efficient, can cost less to maintain, and have abilities their gas-powered counterparts lack.450,000 yellow school buses across the United States travel over 4.3 billion miles each year, according to information from the US Department of Transportations National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).More importantly, toxic emissions from traditional school buses can harm students, bus drivers, and the communities they drive in.Although the EPA has introduced stricter standards, it’s not enough as many school buses still emit harmful diesel exhaust. With federal funding more accessible than ever for electric school buses, making the transition makes sense.As of June 2022, 38 states had adopted electric school buses thanks to several initiatives such as the $5 billion Clean School Bus program.Meanwhile, states like Virginia are taking the initiative to provide funding and accelerate the transition. For example, in 2019, Virginia’s Governor Ralph Northam and Dominion Energy announced an initiative to provide 13,000 electric school buses by the end of 2030.Through programs like these, Virginia has grown to become the country’s second-largest electric bus fleet, currently operating 64 Thomas Built electric school buses. In a significant milestone, the electric school buses have now traveled over 500,000 miles, with more buses expected to be delivered as the school year progresses.Growth of electric school buses in Virginia Source: Sonny MerrymanThomas Built Buses achieves 500,000 electric miles in VirginiaThe first electric school bus to roll out in the state of Virginia was Thomas Built Buses’ Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley in November 2020.One C2 Jouley electric bus can transport 81 students with up to 138 miles of range and a 226 kWh standard battery capacity.Virginia now has 64 electric buses in total. The first 50 were purchased and deployed through the Dominion Energy program, and the remaining 14 were bought using funds from the American Power electric school bus program.The 500,000 miles driven include several different terrains (city, rural, and hills) and distances from less than 20 miles to more than 90 miles. Although the electric buses have primarily been used for regular school routes, a few have made their way to field trips, band competitions, and more.By using electric buses for these trips, 447.7 short tons of greenhouse gases were avoided, according to the AFLEET tool.Through the experience so far, Thomas Built Buses dealer Sonny Merryman and its customers have learned a few critical takeaways that can help others deploy electric buses safely and efficiently:Properly train drivers and technicians for a smooth transition.Consider assigning a partner or team to help with the deployment.Perhaps, most importantly, the electric buses have withstood various operational tests, and drivers who have switched to the electric Jouley school buses have loved them so far, according to the school bus dealer.Electrek’s TakeFirst things first, congratulations to Thomas Built Buses and Sonny Merryman on the huge milestone. Electric school buses protect students and communities from harmful emissions while saving school districts money on fuel and maintenance in the long run.At the same time, I think there is a major takeaway from this case study. State funding works, and electric buses are the future. Virginia is proving it. California has proved it. State leaders need to get on board to speed up the transition. There are no excuses now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

And by focusing on renewables and solar, Oz Minerals has absolute clarity on its electricity costs for the life of the mine.The West Musgrave transport fleet will initially be powered by fossil fuels, but the company intends to switch to electrify the haul truck fleet at the first opportunity, likely to be the first engine change-out.It hopes to increase the penetration of renewables to reach net zero scope 1 emissions well before 2038, and expects technology advancements will help it make the leap from 80 per cent to full renewables, most likely in the areas of storage.Low cost and low emissionsOz Minerals has actually been looking at the renewables options for West Musgrave for many years – we first wrote about it in 2018 – because it knew then that powering the mine with fossil fuels wasn’t a viable option.It has long recognised that at such a remote location a big share of renewables was the key to helping it deliver one of the world’s lower cost and lowest emissions copper and nickel mining projects.The fact that it will supply a low emissions supply of nickel and copper will be important for the electric vehicle markets that it intends to tap into, because EV makes also want to ensure their supply chains are low carbon too.Oz Minerals is currently seeking bids from vendors before finalising the best mix of wind, solar, battery and diesel, and will then sign a long term power purchase agreement with an option to buy the energy component outright at a later date.The mine is being built on the land of the Ngaanyatjarra people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germany’s government wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars with 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electromobility. (AP Photo/Jens Meyer, file)BERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars, spending 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn away from combustion cars to more climate-friendly vehicles.The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet earlier in the day.“We are not just any automotive location, but a leading one in the world. And that’s why it’s important to us that what we’re preparing succeeds well,” Volker Wissing told reporters in Berlin. “We need a forward-looking expansion of the nationwide charging infrastructure that meets demand and is user-friendly.”The share of electric vehicles in Germany grew 24.8% year-on-year to a total share of 14.6% of all newly registered automobiles, according to figures released by the country’s Federal Office for Motor Vehicles.ADVERTISEMENTThere are around 70,000 charging points in the country but only 11,000 of those are fast-chargers, the ministry said.That is not enough to sufficiently fulfill the current needs, and it will be even less so as the number of electric cars grows quickly. There is also a big difference in availability of charging points between big cities and rural areas, where it is even harder to find charging stations.The German government’s goal is to have 1 million publicly accessible charging points in the country by 2030.In order to boost the number of charging points, the federal government will, among other initiatives provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging stations can be built. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars overnight.Electric charging is also supposed to get more user-friendly with new digital offers showing drivers where they can charge their cars on the road or being able to check online how much the different charging points demand, the minister said.Another issue the government wants to tackle is getting the country’s electric grid ready for the increased demand as more people turn to electric cars.ADVERTISEMENT“We are expecting an exponential increase in registered vehicles with battery electric drive in the next few years and must prepare accordingly,” the minister said.Switching Germans from combustion-engine automobiles to electric cars plays a key role in achieving the government’s climate targets set for the transport sector.The transformation to electric cars has also been boosted by a mix of regulatory pressure, tax breaks, improving battery range, and a wider range of vehicles to purchase.Europe in general is leading the push into battery-powered cars as electric vehicles enter the mainstream and has promised to phase out internal combustion cars by 2035.But availability of charging points is a problem not just in Germany but almost everywhere across the continent.ADVERTISEMENT“Not only is there an insufficient number of electric charging points along the road networks in most European Union countries, but the vast majority of these do not charge quickly enough,” the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said.Or as the German minister said: “Electric mobility will only find acceptance if charging is as easy as refueling is today.”___Follow all AP stories on climate change issues at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an example, recently one HJT company conducted an online pitching and according to them almost 800 people joined that call,” it added.So far this year, the output of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules has already beaten the achievements of the Chinese PV industry in 2021 by some 50%. “By June, module shipments of the TOP 10 manufacturer crossed the 100 GW and by the end of September may have reached 140-150 GW (2021: 133 GW),” said the AECEA. “Just five of these top 10 have set shipment targets of between 183-205 GW.”Furthermore, the AECEA revealed that the country’s polysilicon capacity should grow from around 530,000 MT at the end of 2021 to up to 1.2 million MT in 2022, jumping to 2.5 million MT in 2023, and up to 4 million MT in 2024.“In the near term, the overall industrial landscape won’t fundamentally change. Incumbent companies are further consolidating their market positions through backward/forward integration,” the AECEA stated. “By and large, vertical integration remains their favored business model, which in times of external supply constraints or external supply dependencies has gained ever more weight.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when that is available, NASA's technology could provide temperature controls that those charging systems would require.As NASA explains, a five-minute charge requires a charging system that provides a current at 1,400 amps. But, as Purdue points out, Tesla's V3 Supercharger – which is the apex of today's EV chargers – doesn't exceed 600 amps. Purdue's prototype last year demonstrated 2,400 amps.Hence the eventual need for a cooling system beyond today's capabilities that can handle 1,400 amps. Using NASA's FBCE, Purdue researchers, led by Dr. Issam Mudawar, pumped non-electrically conducting liquid coolant through a charging cable to capture heat from the current-carrying conductor.""Subcooled flow boiling allows Mudawar's team to deliver 4.6 times the current of the fastest available electric vehicle chargers on the market today by removing up to 24.22 kilowatts of heat,"" NASA explains.""Application of this new technology resulted in unprecedented reduction of the time required to charge a vehicle and may remove one of the key barriers to worldwide adoption of electric vehicles,"" it said.Faster charging times ought to drive higher adoption of EVs, which are part of the world's answer to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. A recent report from the International Energy Agency said sales of EVs reached 6.6 million in 2021, up from 120,000 in 2012, and accounted for 9% of all vehicle sales.Chinese consumers bought 3.3 million new EVs, many of which were two- and three-wheelers, while Europeans bought 2.3 million EVs, and US consumers bought 630,000. Still, in the US, EV sales doubled their share in 2021 year-on-year to 4.5%. China was also rolling out charging faster than most regions.Source: Purdue University",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites704,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/us/solar-babcock-ranch-florida-hurricane-ian-climate/index.html,Thissolar community endured Hurricane Ian with no loss of power and minimal damage,"CNN —Anthony Grande moved away from Fort Myers three years ago in large part because of the hurricane risk. He has lived in southwest Florida for nearly 19 years, had experienced Hurricanes Charley in 2004 and Irma in 2017 and saw what stronger storms could do to the coast.Grande told CNN he wanted to find a new home where developers prioritized climate resiliency in a state that is increasingly vulnerable to record-breaking storm surge, catastrophic wind and historic rainfall.What he found was Babcock Ranch — only 12 miles northeast of Fort Myers, yet seemingly light years away.Babcock Ranch calls itself “America’s first solar-powered town.” Its nearby solar array — made up of 700,000 individual panels — generates more electricity than the 2,000-home neighborhood uses, in a state where most electricity is generated by burning natural gas, a planet-warming fossil fuel.The streets in this meticulously planned neighborhood were designed to flood so houses don’t. Native landscaping along roads helps control storm water. Power and internet lines are buried to avoid wind damage. This is all in addition to being built to Florida’s robust building codes.Some residents, like Grande, installed more solar panels on their roofs and added battery systems as an extra layer of protection from power outages. Many drive electric vehicles, taking full advantage of solar energy in the Sunshine State.Climate resiliency was built into the fabric of the town with stronger storms in mind.So when Hurricane Ian came barreling toward southwest Florida this week, it was a true test for the community. The storm obliterated the nearby Fort Myers and Naples areas with record-breaking surge and winds over 100 mph. It knocked out power to more than 2.6 million customers in the state, including 90% of Charlotte County.But the lights stayed on in Babcock Ranch.“It certainly exceeded our expectations of a major hurricane,” Grande, 58, told CNN.A damaged building is seen in Babcock Ranch after Hurricane Ian. Courtesy Nancy ChorpenningAn uprooted tree in Babcock Ranch after Hurricane Ian. Courtesy Nancy ChorpenningSign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter.The storm uprooted trees and tore shingles from roofs, but other than that Grande said there is no major damage. Its residents say Babcock Ranch is proof that an eco-conscious and solar-powered town can withstand the wrath of a near-Category 5 storm.“We have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,” Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. “We have water, electricity, internet — and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.”Grande said Hurricane Ian came through southwest Florida “like a freight train.” But he wasn’t afraid that he would lose everything in a storm, like he was when he lived in Fort Myers.“We’re very, very blessed and fortunate to not be experiencing what they’re experiencing now in Sanibel Island and Fort Myers Beach,” Grande said. “In the times that we’re living in right now with climate change, the beach is not the place to live or have a business.”Solar successSyd Kitson, a former professional football player for the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, is the mastermind behind Babcock Ranch. Kitson envisioned it to be an eco-conscious and innovative neighborhood that is safe and resilient from storms like Ian.The ranch broke ground in 2015 with the construction of the solar array — which was built and is run by Florida Power and Light — and its first residents moved into the town in 2018. Since then, the array has doubled in size and thousands of people have made Babcock their home.Around 700,000 solar panels power Babcock Ranch. Dennis Axer/Alamy“It’s a great case study to show that it can be done right, if you build in the right place and do it the right way,” said Lisa Hall, a spokesperson for Kitson, who also lives in Babcock Ranch.“Throughout all this, there’s just so many people saying, ‘it worked, that this was the vision, this is the reason we moved here,’” Hall told CNN.Perhaps the highest endorsement for the city is that it is now a refuge for some of Ian’s hardest-hit victims. The state opened Babcock Neighborhood School as an official shelter, even though it didn’t have the mandated generator. The solar array kept the lights on.Some of Chorpenning’s friends who live on Sanibel Island — which is now cut off from the mainland after Ian’s devastating storm surge severed the causeway — came to shelter at a friend’s house at Babcock Ranch. It will be a while before they can go back, she said.“They’re going to be renting a place over here for a while, while they figure out what’s going to happen out there,” she said. “I joked that we may be the only people in southwest Florida whose property value just increased.”Even Kitson chose to ride out the storm in Babcock to see how the community would fare in the hurricane. Kitson declined CNN’s request for an interview; Hall said he is focused on helping neighboring communities rebuild.“He was there during the storm; he said, ‘where else would I be?’” Hall said. “We built it to be resilient and as much as you plan and think you’ve done the right thing, you don’t know until you put it to the test.”Babcock Ranch has sold more than 2,000 homes, according to the neighborhood's website. Dennis Stephenson/AlamyAs utilities scramble to restore power across the state, Babcock residents say September storms showed that America’s energy infrastructure is not well-equipped to handle worsening extreme weather events. Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico’s power grid when it made landfall there on September 18. Now, Ian has left millions of people in the dark in Florida.Babcock residents say their neighborhood is a model for urban development in a climate change-ravaged future.“It’s not what it was 20 or 25 years ago; the storms are getting bigger and bigger, and it’s no surprise, because the warnings have all been there,” Grande said. “I think Babcock Ranch’s future has gotten even brighter.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Karen Ducey/The Seattle Times via AP)Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at an event highlighting the Biden-Harris Administration's investments in electric school buses at Lumen Field in Seattle on Wednesday, oct. 26, 2022. (Karen Ducey/The Seattle Times via AP)WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 400 school districts spanning all 50 states and Washington, D.C., along with several tribes and U.S. territories, are receiving roughly $1 billion in grants to purchase about 2,500 “clean” school buses under a new federal program.The Biden administration is making the grants available as part of a wider effort to accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles and reduce air pollution near schools and communities.Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan announced the grant awards Wednesday in Seattle. The new, mostly electric school buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions , save money and better protect children’s health, they said.As many as 25 million children ride yellow buses each school day, and they will have a healthier future with a cleaner fleet, Harris said.“We are witnessing around our country and around the world the effects of extreme climate,” she said. “What we’re announcing today is a step forward in our nation’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, to invest in our economy ... to invest in building the skills of America’s workforce. All with the goal of not only saving our children, but for them, saving our planet.″ADVERTISEMENTOnly about 1% of the nation’s 480,000 school buses were electric as of last year, but the push to abandon traditional diesel buses has gained momentum in recent years. Money for the new purchases is available under the federal Clean School Bus Program, which includes $5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed last year.The clean bus program “is accelerating our nation’s transition to electric and low-emission school buses while ensuring a brighter, healthier future for our children,” Regan said.The EPA initially made $500 million available for clean buses in May but increased that to $965 million last month, responding to what officials called overwhelming demand for electric buses. An additional $1 billion is set to be awarded in the budget year that began Oct. 1.The EPA said it received about 2,000 applications requesting nearly $4 billion for more than 12,000 buses, mostly electric. Some 389 applications worth $913 million were accepted to support purchase of 2,463 buses, 95% of which will be electric, the EPA said. The remaining buses will run on compressed natural gas or propane.ADVERTISEMENTSchool districts identified as priority areas serving low-income, rural or tribal students make up 99% of the projects that were selected, the White House said. More applications are under review, and the EPA plans to select more winners to reach the full $965 million in coming weeks.Districts set to receive money range from Wrangell, Alaska, to Anniston, Alabama, and Teton County, Wyoming, to Wirt County, West Virginia. Besides the District of Columbia, big cities that won grants for clean school buses include New York, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Los Angeles.White House adviser Mitch Landrieu said he expects many buses to be delivered by the start of the next school year, with the remainder likely to be in service by the end of 2023. The billion dollars being spent this year — along with an additional $4 billon expected over the next four years — should “supercharge” a domestic manufacturing boom for electric school buses, said Landrieu, a former New Orleans mayor tapped by Biden to oversee spending in the massive infrastructure law.ADVERTISEMENT“These buses will be made in America — real jobs with real wages,″ Landrieu said in an interview. “We are going to ramp up manufacturing in this country.″Environmental and public health groups hailed the announcement, which comes after years of advocacy to replace diesel-powered buses with cleaner alternatives.“It doesn’t make sense to send our kids to school on buses that create brain-harming, lung-harming, cancer-causing, climate-harming pollution,″ said Molly Rauch, public health policy director for Moms Clean Air Force, an environmental group. “Our kids, our bus drivers and our communities deserve better.″",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The startup claims its automated, on-site factory can already speed up plant construction and cut costs by employing robotic arms that lift and connect heavy solar panels to sun trackers. When asked for photos of the insides of its factory, Campbell pointed TechCrunch to previously published aerial pics and declined to share more, “for competitive reasons.”Terabase also makes software tools to manage the design and construction of solar farms. The startup recently wrapped its first commercial project, where its robots reportedly installed 10 megawatts worth of panels. There are one million megawatts in a terawatt, so the startup still has a long way to go to reach its aspirations.Breakthrough Energy Ventures was founded by Bill Gates, and its board members include Jeff Bezos and Masayoshi Son. The VC firm co-led the Terabase deal alongside Lime and Amp Robotics investor Prelude Ventures.Their investment comes as rich folks face scrutiny for their outsized climate pollution. Gates’ private jet might not be as active as Taylor Swift’s, yet the Microsoft co-founder reportedly owns several and has called private flying his “guilty pleasure.”Other recent deals for solar energy startups include panel installer Zolar ($105 million) and solar network developer Okra ($2.1 million).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites711,https://www.igorslab.de/en/evga-pulls-the-plug-with-loud-bang-yet-it-has-long-been-editorial/,EVGA pulls the plug with a loud bangbut it has been stewing for a long time Editorial,"If you want to (or have to) separate, then there are two ways to announce this: one emotionless and one where you once again seek the big stage. EVGA chose, what a coincidence, the time shortly before NVIDIA’s in-house exhibition GTC (after that, the whole thing would have gone down a bit) to drop the bombshell that wasn’t really a bombshell anymore. This media uprising and aftermath is really just the long overdue flashback after a smoldering fire that lasted for months and in which the green fuse was even shorter than Jensen’s wood screws in his old Fermi mock up.I thought long and hard about whether to write something about it (and about what), because I also have my own private opinion about the circumstances in general and EVGA’s appearance in particular, which has been formed in the last few years also due to my own experiences. That’s why I also used the weekend to chat or talk on the phone with one or the other competitor and colleague, in addition to all the benchmarks. Because the way in which and where the reason is now located and the way in which a suitable culprit is presented at the same time has caused quite a stir among many people. It’s not about defending NVIDIA, but using Jensen as the ideal object of hatred is a bit short-sighted and only distracts from one’s own failures. But you have to throw something down the throat of the investors and brand-affine customers. And that’s where the green leather jacket Hulk is best suited.My colleague Stephen Burke from Gamersnexus has actually already said most of it, I don’t need to dissect and regurgitate that again. I’ll just post the short quote from EVGA CEO Andrew Han again now before I get my own thoughts on it.We are not going to be on Jensen’s lap on stage, so I don’t want people to speculate what’s going on….EVGA has decided to nat carry the next gen. (Andrew Han, CEO)The business model: Let others do itIn principle, EVGA is nothing more than a brand without its own production. Of course, the company has its own R&D department for the engineering, but the level of creativity is not particularly high here either, if you only have to rely on the abilities of third parties in the end, be it the circuit boards, the coolers and the complete production as the final implementation. Unfortunately, having it done instead of doing it yourself costs money. And while this very concept mitigates risk and effort in manufacturing, it also reduces the margin that can still be achieved with such a highly complex product. Therefore, I asked several competitors and found out that the currently achievable margins in the worst case (like EVGA) are still 5%, and up to 10% for the do-it-yourself manufacturers, who can manage an own production.This is not less than in 2021 or 2020, only this year merchandise sales have dropped significantly due to orders staying away and a change in demand. However, that one produces at a loss because of NVIDIA’s money-grubbing claws, as EVGA colports, is considered by many to be an urban legend. These are rather homemade problems with faulty designs and a RMA rate that was beyond good and evil. I don’t want to quote myself again, but the disaster with Amazon’s New World and the scorched circuit boards was expensive, really expensive. To attach this to every card as a loss is definitely too short-sighted.Let’s say they made 10x profit than normal business last year, if you are the boss, will you quit now or waste another 10 years just to make the same profit amount last year? (Competitor)The business of brands is actually like the good old stock market business, because you should sell at the peak and best take what is still to be taken. If you have to buy almost all services at a high price, there is not much left in the graphics card business. A large manufacturer (not EVGA) easily produces around 200,000 graphics cards per week, which puts the 5 to 10 percent in a different light. In the system gastronomy, business also only works via sheer mass, which is no different with graphics cards. However, EVGA lacks exactly this mass (which can also be seen as a buffer), which can cushion smaller outliers.If you ask the competitors why they haven’t copied EVGA’s warranty, upgrade and exchange model as well, you actually only see grinning faces or shaking heads. Statements such as “economic suicide by default” are still the most polite thing to say. I wrote that the cards have become more and more complex and that the risk of failure has increased dramatically as a result. Therefore, the RMA processes do not become more favorable, on the contrary. Goodwill and generosity, as EVGA has made its trademark, must also be afforded and what was manageable 10 years ago can end in collapse any day today. House of cards and all. Here, EVGA simply lacks the critical mass to easily pull off something like this financially. Being the US market leader is all well and good, but how big is the DIY market there?If it were profitable, we would have done it long ago (Competitor)Peripherals and power supplies are much easier to keep track of and now offer much higher margins of up to 30 percent. Power supplies are just the new thermal paste and the run is still properly fueled by ATX 3.0. Speaking of power supplies, I remember how EVGA at the time (this was back in the Kepler days) made the sampling of graphics cards dependent on a positive review of the newly introduced power supplies. Back then, I was still writing for Tom’s Hardware and very stubbornly resisted the “reward for award” system. At that time, however, the “Just buy it!” philosophy did not yet exist there and one was still allowed to do such things as a reviewer.As a result, I was then excluded from sampling for a few years. By the way, I’m still alive, which shows once again that you don’t have to go along with something like that if you don’t want to. I also don’t want to repeat how EVGA products later failed my tests and the engineering used my findings (pad mod, area increase on the cooling frame, RAM monitoring in the ICX design), but the PR kicked nasty in my direction. I never asked for money for my support, but would probably have been happy to receive a thank you now and then. By the way, this is exactly where you notice the difference between a US company like EVGA and a German medium-sized company. EVGA is extremely profit-oriented, and when things don’t go so well, they just part with a division. By the way, this is not reprehensible, but the explanations should then also be more honest.The Green Light Program as a buzzkillAnd what does NVIDIA have to do with it now? Yes, even the competitors are properly pissed off that they still don’t know NVIDIA’s prices and don’t know at which dumping or scalper rate Master Jensen will beat his new Ada into the market as a playmate (depending). That’s why you won’t see so many completely new designs, and what I had already called “Playground” in the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will mostly be continued. This is then economic prudence and not even stupid. EVGA could have thought of that as well.However, you also have to know that NVIDIA strives for total control and also mercilessly enforces these policies. There isn’t much room left for technical gimmicks á la EVGA’s special models and both sides have clashed hard not only once. EVGA always explores how far you can go and NVIDIA then intervenes to correct the situation. I have already explained this in detail in the article linked above and I don’t want to repeat myself. However, it is also a fact that NVIDIA only provides replacements if you follow “NVIDIA’s rules”. You can approve of this or not, but it leads (at least in theory) to more durable products.Things like EVGA’s Kingpin models break those rules, but that’s where they’ve found a clever loophole because it’s effectively declared a mod. Galax does the same with the HoF series. Various overclockers give their face for it (for good money) and it is not a consumer product. That’s why you don’t get a real HoF including unlimited OC tool as a normal customer, but only the “roadworthy” version under the same name. The rest is then expensive cannon fodder for the LN2 artillery. Such marketing escapades also cost money, of course, even if they can boost the company’s image. The good Kingpin must now look for another place in the money rainforest, but the choice is rather manageable there.I didn’t really want to go that far, but once you’re in such a nice writing flow, the shore you’re aiming for gets further and further away. In order to come to some kind of conclusion at the end, I’ll make it simple for myself, because I can perhaps also question some things differently: It is certainly not a loss for me (and many others), because it became apparent that the model practiced for years would no longer have been financially viable in this way. And before one admits this publicly and meekly, one looks for the last big performance and says goodbye to the shocked audience with a big bang. I only hope that all previous customers will still be dealt with gallantly and treated fairly. Then it will surely work out with the power supplies, housings and other stuff.After all, I haven’t heard from any other small Jensen exclusive customers that they now have to throw in the towel for the reasons I mentioned. But they can probably calculate better and also produce themselves. It is a pity about a colorful facet on the graphics card market, which I will also miss, but the customer will get over it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet fossil fuel investment didn’t follow the trend, dipping slightly instead of rising along with the market.Bonds and loans for renewable projects and companies did the opposite, ticking steadily upward from 2015 on.

Existing investors ArcelorMittal, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group, Coatue, Energy Impact Partners, The Engine, NGP ETP, Temasek, Prelude Ventures and VamosVentures provided follow-on capital.Such large rounds are becoming commonplace in the battery industry as startups transition from research and development to manufacturing and commercialization.Form is one of many battery tech companies that have popped up over the past decade, though it’s taking a different tack from many others. Where most companies are focusing on lithium ion-related chemistries, the startup has been pursuing iron-air batteries. That means its cells don’t rely on expensive and supply-constrained minerals like lithium, cobalt or nickel. Form will start commercial production in late 2024, and it’s aiming to eventually produce its battery packs for less than $20 per kWh.If the company can hit its target, it would hasten the shift toward renewable power. Already, solar and wind are price-competitive with fossil fuel plants, and in some cases they’re cheaper than running existing natural gas-fired plants. Adding inexpensive storage to contain cheap power would make renewables competitive in more locations.Form already has a contract with Great River Energy in Minnesota to install a 150-MWh battery, and it’s working with Southern Company to explore a similar pilot in Georgia.It’s one of a growing number of battery companies that are ignoring EVs in favor of other markets that are key to the energy transition.

other news sites714,https://electrek.co/2022/10/04/renewables-global-electricity/,Renewables metof the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of ,"Renewables met all of the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of 2022, preventing any growth in coal and gas generation, according to a new report published by London-based energy think tank Ember.The rise in wind and solar generation met over 75% of the demand growth in the first half of 2022, while hydro met the remainder, preventing a possible 4% increase in fossil-fuel generation and avoiding $40 billion in fuel costs and 230 Mt CO2 in emissions.Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior analyst at Ember, said:Wind and solar are proving themselves during the energy crisis. The first step to ending the grip of expensive and polluting fossil fuels is to build enough clean power to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity.The report analyzes electricity data from 75 countries representing 90% of global electricity demand. It compares the first six months of 2022 to the first half of 2021 to show how the electricity transition has progressed.The report finds that global electricity demand grew by 389 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first half of 2022. Renewables – wind, solar, and hydro – increased by 416 TWh, slightly exceeding the rise in electricity demand.Wind and solar alone rose by 300 TWh, which was equal to 77% of the rise in global electricity demand. In China, the rise in wind and solar generation alone met 92% of its electricity demand rise. In the United States it was 81%, and in India it was 23%.Rise in fossil-fuel generation unchangedAs a result of the growth in renewables, fossil-fuel generation was almost unchanged (+5 TWh, +0.1%). Coal fell by 36 TWh (-1%) and gas by 1 TWh (-0.05%). This offset a slight rise in other fossil fuels (mainly oil) of 42 TWh. Consequently, global CO2 power sector emissions were unchanged in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year, despite the rise in electricity demand.Coal in the EU rose 15% only to cover a temporary shortfall in nuclear and hydro generation. Coal in India rose 10% because of a sharp rebound in electricity demand from lows early last year when the pandemic struck hardest. Globally, these rises were offset by coal-power falls of 3% in China and 7% in the United States.The growth in wind and solar prevented a 4% rise in fossil fuel electricity generation worldwide. In China, the growth in wind and solar enabled fossil fuel power to fall by 3%. Without this growth, fossil fuels would have risen by 1%. In India, fossil fuel power rose by 9%, but it would have been 12% without growth in wind and solar. In the United States, it slowed down the rise in fossil fuel power from 7% to just 1%. In the EU, fossil fuel power rose by 6%, but it would have been 16% without growth in wind and solar.Despite the halt in fossil-fuel generation in the first half of 2022, coal and gas generation increased in July and August. It leaves open the possibility that power sector emissions in 2022 may yet rise, following last year’s all-time high.Further, a new report from San Francisco-based NGO Global Energy Monitor found that approximately 89.6 gigawatts (GW) of gas plants in development globally, totaling 5,070 million metric tons of CO2e lifetime emissions if built, are coal-to-gas conversions or replacements.These conversions are proceeding despite data showing that gas projects are increasingly uncompetitive with renewables and are just as bad, if not worse, for the environment than coal.Wiatros-Motyka said:We can’t be sure if we’ve reached peak coal and gas in the power sector. Global power sector emissions are still pushing all-time highs when they need to be falling very quickly. And the same fossil fuels pushing us into a climate crisis are also causing the global energy crisis.

Breaking the 30% barrier is therefore a big step in accelerating the energy transition and improving energy security by reducing the dependency on fossil fuels.The best of both worldsTandem devices can reach higher efficiencies than single junction solar cells because of a better utilization of the solar spectrum. The currently emerging tandems combine commercial silicon technology for the bottom device with perovskite technology: the latter featuring highly efficient conversion of ultraviolet and visible light and excellent transparency to near infrared light. In four-terminal (4T) tandem devices the top and bottom cells operate independently of each other which makes it possible to apply different bottom cells in this kind of devices. Commercial PERC technology as well as premium technologies like heterojunction or TOPCon or thin-film technology such as CIGS can be implemented in a 4T tandem device with hardly any modifications to the solar cells. Furthermore, the four-terminal architecture makes it straight forward to implement bifacial tandems to further boost the energy yield.Researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium have successfully improved the efficiency of the semi-transparent perovskite cells up to 19.7% with an area of 3x3 mm2 as certified by ESTI (Italy). “This type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93% of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device. This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.” says Dr Mehrdad Najafi of TNO. “The silicon device is a 20x20-mm2 wide, heterojunction solar cell featuring optimized surface passivation, transparent conductive oxides and Cu-plated front contacts for state-of-the-art carrier extraction” says Yifeng Zhao, PhD student at TU Delft, whose results have been recently peer-reviewed. The silicon device optically stacked under the perovskite contributes with 10.4% efficiency points to the total solar energy conversion.Combined, 30.1% is the conversion efficiency of this non-area matched 4T tandem devices operating independently.

other news sites717,https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/carmakers-lifetime-emissions-50-higher-than-reported/,Carmakersglobal emissions higher than reported,"Carmakers’ global emissions are on average 50% higher than what they report with Hyundai-Kia and BMW underreporting emissions by as much as 115% and 80% respectively, a new Transport & Environment (T&E) report shows. With obligatory scope 3 (lifetime) emissions disclosure set to be introduced in 2023, asset managers with exposure to carbon intensive carmakers face a ‘ticking carbon bomb’, says T&E.In 2023, the EU will introduce a requirement that financial institutions disclose their scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions)[1]. The new requirement will hit asset managers with exposure to carmakers hard. Unlike manufacturers of furniture or mobile phones, the vast majority (98%) of a car company’s emissions come under scope 3 – primarily the use of the cars [2].But, as T&E’s analysis shows, carmakers’ already high scope 3 emissions are likely far larger than officially reported.Luca Bonaccorsi, director of sustainable finance at T&E, said: “For green investing to be effective, we need accurate data. Carmakers are trying to pull the wool over investors eyes by underreporting the lifetime emissions of their cars. This makes a mockery of carmakers’ green claims.”Carmakers base their total reported emissions on a number of factors such as the average size of the vehicles, where the cars are driven and the lifespan of vehicles. Carmakers on the whole have used selective data to reach a lower figure. Toyota, for example, bases the lifetime average emissions of its vehicles on a scarcely believable 100,000 kilometres.This makes car companies, from an investment perspective, almost as carbon intensive as the oil industry. At today’s prices, €1 million invested in an average of oil giants Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell finances around 5,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The same amount finances more than 4,500 tCO2e in the car sector[3]. In some cases the carbon intensity of carmakers is significantly higher: nearly 10,000 tonnes if invested in Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and 7,000 tonnes for Honda according to carmakers’ reporting [4].Luca Bonaccorsi added: “According to official disclosures, a euro invested in a car company finances virtually the same amount of carbon as a euro in an oil company. This should be a wake up call for the financial industry. Asset managers wanting to avoid a ticking carbon bomb will have to start ditching carmakers that continue to sell polluting cars.”By the end of 2022, Morningstar, a US-based financial firm, estimates that some 50% of all new financial products sold will be environmental, social and governance (ESG) based. However, ESG ratings fail to capture the companies’ true climate impact. Despite CO2 emissions being the most important environmental indicators, they represent less than 1% of the ESG rating for S&P and MSCI, two of the world’s leading ESG indexes. T&E calls on the EU to regulate and harmonise the methodology for ESG ratings to ensure consistent and transparent reporting of data.ENDSNotes to editor[1] Car companies’ true carbon intensity will be revealed in 2023 thanks to mandatory Scope 3 disclosure (both in the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive).[2] Greenhouse gas emissions are categorised into three groups (Scopes) by the most widely-used international accounting tool, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain.[3] This is based on the official scope 3 disclosures of carmakers and oil companies, not T&E’s estimates. Oil companies are likely also significantly underreporting their scope 3 emissions. However, we have no evidence to believe that the under-reporting is higher in any specific sector. On the contrary, in another analysis, evidence suggests the error must be rather homogeneous across sectors and is somewhat filtered out by the use of ratios.[4] The chart does not compare companies’ total emissions but the amount of emissions equivalent to a specific financial investment. This ratio is influenced by the appetite of the market for a specific company, so the higher the evaluation of the company, the lower the carbon intensity ratio. A company’s evaluation is affected by a large number of variables.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites718,https://www.eenews.net/articles/global-emissions-targets-spell-growth-for-co2-tech-sector/,Global emissions targets spell growth for COtech sector,"Companies that produce technologies to remove or reduce carbon emissions are “poised for strong continued growth,” reaching an expected value of $1.4 trillion by 2027, according to new market research.The research report, recently released by the financial data firm PitchBook, predicts that the sector will be worth $905 billion by the end of this year. That makes the global climate tech sector relatively small — collectively worth less than electric vehicle maker Tesla.But PitchBook predicts that the emerging sector will enjoy an 8.8 percent growth rate over the next five years, “thanks to increasing global focus on aggressive emissions targets and consumer interest in emissions reduction.” That rate could also increase if there were “dramatic regulatory change or technological innovation” during that time, the report for investors said.AdvertisementThe sector PitchBook analyzed is a broad one. It includes startups that capture or trade carbon dioxide, industrial and building firms with products that are less emissions-intensive than conventional ones, and land management companies that use or produce monitoring tools or low-emissions fertilizers.The most valuable group of companies in the space are ones working to reduce planet-warming emissions during construction and over the lifetimes of buildings. They are currently worth almost $459 billion and are expected to increase in value to $650 billion over the next five years, according to the report.That segment includes incumbents like building materials producers Holcim Group and HeidelbergCement, as well as startups like green construction firm Veev and energy efficiency company Resideo Technologies.The segment PitchBook calls “green industry” is focused on decarbonizing industrial production of chemicals and raw materials. It’s valued at more than $400 billion, according to the report. Notable firms include lithium battery recycler Redwood Materials and the mining company Lilac Solutions.PitchBook expects green industry to be the most valuable climate tech segment by 2027, with an estimated value of $657 billion. For those projections to play out, however, emissions pricing legislation like the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism “will be critical to ensure that those providing green chemicals and materials are not at a disadvantage against foreign high-emissions products,” the report said.The value of low-carbon land management companies is expected to reach $30 billion this year, increasing to $49.5 billion in five years. The segment includes major monitoring firms like Honeywell and the alternative fertilizer company Pivot Bio.Venture capital investment in land management firms has recently slowed, the report noted. But the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August, included more than $20 billion to support climate-smart agriculture practices and $5 billion in grants for fire-resilient forests, urban tree planting and forest conservation.The smallest but fastest-growing segment of the sector is made up of carbon technology firms like the direct air capture pioneer Climeworks and the carbon trading platform Xpansiv. They’re now valued at around $9 billion and estimated to be worth $20.9 billion by 2027.The carbon tech sector will also get a boost from Biden’s new climate law, the report said. The value of carbon captured in the United States has increased from $50 per ton to $85 for CO2 removed from smokestacks. For direct air capture projects, which suck CO2 from the atmosphere, the price they earn per ton of carbon has jumped 250 percent, to $180.But it’s not all smooth sailing for carbon capture and trading firms.“The core risk facing the carbon tech space is in the potential for the value of carbon to shift dramatically due to changes in policy and regulation,” PitchBook said. “The product of carbon tech (removing or reducing carbon) does not directly provide value — outside of some value as a feedstock for carbon utilization — and fiscal value from carbon tech activities is heavily driven by the value that legislative incentives and schemes place on carbon.”Despite that risk, investors continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential for carbon capture firms. There were 11 venture capital deals in the second quarter of 2022, raising $882.2 million for Climeworks, Carbon Clean and other firms, according to PitchBook.“This far surpasses any prior quarter, with the total invested over the previous four quarters totaling only $432.1 million,” the research firm said in another investor report published last week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Theoretically, the price/performance ratio is also good enough to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation.The first commercial applications are already being realised, with dye-sensitized solar windows installed in the SwissTech Convention Center, however their capacity for generating electricity has so far been restricted by their lack of efficiency compared to traditional solar cells.The latest development pushes the power conversion efficiency to between 28.4-30.2 per cent, while still maintaining long-term operational stability over 500 hours of testing.“Our findings pave the way for facile access to high performance DSCs and offer promising prospects for applications as power supply and battery replacement for low-power electronic devices that use ambient light as their energy source,” wrote the authors of a study detailing the technology.The study, titled ‘Hydroxamic acid preadsorption raises efficiency of cosensitized solar cells’, was published in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Credit: Steve Zylius / UCIResearchers at the University of California, Irvine and four national laboratories have devised a way to make lithium-ion battery cathodes without using cobalt, a mineral plagued by price volatility and geopolitical complications.In a paper published today in Nature, the scientists describe how they overcame thermal and chemical-mechanical instabilities of cathodes composed substantially of nickel—a common substitute for cobalt—by mixing in several other metallic elements.""Through a technique we refer to as 'high-entropy doping,' we were able to successfully fabricate a cobalt-free layered cathode with extremely high heat tolerance and stability over repeated charge and discharge cycles,"" said corresponding author Huolin Xin, UCI professor of physics & astronomy. ""This achievement resolves long-standing safety and stability concerns around high-nickel battery materials, paving the way for broad-based commercial applications.""Cobalt is one of the most significant supply chain risks threatening widespread adoption of electric cars, trucks and other electronic devices requiring batteries, according to the paper's authors. The mineral, which is chemically suited for the purpose of stabilizing lithium-ion battery cathodes, is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of Congo under abusive and inhumane conditions.""Electric vehicle manufacturers are eager to curtail the use of cobalt in their battery packs not only for cost reduction but to counter the child labor practices used to mine the mineral,"" Xin said. ""Research has also shown that cobalt can lead to oxygen release at high voltage, causing damage to lithium-ion batteries. All of this points to a need for alternatives.""However, nickel-based cathodes come with their own problems, such as poor heat tolerance, which can lead to oxidization of battery materials, thermal runaway and even explosion. Although high-nickel cathodes accommodate larger capacities, volume strain from repeated expansion and contraction can result in poor stability and safety concerns.The researchers sought to address these issues through compositionally complex high-entropy doping using HE-LMNO, an amalgamation of transition metals magnesium, titanium, manganese, molybdenum and niobium in the structure's interior, with a subset of these minerals used on its surface and interface with other battery materials.Xin and his colleagues employed an array of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and 3D nanotomography instruments to determine that their zero-cobalt cathode exhibited an unprecedented volumetric change of zero during repeated use. The highly stable structure is capable of withstanding more than 1,000 cycles and high temperatures, which makes it comparable to cathodes with much lower nickel content.For some of these research tools, Xin collaborated with researchers at the National Synchrotron Light Source II, located at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. As a DOE Office of Science user facility, NSLS-II offered the team access to three of its 28 scientific instruments—called beamlines—to study the internal structure of the new cathode.""The combination of the different methods at NSLS II beamlines enabled the discovery of a trapping effect of oxygen vacancies and defects inside the material, which effectively prevents the crack formation in the HE-LMNO secondary particle, making this structure extremely stable during cycling,"" said co-author Mingyuan Ge, a scientist at NSLS-II.Added Xin: ""Using these advanced tools, we were able to observe the dramatically increased thermal stability and zero-volumetric-change characteristics of the cathode, and we've been able to demonstrate extraordinarily improved capacity retention and cycle life. This research could set the stage for the development of an energy-dense alternative to existing batteries.""He said the work represents a step toward achieving the dual goal of spurring the proliferation of clean transportation and energy storage while addressing environmental justice issues around the extraction of minerals used in batteries.More information: Huolin Xin, Compositionally complex doping for zero-strain zero-cobalt layered cathodes, Nature (2022). www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05115-z Journal information: Nature Huolin Xin, Compositionally complex doping for zero-strain zero-cobalt layered cathodes,(2022).

A paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds that it’s raining harder in most of the United States. The study, written by researchers at Northwestern University, tied the results to climate change and to warmer air’s ability to hold more water. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Record rain is hitting drought-stricken areas. That’s not good news. The findings echo the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics, as well as the evidence from decades of research, and highlight the real-time effect that humans are having on the weather and climate.The research offers confirmation of what atmospheric scientists have been warning of for years: a warmer world is, on balance, a wetter world. And as global temperatures continue to rise, an uptick in precipitation extremes is expected.Climate change is causing heavier rainsWhat the study finds is consistent with a basic tenet of atmospheric physics: For every degree Fahrenheit that air temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold 4 percent more water; this is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Where storm clouds develop and the atmosphere is sufficiently moist, it means a warmer climate will support more intense rainfall.AdvertisementThe study reports “consistent shifts from lower to higher daily precipitation intensities, particularly in the central and eastern United States.” The authors compared rainfall over two periods — 1951 to 1980 and 1991 to 2020 — to see how patterns evolved.“When it’s raining, it’s raining more,” said Ryan Harp, the author lead author on the study, in an interview. “But what we also did was … we were able to verify some of the expectations we had based on modeling studies.”In other words, most similar studies to date had centered on projections made by forward-running computer models fed with historical data. This is among the first that, on a nationwide level, examine observed daily rainfall trends.“I think during that process we were a little surprised that this paper hasn’t been written before,” said Daniel Horton, a study co-author and a professor at Northwestern University, in an interview. “We know that precipitation should be increasing … but we just wanted to do a very straightforward paper that says, ‘Yep, we’re seeing it.’ ”AdvertisementHarp said the fact that reality matched simulations lends credence to climate models.“People should in general be trusting in climate models,” he said. “We’re constantly working to improve them to the best of our abilities.”Not necessarily more rain overall, and not everywhereIn the study, the authors examined daily data from more than 1,700 weather stations distributed in the Lower 48. Each had to have a continuous record dating back to at least 1951 to be included in the study.In the eastern United States, the researchers observed a 4.5 to 5.7 percent increase in average daily rainfall on days when it rained. That does not say there are more days with rain, or more rain overall.“That doesn’t necessarily give us the whole story,” Harp said. “There may be places where precipitation intensity is increasing but frequency is decreasing. We might not know if there’s an overall increase or decrease. That’s one thing that we’re working on.”Greg Carbin, the head of forecast operations at the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center, who was not involved in this research, appreciated that the study touched on the “paradox of potentially fewer precipitation days with higher-intensity precipitation occurring on those days.”Carbin has noted a trend of more rain falling on fewer days in his analysis of recent precipitation.Advertisement“Overall, the area covered by the count of 1-inch rainfall days was lower than in recent years across large parts of the central and eastern U.S.,” Carbin wrote in an email. “In fact, moderate to severe drought has plagued areas of the Northeast, and extreme to exceptional drought is now expanding across part of the central U.S. Nonetheless, we have had extreme rainfall events occur in St. Louis, Dallas, eastern Kentucky, and, most recently, with Hurricane Ian in Florida.”Despite strong trends in the central and eastern United States, the authors noted that there were a few places where rainfall did not appear to be growing more intense. The paper does detail “mixed signals in the western U.S.,” but for reasons the authors are still trying to identify.“That [trend] didn’t hold true for the western U.S.,” said Harp, especially in the Pacific Northwest. He explained that changes in the overall placement of weather systems are “suppressing” any tendency for heavier precipitation in the West. A slight change in the location at which high and low pressure systems are anchored can have an enormous bearing on steering currents, and subsequently on how much precipitation falls in a given location.Changing precipitation trends poses societal challengesWith the planet continuing to warm, a continued increase in rainfall intensity can be expected. That spells concern over whether existing infrastructure can handle the downpours of the future.AdvertisementCommunities may need to turn to simulated precipitation events of the future to guide building decisions, Horton said.The past summer was a testament to the extent to which climate-supercharged downpours can wreak havoc on major metropolitan areas. During a five-week span in July and August, five 1,000-year rain events — or extremely heavy rainfall episodes that have a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year — occurred across the nation.“Recent years have seen some remarkable high-end precipitation events,” Carbin said.GiftOutline Gift Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country listed border control, oil spill detection and ship detection and tracking among the practical uses for the satellites. The UAE aims to launch the first satellite in three years, with the entire satellite program to last around six years. It did not specify the total amount it plans to invest in the constellation.The 3 billion AED ($820 million) National Space Fund, announced Monday, is the latest signal that the country is looking to the space sector to help diversify its oil-dependent economy. As of 2020, oil exports made up nearly 30% of total gross domestic product. However, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy counts space among its “promising economic sectors,” and its space program has undertaken a number of major programs in the past five years.The UAE established an astronaut program in 2017; one of its two astronauts will fly to the International Space Station in 2023 as part of a long-duration mission with Axiom Space. That astronaut, Hazza Al Mansoori, was the first person from the Emirates to go to space in a 2019 mission to the ISS.KhalifaSat, the first satellite that was entirely designed and manufactured in the Emirates, was launched to orbit in 2018. Since, the UAE sent an orbiter to Mars in 2020, announced plans to send a 22-pound rover to the moon with Japanese startup ispace and said it would send a probe to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with the aim of ultimately landing on an asteroid in the early 2030s.The National Space Fund will “actively encourage partnerships between international and local enterprises,” according to a statement. The country will also seek solicitation from local and international companies for the Sirb satellite constellation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch725,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/solid-63m-embedded-fintech/,Solid banksM for easier deployment of embedded fintech products,"Solid, which rebranded from Wise in 2021, raised a $63 million Series B round of funding to continue providing its fintech-as-a-service offering for companies wanting to launch and scale their own fintech products.The San Mateo-based company works with fintech and vertical SaaS companies and offers banking, payments, cards and cryptocurrency products via easy-to-integrate APIs.We last profiled the company in 2020, before its name change, and after it had picked up both a $5.7 million seed and a $12 million Series A.Arjun Thyagarajan, co-founder and CEO at Solid, told TechCrunch that the company spent the last 18 months working with early customers on product-market fit.Traditional fintech infrastructure was not built for the modern company, he explained, and that results in companies needing dozens of point solutions and often spending millions in upfront and ongoing maintenance costs, all before launching an actual product.Instead, by utilizing APIs and a few lines of code, customers can embed fintech products and get them up-and-running quickly.“Customers aren’t looking for UI/UX, but really for DI/DX, that developer interface with a powerful dashboard that is self-service,” he said. “We understood what they were looking for — that demand for modern infrastructure. They work with banks, but those often don’t have tools for launching the fintech experience or the building blocks to make it easy to put together.”It was also during that time that they decided to rebrand as they solidified their business-to-business focus. The new Solid name also resonated more with customers, Thyagarajan added.Over the past year, Solid grew 10x in revenue, doubled its customers to 100 and became profitable. Year to date, the company processed $2 billion in transactions.After being in sort of a stealth mode during the past 18 months, Thyagarajan said the company was now on a journey to get to 100 customers. To do that, he and co-founder Raghav Lal thought it was time to go after new funding. They started the process in May and closed the Series B at the end of July.“We saw early signs of product market fit, so our thought process was to do the Series B when we were ready for hypergrowth, and now we have cash in the bank,” Thyagarajan said. “We are going after the mid-market, so we had to go back and fine-tune our product as we figured out what businesses need. The key was to build our technology from the ground up to own the complete experience so we could give customers what they want.”FTV Capital led the new investment and was joined by existing investor Headline. To date, Solid has raised $80.7 million. Thyagarajan didn’t disclose a specific valuation with the new round, but did reveal it was 5x over Solid’s Series A valuation.The capital infusion will help accelerate Solid’s entrance into some new verticals like travel, logistics, construction, healthcare, education and the gig economy. The company is looking at where money is moving and identified 40 to 50 different verticals where there is an impedance in how money moves, but they want to benefit their customers.The company is also focusing on mid-market and larger companies, which is another reason why Thyagarajan said the investment was important.“We are talking to Fortune 1000 companies and they feel more comfortable working with companies with a strong balance sheet,” he added. “A lot of work has been under the radar, so we are getting the brand out and showcasing we are the ‘AWS of fintech,’ a one-stop shop. Our goal is to be alongside them as a partner, not just a vendor.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites726,https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5vwzq/the-pacific-ocean-is-shrinking-amasia-supercontinent,The Pacific Ocean Is Shrinking and Will Form a New SupercontinentScientists Say,"The Pacific Ocean is shrinking. Every year, it gets about an inch smaller as the tectonic plates that the Americas sit on are pushed westward. Now, thanks to calculations by a supercomputer, scientists say that a new “supercontinent” will eventually emerge due to this process: Amasia.The current world map, with its recognizable pattern of continents and oceans, is just one snapshot of our planet in time. Earth has tried on all kinds of continental configurations over its 4.5-billion-year lifespan, including periods where almost all of Earth’s land consolidates into one giant supercontinent.AdvertisementWe currently live in the broken remains of the supercontinent Pangaea, which formed 335 million years ago and disintegrated during the rise of the dinosaurs. The existence of even older supercontinents, such as Rodinia and Columbia (Nuna), suggest that Earth is locked into a “supercontinent cycle” that sees the formation and destruction of these immense landmasses on a rough timeline of 600 million years. The cycle raises the question of what kind of new supercontinent might emerge millions of years from now, prompting scientists to propose future landmasses with names like Novopangaea, Aurica, and Amasia.To shed light on this mystery, researchers led by Chuan Huang, a geophysicist at Curtin University in Australia, simulated the future of Earth with a supercomputer. The results suggest that a new supercontinent, Amasia, will form when the Pacific Ocean shrinks into nothingness some 200 million years from now, causing North America to slam into Asia, according to a recent study published in National Science Review.The future emergence of Amasia, a portmanteau of America and Asia, has been discussed by scientists for more than a decade, but there is debate over whether this supercontinent would form “inside in,” a process known as introversion, or “outside in,” which is called extroversion. Introversion involves the closure of younger post-Pangaea oceans, such as the Indian or Atlantic, whereas extroversion indicates the closure of the Pacific Ocean, which is the oldest ocean on Earth and is shrinking at a rate of about one inch per year.Advertisement“Earth's known supercontinents are believed to have formed in vastly different ways, with two endmembers being introversion and extroversion,” said Huang and his colleagues in the study. “The former involves the closure of the internal oceans formed during the break-up of the previous supercontinent, whereas the latter involves the closure of the previous external superocean.”“With our modelling results, we speculate if the next supercontinent will likely assemble through the closure of the Pacific Ocean,” which would be extroversion, “or the Indo-Atlantic oceans,” which would be introversion, the team added.As Huang and his colleagues ran their supercomputer simulations, they noticed the strength of the lithosphere, the stiff top layer of Earth that encompasses the crust and surface, is an overlooked variable in the emergence of the next supercontinent. The oceanic lithosphere has been weakening over time as a result of Earth’s slow cooling, a shift that clearly predicts the rise of Amasia from extroversion, or the closure of the Pacific Ocean.Sign up for Motherboard’s daily newsletter for a regular dose of our original reporting, plus behind-the-scenes content about our biggest stories.“Our results show that the yield strength of the oceanic lithosphere plays a critical role in determining the assembly path of a supercontinent,” the researchers said. “We found that high oceanic lithospheric strength leads to introversion assembly, whereas lower strength leads to extroversion assembly.”“This predicts that the next supercontinent Amasia could only be assembled through the closure of the Pacific Ocean,” the team concluded.In this way, the new study offers a glimpse of our planet some 200 to 300 million years from now, when an enormous landmass could unite over the ashes of the long-lived Pacific Ocean. It’s a reminder that humanity has existed for a mere split-second in geological time, and that our planet in the deep past and far future may as well be an alien world.""Earth as we know it will be drastically different when Amasia forms,” said Zheng-Xiang Li, a professor at Curtin’s Earth Dynamics Research Group who co-authored the study, in a statement. “The sea level is expected to be lower, and the vast interior of the supercontinent will be very arid with high daily temperature ranges.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photo: Ocean BuildersWith minimalist decor, curved walls and an ultra-sleek design, the SeaPod flagship model looks like something from The Jetsons. It is spread over 77 square metres of space that's split across three levels.There's a master bedroom with epic views, a living room and kitchen, a bathroom and an outdoor patio. Wraparound panoramic windows give residents 360-degree unobstructed ocean views.Wooden teak flooring, colour-changing lights and wireless charging stations are available in each SeaPod, which also comes with automated black-out blinds and sliding panel windows.Entirely customisable, there's the option to add climbing walls, greenhouses, skylights, hot tubs and patio gardens.Cutting-edge technology is at the heart of Panama's newest waterfront destination, with each pod using software to control lighting, internal air temperature, water pressure and more.Guests wear a smart ring that can be used to control technology settings, as well as being used to unlock doors, open windows and turn on music and mood lighting. Wireless charging stations are built into several of the pod's surfaces so that chargers and wires for phones become a thing of the past.Daily drone delivery and new marine habitatsDaily essentials such as groceries and medicine are flown in by drones that have been designed to easily withstand open ocean conditions. Self-driving boats remove rubbish, compost and recycling and, when they're not on duty, work to clean up the surrounding ocean waters by expelling trash to help mitigate human impact on the ocean even beyond the community.The SeaPods are designed so that each one can function as a new habitat for marine life.

Marine detection technology is available to alert pod residents when dolphins, whales or their other favourite sea creatures are nearby.Ocean Builders officially launched three models on Monday. They include the original SeaPod, the GreenPod for land living and the EcoPod, a more affordable option of each version.The single-level SeaPod Eco is slightly smaller than the flagship version and laid out on a single floor, but includes the same principles, technology options and customisable design features.12 futuristic cities being built around the world, from Saudi Arabia to China — in pictures",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch728,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/12/2422480/,Carbon accounting platform acquired by Sage as climate tech heats up,"Spherics, a U.K.-based carbon accounting platform for SMEs to understand and reduce their environmental impact, has been acquired by accounting giant Sage. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but it’s understood Spherics had raised £1.25 million in equity financing from angel investors and £300,000 in grants.Spherics was a smaller startup playing in a similar space to larger ones, which include Normative, Plan A, Klimametrix.global, Persefoni and Planetly.com (other carbon accounting players, like Watershed and Climatiq, operate more like consultants).Sage previously stated it plans to support SMEs to get to net zero, and this acquisition appears to be part of their strategy.Spherics automates the process of calculating emissions by ingesting data from a company’s accounting software and matching transactions to gauge an estimate of their carbon footprint. It can also apply carbon emission factors to procurement categories (such as delivery, accommodation, electricity and travel).“We know that SMBs care about the impact they have on the environment, and our research shows that they want to work with suppliers and partners that can help them understand and address it,” said Amaya Souarez, EVP Cloud Operations, Sage, in a statement. “By combining Spherics’ innovative software with Sage’s digital network, we are connecting businesses with their customer and supplier emissions data, enabling easy and collaborative climate action across value chains which helps to reduce carbon.”George Sandilands, CEO and co-founder of Spherics, added: “Our vision and mission align very much with Sage’s core values, and we are excited to embark on this new journey to help SMBs knock down barriers to a more sustainable future. Global emissions are still rising fast, and we need immediate and meaningful climate action across the world.”Headquartered in Bristol, United Kingdom, Spherics is the second Bristol startup to be acquired by Sage in the last year, after Brightpearl was picked up in 2021.Bristol seems to be making a habit of climate tech, also producing Ecologi Zero, real-time carbon footprinting software for businesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch729,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/02/identity-verification-company-youverify-extends-seed-funding-to-2-5m-as-it-expands-across-africa/,Identity verification company Youverify extends seed funding to M as it expands across Africa,"This past month has seen several African fintechs such as Flutterwave and Union54 make headlines for compliance checks issues and fraud allegations. Both unlinked events re-emphasize the importance of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks and why regulators enforce strict policies that financial institutions need to be held accountable to while operating across the continent and globally.For the many startups whose services help keep the operations of financial institutions such as banks and fintechs in check, this period highlights their relevance more than ever. In the latest development, Youverify, a Lagos and San Francisco–based identity verification company helping African banks and startups automate KYC and other compliance procedures, is announcing that it has secured a $1 million seed round extension. The startup raised a $1.5 million round in 2020, bringing its total seed raise to $2.5 million.Africa-focused VCs Orange Ventures and LoftyInc Capital, the two investors who co-led its initial seed round, also led the extension. Additional investment came from Octerra Capital, Plug & Play Venture, Syntax Ventures, HTTP Investors, Afer Group and Fronesyz Capital.The proliferation of financial services in Africa is beginning to attract more scrutiny from regulators. According to reports, transactions worth $116 billion will be made through digital payment channels this year, requiring stringent measures to prevent identity theft and fraud. Therefore, the rise in focus on maintaining transparency in financial regulations and improving strategies for KYC and AML by implementing regulatory technologies has become a significant growth factor for the market. And as regtech demand globally increases, so will Africa’s, with reports saying it will reach about $1.2 billion in the next five years.Youverify came into Africa’s regtech scene when founder and CEO Gbenga Odegbami founded the company in 2018. Launched in the Nigerian market, Youverify first provided API for address and identity verification to several financial institutions. Now it has added more KYC products and expanded into new markets such as Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda.“The way our customers see us is that we help them automate their KYC and compliance issues,” said Odegbami on a call with TechCrunch.In addition to verifying identities beyond Nigeria’s bank verification number (BVN) and addresses, Odegbami says Youverify layers KYC and compliance products such as transaction monitoring. He further explained that these offerings cater to issues some fintech platforms have faced recently: alleged AML issues in the case of Flutterwave in Kenya and Ping Express in the U.S. and fraud in the case of Union54’s chargebacks. In the latter, Youverify claims it could’ve prevented large-scale chargeback fraud by identifying the pattern of transactions to flag fraud, blocking the virtual cards and tying them back to fraudsters committing the multiple fake chargebacks.“They [Union54] grew faster than they could put in place the proper transaction monitoring and fraud detection systems that will identify transactions happening from their customers,” the CEO said of the chargeback situation Union54 has dealt with over the past couple of months. “A system like ours will be able to identify previous and new patterns in such a way that we would’ve been able to help such the company.”It wasn’t until last year that Youverify started dealing with fintechs. Initially, most of its customers were governmental bodies, big corporations like Bolt and banks. Nearly two-thirds of Nigeria’s commercial banks, such as Standard Chartered, Standard Bank and Fidelity Bank, use the platform’s identity verification and KYC products, Youverify said.However, in a bid to serve more clients, the company launched its proprietary technology, the Youverify OS (YVOS), which provides a single platform for automating due diligence and combines risk and compliance management with its core identity verification platform to deliver these fintechs an enterprise-grade compliance solution. With its other product, vFORM, a low and no-code tool, businesses can create a custom process for onboarding new customers using a drag-and-drop builder.As a result of diversifying its clientele and demand for its KYC products, Odegbami said Youverify’s customer base increased by 300% to serve more than 400 banks and high-growth startups. In the last 24 months, Youverify’s application processes have grown by more than 1,000% to more than 5 million applications that have helped its clients hire talent, sell financial products, and remotely onboard ride-hailing drivers. The company’s YouID digital identity platform added more than 500,000 users, with 600 service providers on its marketplace waitlist across the continent. Odegbami said the Lagos-based identity verification company crossed an ARR of over $1 million last year.Youverify isn’t the only identity verification company in Africa. Similar providers include Smile Identity and YC-backed companies IdentityPass and Dojah. Without mincing words, Odegbami said his company is a “market leader” because it came into the market much earlier and possesses more experience, and provides more data sets than the others.Over the next 18 months, Youverify plans to grow its footprint to cover 30 countries, especially in the southern, eastern and francophone parts of Africa, where Odegbami says the company will be recruiting aggressively. It also intends to increase the number of IDs it can verify, from 400 million to 2 billion, and develop new automated compliance products for the gaming, travel, healthcare and telecommunications industries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

How did you break into it?When did you first become interested in venture capital? How did you break into it?While growing up, I had no idea what venture capital was. The concept made sense; who wouldn’t want to be invested in ‘Google’ in the early days, but the idea of an industry that did precisely that was foreign to me until about 16 years old. At the time, there was a fund in St. Louis, iSelect Fund, that was growing rapidly and needed some help doing Excel/database work. I’d have to say that performing that grunt work was the best thing that has happened to me in my professional life. In a few weeks, I was engulfed in the venture and startup worlds. Reading about activity in the ecosystem became my dopamine hit, and I was hooked. I felt like the luckiest teenager in the world, having gotten the opportunity to watch some of the best and brightest people I had ever seen try and solve the problems we are afflicted with, the problems we see on the news every day. The notion of work that I felt in my previous job at a national tutoring chain fell away and was replaced with a sense of purpose.While growing up, I had no idea what venture capital was.

At the time, our path forward wasn’t always clear. For example, I was mistaken for an intern in multiple meetings and generally not taken too seriously at networking or industry events. It wasn’t unusual for founders to take calls mid-pitch or check their messages when it was my turn to ask questions. I learned quickly that the best way to go about working was to build a rapport with someone via email or phone before a face-to-face meeting. Referrals and testimonials went a long way in establishing credibility with people outside my growing network, but that network is what kept me going. I was inspired by the people in my life.

For example, we completed a cutting-edge research and development facility with one of our portfolio companies that is seeking to transform how we produce and think about food. That deal is quite different from what most VC funds will take on, but we believed it to be critical to the advancement of a better food system, and we pursued it. Unlike some other funds, we do not consider ourselves an Impact or ESG fund.

techcrunch733,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/07/convective-capitals-35-million-answer-to-the-increasing-threat-of-wildfires/,Convective Capital s million answer to the increasing threat of wildfires,"Wildfires have become an ever-increasing threat as houses are built closer together and the growing impacts of climate change wreak havoc on natural landscapes. Entrepreneurs, in response, have started to develop tech meant to minimize the scale and damage of these natural disasters. Convective Capital is a new VC firm looking to back them.Bill Clerico, the former co-founder and CEO of fintech WePay, launched the firm this year and has since raised $35 million for a first fund to back early-stage startups creating tech that can help detect and contain wildfires. The fund plans to invest in roughly 15 companies by writing seven-figure checks.While some of these startups could fall under the umbrella of climate tech, Clerico said focusing on wildfire solutions fits more into the climate resilience category. He thinks the distinction makes it a more straightforward investment opportunity because increasing wildfires are already a problem today as opposed to climate tech meant to prevent or minimize future problems.The thesis turned out to be a polarizing one to pitch as some investors understood the need immediately while others thought focusing on wildfire could prove to be too niche.“It made fundraising easier in that there were people who had witnessed the economic opportunity first hand, and understood the impacts of fire there,” Clerico said. “Or they had experienced it personally in various ways…or folks didn’t.”Clerico left WePay after a decade to pursue angel investing and become a volunteer fire fighter. While spending time at his home in Mendocino, California, he saw the impacts of the growing wildfire crisis as one of the natural disasters closed down the road to his house and he found himself struggling to get home insurance.“Just watching wildfires become the really big crisis that it is, and having a real vested interest in the outdoors, led me down this path,” Clerico said. “I started thinking about how technology could be a solution.”Clerico had made about 50 angel investments and admitted he was bored at the thought of hearing another fintech pitch. He started backing fire tech companies and began to specialize in the category. He decided to raise a fund so he could invest in the sector at scale.He estimated that there are currently 200 startups focused on this area, claiming that Convective Capital has probably talked to all of them. These startups are tackling different areas of the wildfire crisis ranging from Pano, a startup that uses camera systems and AI to help emergency response teams detect fires earlier, to Rain Industries, a company that creates autonomous drones to help put out fires.“What was missing though is that community coming together and acknowledging that fire tech is thing,” Clerico said. “It doesn’t exist as a category like fintech exists. Part of what we want to do as a firm is bring awareness to that category and really just help these founders get to know each other.”Maxwell Brodie, the co-founder and CEO of Rain Industries, told TechCrunch that while most likely everyone in California has been impacted by wildfires, it’s nice to see that someone like Clerico is actually trying to do something about it. He hopes that his involvement can help draw more builders and investors into the category.“All larger pools of resources [and capital] seek out where new emerging growth is going to come from,” Brodie said. “What [Clerico] is doing with Convective Capital is proving that there is a new emerging area of growth and everyone should be paying attention to that, especially late-stage investors.”While Clerico doesn’t believe that any sectors can really be recession proof, he thinks firetech is an area that isn’t really tied to broader market conditions. And while many of the companies he backs aren’t preventing the wildfires from starting, he hopes they can help mitigate some of the damage.“To leverage the power of startups to have a positive impact is a really inspiring challenge,” he said. “And one of the reasons why myself and my partners have gone after this.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch734,https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/02/an-action-plan-for-founders-fundraising-in-fintechs-choppy-waters/,An action plan for founders fundraising in fintech s choppy waters,"This past year has seen a wholesale shift in how the market feels about fintech. A year ago, nearly every investor had a fintech thesis, companies were racing to go public and investors at nearly every stage of the market were fighting to jam money into the hands of founders.That’s not true any longer. The collapse in valuations on the public market has been extreme. A significant number of the biggest fintech companies to go public in the last couple of years are now worth less than the money they’d raised. And that drop in confidence has now permeated to all stages of the market.Understandably, many early founders are unprepared to contemplate that the valuation of their idea — which will likely take about a decade to come to fruition — is now worth 75% less than it would have been six months ago.But the long-term outlook of the sector remains unchanged for most investors and founders.

But, as the contest resumes in earnest in the wake of the pandemic, the old order has changed. Airbus now has a wide lead in the single-aisle market — the hottest area of aviation — leaving Boeing to grapple with how to bridge the gap.The European company has grabbed new orders and market share with its popular A320 family of narrow-body jets, which predominantly serve shorter-haul destinations, to which travel has rebounded faster, compared with long-haul flights.Latest figures to the end of June show that Airbus had close to 17,000 orders of its A320 and A220 aircraft, and has so far delivered just over 10,600. The A320 is now the bestselling aircraft ever, overtaking US-based Boeing’s 737 jet.Recent fleet data from aviation consultancy Cirium showed Airbus’s A320 family with a “firm order backlog” market share of 59 per cent compared with Boeing’s 737 family of jets.The bestseller within the A320 family is its largest model, the A321neo, which is also offered with extra fuel tanks in long-range and extra-long range variants. Some airlines — such as America’s JetBlue — now use these for long-haul flights that were traditionally flown by more expensive wide-body jets.Airbus’s market share is only likely to grow as the group moves ahead with aggressive plans to lift output of the jets to 75 a month by 2025, despite industry-wide concerns about constraints in the supply chain. Production had reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before dropping to 40 a month when Covid hit.Some analysts have questioned when Boeing will be able to regain some of that lost market share, as the company has continued to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 Max 8 after two fatal crashes within five months.Production problems have prevented customer deliveries of Boeing’s wide-body 787 aircraft © Richard Ellis/AlamyGlobal regulators have since cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing implemented software and design changes and the plane is notching up new orders.Another challenge looming, however, is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. Boeing is racing to complete those processes before the end of the year to avoid having to develop a new flight deck under rules introduced by US Congress following the Max crashes.I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but he’s not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in SeattleBoeing has also suffered production issues that have prevented customer deliveries of its wide-body 787 aircraft. In addition, development of its 777X aircraft has been delayed, while problems on a number of big defence contracts have only added to the challenges.Union representatives, meanwhile, have criticised the company’s decision to move its global headquarters from Chicago to Washington, DC — seen as taking it further away from its spiritual home, the commercial aircraft factories of Seattle, and adding to persistent questions over the quality of its engineering.Repeated delays on the commercial side have frustrated some of Boeing’s largest customers, including Ryanair. The low-cost carrier’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said sweeping changes are needed to Boeing’s senior management led by chief executive Dave Calhoun.In a recent interview, O’Leary told the Financial Times that the US aviation group has “lost huge market share and existing customers are being lost to Airbus, which is why I don’t understand why they sit there and do nothing”.“I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but he’s not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle,” he said.But others, including Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr, have continued to back the US company. Boeing has insisted that things have changed since the Max accidents. It is also ramping up the hiring of engineers as it works with the US aviation regulator to certify its upcoming 777X aircraft.Boeing’s chief executive Dave Calhoun has sought to resist discussion on market share © Christopher Goodney/BloombergHowever, in a further blow, Boeing last month lost out to Airbus on a $37bn order from China’s three big state airlines. They chose 290 A320neo jets — the biggest order by Chinese airlines since the start of the pandemic. The country is a crucial market for both Airbus and Boeing and the orders come at a time of rising political tensions between the US and China.Calhoun has previously cited uncertainty over orders from China as one of the three main risks facing the company, along with securely boosting production of the Max and resolving issues around the 787. China was the first country to ground the Max and, although its aviation regulator last year approved its return to service, Chinese carriers have not started flying the plane commercially again.The multibillion-dollar question facing Boeing, therefore, is how to recover its lead against Airbus, at the same time as China’s first self-developed aircraft — Comac’s narrow-body C919 — is finally nearing completion.Boeing abandoned a plan for a new midsize aeroplane — a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 Max and the larger 787 — and it remains unclear what its next step will be. Its balance sheet also remains constrained, with some $45bn of net debt.$45bn Net debt on Boeing balance sheetThe company needs to “launch an answer to the A321neo,” says Kevin Michaels, managing director of Michigan-based AeroDynamic Advisory. “Can they afford it? I think they can. Their balance sheet isn’t great but you’ve got to invest in your core business to stay around in the long run.”“The other problem they face is knowing what to do — if you do press the button, how do you do that plane? The world is about to change massively but no one yet knows what that technology will be and you could end up spending $20bn on something that will be immediately obsolete,” says Nick Cunningham, analyst at research firm Agency Partners in London, who believes the company needs to raise equity to fund a new programme.But Calhoun has recently played down any concerns about the company’s market share position vis-à-vis Airbus. “At this moment in time, it’s less important,” he told an investor conference in June. Boeing, he added, had to concentrate on getting planes back in the air.“We have to stay focused on doing that incredibly well. One aeroplane at a time. If I jump to a market share discussion immediately and say, ‘Let’s get above 50 and let’s do it next year’, what happens? The whole system gets crammed down in every way.”He also indicated at the same conference that the company might not launch anything new for at least another couple of years. He does not believe that the performance improvement to justify an all new aircraft currently exists.Boeing, he said, was sure it had the ability to compete. “I’m confident, my sales team is confident,” said Calhoun. “Our customers express confidence to me, so why would I rush? No good reason.”Additional reporting by Philip Georgiadis",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch736,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/10/fears-of-climate-tech-underinvestment-are-probably-overblown/,Fears of climate tech underinvestment are probably overblown,"There’s been a lot of hand-wringing over whether the world will get its act together enough to prevent catastrophic warming. There’s certainly a case to be made there — we’ve spent the last several decades kicking the can down the road at every opportunity.Well, here we are again, with the can again before us and the end of the road fast approaching.Lucky for me, I tend to be an optimist. I still think we’re in for a world of pain, and we’ll probably have to rely on some exotic technologies like fusion power and direct air capture to pull ourselves back from the brink. But in my opinion, when the chips are down, humanity tends to pull through.If we use computing and software as a guide, we should expect to see a nearly fivefold increase in the capital committed in the next 30 years.That is why I think many of the gloom-and-doom scenarios regarding climate tech investments tend to be overly bearish. Take the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) forecasts, which for years habitually underestimated the growth of solar power. The agency has since added better models to its toolkit, but it and others still make predictions that go on to be proven overly pessimistic.In reality, renewable energy and other climate tech is likely to follow an adoption curve that’s similar to other industries. It might even follow an accelerated version given how broad and deep the impacts and benefits of climate tech are likely to be — and the very real prospect of Armageddon if we do nothing.To see how climate tech stands to outperform today’s forecasts, you only have to look as far back as 1970, when the computing revolution was beginning.Exponential trendsThe overarching trend of investment in the computing and telecommunications space over 50 years has been exponential. But that simplistic analysis papers over the significant growth that happened in the early years. It also fails to pick up on key technological advances that sparked wider adoption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch737,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/bitmain-matrixport-john-ge/,Bitmain co founder welcomes crypto regulation to restore market confidence,"The collapse of Three Arrow Capital and the counterparties wrapped in the crypto hedge fund’s troubles have drawn questions about the soundness of the heady digital asset investment space. For the industry’s survivors, watching their rivals fall to pieces overnight has been an alarming experience.To understand where the industry might be going after the market turmoil, we spoke with John Ge, chief executive officer at Matrixport, a Singapore-based digital asset manager with over $10 billion in assets under management and custody.Ge was formerly the head of investment and financing as well as a founding partner at Bitmain, the world’s biggest maker of Bitcoin mining machines. Together with Bitmain’s co-founder and former CEO Jihan Wu, Ge co-founded Matrixport in 2018.Three Arrow Capital, known as 3AC in the crypto community, was one of the world’s largest crypto hedge funds before its fall from grace. Its success was predicated on a risky strategy: it borrowed aggressively from crypto lenders and in turn invested that money in other crypto projects.When cryptocurrency prices began to plummet earlier this year, the firm, as well as other similar outfits that bet on rising crypto prices, failed to repay their creditors and plunged into liquidation. The crypto market is down by $1.8 trillion since its peak in November, led by the slide in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.The recent market crash is “inevitable”, Ge says in an interview with TechCrunch. “The core issue is that we saw players whose business model is like a black box. They borrow money from investors without giving transparency over how the money will be used.”The other problem is that these crypto managers are acting both as the player and referee, Ge contends. “Many of them are providing both asset management and proprietary trading. An asset manager should not be doing proprietary trading, and if it does, it needs to follow stringent leverage requirements.”“Even the most conservative investment strategy has risks and may result in losses, but the principle is to be transparent with your customers, not fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading,” the founder says.Matrixport, which serves individuals as well as over 500 institutions across Asia, Europe and North America, was exposed to 3AC and has lodged a claim alongside other creditors. But Ge assures that the firm’s exposure is “relatively small” when compared to the exposure other industry players faced and is considered “minor” when compared relative to Matrixport’s equity.As to how to restore investor confidence in the crypto sphere, Ge believes regulators are on the right track to bring more oversight over consumer-facing crypto products and protection for retail investors, as is the case in Singapore.But it’s “unrealistic” to have regulators design risk control models for institution-focused asset managers. “The pace of regulations tends to fall behind that of industry development.”Ge thinks investors have “lost a certain level of confidence” in the crypto market and the industry will take time to recover. On the other hand, he thinks competition has waned for survivors like Matrixport because “many of the other players are gone.”Matrixport told Bloomberg last year that it planned to go public in three to five years and Ge said that plan “hasn’t changed.” It’s too early to say which market the company is floating its shares but the U.S. is a “likely” option given investors there are more “welcoming of crypto innovation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch738,https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/ironclad-raises-50m-series-c-round-for-its-digital-contracting-platform/,Ironclad raisesM Series C round for its digital contracting platform,"Ironclad, a startup that makes it easier for legal teams to manage their contracts workflow, today announced that it has raised a $50 million Series C round led by Y Combinator Continuity, with participation from Emergence Capital, as well as existing investors including Accel and Sequoia Capital. This round brings Ironclad’s total funding to $83 million, according to Crunchbase.In addition to the new funding, Ironclad, which was part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2015 class, also today announced the launch of its Workflow Designer. This tool allows teams to easily create their own custom workflows based on their individual business processes and timelines. Setting up those workflows looks be a pretty straightforward process. After tagging the existing contract, teams can then set up their processes based on what’s in a specific document. If a contract is over a specific value, for example, they can add a payment clause, or set up an approval process based on that value.Workflow Designer complements the service’s existing tools for managing the contract life cycle and collaborating on legal documents.The company says it will use the new funding to expand into new geographies and expand its product.“This round and our continued momentum highlights how big the opportunity is to streamline contracting for every type of company in the world,” said Jason Boehmig, co-founder and CEO of Ironclad. “Our newest investors bring a depth of later-stage company experience and a vision for what cloud companies will look like in the future. Our new funding will fuel continued product innovations, like our new Workflow Designer, which is accelerating contracting time by 85% for our customers.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While they can buy offsetting credits, the market remains pretty ‘wild-west”, and has multiple competing standards running in parallel. For instance, the price range of $5 to $500 per ton is clearly all over the place, and sometimes carbon offset resellers make buyers pay high prices for low-quality carbon credits, pulling in extra revenues from a very opaque market.The startup’s offering is for corporates to integrate both carbon removal and avoidance credits in one package. It does this by mining the offsetting market for lots of data points, enabling carbon offset sellers to reach buyers without having to use these middle-men resellers.The startup claims that sellers no longer waste time and money on bespoke contracts with corporates but instead use Ceezer’s legal framework for all transactions. Simultaneously, buyers can access credits at a primary market level, maximizing the effect of the dollars they spend on carbon offsets.Ceezer says it now has more than 50 corporate customers and has 200,000 tons of carbon credits to sell across a variety of categories, and will use the funds to expand its impact and sourcing team, the idea being to make carbon removal technologies more accessible to corporate buyers, plus widen the product offering for credit sellers and buyers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch741,https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/29/badass-millennial-women-are-supercharging-startup-investments/,Badass millennial women are supercharging startup investments,"Across the political, social and economic stage, women’s issues are finally receiving heightened attention and priority.There are more women than ever seeking political office; funding for female-founded startups is reaching record levels (even if they still have a long way to go to reach gender parity); a sizable cohort of female-founded and led companies have achieved billion-dollar unicorn valuations; and several women-led companies, including PagerDuty, The RealReal, and Eventbrite, have entered the public markets with successful IPOs.What’s driving so much positive change?Clearly, broadened awareness of gender and power issues, largely due to #MeToo, as well as an increase in the number of female investors, thanks to groups like All Raise, are all contributing catalysts. In addition, women now outnumber men in college, a majority of American moms are in the workforce, and in 40 percent of households those women are the breadwinners. But it’s more than that; I believe that there’s a profound generational shift afloat, and that this first wave of female-led unicorns is just the tip of the NASDAQ iceberg.Unlike previous generations who may have either looked at self-investment as self-indulgence or who simply didn’t have the resources or technology available to make supplementary investments in themselves, today’s badass millennial women are unapologetic about their desire to invest in their own success and well-being. Determined to succeed without compromising their values or physical and mental wellness, these uber-empowered millennial women are making viable a new generation of startups to help them realize their dreams and feel comfortable in their skin. I refer to this economic wave as She-conomy 2.0.For decades now there have been tech companies, which I refer to as She-conomy 1.0 , catering to traditional and homogeneous identities of women primarily as shoppers and caregivers. In contrast, these new modern She-conomy 2.0 brands address latent, historically unmet, often un-discussed and under-served needs that speak to the multitude of other facets of our identities.These companies have less to do with what women buy and more to do with their willingness to invest in themselves — in their careers and in their physical and emotional health and well-being. They are seeking and are willing to pay for products and services that help them advance their careers, feel comfortable about their bodies, and provide the physical and emotional support they’re seeking.Women are taking control of their careers and supporting each other.More than two decades ago, when I had my first child, I joined a mom’s group at Stanford Hospital. We were all working moms trying to juggle career and motherhood. It was a truly challenging time for each of us. The group provided such helpful support that we met every Monday evening for five years until our kids were in kindergarten. Why Mondays? Because Mondays are especially hard for working parents, marking yet another week in search of balance. We realized that meeting on Monday evenings provided us with the support we needed to make it through the work week. Perhaps even more critically, it gave us something about Mondays to look forward to.There’s something incredibly empowering about experiencing a major transition like a new job or new parenthood as part of a cohort. Sheryl Sandberg famously sought to institutionalize this kind of support for working women with her non-profit Lean In. It has dramatically raised awareness around working women’s struggles. However, individual Lean In group leaders are usually volunteers running these sessions on the side while working and shouldering life’s endless list of other responsibilities.Now a new generation of organizations is offering this support — for a fee. As for-profit organizations, they’re doing so in a scalable, consistent and reliable way. Women don’t have to worry about whether the organizer will be able to carve out time to orchestrate a meeting because doing so is the organizer’s job. Chief, Declare, The Assembly * , The Wing and The Riveter are all examples of companies that are growing and thriving because they’re offering valuable space, support and services that women are willing to pay for. Most of these organizations initially targeted millennials, but women of all generations are benefiting and participating.Women are changing the narrative around previously taboo topics and promoting inclusiveness and acceptance of oneself.It wasn’t long ago that mannequins, much like cover models, only came in one size. Now mainstream brands not only sell broader offerings; they increasingly showcase them in magazines, catalogs, stores and the runway. For example, Nike’s flagship store in London featured both plus-sized mannequins and para-sport mannequins for people with physical and intellectual abilities, and Rhianna’s new inclusive lingerie line regularly presents both plus-size and pregnant models.Millennials (like all of us) don’t want to feel shamed; they want to feel empowered and beautiful. Instead of settling for frumpy, ill-fitting clothing or outdated product design, millennials are using their social media megaphones to tell the market what they want. Traditional companies like Victoria’s Secret have moved at a molasses-like pace to evolve from treating women as objects of fantasy to celebrating their right to feel great about themselves. Their antiquated practices have created the opportunity for new startups to create brands centered on body positivity. Some companies are filling largely underserved market needs by catering exclusively to larger and specialty sizes, and others are addressing previously taboo topics like body hair, which also contribute strongly to feelings around body positivity. Eloquii offers extended clothing sizes, Ruby Ribbon * and Third Love provide a wide sizing range of under garments and bras, and Fur addresses body hair and grooming.Women are dedicating more attention to their own health and relationships.Self-help books have been around for ages, but tech is paving the way for a new generation of services to provide guidance and support that are more convenient and targeted. At the same time, women are increasingly willing to discuss health issues that were previously taboo, like menstruation, menopause and perimenopause, fertility, and depression. Advancements in technology are making health-related self-care more accessible from the convenience of our wristbands and phones. Meanwhile, people are spending a disproportionate amount of their wealth on health, making the entire healthcare industry ripe for disruption.All of these factors are making femtech big business. Countless new companies are helping women take more active control of their sexual health, including birth control and STI testing (Pill Club and Nurx), period tracking (Flo Health), fertility and egg freezing (Kind Body and Carrot Fertility), menopause (Rory, Genneve), postpartum depression and miscarriage (Maven) and even our relationships (Relish* and Bumble). In addition, no shortage of femtech companies are addressing period care, such as Lola, Cora, The Flex Company, Thinx, and Sustain Natural.These companies are only viable because so many women — beginning with millennials but expanding out to the rest of us — are now willing and able to invest in themselves. United across a shared mission of female empowerment and inclusivity, She-onomy 2.0 is making it more realistic than ever to empower us to advance our careers, feel good about ourselves and stay healthy. Hats off to the badass millennial women leading this charge; we’re all better off professionally, emotionally and even physically thanks to you!*Denotes portfolio company for Trinity Ventures",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch742,https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/21/luminar-lidar-ecarx-geely-china-ev/,Luminar to invest in Geely affiliated Ecarxeyes China market,"Luminar, the Florida-based lidar company that went public via SPAC in 2020, has formed a close alliance with an auto behemoth in China. It’s making a strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in Ecarx, an auto tech startup co-founded by Eric Li, founder of China’s largest private automaker Geely, Ecarx said on Thursday.The funding will be part of the pair’s wider collaboration on automotive-grade technologies, which aims to “enable advanced safety and automated driving capabilities in the production of consumer vehicles and commercial trucks,” a plan that Luminar unveiled in May.Luminar’s sensing technology can potentially reach millions of vehicles through the Geely/Ecarx auto empire. Ecarx is building a comprehensive platform for the future of cars, focusing on the likes of auto chips and smart vehicles. Its customers include, unsurprisingly, Geely-owned brands like Lotus and Volvo.Shen Ziyu, Ecarx’s other co-founder and a former General Motors executive, told Reuters in March 2021 that the company had already supplied 2.5 million vehicles.The lidar industry in China is enjoying a boom as the country’s electric car makers — which themselves have benefited from government support for renewable energy — woo picky consumers with advanced driving technology, in-car entertainment and other novel auto features.Luminar’s tie-up with Ecarx will be critical in helping it confront domestic lidar players, from BYD-backed RoboSense and Bosch-backed Hesai to Temasek-funded Innovusion and Livox, which sprang out of DJI.“The collaboration will help Luminar to accelerate deployment of its industry-leading long-range lidar and software in the [Chinese] market and beyond through Ecar’s deep connection with Geely and the Geely ecosystem, comprising some of the world’s most reputable automotive brands,” Luminar said in May.The same month, the American lidar maker said it had brought on Jackie Chen, a Harman veteran, to head its China business.Ecarx’s empire is ever expanding. On Thursday, the company announced another funding boost along with the Luminar partnership. Siengine, an automotive system on chip maker it co-founded with Arm China, has completed a Series A funding round of nearly 1 billion yuan or $15 million. Sequoia Capital China led the round, with Bosch’s China venture capital arm Boyuan Capital and others participating.Earlier this month, Li and Shen bought Chinese smartphone maker Meizu, once a Xiaomi archrival, to work toward a future of “multi-device, scenario-agnostic, and immersive” digital experience, which will no doubt include system integration between vehicles and handsets.In May, Ecarx announced plans to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm in a $3.8 billion deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fund II will be used to help scale and commercialize software across renewable energy, mobility, cybersecurity, battery storage, critical infrastructure and climate resiliency.The fund, which is worth exactly double what Energize raised for its first fund, is backed by anchor investors such as Invenergy, CDPQ, SE Ventures, GE Renewable Energy and Hannon Armstrong. Credit Suisse, Xcel Energy, American Electric Power and Equinor Ventures also participated.“Since we first launched Energize five years ago, we have seen the energy and industrial sectors undergo a massive digital transformation,” said John Tough, managing partner of Energize Ventures, in a statement. “The transition towards a more renewable and sustainable future is outpacing all expectations, and market participants are digitizing operations to address this new, emerging scale.”To date, Energize has deployed capital from Fund II into three investments, including Munich-based predictive battery analytics software TWAICE, Columbus, Ohio-based IoT device company Finite State and New York-based critical infrastructure safety AI company Urbint, according to the firm. Fund II is targeting 15 or more early-stage digital-first startups that are raising Series A, B or C rounds in the energy and sustainable industry sectors. Typically, Energize Ventures invests around $10 million to $20 million and prefers to lead the round. The firm’s first round invested in 14 software-based companies, including the now-public EV charging solution Volta, cloud manufacturing startup Fast Radius and solar software company Aurora Solar.“Energize exclusively invests in digital solutions,” according to the company. “That means no hardware, no moonshots that require untold amounts of capex to get off the ground — just technologies at the software layer at commercialization. Part of that comes from the firm’s investment strategy; the team leans on its LPs (including well-known corporates such as GE and Schneider) to identify the challenges facing the sectors today, and then finds solutions that overcome those barriers to decarbonization.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch744,https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/08/this-startup-hopes-to-get-us-to-net-zero-via-its-platform-to-construct-wooden-buildings/,This startup hopes to get us to net zero via its platform to construct wooden buildings,"This startup hopes to get us to net zero via its platform to construct wooden buildingsOne of the stunning facts that’s emerged over the last few years — especially as VCs and startups have turned their attention toward the climate crisis — is that our cities produce an enormous amount of CO 2 : In fact, buildings are responsible for around 40% of global CO 2 emissions. But of course, the problem is that cities are unlikely to stop building, and growiing.Some estimates say that if global urban growth continues at its current pace, then we’d build a New York City every month for the next 40 years. So if we could reduce this amount or transition, this growth to “net zero” (or better), we’d would do to a lot alleviate the impending, and disastrous, affects of climate change. This is why we are seeing so many new climate funds appear, which are concentrating on the built environment.A large part of this problem is that concrete and steel are just not sustainable materials, unlike (say) timber.Now, “011h“, based out of Barcelona, thinks it might have the answer.Currently, the building processes that use manual labor and usustainalble materials don’t pass muster, so if you can standardize and digitize the building process to make it repeatable and scalable (says 011h) while shifting sustainable materials — like mass timber — you can allow architects, builders, developers and investors to make net-zero buildings faster, cheaper and more sustainable.It all sounds lovely in theory, but in fact 011h says it has already completed such a project with Renta Corporación, a publicly traded developer, where the “embodied carbon” of the building was reduced by more than 90% compared to conventional methods, while construction timelines were reduced by 35%. This has led to three more major projects being commissioned.No doubt partly as a result of this, 011h has now raised a significant €25 million in Series A funding. The funding round was led by Redalpine, accompanied by Seaya Andromeda and Breega, with the participation of Aldea Ventures, among others. Previous investors also joined the round, including Giuseppe Zocco, Foundamental and A/O Proptech, which accelerates 011h’s ambition to create a sustainably built world.The funding will be used to further develop 011h’s platform, building system and team, initially focusing on Spain, then internationally.Lucas Carné, co-founder and co-CEO of 011h, said the impact of reducing the carbon footprint of building can’t be iunderestimated: “If the embodied carbon of every building were reduced by more than 90%, this would reduce 10% of annual global CO 2 emissions, this is equivalent to three gigatonnes of CO 2 every year. In real terms, this is almost 2x more carbon than completely transitioning from petrol to electric vehicles; and is equivalent to eliminating 1 billion domestic gas boilers,” he told me.Harald Nieder, general partner of Redalpine, added in a statement: “At Redalpine, we believe that there are massive opportunities around sustainability. In fact, the opportunities are such that we are not looking for marginal improvements of the status quo. We are looking for teams that are aiming to have a real impact, worthy of the global challenges we are facing. Construction is both one of the most unsustainable industries and one of the least digital and the 011h vision is exactly what we were looking to support.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it’s still business as usual at fintech companies here. They have proven their resilience even in wartime conditions, and impressively, 90% of Ukrainian tech startups are still hiring.This March, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a bill to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the country. While the bill doesn’t let you use digital assets as a form of payment, it seeks to create proper conditions to establish a strong cryptocurrency market.Cryptocurrency exchanges can now claim a license to operate legally in the country. Banks will be able to open accounts for crypto companies, which can opt for different licenses depending on what they do.The Ukrainian IT sector is still growingIn the first five months of 2022, Ukraine’s IT sector generated roughly $3.2 billion from exports — 27% more than the same period in 2021, and accounting for almost half of the country’s total volume of export services.One of the main goals of the Ukrainian government is to increase the IT sector’s share of the country’s GDP from the current 4% to 10% by 2024.The government’s backing and the strong growth together make for a strong signal of how the IT sector is ripe for investments.Global finance and tech firms are supporting UkraineEarlier this month, the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation presented Digital4Freedom — a global initiative that is the primary source of charitable donations for tech companies to support Ukraine.Digital4Freedom is part of the global UNITED24 effort and allows anyone across the globe to make monetary contributions to the restoration of the country’s economy.The program consists of nine projects presented to 40 companies, of which the vast majority have agreed to help with monetary contributions or technology solutions.Amazon, for example, will reportedly provide over $100 million in cloud hosting services for Ukrainian state registers and is planning to develop solutions for deploying artificial intelligence in courts.Crypto exchange Binance will become an official partner of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine to offer educational projects in the IT, web3 and finance fields.Meta, with the support of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, recently launched a $1.5 million assistance program for the recovery of the Ukrainian economy, helping small- and medium-sized businesses with a specialized training centre.Startups are an integral part of the Ukrainian economyUkrainian businesses expect a reduction in the production of goods and services due to the war. What’s more, company executives predict the next 12 months will bring inflation and devaluation of the hryvnia.Ukrainian tech startups are dedicating their efforts to elevating the industry to new heights. They are set to become the foundational pillars for a new layer of technology companies that will add significant value to the economy.Fintech is growing fast despite setbacksThis year, Ukrainian lawmakers introduced the Law of Ukraine on Payment Services (LPS), which will provide a better regulatory environment for the fintech sector, including for payment services.Additionally, the Ukrainian Association of Fintech and Innovation Companies (UAFIC) became the first non-EU member to join the European Digital Finance Association (EDFA). Both organizations are collaborating to strengthen the fintech landscape in Ukraine.I believe Ukraine’s resilience in the face of Russian aggression, and the tremendous growth of the fintech landscape despite the crisis has proven that investors should not hesitate to invest in the fast-growing industry.Despite the difficult situation in the country, the industry continues to develop. While attending numerous conferences and fintech events, I meet investors from all over the world interested in companies from Ukraine. All this tells us that the prospects for fintech in Ukraine look good, and that now is an excellent time to invest in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

other news sites749,https://www.vice.com/en/article/akek7g/this-startup-is-selling-tech-to-make-call-center-workers-sound-like-white-americans,This Startup Is Selling Tech to Make Call Center Workers Sound Like White Americans,"On the Clock On the Clock is Motherboard's reporting on the organized labor movement, gig work, automation, and the future of work. See More →Continuing Silicon Valley’s long and storied history of misreading dystopian satires as instruction manuals, a startup has created a tech product that makes call center workers' voices sound white.The startup, called Sanas and founded by three former Stanford students, was first reported on by Joshua Bote for SFGate on Monday. On Sanas' website, you can “hear the magic”: a simulated conversation between a call center worker with an Indian accent that can be modified with a slider that applies Sanas’s accent translation. After Sanas is applied, the voice sounds more like a text-to-voice reader than another human being, but it does sound typically American and white.AdvertisementIn a demonstration for Motherboard, company President Massih Sarimand and COO Sharath Keysheva Narayana called an employee in India who talked about his background and work. Then the Sanasa filter was applied. It removed the employee’s accent and created a passable white and American-sounding voice, albeit a bit robotic.Sanas describes its approach as ""accent matching,"" and advertises on its website that it can ""improve understanding by 31% and customer satisfaction by 21%."" Apparently, the software can offer multiple accents at the touch of a button—although its demo only features an Indian accent being turned into typically white and American—and the company frames its technology as ""empowering"" workers. According to materials offered by the company to SFGate, the company claims to have garnered about $132 million worth of funding thus far.Ironically, given its focus on empowerment, Sanas' software to turn call center workers' voices into white American voices mirrors the plot of Boots Riley's 2018 dystopian satire Sorry to Bother You. In the film, the ability to put on a ""white"" voice on the phone allows the film's Black protagonist to rise up in the company, but introduces tension in the workplace that undercuts a union drive and eventually pits him against his former co-workers.In an interview with Motherboard, Sarim and Narayana sketched out their business strategy and explained why call centers were their first choice as clients.Advertisement""Call centers have a very specific speech pattern. You don't have people laughing, crying, singing—those nuances of speech are not there so it is easier to build it. The next use case is on enterprise communications. As we started going live with enterprise call centers, they said 'Hey we have teams in Asia, we have teams in Africa,'"" Naryana told Motherboard. ""We want to leverage a tool like this so that we can give them a choice and we want everybody to be heard. We want to build a very inclusive work culture and we think this could be an extremely great product and technology to actually bring people closer.""Call centers are heavily surveilled workplaces—dominated by “employee monitoring” which some are eager to argue is somehow beneficial for the workers. These workers suffer the brunt of a customer’s anger when something goes wrong but lack the autonomy to go beyond a script or narrow guidelines laid out by management. Viewed as disposable, closely surveilled, experiencing little if any autonomy, and forced to deal with angry or racist customers, call center workers typically burn out in a few months—when they don’t, their mental health suffers. The core question here, then, is what deploying Sanas will actually do to working conditions for call center workers.AdvertisementIt’s not hard to imagine scenarios where the introduction of Sanas results in companies demanding more of their workers because they now have “accent matching"" that is supposed to increase their performance with customers—a typical outcome when workplaces with minimal autonomy implement performance-boosting software. Narayana said increased performance would be a side-effect of Sanas' software, but it mainly has the potential to improve every aspect of this industry: call center labor conditions, the mental health of these workers, and the experience of customers on the phone.""I don't care about metrics, I think about mental health, employee satisfaction, retention, and overall employee happiness. All of those metrics are checked out for me,"" Narayana told Motherboard. ""I strongly believe once you keep your employees happy, all the business metrics will get better. So that's a secondary result of what we're trying to achieve. But the primary result for me is actually improving the lives of all these agents.""Sanas’s product doesn’t address the structural issues with call center work nor racism from callers, which its product implicitly side steps. Sanas acknowledges the potential for misuse of its software and says nobody will be ""forced"" to use it because workers themselves activate it with a button—however, this doesn't acknowledge the possibility of being forced to use it by default due to performance quotas. Sanas also says it has a ""code of ethics"" with three values: individual choice (it's activated by the worker), personal control (effectively the same point), and flexibility (Sanas offers multiple accents).The desire to communicate clearly and seamlessly with one another is understandable—as Sarim and Narayana reiterated to Motherboard multiple times, and as the website says, 80 percent of this company’s workers were immigrants. Sarim and Narayana have both worked call center jobs where they dealt with racism. The two insist this informs their end goal: not to simply have an accent translation engine that turns anything into white, American English (“many-to-one”) but one day to develop a translator for any accent to any accent (“many-to-many”).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stripe, Opendoor, Chime, Zillow, Cerebral, Brex, and of course Twitter, among others, have already cut or are about to eliminate thousands of jobs.That’s bad news for employees today, but it might be good news for the climate in the near future.Before we get too far, let me say up front that getting laid off is terrible and not something I wish to happen to anyone. Not knowing where your paychecks will come from or what benefits you’ll receive is difficult in the best of times, and it’s far worse when economic signs are mixed or major life changes are looming. I am not at all trying to minimize what people go through when they’ve been laid off. It’s happened to me, and it sucks.But layoffs also offer a chance at a new beginning. Even before the recent waves of layoffs started washing over the tech industry, people were leaving their old jobs for new opportunities in climate tech.While this is a TechCrunch+ story, we made sure the paywall is below the key links in case you are job-hunting. Hugs — The TC+ team“One thing we’re seeing is really, really strong talent leaving larger companies,” Erin Price-Wright, a partner at Index Ventures, said at TechCrunch Disrupt, “because some of the financial upside for public tech companies or maybe even late-stage tech companies has sort of vaporized in the last few months. And people are like, ‘Well, I had these golden handcuffs, and that was preventing me from working on what I really care about. And I don’t have that anymore. So I’m going to take a risk and I’m going to do something.’”Climate tech has been booming relative to the rest of the market, with startups in the sector raising $5.6 billion in the first half of this year, short of 2021’s crazy hauls but still well ahead of 2020, the next previous record, according to PitchBook. Five years from now, PitchBook expects the climate tech market to be worth $1.4 trillion, a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%.All those companies are in desperate need of talent. Nearly every early-stage founder in the climate tech space I’ve spoken with in recent months went out of their way to mention that they’re hiring. Climatebase has thousands of jobs listed right now, and that’s just a portion of the climate tech companies with active listings.Shaun Abrahamson, co-founder of climate-focused Third Sphere, pointed out that his firm’s portfolio companies are currently hiring for over 400 positions. Breakthrough Energy Ventures’ portfolio companies are hiring for nearly 1,200 positions.Elsewhere, around 100 companies are using the climate career platform Terra.do to directly connect with applicants, chief business officer Nishant Mani told TechCrunch.

Now, certain industries are emerging as potential areas where New Zealand can win in the tech space.Deep tech, medtech/biotech, climate tech, and crypto and blockchain are all areas that investors say they’re either actively investing in or watching for signs of scale.Note: All monetary amounts are listed in New Zealand dollars unless otherwise stipulated.Deep techNew Zealand has the right mix of deep tech-focused capital and resources, strong engineering schools and major success stories that are helping create technologically sophisticated, globally scalable startups.During the first half of this year, total investment in New Zealand’s early-stage sector increased 78% from the first half of 2020, 42% of which went directly to deep tech startups, according to PwC. Much of that funding came from New Zealand Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP), a government entity established to create a vibrant early-stage environment in New Zealand, via its Elevate fund of funds program that provides capital to New Zealand VCs investing in Series A and B rounds.Last October, Elevate allocated $20 million to a fund managed by deep tech VC firm Pacific Channel. More recently, Elevate committed $17 million to Nuance Connected Capital’s fund focused on deep tech innovations, as well as $45 million to GD1’s Fund 3, which focuses on deep tech as well as connected hardware, enterprise software and health tech.New Zealanders make really good founders. … There’s something about just growing up on a farm or, you know, playing beer float out in the lakes and rivers; New Zealand is just really resourceful. Blockchain NZ Chair Bryan VenturaThen there are groups, like Outset Ventures, formerly LevelTwo, that are geared toward helping seed and pre-seed deep tech startups get going. Outset is home to New Zealand’s only two deep tech unicorns, Rocket Lab and LanzaTech, both of which have spun out numerous other deep tech companies. Outset continues to be a resource for seed-stage startups that need not only money, but also connections to larger companies and access to workshops and labs. Just last year, Outset and Icehouse Ventures, a VC firm, partnered to raise a $12 million fund, which launched this April, for early-stage science and engineering startups. Imche Fourie, CEO of Outset, said the company has already made 17 investments from that fund.*Notable deep tech companies out of New Zealand include Foundry Lab, a startup that creates metal castings quickly and cheaply with a microwave; Soul Machines, a platform that creates lifelike digital avatars that animate autonomously, responding to interactions and interpreting facial expressions, with personalities that evolve over time; and Dennisson Technologies, a wearables company that’s developing soft exosuits that incorporate 4D material technology to actively assist people with limited mobility due to physical or neurological disability.The most Kiwi of deep tech startups, however, is Halter — a company that spun out of Rocket Lab and produces solar-powered smart cow collars that allow farmers to remotely shift and virtually fence and monitor cows in order to optimize pasture time. Founder Craig Piggott grew up on a dairy farm watching his parents struggle with the relentless work. After studying engineering at Auckland University of Technology and working at Rocket Lab, Piggott combined his experience to come up with a somewhat wacky and ambitious hardware and software play. Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, who backed Halter, told TechCrunch he thinks it will be a globally scalable billion-dollar company.The epitome of New Zealand’s deep tech scene is its over $1.75 billion space industry. Rocket Lab, which is now a U.S.-owned company after a SPAC merger, put New Zealand on the map as a place with minimal air traffic, clear skies and favorable aerospace regulations. As a result, companies are forming that can either send payloads into space or provide services to existing space companies.Outset-backed Zenno Astronautics, for example, is developing a fuel-free satellite propulsion system that uses magnets powered by solar panels. Dawn Aerospace is working toward a remotely piloted aircraft that could take off like a normal airplane, drop a satellite payload and be back home in 15 minutes. And Astrix Autonautics, a startup founded by three Auckland University students, is being trialed by Rocket Lab to see if they can more than double the power-to-weight ratios of solar arrays used today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Climate change threatens to unlock the carbon in sediments such as this.Julien SchroderRichard Littlemore is a Vancouver-based journalist, consultant, speechwriter, and co-author of Climate Cover-up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming.The Klondike capital of Dawson City is one of the best places in Canada to contemplate the catastrophic consequences of thawing permafrost. Or, if you’d rather, it might be a place to ignore the implications entirely, and with confidence that you are not alone in doing so. It depends on how closely you want to look – or how desperately you want to look away.Most of Dawson – like 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Canada – is underlain by permafrost, which scientists define as ground that has remained frozen, winter and summer, for at least two years. The notion may seem chilly, even forbidding, in the south, but many northerners call permafrost “our concrete.” They use it as a base for roads and bridges, as the foundation for homes, churches and businesses. In the words of Steve Kokelj, a Carleton University geographer and one of the deans of the Canadian permafrost community, it’s “the glue that holds the northern landscape together.”But if the promising prefix “perma-” suggests that this essential base is going to remain frozen forever, you might be disappointed. Thanks to climate warming, which a recent study by the Finnish Meteorological Institute showed is advancing in the North at up to seven times the global average, permafrost is thawing at an accelerating rate.Which means that stuff is starting to break. The Northwest Territories Association of Communities said in 2017 that its annual bill for permafrost-related repairs was already $51-million – a big additional tax for a small population (44,800). And it’s going to get worse. A January study in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment predicted that permafrost-related damage will affect 30 per cent to 50 per cent of all northern infrastructure by 2050.That’s obviously bad news for everyone who lives in one of the houses that is riding a permafrost thaw slump into the sea. But there is an even greater threat that hangs over us all.According to Sue Natali from the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., there is currently between 1.4 trillion and 1.6 trillion metric tonnes of carbon trapped in northern circumpolar permafrost, the remains of plants and animals that, over many thousands of years, died and slipped below the surface, where they have remained frozen ever since. For scale, that’s roughly twice as much carbon as is currently contained in the world’s atmosphere, three times as much as in all the forests on Earth.And when the permafrost thaws and micro-organisms start chowing down on all that suddenly available carboniferous material, those microbes wind up breathing out the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2) or the even more powerful methane.Next comes the truly dangerous turn, the self-reinforcing feedback that could become an irreversible global tipping point. The warming atmosphere hastens the thaw of the permafrost, which belches up more greenhouse gases, which further accelerates the warming – and so on into the crisis-ridden future. The short- to medium-term impact of this “permafrost carbon feedback” loop remains speculative and controversial but by one estimate, based on calculations from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 2019 Arctic report card, Canadian permafrost could be emitting greenhouse gases by 2050 at a rate equal to all of the country’s current human output. If we were including those GHG emissions in our national totals (we’re not), that would mean we would have to double our emission reductions and/or carbon-capture efforts to reach the federal government’s widely heralded target of net zero by 2050. It hardly bears considering.In the slightly longer term, an overview paper published this month in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources reported that by the end of the century, even middling forecasts show that northern permafrost will be emitting carbon at a rate higher than the current output of any country other than China.A drone's-eye view of the Yukon wilderness. Much of the land in this area lies on permafrost hundreds of thousands of years old that was never scoured by glaciers.Julien SchroderWhich brings us back to Dawson, where in late August the foremost permafrost experts in the country gathered with an unprecedented contingent of First Nations delegates for the North Yukon Permafrost Conference.It is, again, a fitting venue. The fabled home of the Klondike Gold Rush, Dawson transformed in the late 1890s from a Dene community of a few hundred to a bacchanalian metropolis of up to 30,000 miners, revellers and hangers-on before crashing back down to its current permanent population of fewer than 2,000.Honouring that history, the town presents as something of a theme park – though, because it is curated by Parks Canada as a National Historic Site, it looks more quaint than Disneyfied. By municipal decree, all the downtown building fronts must remain “in conformity with the architectural and landscape … style common in Dawson during and immediately following the ‘Gold Rush.’”At a distance, the effect is pretty convincing. The landscape part is easy – 1890s-style dirt roads and rickety wooden boardwalks where the sidewalks might be. This is also robustly practical. The heaving permafrost and winter temperatures that frequently dip below -40 would quickly turn pavement or sidewalk concrete to rubble.The buildings appear similarly authentic, as long as you don’t peek behind the facades to see the ones that are, in fact, corrugated-metal Quonset huts with false fronts. If you were to lift the skirts of the actual buildings, you also would find that nearly all of them are sitting on “cribbing,” beams and posts that can be shimmed and adjusted year after year to remain level, despite the permafrost decline. You don’t have to wander far from the main streets to see drunken, slewing (and ultimately dangerous) structures that have not been kept up.“Most of us are used to relevelling our buildings quite a bit,” says Dawson Mayor Bill Kendrick. It’s more difficult, though – and even more expensive – to manage some of the other infrastructure, he says, offering the example of the sewer and water lines that snapped a few years ago, thanks to a four-foot, permafrost-driven “deflection” along Sixth Avenue.These historic buildings in Dawson, shown in the mid-2000s, are smushing together as the permafrost thaws.Chris BeacomSome of Dawson's more picturesque buildings, as seen at 2018's Canada Day parade.Darryl Dyck/The Canadian PressSo people in Dawson are hypersensitized to the local effects of permafrost – the geohazard. But many seem to actively ignore the implications of permafrost carbon feedback. Far from trying to protect the permafrost, to keep excess carbon in the ground, many dozens of placer mines are working tirelessly to destroy the permafrost layer, to get access to the gold that still lurks in Klondike gravel. The miners, usually in operations of four to six people, set up in creek beds and spray water at the banks, blowing off any surface flora and the layers of permafrost ice, soils and fossilized material to get to the good stuff. Then they sluice out the gold, thereafter covering the landscape with washed-gravel tailings that, from the plane coming in from Whitehorse, look like castings from Dune-sized sandworms.According to the Yukon government manager of surficial geology, Jeff Bond, there are roughly 150 placer mining operations in the Dawson region, generating 90 per cent of the 80,000 ounces of gold that come out of the Yukon every year. At current gold prices, about $2,200 an ounce, that’s roughly $160-million worth of income, an estimated 87 per cent of which stays in the local economy. As Mayor Kendrick says, “When COVID devastated tourism, mining helped us weather the storm.”Here, then, is an analogy for the whole climate-change dilemma: what you know versus what you don’t want to know. As in southern Canada, where governments set emission-reduction targets and then invest in oil sands pipelines or promote oil and gas developments, there is always the tension between an uncertain threat tomorrow and a reliable income today.Against that tension, the Dawson permafrost conference was set up as a multifaceted act of reconciliation. First, of course, was the challenge of engaging and reconciling with the Indigenous people on whom the climate effects are having the most immediate and, often, devastating impact. Carleton University’s Chris Burn, another giant in the Canadian permafrost panoply, describes First Nations people in the North as “the last group who are not removed from the environment.” He says, “They realize that they are facing an existential problem, not just an interesting intellectual exercise.” Dr. Burn is also beloved in these parts as an academic who came to the Yukon to research permafrost in 1982 and has been coming back almost every summer since. Unlike too many academic researchers, who fly in with thousands of dollars of equipment and head straight into the field, neither tapping the locals for their insights nor sharing any knowledge gained in the process, Dr. Burn recognized early that “the observations of the people who actually live here are always more interesting than those I can make myself.” As if to drive home the point, 40 years later, he still gets ribbed for the unlikely riverbank location of his first camp.So, in preparing for this conference, Dr. Burn and others from the Canadian Permafrost Association (CPA) invited First Nations to participate as co-organizers. Three First Nations accepted: the Trʼondëk Hwëchʼin, the Vuntut Gwichen, and the Na-cho Nyak Dun.The outcome, according to current CPA president Kumari Karunaratne, was “amazing.” Knowing that a third of the people in the room would be First Nations elders, the scientists accepted a challenge to avoid jargon-filled, insider presentations. “They’re not dumbing it down,” Dr. Karunaratne said, “but they’re breaking it down enough to be understood.” And in the multidisciplinary world of permafrost science, that turned out to be a boon for other scientists, as well.Participants at the Dawson permafrost conference listen to scientist Antoni Lewkowicz and Peggy Kormandy, a Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in elder, describe the Moosehide Slide north of town.Julien SchroderThat signals the second point of reconciliation – the drawing together of the permafrost science community and, especially, the co-ordination of permafrost research.Like other dangerous climate forcings, the permafrost threat is so dispersed that no single jurisdiction can claim or exercise responsibility. Scientists, distributed among many institutions – and many countries – tend to work in isolation and, in Canada certainly, funding agencies prioritize short-term capital-intensive research projects, resisting long-term or operating grants. As a result, the Canadian permafrost research community has been relying on what University of Montreal geographer Oliver Sonnentag calls “a coalition of the willing,” in which “co-ordination is not funded and every person, every project is disconnected.”Thanks to at least three initiatives, however, that may be about to change.The first is being led by Carleton University geographer Stephan Gruber, who is the principal investigator for the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Permafrost Partnership Network (NSERC PermafrostNet), which unites researchers from 11 universities, and partners with government agencies, industry, and Indigenous communities to monitor, predict and adapt to permafrost thaw and its consequences.Dr. Natali and the Woodwell Center are driving an even larger research and co-ordination project called Permafrost Pathways, which is building a comprehensive international monitoring network to improve tracking and modelling of Arctic permafrost and carbon fluxes – i.e., how much carbon is being emitted from permafrost as opposed to that which is being absorbed as new plant material dies and is frozen in the annual cycle. Dr. Natali and company are working to partner with local leaders and to provide local and national policy makers with the data they need to fill gaps in monitoring and modelling permafrost thaw.As mentioned above, permafrost emissions are not currently included in national carbon budgets, which means that emission-reduction targets negotiated at the 2015 Paris climate conference could be way off the mark as the world seeks to keep global warming from exceeding catastrophic levels.The bad news in the Permafrost Pathways project comes in the sudden and unfortunate departure of Russia from international permafrost science collaboration, thanks to the diplomatic break driven by the Ukraine war. Two-thirds of the world’s permafrost lies within Russian borders, so permafrost researchers in the rest of the world are eager to restore the flow of scientific information.In the meantime, there may be a greater opportunity to focus on Canadian monitoring and the Woodwell team has now engaged Dr. Sonnentag, who will be taking a leave from his University of Montreal teaching duties, beginning Jan. 1, to serve as a liaison to the Canadian research community.The Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University is launching a third co-ordination project, called the Permafrost Carbon Feedback Intervention Roadmap, again seeking to expand the conversation and reduce the scientific uncertainties that some policy makers use as a rationale to delay action.Even without working through the next stage of monitoring and analysis, however, Dr. Natali bridles at the continuing policy delay. She says, “Uncertainty is just a range of possibilities. It shouldn’t frustrate action.”She also points out that we already understand the range of consequences and says that we should be making decisions based on the high end of the range, precisely because the possible consequences are so huge. (Dr. Gruber calls permafrost carbon feedback “a trillion-dollar question for coastal cities.”)Dr. Natali concludes that, in the long run, “The science will give us the numbers. For decisions, we need the wisdom to come together as human communities.”Jimmy Johnny, a Na-Cho Nyak Dun elder, speaks at the Dawson conference.Julien SchroderOne of the most popular sources of wisdom in Dawson was a Na-Cho Nyak Dun elder named Jimmy Johnny, a presenter in a panel discussion on climate-change adaptation. Mr. Johnny is a short, wiry and quietly mirthful character who has spent his life as a horse wrangler, having gotten his first job as a guide-outfitter in 1958. And he dresses the part: cowboy boots, hat, leather vest and blue jeans that stay up out of pure stubbornness, there being too little flesh on Mr. Johnny’s bones to stop them from falling down.He told a story of a recent hunting trip in which a pack horse named Big Blue fell into a huge permafrost sinkhole: “Right before my eyes, he disappeared.” Tapping the strength of all hands and a couple of other horses, Mr. Johnny worked to pull Big Blue out, but the sloppy hole was too constricted and the horse too panicked. Facing a terrible decision, Mr. Johnny walked to a high point and phoned the horse’s owner – for permission, or maybe for his blessing. But the owner just said, “Jimmy, you’re the trail boss. You do what you have to do.”Mr. Johnny walked back to his own horse and, to the consternation of the southern hunters in the party, he pulled a .30-30 rifle from his saddle. “And then I walked around behind the horse, so he didn’t have to see.”But Big Blue was neither inattentive nor new to the world of hunters. When Mr. Johnny cocked the rifle – “click, click” – the horse bounded upward, not clear of the hole, but far enough that they were able to wrestle him the rest of the way.The moderator for the adaptation panel was a Na-Cho Nyak Dun adviser named John Meikle, who noted that there is now ample evidence of the risks we all face from climate change, and the urgency of the call to action, concluding, “Maybe it’s time to take a lesson from Big Blue and imagine Jimmy Johnny standing behind you with a .30-30.”It’s a rough metaphor, but the head-nodding and mirthless laughter that greeted Mr. Meikle’s comment suggest that, in this room, at least, there is wary consensus about the looming implications of climate change generally and permafrost specifically: Even if we’re not yet capable of jumping out of the hole, it might be time to stop digging.Editor’s note: (Nov. 1, 2022): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Woodwell Climate Research Center is linked to Harvard.

But for Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of battery tech startup Sila, hard tech problems are also some of the most tantalizing.“It’s always a good time to be a hard tech startup,” Berdichevsky said at TechCrunch Disrupt. “One of the reasons is that the world doesn’t change just because it should. It changes because someone goes after something insanely hard and actually succeeds at it.”Such hard.tech startups run the gamut from advanced batteries like those made by Sila to nuclear fusion, quantum computing, automation and robotics. Any tech that has the potential for such broad impact also has a massive potential market, and that means a certain class of investors are willing to be in it for the long haul.“Hire people to do the technical stuff.

The threats to food security and livelihoods go on and on.Undoubtedly, this has some deal-makers in tech salivating. As startups look for ways to adapt the global food system to the chaos of today, we reached out to seven agtech investors to get a better understanding of how the climate crisis has informed their strategies to date.“Climate challenges are not new to anybody operating in the broader food and agriculture space, so our approach is to invest in solutions that can help mitigate and adapt to climate change,” Yield Lab partner Camila Petignat told TechCrunch.Themes the firm looks at “include soil and water conservation, improved use of crop inputs, the shift from chemical to biological crop protection solutions and reduction of food waste,” Petignat said.“We could argue,” Petignat added, “that the increased awareness of carbon markets in recent years has triggered new opportunities at the intersection of agtech and fintech, a space that we are interested in.”“India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change,” Omnivore managing partner Jinesh Shah told TechCrunch. “Agriculture represents 20% of India’s GHG emissions, but the sector is also incredibly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which may begin to threaten Indian food security in the coming decade.” he said. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, per the EPA.Shah added that the firm’s strategy is to “invest in startups that align with one or more of our four key pillars — increasing smallholder profitability, enhancing smallholder resilience, improving agricultural sustainability and catalyzing climate action.” The investor went on to state that agtech in India must “evolve beyond digital technologies (farmer platforms and B2B marketplaces), and we look to agrifood life sciences for long-term solutions to climate change.”Read the full survey to learn where investors are looking to invest, what’s on their minds right now, the best way to pitch and contact them, and understand which emerging technologies have captured their attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since last year, valuations are down 70%-80%, deal activity is down 67% and layoffs have plagued many former industry favorites.But fintech is resilient. Innovation continues to drive new developments in lending, payments, crypto and, in particular, infrastructure, showing that the industry still has lots of room for growth. And even though investment activity decreased this year, it still remains well above where it was in 2019 and 2020.Infrastructure providers have a unique opportunity to be a bright spot amidst all the doom and gloom. Over the years, infrastructure has enabled fintech companies and non-financial services companies alike to seamlessly integrate financial products into their platforms.However, as the market grew crowded, infrastructure providers have started competing over who can develop the least expensive product and sign the most fintech companies. The infrastructure market is overlooking a pivotal opportunity to build additional product capabilities that address pain points arising from the struggles of fintech.Infrastructure providers can help connect fintech companies with incumbent banks so that they can both reap the benefits of the interest rate environment.Infrastructure providers must reprioritize and find a way to grow their capabilities for their current customers instead of just signing new ones. To do this, they’ll have to take a closer look at the problems those customers deal with on a daily basis. What does a fintech company do when it’s under a fraud attack? What does a new compliance order in the U.K. mean for their business? How do they retain customers who are terrified by news of skyrocketing interest rates and inflation?These are the questions the leaders of the fintech industry face daily, and infrastructure providers need to understand how they can help answer them.Identifying and addressing pain pointsThe influx of prodigious amounts of cash in the financial infrastructure sector has crowded the space with newcomers. Addressing specific fintech pain points is not only a way to help the fintech industry out; it’s also a way for infrastructure providers to differentiate themselves and show that they provide real value.International coverageThe draw of additional customers and revenue streams has caused fintech companies to explore international waters. In an increasingly globalized world, international coverage is no longer optional.Infrastructure providers must meet their customers’ appetite for global growth by ensuring that their platform is available in countries outside the U.S. They also need to ensure their platform helps fintech companies stay compliant with rapidly changing global regulations — more on that below.Regulatory scrutiny",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After months of opposing major climate legislation, citing inflation risks, he suddenly changed his tune. Last night, climate legislation was back on the table, and the odds of it passing had gone up considerably.While not as large, in terms of dollars, as President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 still stands as one of the most significant pieces of climate legislation proposed in the U.S. It would put $369 billion toward clean energy, electric vehicles and a range of other climate programs.Senate Democrats say that the bill could cut emissions by 40% (most likely below 2005 levels, a benchmark the Biden administration has used in the past). That’s not enough to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the globally agreed upon level that would limit most catastrophic outcomes, but it’s close. According to Climate Action Tracker, the bill would bring the U.S. from “insufficient” to “almost sufficient,” increasing the chances that the world can keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius.The bill, at 725 pages, goes into great detail outlining how the hundreds of billions of dollars should be spent.

So, if anything, it’s trendy.But when the seed-stage VC — a backer of e-bike maker Zoomo and solar data firm PVcase — debuted with a $13.6 million fund in 2017, its focus was “obviously contrarian,” founding partner Rokas Peciulaitis told TechCrunch, as the “industries in vogue at the time were AI and Fintech.”The launch also marked an unexpected pivot for Peciulaitis, who says he dove into the scene with “literally zero climate tech sector experience.” He’d recently left an inflation-trading job at Bank of America, where the work was “not fulfilling in the slightest,” Peciulaitis said in a nod to the bank’s reputation as a major funder of fossil fuels.In 2017, PitchBook recorded 578 climate tech deals globally, altogether worth $12.5 billion. The sector has since tripled in size, as climate change–driven extreme weather events occupy evermore space in our collective consciousness. To that point: PitchBook tracked 1,130 climate tech deals globally in 2021, topping $44.8 billion in value. Climate tech is cool now, but Peciulaitis’s Lithuania-based venture firm is sticking with its name anyways.Like any venture capital firm, Contrarian says that it stands out through its emphasis on “developing excellent relationships with founders.” Materially, the firm invests in tech that could help decarbonize transportation, industrial processes, energy and buildings.Contrarian has completed 21 deals to date, and this year it expanded beyond Lithuania with new partners in Berlin and London. The firm backs emerging startups in Europe as well as Israel, but nowhere else in the Middle East. Currently, the firm does not invest in agriculture-related tech, though the category has a significant carbon footprint of its own.In an email, Contrarian said it counts London-based tech VC Molten Ventures among its limited partners. The firm declined to share a full list of its LPs, but stated that none of them were fossil fuel companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though numbers are down compared with 2021, a year that many agree is an outlier in the VC world, they’re on track to beat 2020 as the second hottest year for investment.What’s more, deal counts and values were up in the second quarter of this year compared with the first, suggesting that the slowdown has more or less skipped climate tech.Though deal count is down nearly 19% compared with last year, it was up 15.4% in the second quarter, according to a PitchBook analysis. Total market deal value, down year over year, was up significantly in Q2, and the average value per deal has held steady at $23.6 million, more than triple what it was five years ago.In some ways, those modest numbers could be interpreted as a slight cooldown. But the sector is probably just taking a breather given its near-term potential. Just five years from now, PitchBook estimates the climate tech market will near $1.4 trillion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%.With that kind of growth coming down the pike, there are a lot of different bets to place in the climate tech sector, but a few stand out for their early-stage potential and favorable tailwinds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since much of modern civilian infrastructure is based on global positioning systems and other satellite technologies that fall under the Defense Department’s purview, those views on cooperation are changing on both sides.“Space isn’t a quiet domain of communication and navigation and exploration anymore,” Roper told the audience at TechCrunch’s latest Sessions event, TC Sessions: Space 2020. “It’s increasingly becoming a hostile place… So we’re gearing up a new kind of competition on the military side that could extend to space and that’s creating a lot of new space programs.”Roper emphasized that the interest from the Air Force and the government more broadly extends well beyond offensive capabilities and military priorities. As space becomes an economic opportunity, Roper sees the Air Force as an engine for driving technology development forward in ways that have commercial benefits.“It’s a great, great time for innovation in new technologies that could help the military, but we want to do more than just help the military. That’s the old thinking in the Pentagon. That’s all that would help us win the Cold War in the 20th Century, but it’s not going to help us in the 21st, where technology is globalized and accelerating,” Roper said.“We want to find ways where our military mission and our funding can help accelerate commercial markets too, so it’s competing on a much bigger stage. But we think it’s where we need to aspire to be, so that we’re playing the right catalyst role in this nation and with our partners around the world,” Roper said.There are several programs that startups can tap to get those federal dollars. Two of the easiest points of entry are through the AFWERX and its recently announced SpaceWERX arm focused entirely on space technology.“These look like any tech company,” Roper told the audience at the TechCrunch event. “They’re outside our fence lines. They’re easy to walk into… Now you don’t have to know the mission, we will help you find the mission and the customer — the warfighter associated with it. It’s a great model because it keeps the company focused on what they know best, which is their tech.”Over the last three years, Roper estimated that the AFWERX program had brought 2,300 companies into the Air Force and Space Force programs, and most of them had never worked with the military before, he said.Within AFWERX there are three programs that particularly relate to integrating startups into the procurement process, Roper said. One is the Spark program, which pairs military with private industry; one is the AFVentures program, which is designed to finance new innovations coming from private industry; and finally there’s the Prime program, which helps commercialize and certify technologies.Roper pointed to the recent certification the Air Force gave to Joby Aviation for its flying cars. “So there’s a new military market that will hopefully generate a new commercial market,” Roper said.In 2021, the Prime program will expand to space technologies, according to Roper.As the demand for new tech grows, there’s no shortage of innovations Roper would like to see from private industry. From new autonomous innovations that could help co-pilot spacecraft to technology for refueling and in-space maneuverability, and reusable equipment from boosters to other components that can bring costs down.Roper also acknowledged that the Pentagon has a long way to go to “hack the acquisition system” when it comes to dual-use technologies.Entrepreneurs have pointed out that one of the biggest obstacles to the growth of the commercial space industry has been the inability of the U.S. government to open up the technology for use by private industry.Roper hopes to change that. “We want to use our military dollars, our mission, and potentially our certifications to help get you there without changing your core product,” he said. “If you succeed as a commercial success, then we succeed as well, because now we’ve got a great tech partner, that hopefully we can continue to come to to solve problems in future. The thing that we’ll want to understand early on is how our military market and all those benefits I just mentioned, how can they help you get to commercial success? And what is it that we not need to do to pull you off that trajectory?”Contracts with AFWERX are fixed-price and progress as companies hit certain milestones on the product roadmap. These orders increase incrementally as the technology proves itself, so a contract could start with the delivery of a prototype, then experimental usage, then a commercial contract, then broad adoption. “What we’re looking to do is see if you can move the ball forward on your technology, and if you do, then we do another contract. We step you up our process,” Roper said.Roper sees the project as nothing less than the evolution of the aerospace and defense industry.“We have a lot of amazing companies today that helped build stealth bombers and space planes and all sorts of awesome stuff. They’re defense companies and we still need them,” Roper said. “What we’re hoping to help build in this century is a set of new companies that are just tech companies. They’re not defense, purely, and they’re not commercial purely. They’re just technology companies and they do a bit of business on both sides.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

(PSE Healthy Energy via AP)Gas stoves in California homes are leaking cancer-causing benzene, researchers found in a new study published on Thursday, though they say more research is needed to understand how many homes have leaks.In the study, published in Environmental Science and Technology on Thursday, researchers also estimated that over 4 tons of benzene per year are being leaked into the atmosphere from outdoor pipes that deliver the gas to buildings around California — the equivalent to the benzene emissions from nearly 60,000 vehicles. And those emissions are unaccounted for by the state.The researchers collected samples of gas from 159 homes in different regions of California and measured to see what types of gases were being emitted into homes when stoves were off. They found that all of the samples they tested had hazardous air pollutants, like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), all of which can have adverse health effects in humans with chronic exposure or acute exposure in larger amounts.ADVERTISEMENTOf most concern to the researchers was benzene, a known carcinogen that can lead to leukemia and other cancers and blood disorders, according to the National Cancer Institute .The finding could have major implications for indoor and outdoor air quality in California, which has the second highest level of residential natural gas use in the United States.“What our science shows is that people in California are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of benzene from the gas that is piped into their homes,” said Drew Michanowicz, a study co-author and senior scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, an energy research and policy institute. “We hope that policymakers will consider this data when they are making policy to ensure current and future policies are health-protective in light of this new research.”Homes in the Greater Los Angeles, the North San Fernando Valley, and the San Clarita Valley areas had the highest benzene in gas levels. Leaks from stoves in these regions could emit enough benzene to significantly exceed the limit determined to be safe by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessment.This finding in particular didn’t surprise residents and health care workers in the region who spoke to The Associated Press about the study. That’s because many of them experienced the largest-known natural gas leak in the nation in Aliso Canyon in 2015.ADVERTISEMENTBack then, 100,000 tons of methane and other gases, including benzene , leaked from a failed well operated by Southern California Gas Co. It took nearly four months to get the leak under control and resulted in headaches, nausea and nose bleeds.Dr. Jeffrey Nordella was a physician at an urgent care in the region during this time and remembers being puzzled by the variety of symptoms patients were experiencing. “I didn’t have much to offer them,” except to help them try to detox from the exposures, he said.That was an acute exposure of a large amount of benzene, which is different from chronic exposure to smaller amounts, but “remember what the World Health Organization said : there’s no safe level of benzene,” he said.ADVERTISEMENTKyoko Hibino was one of the residents exposed to toxic air pollution as a result of the Aliso Canyon gas leak. After the leak, she started having a persistent cough and nosebleeds and eventually was diagnosed with breast cancer, which has also been linked to benzene exposure . Her cats also started having nosebleeds and one recently passed away from leukemia.“I’d say let’s take this study really seriously and understand how bad (benzene exposure) is,” she said.___Follow Drew Costley on Twitter: @drewcostley .___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Since then a group of scientists in the U.K. has been working with Milne to pinpoint the molecules that give Parkinson’s its distinct olfactory signature. The team has now zeroed in on a set of molecules specific to the disease—and has created a simple skin-swab-based test to detect them.Milne, a 72-year-old retired nurse from Perth, Scotland, has hereditary hyperosmia, a condition that endows people with a hypersensitivity to smell. She discovered that she could sense Parkinson’s with her nose after noticing her late husband, Les, was emitting a musky odor that she had not detected before. Eventually, she linked this change in scent to Parkinson’s when he was diagnosed with the disease many years later. Les passed away in 2015.In 2012 Milne met Tilo Kunath, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, at an event organized by the research and support charity Parkinson’s UK. Although skeptical at first, Kunath and his colleagues decided to put Milne’s claims to the test. They gave her 12 T-shirts, six from people with Parkinson’s and six from healthy individuals. She correctly identified the disease in all six cases—and the one T-shirt from a healthy person she categorized as having Parkinson’s belonged to someone who went on to be diagnosed with the disease less than a year later.Subsequently, Kunath, along with chemist Perdita Barran of the University of Manchester in England and her colleagues, has been searching for the molecules responsible for the change in smell that Milne can detect. The researchers used mass spectrometry to identify types and quantities of molecules in a sample of sebum, an oily substance found on the skin’s surface. They discovered changes to fatty molecules known as lipids in people with Parkinson’s.In their latest study, published on September 7 in the American Chemical Society journal JACS Au, the researchers revealed the results of using a simple skin-swab-based test to detect the lipid signature that is indicative of Parkinson’s. By comparing sebum samples from 79 people with Parkinson’s and 71 people without the illness, the team zeroed in on a set of large lipids that could be detected in a matter of minutes using a special type of mass spectrometry in which substances are rapidly transferred from a swab to an analyzer using just a piece of paper.“I think it’s a very promising set of biomarkers,” says Blaine Roberts, a biochemist at Emory University, who wasn’t involved in the work. He adds that one of the big open questions that remains is how exacting this test can be. While the authors of the September 7 study reported the detailed chemical profile of the unique Parkinson’s signature, they did not include an assessment of its accuracy. According to Barran, based on not-yet-published data, their test appears to be able to determine whether an individual has Parkinson’s with more than 90 percent accuracy.Tiago Outeiro, a neuroscientist at the University of Göttingen in Germany, who was not involved with the research, says the sebum-based swab test is novel and has clear advantages, such as the ease of sample collection. Outeiro wonders whether people with diseases that share symptoms and pathologies with Parkinson’s disease, such as multiple system atrophy, also have similar chemical markers.The team is now working with local hospitals to determine whether this sebum-based test can also be conducted in clinical labs—a key step toward determining whether it can be used as a diagnostic tool. Ultimately, Barran says, the hope is to use the test to help identify individuals who have been referred to their neurologists by their general practitioner for suspected Parkinson’s so they can receive a faster diagnosis. Currently, there are thousands of people waiting to see a neurologist in the U.K.’s National Health Service, and it will take an estimated two years to clear that list, Barran says. A skin-swab test could enable those patients to mail in skin swabs to be analyzed in the hospital laboratory and pinpoint those who need help most urgently. Barran’s research team is approaching people on the waiting list to see if they are willing to take part in a trial to see whether such skin-swab tests could prove effective in helping to speed up the triage process.Barran and her colleagues are also collaborating with a group at Harvard University to determine whether sebum-based biomarkers are detectable in people who have constipation, a reduced sense of smell or other early signs of Parkinson’s but have not yet received a diagnosis.Milne has inspired groups elsewhere to search for biomarkers based on the disease’s olfactory signature. This year researchers in China published a paper describing an electronic nose—an artificial-intelligence-based sensor modeled after the olfactory system—that sniffs out molecules present in the sebum of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Other groups in China, the U.K. and elsewhere have also been training dogs to sniff out the disease.Parkinson’s may not be the only disease Milne has a nose for. She’s also reported noticing a unique smell in people with Alzheimer’s, cancer, and tuberculosis and is working with scientists to see whether a specific olfactory signature of those diseases can be deduced.For Milne, the hope is that this work will ultimately benefit patients with these conditions. “My husband suffered from [Parkinson’s] for 21 years after his diagnosis, but he had it many years before that,” Milne told Scientific American in 2015. “I would like to see that people don’t suffer the way he suffered.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only some blood tests can pinpoint which organ the cancer is actually in. Lab tests must be run on potentially cancerous tissue to confirm a diagnosis, but you can’t biopsy someone’s entire body. False positives remain an issue for the entire field of cancer screening, which, by design, involves sifting through mounds of healthy tests to find cancer. Galleri—the MCED furthest along the path to widespread use—incorrectly flagged 57 healthy blood samples as cancerous in the aforementioned study.There’s also a risk of jumping the gun—some cancers never become invasive or life-threatening, but early detection could prompt harsh treatment like chemotherapy. Some data suggests that less worrisome cancers actually show up in the bloodstream less, which could minimize that problem.The NIC trial will help determine how blood test results for cancer should be interpreted, and it should provide a standard approach to launching cancer screening studies as companies flood the field with new tests.“I don't think most companies tend to want to compare their tests head to head,” says Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard. “It's expensive and difficult. So somebody else, a neutral party like the NCI, needs to.”Rebbeck thinks the blood tests the new trial will vet will prove most helpful in the cases of pancreatic, liver, and ovarian cancer, which kill often and have no other form of screening. Still, longer trials are needed to confirm whether the time bought by these blood tests saves lives.But Rebbeck is optimistic about the Cancer Moonshot’s ultimate goal: “It seems very realistic to me to think that we could reduce death by half,” he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vaccine is based on a spherical protein ‘nanoparticle’ that was created by researchers nearly a decade ago, through a labour-intensive trial-and error-process1.Now, thanks to gargantuan advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a team led by David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, reports in Science2,3 that it can design such molecules in seconds instead of months.‘The entire protein universe’: AI predicts shape of nearly every known proteinSuch efforts are a part of a scientific sea change, as AI tools such as DeepMind’s protein-structure-prediction software AlphaFold are embraced by life scientists. In July, DeepMind revealed that the latest version of AlphaFold had predicted structures for every protein known to science. And recent months have seen an explosive growth in AI tools — some based on AlphaFold — that can quickly dream up completely new proteins. Previously, this had been a painstaking pursuit with high failure rates.“Since AlphaFold, there’s been a shift in the way we work with protein design,” says Noelia Ferruz, a computational biologist at the University of Girona, Spain. “We are witnessing very exciting times.”Most efforts are focused on tools that can help to make original proteins, shaped unlike anything in nature, without much focus on what these molecules can do. But researchers — and a growing number of companies that are applying AI to protein design — would like to design proteins that can do useful things, from cleaning up toxic waste to treating diseases. Among the companies that are working towards this goal are DeepMind in London and Meta (formerly Facebook) in Menlo Park, California.“The methods are already really powerful. They’re going to get more powerful,” says Baker. “The question is what problems are you going to solve with them.”From scratchBaker’s laboratory has spent the past three decades making new proteins. Software called Rosetta, which his lab started developing in the 1990s, splits the process into steps. Initially, researchers conceived a shape for a novel protein — often by cobbling together bits of other proteins — and the software deduced a sequence of amino acids that corresponded to this shape.But these ‘first draft’ proteins rarely folded into the desired shape when made in the lab, and instead ended up stuck in different confirmations. So another step was needed to tweak the protein sequence such that it folded only into a single desired structure. This step, which involved simulating all the ways in which different sequences might fold, was computationally expensive, says Sergey Ovchinnikov, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who used to work in Baker’s lab. “You would literally have, like, 10,000 computers running for weeks doing this.”What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolutionBy tweaking AlphaFold and other AI programmes, that time-consuming step has become instantaneous, says Ovchinnikov. In one approach developed by Baker’s team, called hallucination, researchers feed random amino-acid sequences into a structure-prediction network; this alters the structure so that it becomes ever-more protein-like, as judged by the network’s predictions. In a 2021 paper, Baker’s team created more than 100 small, ‘hallucinated’ proteins in the lab and found signs that about one-fifth resembled the predicted shape4.AlphaFold, and a similar tool developed by Baker’s lab called RoseTTAFold, were trained to predict the structure of individual protein chains. But researchers soon discovered that such networks could also model assemblies of multiple interacting proteins. On this basis, Baker and his team were confident they could hallucinate proteins that would self-assemble into nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes; these would be made up of numerous copies of a single protein and would be similar to those on which the COVID-19 vaccine is based.Nik Spencer/Nature; Source: Adapted from N. Ferruz et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.31.505981 (2022); and J. Wang et al. Science 377, 387–394 (2022).But when they instructed microorganisms to make their creations in the labs, none of the 150 designs worked. “They didn’t fold at all: they were just gunk at the bottom of the test tube,” says Baker.Around the same time, another researcher in the lab, machine-learning scientist Justas Dauparas, was developing a deep-learning tool to address what is known as the inverse folding problem — determining a protein sequence that corresponds to a given protein’s overall shape3. The network, called ProteinMPNN, can act as a ‘spellcheck’ for designer proteins created using AlphaFold and other tools, says Ovchinnikov, by tweaking sequences while maintaining the molecules’ overall shape.When Baker and his team applied this second network to their hallucinated protein nanoparticles, it had much greater success making the molecules experimentally. The researchers checked 30 of their new proteins using cryo-electron microscopy and other experimental techniques, and 27 of them matched the AI-led designs2. The team’s creations included giant rings with complex symmetries, unlike anything found in nature. In theory, the approach could be used to design nanoparticles corresponding to almost any symmetric shape, says Lukas Milles, a biophysicist who co-led the effort. “It is electrifying to see what these networks can do.”Deep-learning revolutionDeep-learning tools such as proteinMPNN have been a game changer in protein design, says Arne Elofsson, a computational biologist at Stockholm University. “You draw your protein, push a button, and you get something that one in ten times works.” Even higher success rates can be achieved by combining multiple neural networks to tackle different parts of the design process, as Baker’s team did in designing the nanoparticles. “Now we have full control over the shape of the protein,” says Ovchinnikov.Baker’s isn’t the only lab applying AI to protein design. In a review paper posted to the bioRxiv this month, Ferruz and her colleagues counted more than 40 AI protein-design tools that have been developed in recent years, using various approaches5 (see ‘How to design a protein’).Many of these tools, including proteinMPNN, tackle the inverse folding problem: they specify a sequence that corresponds to a particular structure, often using approaches borrowed from image-recognition tools. Some others are based on an architecture similar to that of language neural networks such as GPT-3, which produces human-like text; but, instead, the tools are capable of producing novel protein sequences. “These networks are able to ‘speak’ proteins,” says Ferruz, who has co-developed one such network6.With so many protein-design tools available, it’s not always clear how best to compare them, says Chloe Hsu, a machine-learning researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who developed an inverse folding network with researchers from Meta7.Four examples of protein ‘hallucination’. In each case, AlphaFold is presented with a random amino-acid sequence, predicts the structure, and changes the sequence until the software confidently predicts that it will fold into a protein with a well-defined 3D shape. Colours show prediction confidence (from red for very low confidence, through yellow and light blue to dark blue for very high confidence). Initial frames have been slowed down for clarity. Credit: Sergey OvchinnikovMany teams gauge their network’s ability to accurately determine the sequence of an existing protein from its structure. But this doesn’t apply for all methods, and it’s not clear how this metric, known as recovery rate, applies to the design of novel proteins, say scientists. Ferruz would like to see a protein-design competition, analogous to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, in which AlphaFold first demonstrated its superiority over other networks. “It’s a dream. Something like CASP would really move the field forward,” she says.To the wet labBaker and his colleagues are adamant that making a novel protein in the lab is the ultimate test of their methods. Their initial failure to make hallucinated protein assemblies shows this. “AlphaFold thought they were fantastic proteins, but they clearly didn’t work in the wet lab,” says Basile Wicky, a biophysicist in Baker’s lab who co-led the effort, along with Baker, Milles and UW biochemist Alexis Courbet.But not all scientists developing AI tools for protein design have easy access to experimental set-ups, notes Jinbo Xu, a computational biologist at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in Illinois. Finding a lab to collaborate with can take time, so Xu is establishing his own wet lab to put his team’s creations to the test.Experiments will also be essential when it comes to designing proteins with specific tasks in mind, says Baker. In July, his team described a pair of AI methods that allow researchers to embed a specific sequence or structure in a novel protein8. They used these approaches to design enzymes that catalyse particular reactions; proteins capable of binding to other molecules; and a protein that could be used in a vaccine against a respiratory virus that is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations.Last year, DeepMind launched a spin-off company called Isomorphic Labs in London that intends to apply AI tools such as AlphaFold to drug discovery. DeepMind’s chief executive, Demis Hassabis, says that he sees protein design as an obvious and promising application for deep-learning technology, and for AlphaFold in particular. “We’re working quite a lot in the protein design space. It’s pretty early days.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kidneys are far and away the most sought-after organ for transplantation , followed by livers. While the liver is the only human organ known capable of regenerating itself, if you damage yours badly enough for long enough — as some 30 million Americans have — then the only treatment is a transplant. Assuming you can even acquire one for doctors to stick in you. Every year demand for replacement livers outstrips supply by a scope of tens of thousands.“Only one-third of those on the liver transplant waiting list will be transplanted, and the demand for livers is projected to increase 23 percent in the next 20 years,” a multidisciplinary team of researchers observed in 2016’s Liver-Regenerative Transplantation: Regrow and Reset . “Exacerbating the organ shortage problem, the donor pool is expected to shrink further because of the obesity epidemic. Liver steatosis [aka fatty liver disease ] is increasingly common in donors and is a significant risk factor in liver transplantation.”To address this critical shortage, the study authors note that doctors have explored a variety of cutting-edge regimens, from cell repopulation and tissue engineering, nanoparticles to genomics, mechanical aids to porcine-derived xenotransplantation, all with varying degrees of success. Cellular repopulation has been used for years, a process that injects healthy liver cells into the patient’s damaged organ through a portal vein where they adhere themselves to the existing cellular scaffolding and grow into new, functional liver tissue.Turn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from Engadget You can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu. Not now Turned on Turn onFabian Bimmer / reuters“Creating an immediately available and inexhaustible supply of functioning liver cells from autologous tissue would allow early intervention in patients with hepatic failure and would allow liver cells to be infused over a longer period of time,” the 2016 study’s authors note. “Combined with recent advances in genome-editing technology, such liver cells could be used widely to treat devastating liver-based inborn errors of metabolism and to eliminate the need for a life-long regimen of immunosuppressive drugs and their complications.” The downside to this technique is the pace at which the donor cells proliferate, making it a poor tool against acute liver failure.Extracellular Vesicle-based therapies, on the other hand, leverage the body’s intracellular communications pathways to deliver drugs with, “high bioavailability, exceptional biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity,” according to 2020’s Extracellular Vesicle-Based Therapeutics: Preclinical and Clinical Investigations . “They provide a means for intercellular communication and the transmission of bioactive compounds to targeted tissues, cells, and organs” including “fibroblasts, neuronal cells, macrophages, and even cancer cells.”EVs are the postal letters that cells send one another. They come in a variety of sizes from 30 to 1000 nm and have exterior membranes studded with multiple adhesive proteins that grant them entry into any number of different types of cells. Exploiting the biological equivalent to a janitor’s key ring, researchers have begun tucking therapeutic nanoparticles into EVs and using them to discreetly inject treatments into the targeted cells. However, these treatments are still in the experimental stages and are most effective against acute liver failure and inborn metabolic diseases rather than end-stage liver failure.Mayo ClinicMechanical aids, the hepatocytic equivalent to a dialysis machine, like the Mayo Spheroid Reservoir Bioartificial Liver (SRBAL, above) are ideal for treating cases of acute liver failure, able to take over the entirety of the patient’s liver function externally and immediately. However, such procedures are both expensive and temporary. The SRBAL can only support a patient for up to two weeks, making it more suitable for keeping someone alive until a donor can be located rather than as a permanent, pacemaker-like solution.The bioprinting and implantation of replacement livers has also shown promise, though they too are still in early development and largely not near ready for widespread adoption. Interspecies transplantation using genetically-engineered pig organs are a bit closer to clinical use , with surgeons successfully transplanting a porcine heart into a human patient for the first time this past January (though he died of complications two months later). Pig kidneys and livers have similarly been transplanted into human recipients, often with less drastic side effects than death.No matter where the transplanted organ comes from, getting it into the patient is invariably going to involve a significant surgical procedure. However, the Lygenesis company recently unveiled its non-invasive solution: tricking the patient’s body into growing a series of miniature, ectopic liver “organoids” in its own lymphatic system like a crop of blood-scrubbing potatoes.For those of you who dozed through high school bio, a quick recap of terms. The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system that serves to circulate some 20 liters of lymph throughout your body, absorb excess interstitial fluids back into the bloodstream, and incubate critical lymphocytes like T-cells . Organoids, on the other hand, are biological masses artificially grown from stem cells that perform the same functions as natural organs , but do so ectopically, in that they function in a different part of the body as a regular liver. Blood-scrubbing potatoes are self-explanatory.“Fundamentally, Lygenesis uses the lymph node, your body's natural bio reactors typically used for T-cells,” company CEO and co-founder Michael Hufford, told Engadget. “We hijacked that same biology, we engraft our therapies into the lymph nodes to grow functioning ectopic organs.”“We use an outpatient endoscopic ultrasound procedure where we're going down through the mouth of the patient using standard endoscopic equipment,” Hufford continued. “We engraft ourselves there in minutes under light sedation, so it's very low medical risk and also is really quite inexpensive.” He notes that the average cost for a proper, in-hospital liver transplant will set you back around a million dollars. Lygenesis’ outpatient procedure “is billed at a couple of thousand or so,” he said.More importantly, the Lygenesis technique doesn’t require a full donated liver, or even a large fraction of one. In fact, each donated organ can be split among several dozen recipients. “Using our technology a single donated liver can reach 75 or more patients,” Hofford said. The process of converting a single donated liver into all those engraftable samples takes a team of three technicians more than six hours and 70 steps to complete. The process does not involve any gene manipulation, such as CRISPR editing.This process is quite necessary as patients cannot donate culturable liver cells to themselves. “Once you have end-stage liver disease, you typically have a very fibrotic liver ,” Hofford noted. “It will bleed at the slightest sort of intervention.” Even the simple act of collecting cellular samples can quickly turn deadly if the wrong bit of organ is bisected.And it’s not only the transplant recipients themselves who are unable to donate. Hofford estimates between 30 and 40 percent of donated livers are too worn to be successfully transplanted. “One of the benefits of our technology is we're using organs that have been donated but will otherwise be discarded,” he said.Once engrafted into a lymph node, the liver organoid will grow and vascularize over the course of two to three months, until it is large enough to begin supporting the existing liver. Hufford points out that even with end-stage disease, a liver can retain up to 30 percent of its original functionality, so these organoids are designed to augment and support the existing organ rather than replace it outright.Lygenesis is currently in Phase 2A of the FDA approval process , meaning that a small group of four patients have each received a single engraftment in a lymph node located in their central body cavity near the liver itself (the body has more than 500 lymph nodes and apparently this treatment can technically target any of them). Should this initial test prove successful subsequent study groups will receive increasing numbers of engraftment, up to a half dozen, to help the company and federal regulators figure out the optimal number of organoids to treat the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites768,https://news.mit.edu/2022/sensors-face-masks-fit-1020,MIT engineers develop sensors for face masks that help gauge fit,"The study is a collaboration between Dagdeviren’s lab; Siqi Zheng, the STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; and Tolga Durak, managing director of MIT’s Environment, Health, and Safety programs. Jin-Hoon Kim, an MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Electronics.The researchers hope that their sensor will help people to find masks that fit them better, and that designers could use it to create masks that fit a wider variety of face shapes and sizes. The sensor can also be used to monitor vital signs such as breathing rate and temperature, as well as environmental conditions such as humidity.“What we realized by analyzing our collected data from the individuals in the study was that the masks that we use in daily life are not very suitable for female participants,” says Canan Dagdeviren, the LG Career Development Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT and the corresponding author of the study.Using this sensor, the researchers analyzed the fit of surgical masks on male and female subjects, and found that overall, the masks fit women’s faces much less closely than they fit men’s faces.Currently, there are no simple ways to measure the fit of a mask, but a new sensor developed at MIT could make it much easier to ensure a good fit. The sensor, which measures physical contact between the mask and the wearer’s face, can be applied to any kind of mask.Wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, but a mask’s effectiveness depends on how well it fits.Fit qualityThe researchers began working on this project before mask-wearing became common during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their original intention was to use sensors embedded in masks to measure the effectiveness of mask-wearing in areas with high levels of air pollution. However, once the pandemic started, they realized that such a sensor could have more widespread applications.With so many different kinds of masks available during the pandemic, the researchers thought this kind of sensor could be useful to help individuals find the best-fitting mask for them. Currently, the only way to measure mask fit is to use a machine called a mask fit tester, which evaluates the mask fit by comparing air particle concentrations inside and outside of the face mask. However, this type of machine is only available in specialized facilities such as hospitals, which use them to evaluate mask fit for health care workers.The MIT team wanted to create a more user-friendly, portable device to measure mask fit. Dagdeviren’s lab, the Conformable Decoders group, specializes in developing flexible, stretchable electronics that can be worn on the skin or incorporated into textiles to detect signals from the body.“In this project, we wanted to monitor both biological and environmental conditions simultaneously, such as breathing pattern, skin temperature, human activities, temperature and humidity inside the face mask, and the position of the mask, including whether people are wearing it properly or not,” Kim says. “We also wanted to check the fit quality.”To integrate their sensors into face masks, the researchers created a device that they call a conformable multimodal sensor face mask (cMaSK). Sensors that measure a variety of parameters are embedded in a flexible polymer frame that can be reversibly attached to the inside of any mask, around the edges.To measure fit, the cMaSK has 17 sensors around the edge of the mask that measure capacitance, which can be used to determine whether the mask is touching the skin at each of those locations.The cMaSK interface also has sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure, which can detect activities such as speaking and coughing. An accelerometer within the device can reveal if the wearer is moving around. All of the sensors are embedded into a biocompatible polymer called polyimide, which is used in medical implants such as stents.The conformable electronics are laminated and delaminated on a surgical mask.The researchers tested the cMaSK interface in a group of five men and five women. All of the subjects wore surgical masks, and the researchers monitored the readings from the sensors as the participants performed a variety of activities, such as speaking, walking, and running. They also tested the sensors in a variety of temperature conditions.Using data obtained by the capacitance sensors, the researchers created a machine-learning algorithm to calculate mask fit quality for each subject in the study. These measurements revealed that mask fit was significantly worse for women than men, due to differences in face shape and size. However, the fit for women could be improved slightly by wearing smaller surgical masks. The researchers also found that mask fit quality was low for one of the male subjects who had a beard, which created gaps between the mask and the skin.To verify their results, the researchers also collaborated with MIT’s Environment, Health, and Safety Office on the design and evaluation of the fit, and found that the fit results for each study participant were very similar to what they found using the cMaSK.Customized fitThe researchers hope that their findings will encourage mask manufacturers to design masks that fit a variety of face shapes and sizes, especially women’s faces. Dagdeviren’s lab is planning to work on mass production and large-scale deployment of the cMaSK interface.“We hope to think about ways to design masks and come up with the best fit for individuals,” Dagdeviren says. “We have different sizes for shoes, and you can even customize your shoes. So why can’t you customize and design your mask, for your own health and for societal benefit?”The researchers also hope to return to their original idea of studying the effects of air pollution on people who work outside.“Our technology can really help to quantify the social costs of these environmental hazards, and also to measure the benefits of any kind of policy intervention,” Zheng says.The research was funded by the MIT Media Lab Consortium, the 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, and the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative (MISTI) Global Fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites769,https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/a-bold-effort-to-cure-hiv-using-crispr/,A bold effort to cure HIV using Crispr,"In July, an HIV-positive man became the first volunteer in a clinical trial aimed at using Crispr gene editing to snip the AIDS-causing virus out of his cells. For an hour, he was hooked up to an IV bag that pumped the experimental treatment directly into his bloodstream. The one-time infusion is designed to carry the gene-editing tools to the man’s infected cells to clear the virus.Later this month, the volunteer will stop taking the antiretroviral drugs he’s been on to keep the virus at undetectable levels. Then, investigators will wait 12 weeks to see if the virus rebounds. If not, they’ll consider the experiment a success. “What we’re trying to do is return the cell to a near-normal state,” says Daniel Dornbusch, CEO of Excision BioTherapeutics, the San Francisco-based biotech company that’s running the trial.The HIV virus attacks immune cells in the body called CD4 cells and hijacks their machinery to make copies of itself. But some HIV-infected cells can go dormant—sometimes for years—and not actively produce new virus copies. These so-called reservoirs are a major barrier to curing HIV.Advertisement“HIV is a tough foe to fight because it’s able to insert itself into our own DNA, and it’s also able to become silent and reactivate at different points in a person’s life,” says Jonathan Li, a physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and HIV researcher at Harvard University who’s not involved with the Crispr trial. Figuring out how to target these reservoirs—and doing it without harming vital CD4 cells—has proven challenging, Li says.While antiretroviral drugs can halt viral replication and clear the virus from the blood, they can’t reach these reservoirs, so people have to take medication every day for the rest of their lives. But Excision BioTherapeutics is hoping that Crispr will remove HIV for good.Crispr is being used in several other studies to treat a handful of conditions that arise from genetic mutations. In those cases, scientists are using Crispr to edit peoples’ own cells. But for the HIV trial, Excision researchers are turning the gene-editing tool against the virus. The Crispr infusion contains gene-editing molecules that target two regions in the HIV genome important for viral replication. The virus can only reproduce if it’s fully intact, so Crispr disrupts that process by cutting out chunks of the genome.In 2019, researchers at Temple University and the University of Nebraska found that using Crispr to delete those regions eliminated HIV from the genomes of rats and mice. A year later, the Temple group also showed that the approach safely removed viral DNA from macaques with SIV, the monkey version of HIV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

other news sites771,https://elifesciences.org/articles/80315,Transient cell in cell formation underlies tumor relapse and resistance to immunotherapy,"We then set out to understand what signaling cascade governs cell-in-cell structures. Initially, we sought to test if the observed results were cell fusion. Thus, we incubated tumor cells whose cytosols were labeled with either Wasabi or tdTomato with tumor-reactive T cells. Confocal analysis indicated that each cell type in the cell-in-cell formation maintained its cytoplasm, and no mix between colors was detected (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, long-term follow-up of cell dissemination from this structure indicated that each cell maintains its initial single labelling color (Figure 6—video 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). To corroborate this, we also incubated tumor cells whose membrane, nucleus, and F-actin were labeled with different fluorophores. Similarly, each cell in this formation was separated and maintained the integrity of its original cell components (Figure 6A). Given the similarity of this formation to entosis, we used ROCK inhibitor, which is the key regulator of this process. Indeed, blocking ROCK almost completely prevented T cell-mediated cell-in-cell formation (Figure 6B, C). We then tested whether the molecular machinery reported to mediate tumor spontaneous entosis applies to govern the current cell-in-cell structure. However, we observed no increase or changes in the cellular localization of phosphorylated β catenin, E-cadherin, and phosphorylated integrin β1 (26) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) suggesting other mediators promote this entosis. Furthermore, there was no reduction in cell-in-cell formation upon blocking of E- and N- cadherins, or inhibition of Wnt signaling (Figure 6D–E). In sharp contrast, disruption of actin filaments, blocking of mRNA synthesis or protein production completely abrogated tumor cells’ capacity to form a cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that the structure requires de novo synthesis of genes (Figure 6D–E).Figure 6 with 2 supplements with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset STAT3 and EGR1 signaling govern T cell-mediated cell-in-cell tumor formation.

Over 400 genes were increased in cell-in-cell formation induced by T cell secreted granules compared to untreated B16F10 cells, 215 of which were also upregulated by the tumor cells sorted from treated animals (Figure 6F, ). KEGG analysis further indicated that multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT3 axis and FGF-receptors downstream pathways, are enriched in cell-in-cell formation generated in vivo, with approximately 80 significantly elevated genes relating to these pathways (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, ). Indeed, EGR1 and STAT3 expression was significantly elevated in cell-in-cell tumors (Figure 6G). Both mice and human tumors incubated with reactive T cells had elevated their p-STAT3 levels, in comparison to untreated tumor cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), suggesting this mechanism is conserved across species. Since these results may also reflect adaptation to the tumor microenvironments, we next corroborate the necessity of these factors to cell-in-cell formation ex vivo. Overexpression of either STAT3 or EGR1 was sufficient to induce cell-in-cell formation without additional stimulation (Figure 6H). Furthermore, these cells were significantly more resistant to killing by CD8+ T cell, compared to sham transfected cells (Figure 6I). We also tested if inhibiting these genes would reduce cell-in-cell tumor formation. Inhibition of STAT3 and EGR1, but not MAPK3 and EGR2, significantly abrogated the capacity of tumor cells to form cell-in-cell structures upon incubation with IFNγ-stimulated T cells and with T cell secreted granules (Figure 6J and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In order to integrate cell-in-cell inhibition to an in vivo therapy, we first tested the effect of small molecule inhibitors on tumor cell formation. We found that inhibition of STAT3, or EGR pathway, completely prevented cell-in-cell formation upon incubation with reactive T cells or T cell-secreted granules (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Since blocking EGR1 also reduced T cell viability, we then set out to establish a treatment protocol that combines STAT3 inhibition (which also inhibits T cell activity) and immunotherapy. To this end, mice bearing palpable tumors were injected with Stattic or with PBS for two consecutive days. On the second day, we sub-lethally irradiated the mice and injected them with 5 × 106 gp100-reactive T cells and IL-2. In another model, we treated mice for two days with Stattic, followed by treatments with anti-CD40, TNFα, and anti-TRP1. Recurrent tumors were treated with the same regimen. In both models, injection of Stattic alone had no effect on tumor growth. We found, however, that injection of Stattic prior to administration of immunotherapy partially restored the responsiveness of tumors that re-occur following immunotherapies (Figure 6K–L). While tumor cell sensitization may be a result from multiple mechanisms, these results stress the benefit of combining immunotherapy with STAT3 inhibition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch772,https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/scanbo-non-invasive-blood-glucose/,How sweet is your bloodScanbo gives an answer without poking holes in you,"If you have diabetes, or ever suspected that you might, you will have done the poke-your-finger-and-drop-blood-on-a-stick thing until your finger goes numb. Finger-prick blood glucose monitoring is the de facto standard, but AI company Scanbo wants to put an end to all that, replacing the droplet with some off-the-shelf diagnostic tools and a big helping of data analysis.The company has developed a prototype device that combines a three-lead ECG measurement and a Photoplethysmogram (PPG). The 60-second measurement is fed to a set of algorithms that can give you some very promising measurements. For starters, the device is doing non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, but the company’s founder claims that it can also do blood pressure measurements.I spoke to the company’s founder and CEO, Ashissh Raichura, as part of TechCrunch’s virtual CES coverage, where he told me a bit more about the technology. He also gave me a demonstration, first testing his own blood with a conventional, off-the-shelf fingerprick blood glucose monitor, and then with the company’s own prototype. The measurements were 6.2 and 6.3 mmol/L, respectively, which puts the two devices within a couple of percent accuracy of each other.“We use the three electrodes for ECG data, and an additional measurement for PPG. We measure for 60 seconds, and then take the raw data and analyze that using the machine learning convolutional neural network, and the deep neural network. We combine all of that data, take the three machine learning algorithms, see what comes as a result, and then analyze the glucose,” Raichura told me, as he was preparing to demo the device for me. “We want to commercialize our product, and will be looking looking for US FDA in Health Canada approval.”I was surprised to learn that it is possible to do non-invasive blood glucose measuring — most of the so-called non-invasive methods do use an implant or a filament sensor wire to get readings, but the method that Scanbo uses has been studied and covered in medical journals. It doesn’t look like the FDA has approved any products that take this approach yet, so the company is certainly facing a lengthy medical approval process in order to bring its products to market.The company also claims it is able to do blood pressure measurements, the kind that you might do at home or in the doctor’s office with a blood pressure cuff.“When we take your EKG data, we convert that into what is called a short wave transmission length,” Raichura summarizes in how the company is able to pull off blood pressure metrics. “Based on that, we calculate your non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure too. That is another piece of algorithm that we have patent pending.”With all of this tech in its back pocket, the company has an interesting choice to make; is it going to start manufacturing its own hardware devices, or is there an opportunity to license the algorithms and technology to other manufacturers that already have devices with PPG and ECG capabilities on the market.“We have two patents pending, purely on the hardware, how we designed it, how we amalgamated electrodes and all the sensors in a way where we can take all the parameters in one time,” explains Raichura, hinting at how the company is trying to measure all the things at once. “If you look at the traditionally available all the devices, you measure one thing at a time, not everything at once. You do blood pressure one time, your EKG at another time. One after another, all in sequential processes. In our case, we are asking you to put four fingers on the device, so we can capture all the data, and use algorithms to report different aspects of your health.”Scanbo sees its technology as an at-home alternative to some of the currently existing clinical techniques and technology.“As a company, we are a combination of AI and med-tech,” Raichura says, and mentions that the market is starting to take notice. “With this product, we are just getting started now. Medtronic, Samsung, LG, and others are already talking to us and see can we collaborate with them, and we are exploring a couple of strategic partnerships that could help us in taking us to different markets globally. We see the needs from 400 million people in the world with type two diabetes, and most of the populations can’t afford glucometers — never mind continuous glucose meters. We are very, very cost-effective, and we can bring the cost down to as low as $20 a month. There is no biowaste, you don’t need any disposables, you don’t need strips or anything, just purely the machine learning algorithm and a device with a chargeable battery.”The company is about to take its prototype and clinical results as leverage to go raise a seed round and kick off the process toward regulatory approval and, eventually, make a product available to the public.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites773,https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/new-mrna-vaccine-universal-flu-shot,Scientists use mRNA technology to create a potent flu vaccine that could last for years,"In the spring of 1933 , three scientists at the U.K.’s Medical Research Council received a treasure trove of vials containing human mucus from sick hospital patients. It was gross, yes, but not unwarranted: The culprit behind what had caused the 1918 influenza pandemic was still at large.Months later, the trio of scientists published a paper that found that a virus, not a novel strain of bacteria like some within the scientific community originally thought, was to blame. Over the following decades, other scientists unfurled the gnarly branches of the large influenza family tree, gathering enough information to formulate a vaccine, which (hopefully) most of us get before every flu season.But here’s the catch: Influenza is a master shapeshifter. Every year, strains of the virus that infect humans — influenza type A and B — evolve in ways that evade vaccines and, subsequently, our immune systems. This results in uneven vaccine effectiveness from year to year and also undermines efforts to pack a flu shot with a broad, long-lasting immune punch.But we may have an ace in the hole thanks to mRNA, the same technology used for our Covid-19 vaccines. In a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and other institutions have cooked up an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that targets four viral proteins that tend to remain the same across different strains of influenza.“[It’s] a nice study with significant clinical implications that uses the same strategy as for Covid vaccination to create a better flu vaccine with broader capabilities by targeting multiple conserved flu [viral proteins] antigens instead of the way we do it now, which is to grow candidate strains in eggs and then inactivate them,” Anne Davidson, a researcher at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York, who was not involved in the study, told Inverse in an email.Artistic rendering of a molecule of hemagglutinin. ShutterstockHere’s the background — Flu vaccines are updated every year based on influenza patterns most recently seen in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia; its flu season runs from April to October.Scientists pay close attention to one sugar-covered protein called hemagglutinin that dots the surface of the influenza virus, Norbert Pardi, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who co-led the study, tells Inverse.“Hemagglutinin has two major parts: the head domain, which is variable and immunodominant, [and a stalk domain],” explains Pardi. “The current seasonal vaccines that use three or four inactivated [influenza] viruses primarily target the immunodominant head domain… but the problem is that the virus can change that pretty easily and escape from protective immunity.”A better option would be to target viral proteins that don’t switch up and stay pretty much the same regardless of which strain of influenza you’re infected with, says Pardi and Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who also co-led the study.Those proteins include neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein 2, all of which help the virus make copies of itself.Krammer says while there have been efforts over the years to include conserved influenza proteins, such studies have run up against failure and a whole host of hurdles. For example, to measure a potential shot’s effectiveness, scientists look to see whether it triggers an immune response, indicated via the presence of antibodies.“The vaccines that we’re testing these proteins with, they don’t induce those types of antibodies that are used as correlates,” explains Krammer. “So there’s not a lot of confidence during clinical development.”Of the four different types of influenza, A and B primarily infect humans. ShutterstockHow they did it — What has really made the dream of a potent flu shot come alive, says Pardi and Krammer, is messenger RNA (or mRNA) technology, the same used for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccines. It involves taking a piece of genetic code that isn’t capable of altering anyone’s DNA and instructing it to make a particular type of protein that the immune system can then learn to recognize and target.For their influenza vaccine, the researchers created an mRNA cocktail encoding the four influenza proteins neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 2, and the stalk portion of hemagglutinin (which is conserved compared to its head domain).The vaccine was then injected into a group of twenty or so naive mice who had never experienced influenza before. They either got a quadrivalent jab (meaning all four mRNA segments for each protein was present) or monovalent (the conventional flu vaccine or vaccines containing an individual mRNA for any one of the proteins). Some animals received one shot, while others lucked out with one shot plus a booster four weeks later. The mice were then challenged with an assortment of different influenza strains, both that infect humans and other animals like dogs.What they found — There were two important phenomena the researchers noticed. First, while both the quadrivalent and monovalent jabs encouraged antibody production, only the quadrivalent shot protected the mice against the viral challenge, with exception of the monovalent vaccine containing nucleoprotein, which seemed to protect vaxxed mice from death.While antibodies tend to hog the vaccine limelight, immune cells called T cells, which roam the body and kill infected cells, are also crucial in the fight against viruses. Pardi, Krammer, and their colleagues found that the nucleoprotein-specific jab encouraged a class of cytotoxic T cells that studies have found play an important role in protection against severe influenza infection in humans and animal models.On average around five to 20 percent of Americans will get the flu every year. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp drop in the number of flu cases reported. bluecinema/E+/Getty ImagesKrammer says this motley of immune responses to the four different influenza viral proteins suggests it's more powerful to have a colorful vaccine cocktail rather than a drab monotone.“When we mix all of them together, we get the broadest immune response,” he says. “You get the engagement of T cells against the nucleoprotein, you get antibodies, and we get a pretty strong neuraminidase response. That’s kind of the beauty here that you’re flexible in what types of [viral proteins] you use… and you have a lot of possibilities to try [out].”The researchers also expect it wouldn’t need to undergo annual updates as our current ones do. Instead, they might last for a few years.What’s next — While mice studies are the launch point for future studies into other organisms like monkeys and eventually humans, Pardi and Krammer say it’s not clear whether what we see in mice will necessarily translate to us. For one, humans don’t have a naive immune system like the mice used in the study. Our pre-existing immunity against the flu may impact the quality of any potential vaccine’s antibody response, according to some studies.“Clinical trials will be necessary to see how vaccines can overcome the issue with the shortfall from previous immunity,” says Pardi. “Pretty much all adults have antibodies against the flu, and we need to see how our vaccine can overcome this issue.”It may take several years of research and clinical trials before their mRNA influenza vaccine sees the light of day, say Pardi and Krammer. In the meanwhile, there’s no point waiting: Go get your flu shot, dear reader.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In preliminary data from a Phase I trial, a genetically modified version of the herpes virus has shown promise in treating difficult-to-eradicate tumors, with one patient having experienced a complete remission for 15 months so far. Much more research will be needed to confirm the treatment’s early success, however.The viral treatment is known as RP2 and is a genetically engineered strain of herpes simplex 1, the virus responsible for most cases of oral herpes in humans, as well as some cases of genital herpes. Developed by the company Replimune, RP2 is designed to work on two fronts. Injected directly into the tumor, the virus is supposed to selectively infect and kill certain cancer cells. But it also blocks the expression of a protein known as CTLA-4 produced by these cells, and it hijacks their machinery to produce another molecule called GM-CSF. The net result of these cellular changes is to weaken the cancer’s ability to hide from and fend off the immune system.In a Phase I trial conducted by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in the UK, RP2 was given as the only treatment to nine patients with advanced cancers that failed to respond to other therapies; it was also given in combination with another immunotherapy drug to 30 patients. Three patients on RP2 alone appeared to respond to the treatment, meaning their cancers shrank or stopped growing, and seven patients on the combination therapy responded as well. One patient in particular, with a form of carcinoma along his salivary gland, has shown no signs of cancer for at least 15 months after treatment with RP2 alone. There were no life-threatening adverse events reported in the trial, with the most common symptoms post-treatment being fever, chills, and other flu-like illness.AdvertisementThe findings, presented this week at the 2022 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress (ESMO), are preliminary, since they’ve yet to be vetted through the formal peer review process. They’re also based on a very small sample size, meaning that any results should be taken with caution. But Phase I trials aren’t intended to show that a treatment is effective, only that it’s safe enough for humans to take. So the fact that some people with seemingly incurable cancers already appear to be responding to RP2, the team argues, is a very good sign that it can live up to its potential.“Our study shows that a genetically engineered, cancer-killing virus can deliver a one-two punch against tumors—directly destroying cancer cells from within while also calling in the immune system against them,” said lead author Kevin Harrington, professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, in a statement from the organization.Scientists have been hopeful about cancer-fighting viruses for a long time. But it’s only recently that this hope has finally been starting to pay off. In 2015, the first viral therapy was approved in the U.S. for certain advanced cases of melanoma. This May, scientists in California launched a Phase I clinical trial of their anticancer virus, called Vaxinia. Other companies are developing their own candidates, either alone or in combination with other treatments. And Replimune is developing two other candidates based on their modified herpes virus.While many experimental therapies ultimately fail to cross the finish line and reach the public, it’s possible at least some of these viruses could one day become a new standard cancer treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch775,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/sensor-studded-suit-helps-track-recovery-of-stroke-patients/,Sensor studded suit helps track recovery of stroke patients,"Millions of people suffer from strokes every year worldwide, and severe ones can require long-term care — but as with other rehabilitation regimens, it can be hard for doctors to track the everyday activities of their patients. A high-tech suit created by a Dutch grad student may be a powerful new way to help keep better tabs on those in recovery.Bart Klaassen, from the Netherlands’ University of Twente, and the rest of his team pursued it as part of a project resulting from Europe’s FP7 research initiative. Klaassen’s doctoral thesis is based on the work, as well.The idea is that while patients are closely monitored while at the rehabilitation clinic or in regular checkups, real-world tasks such as getting out of bed, navigating the house and cooking can only be reported secondhand.“There has long been a great need for systems like this, but the technology simply was not ready,” explained Klaassen in a news release from the school. But as other projects along these lines have proved, that’s not the case any more: sensors can be made small enough, fabrics smart enough and the resulting data coherent enough that a high-tech suit like this is not only a possibility, but potentially a major advance.The suit, which is worn underneath the clothes for several months, contains 41 sensors that track strength, flexibility, gait and other relevant metrics. They’re collected wirelessly and processed by (at present) university servers.“We have succeeded in modelling all of the relevant movements, and in cleaning up the data that is relevant for the therapist by filtering out the rest,” said Klaassen. “Our project has delivered new techniques and methods that can be used to monitor patients at home for extended periods of time, and to identify any differences with structured clinical measurements.”Presumably the sensors and data could also be used for tracking progress in cases other than those suffering from strokes, but Klaassen’s research is focused on the one domain for now. If it proves useful it could be adapted for use in other forms of physical therapy.The suit isn’t in production or anything right now and there are plenty of questions, from whether it can be made cheaply to whether it can be washed at all — I’ve emailed the university with some questions and will update the post if I hear back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The researchers found no associations with uterine cancer for other hair products that the women reported using, including hair dyes, bleach, highlights, or perms.The study data includes 33,497 U.S. women ages 35-74 participating in the Sister Study, a study led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, that seeks to identify risk factors for breast cancer and other health conditions. The women were followed for almost 11 years and during that time 378 uterine cancer cases were diagnosed.The researchers found that women who reported frequent use of hair straightening products, defined as more than four times in the previous year, were more than twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the products.“We estimated that 1.64% of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70; but for frequent users, that risk goes up to 4.05%,” said Alexandra White, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the new study. “This doubling rate is concerning. However, it is important to put this information into context - uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.”Uterine cancer accounts for about 3% of all new cancer cases but is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system, with 65,950 estimated new cases in 2022. Studies show that incidence rates of uterine cancer have been rising in the United States, particularly among Black women.Approximately 60% of the participants who reported using straighteners in the previous year were self-identified Black women, according to the study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Although, the study did not find that the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer incidence was different by race, the adverse health effects may be greater for Black women due to higher prevalence of use.“Because Black women use hair straightening or relaxer products more frequently and tend to initiate use at earlier ages than other races and ethnicities, these findings may be even more relevant for them,” said Che-Jung Chang, Ph.D., an author on the new study and a research fellow in the NIEHS Epidemiology Branch.The findings are consistent with prior studies showing straighteners can increase the risk of hormone-related cancers in women.The researchers did not collect information on brands or ingredients in the hair products the women used. However, in the paper they note that several chemicals that have been found in straighteners (such as parabens, bisphenol A, metals, and formaldehyde) could be contributing to the increased uterine cancer risk observed. Chemical exposure from hair product use, especially straighteners, could be more concerning than other personal care products due to increased absorption through the scalp which may be exacerbated by burns and lesions caused by straighteners.“To our knowledge this is the first epidemiologic study that examined the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer,” said White. “More research is needed to confirm these findings in different populations, to determine if hair products contribute to health disparities in uterine cancer, and to identify the specific chemicals that may be increasing the risk of cancers in women.”This team previously found that permanent hair dye and straighteners may increase breast and ovarian cancer risk.Grant Numbers: Z01-ES044005, Z1AES103332-01About the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS): NIEHS supports research to understand the effects of the environment on human health and is part of the National Institutes of Health.

The product of the Department of Defense’s Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Innovation Institute, the material can be used in any situation where flexibility and high pressure are the norm.“Basically, we are using a hybrid technology that mixes traditional electronics with flexible, high-performance electronics and new 3-D printing technologies,” said Benjamin J. Leever, Ph.D. “In some cases, we incorporate ‘inks,’ which are based on metals, polymers and organic materials, to tie the system together electronically. With our technology, we can take a razor-thin silicon integrated circuit, a few hundred nanometers thick, and place it on a flexible, bendable or even foldable, plastic-like substrate material.”The team is using liquid gallium alloys injected into the substrate to carry electricity. Because the alloys are never exposed to air you efficiently prevent oxidation. The material can then be “integrated into complex curved surfaces, such as an airplane’s wing, or even a person’s skin.” The team also sees some value in the material for weapons. For example, a slice of this material connected to a bomb could survive the initial impact with a target to control the final payload detonation. In short, it acts as a tough skin and sensor for highly sensitive situations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For years, our understanding of cancer has focused on genetic mutations which permanently change the DNA code. But our research has shown that the way the DNA folds up can change which genes are read without altering the DNA code and this can be very important in determining how cancers behave.""The research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, Human Technopole in Milan, and the Queen Mary University of London.Epigenetic changes are involved in cancer's evolutionIn the first paper, the researchers collected 1,373 samples from 30 bowel cancers and looked at epigenetic changes as cancers grew. Their observations showed that epigenetic changes are common in cancerous cells, are heritable, and were present in cancer cells that had ""survival advantages.""The second paper intended to study why cancer cells within the same tumor can be different from one another. So, the researchers looked at the DNA sequence in diverse samples taken from different parts of the same tumor. The study revealed that less than two percent of ""changes in the DNA code in independent areas of a tumor were associated with changes in gene activity and variation in cancer cell characteristics throughout tumors is often governed by factors other than DNA mutations"".With these studies, scientists were able to track the influence of epigenetic control on the growth and evolution of bowel cancers. They also noted that epigenetic changes are heavily involved in cancer's evolution.""I hope our work will change the way we think about cancer and its treatment – and should ultimately affect the way patients are treated. Genetic testing for cancer mutations only gives us part of the picture about a person’s cancer – and is blind to ‘epigenetic’ changes to how genes are read. By testing for both genetic and epigenetic changes, we could, potentially, much more accurately predict which treatments will work best for a particular person’s cancer,"" said Graham.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch779,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/the-mednet-launches-its-quora-for-cancer-an-online-medical-knowledge-base/,The Mednet launches itsQuora for cancer an online medical knowledge base,"A New York City startup called The Mednet today launched a platform that gives physicians a knowledge-sharing tool that’s as easy to use as Quora, but provides them with expert answers about the latest research in their field. The site has focused, so far, strictly on cancer.Due to rules governing medical information and patients’ privacy, questions posted to The Mednet cannot be case-based. They are situation-based only, meaning doctors don’t share patient info, not even blurred photos.While the startup’s site, theMednet.org, has been in development for about 2.5 years, the company officially launched today and is part of the latest batch of the Y Combinator accelerator. Co-founders Nadine Housri, a radiation oncologist, and her brother CEO Samir Housri told TechCrunch their company has raised some grant funding and equity funding to date, including from YC and The Hope Foundation.Results on the platform have been hope-inspiring so far to Nadine Housri, she said. Cancer experts regularly help each other there to figure out complex issues that will immediately impact their patients. For example, a new study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine came out, and an investigator in that study, Howard Sandler, answered questions about it on The Mednet, helping other doctors decide whether or not to use hormones, along with radiation, to treat a prostate cancer patient.His study had found that adding hormonal therapy to radiation treatment improved the average long-term survival of men with prostate cancer who have had their prostate gland removed. But of course, the science was complicated and the regimen wasn’t recommended for any or every patient.Nadine Housri said when theMednet.org first launched, she wasn’t sure if oncologists, professors, department chairs and other cancer researchers would be too busy to give away their expertise on some new online platform. But, she explained, “Experts are willing to give away info to random people here because they constantly field phone calls, emails and answer questions at medical conferences anyway. One reason you go into academia or medicine is to have a great impact on people, on your community. On Mednet experts can put their answers out there, clear up misconceptions on research and clinical practices.”Like many startups, The Mednet has spent its early years focused on building an expert user community, and becoming a vital resource to users, as well. The Housris said their network will always be accessible for free to doctors, and they want it to serve as a knowledge base for medicine broadly. The company plans to expand beyond oncology over the long run.It is exploring the potential to generate revenue by helping companies raise awareness of and enroll patients in their clinical trials. It could also aggregate some of its expert answers into automated decision support for clinics, the founder said. Depending on its monetization strategy, The Mednet could compete with online resources for physicians like Figure 1 or UpToDate over the long run. But when it comes to medicine, there probably can’t be too many tools to help people get good, up-to-date information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites780,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/07/woman-who-can-smell-parkinsons-helps-scientists-develop-test, Woman who can smell Parkinson shelps scientists develop test,"Scientists have harnessed the power of a woman’s hyper-sensitive sense of smell to develop a test to determine whether people have Parkinson’s disease.The test has been years in the making after academics realised that Joy Milne could smell the condition. The 72-year-old from Perth, Scotland, has a rare condition that gives her a heightened sense of smell.She noticed that her late husband, Les, developed a different odour when he was 33 – 12 years before he was diagnosed with the disease, which leads to parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years.Milne, nicknamed “the woman who can smell Parkinson’s”, described a musky aroma, different from his normal scent.Her observation piqued the interest of scientists who decided to research what she could smell, and whether this could be harnessed to help identify people with the neurological condition.Years later, academics at the University of Manchester have made a breakthrough by developing a test that can identify people with Parkinson’s disease using a simple cotton bud run along the back of the neck.Researchers can examine the sample to identify molecules linked to the disease to help diagnose if someone has it.Though still in the early phases of research, scientists are excited about the prospect of the NHS being able to deploy a simple test for the disease.There is no definitive test for Parkinson’s and diagnosis is based on a patient’s symptoms and medical history.If the skin swab is successful outside laboratory conditions it could be rolled out to achieve faster diagnosis.Milne said it was not acceptable that people with Parkinson’s had such high degrees of neurological damage at the time of diagnosis, adding: “I think it has to be detected far earlier – the same as cancer and diabetes, earlier diagnosis means far more efficient treatment and a better lifestyle for people.“It has been found that exercise and change of diet can make a phenomenal difference.”She said her husband, a former doctor, was determined to find the right researcher to examine the link between odour and Parkinson’s and they sought out Dr Tilo Kunath at the University of Edinburgh in 2012.Kunath paired up with Prof Perdita Barran to examine Milne’s sense of smell.The scientists believed that the scent may be caused by a chemical change in skin oil, known as sebum, that is triggered by the disease.In their preliminary work they asked Milne to smell T-shirts worn by people who had Parkinson’s and those who did not. She correctly identified the T-shirts worn by Parkinson’s patients but also said that one from the group of people without Parkinson’s smelled like the disease – eight months later that individual was diagnosed with the disease.Researchers hoped the finding could lead to a test being developed to detect Parkinson’s, working under the assumption that if they were able to identify a unique chemical signature in the skin linked to the disease, they may eventually be able to diagnose it from simple skin swabs.In 2019, researchers at the University of Manchester, led by Barran, announced they had identified molecules linked to the disease found in skin swabs. The scientists have now developed a test using this information.The tests have been successfully conducted in research labs and scientists are assessing whether they can be used in hospital settings. If successful, the test could potentially be used in the NHS so GPs can refer patients for Parkinson’s tests.Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some molecules are present only in people who have Parkinson’s.Researchers compared swabs from 79 people with Parkinson’s with a healthy control group of 71 people.Barran said: “At the moment, there are no cures for Parkinson’s but a confirmatory diagnostic would allow them to get the right treatment and get the drugs that will help to alleviate their symptoms.“There would also be non-pharmaceutical interventions, including movement and also nutritional classes, which can really help. And I think most critically, it will allow them to have a confirmed diagnosis to actually know what’s wrong with them.”She added: “What we are now doing is seeing if (hospital laboratories) can do what we’ve done in a research lab in a hospital lab. Once that’s happened then we want to see if we can make this a confirmatory diagnostic that could be used along with the referral process from a GP to a consultant.“At the moment in Greater Manchester there are about 18,000 people waiting for a neurological consult and just to clear that list, without any new people joining it, will take up to two years. Of those 10-15% are suspect Parkinson’s.“Our test would be able to tell them whether they did or whether they didn’t (have Parkinson’s) and allow them to be referred to the right specialist. So at the moment, we’re talking about being able to refer people in a timely manner to the right specialism and that will be transformative.”Milne is working with scientists around the world to see if she can smell other diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis (TB).“I have to go shopping very early or very late because of people’s perfumes, I can’t go into the chemical aisle in the supermarket,” she said.“So yes, a curse sometimes but I have also been out to Tanzania and have done research on TB and research on cancer in the US – just preliminary work. So it is a curse and a benefit.”She said she can sometimes smell people who have Parkinson’s while in the supermarket or walking down the street but has been told by medical ethicists she cannot tell them.“Which GP would accept a man or a woman walking in saying ‘the woman who smells Parkinson’s has told me I have it’? Maybe in the future but not now.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it is important to note that although everyone in this study was hospitalized, vaccinated individuals were less likely to be severely ill or die, suggesting that you are likely to have far less severe consequences if vaccinated,” said Dr. Annette Regan, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health assistant professor of epidemiology and lead author of the peer-reviewed research, published in the October edition of The Lancet Infectious Diseases. “This is an important point, especially in light of the upcoming influenza season coupled with ongoing COVID-19 activity, both this season and into the future.”Globally, influenza contributes to 9.5 million hospitalizations, 81.5 million hospital days, and 145,000 deaths each year. Vaccination offers the best method of preventing influenza illness, reducing illness in the general population by 40–60%, experts say.Specifically, The Lancet analysis found that three groups routinely targeted for influenza vaccination experiences less severe illness. Children who had received only part of their first series of influenza vaccines had 36% lower chances of being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and children who had fully completed their first series of influenza vaccines had 48% lower chances of admission to ICU compared to unvaccinated children, the researchers found.The study – “Severity of influenza illness associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among hospitalized patients in four South American countries” – is the product of an international team of researchers from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay, and drew on data from all four South American countries over a period of seven years. Data were obtained through the Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean, influenza (REVELAC-i) which is coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).“Although several studies have reported drops in influenza illness following influenza vaccination, the results have focused predominantly on adults in the United States, and this study aimed to evaluate the severity of influenza illness by vaccination status in a broad range of age groups, and across multiple South American countries,” said Dr. Marta Von Horoch, a co-author who serves as coordinator of the National Immunization Program in Paraguay. “We were very pleased to work with our partners in the U.S. and across the continent, and these findings demonstrate, quite clearly, the importance of influenza vaccination for children and adults, no matter where they live.”The study – the first-ever on this scale in South America - examined influenza-related hospitalization rates and outcomes across all four countries from 2013-19. Specifically, the analysts reviewed the outcomes for some 2,747 patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza virus infection, in three age groups – children aged 6–24 months, adults aged 18–64 years, and adults aged 65 years or older.Given the reality that vaccination rates have fallen, in the U.S. and globally during the COVID-19 pandemic, including among children, the findings should help make clear the benefits of timely, pro-active immunization campaigns to the public, the researchers said.“With influenza season approaching this winter and influenza vaccines now available, these results highlight the importance of getting vaccinated for flu for anyone six months of age or older – as CDC recommends,” Regan said. “It is critical that healthcare providers and the public understand the risks of missing out on vaccinations – it is so much better to prevent a serious illness than to suffer through it, for the patient and everyone in their community.”===================================================",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chan School of Public Health.“Before our study, research on how political ideology affects COVID-19 looked solely at voters’ political lean; we expanded on that research to investigate associations of COVID-19 outcomes with the voting records of federal elected representatives and the concentration of political party power at the state level. The point is not partisan analysis, but rather to understand how politics, and political polarization, are affecting population health,” said Nancy Krieger, professor of social epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and corresponding author of the study.The study was published online in the Lancet Regional Health – Americas on November 1, 2022.Little prior research had looked at COVID-19 health outcomes in relation to U.S. congressional districts. The researchers analyzed data on COVID-19 mortality rates and stress on ICU capacity from April 2021 to March 2022, a period when adult vaccines were available, across all 435 U.S. Congressional districts. They examined three exposure variables that had not been used previously in COVID-19 research: the political ideology of U.S. elected members of Congress, as measured by their overall voting records; their votes on four key COVID-19 relief bills; and “state trifectas,” the concentration of political power at the State level, defined as the governor, House, and Senate, all under the control of one party.The study found that the higher the exposure to conservatism on each political metric, the higher the COVID-19 age-standardized mortality rates, even after adjusting for the district’s social characteristics, voters’ political lean, and vaccination rates. The same relationship held true for stress on hospital ICU capacity.For COVID-19 mortality rates, for example, models controlling for political and social metrics and vaccination rates showed that Republican trifectas were, respectively, 11% higher and conservative voter political lean 26% higher.“Our study offers new approaches to analyzing political determinants of COVID-19 metrics—such as mortality, illness, or vaccination rates—as one component of analyzing political accountability for populations’ COVID-19 burdens. It also points to the importance of analyzing political metrics in relation to population health outcomes more generally,” said Krieger.There was no funding for the study from any agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sector.“Relationship of political ideology of US federal and state elected officials and key COVID pandemic outcomes following vaccine rollout to adults: April 2021-March 2022,” Nancy Krieger, Christian Testa, Jarvis T.

In the laboratory, the researchers proved that these substances cause tumors in mice. The finding was published in the journal Science on October 28.A human being has more bacterial cells (38 trillion) than human cells (30 trillion). However, defecation can reverse the proportion in favor of human cells. Through this act, in which a third of the microbes in the colon is expelled, the person ceases to be numerically bacterial and becomes fully human. Most of these microorganisms are harmless, or even beneficial, but some can cause illness, explains Noah Palm, lead author of the study, and it is possible that the indolimines have an effect on colorectal cancer. However, much more work will be needed to prove that they are indeed the cause.More information Scientists transplant human neurons into rats and modify their behaviorThe lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 1 in 23 in men and 1 in 25 in women, according to data from European tumor registries. The usual risk factors are age, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and a diet low in fruit and high in processed meats. Having an inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, increases the risk as well.Palm’s team developed a new technique that allows for the simultaneous study of a hundred types of microbes and their products. The researchers detected the (previously unknown) indolimines in strains of Morganella morganii in people with inflammatory diseases. However, even though there is a larger amount of this bacterium in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer, it is also present in seemingly healthy people. Even the epithelial cells of the intestines of healthy individuals show some mutations that can be caused by toxins from these communities of microorganisms, such as indolimines, explains Palm.Morganella morganii, which measures one thousandth of a millimeter, is commonly found in water, soil and the intestines of mammals. It is usually a benign microbe, but it is also associated with urinary tract infections.Spanish biotechnologist Cayetano Pleguezuelos and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute in the Netherlands were the first to show the direct connection between the bacteria that live in the human digestive system and the genetic alterations that cause the development of cancer. The researchers saw that a specific strain of Escherichia coli produces a toxic molecule called colibactin which damages the DNA of human cells. This was confirmed in miniature versions of intestinal tissue generated in the laboratory. Their discovery was published in the journal Nature on February 27, 2020, while the human race had its attention on another microorganism: a coronavirus that was spreading around the world from China.Pleguezuelos applauds the new work, but suggests prudence. “Our intestinal microbiota is very complex, with many different species of bacteria, and among them there are mutualistic relationships, symbiosis, negative competition… and there are many other parameters. Bacteria can produce these toxic compounds in humans but, for some reason, they may not be able to reach the epithelial cells of the intestine and damage the DNA. These factors are not seen in experiments with mice,” he warns.The Spanish researcher believes that the new Yale University technique “opens the door to evaluating a large number of bacteria and their ability to damage DNA.” A person that weighs 70 kilos has about 46 kilos of human cells, according to a study carried out by a team from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The heaviest ones are muscle and fat cells. The 38 trillion bacteria only weigh about 200 grams, but they make up an extremely complex universe. “Their ability to carry out different enzymatic reactions is immense. And we don’t know most things,” says Pleguezuelos.The Spanish biotechnologist explains that every agent that damages human DNA causes a specific pattern of mutations called a mutational signature. Pleguezuelos and his colleagues identified the mutational signature of the harmful strains of the Escherichia coli and found this characteristic trace in more than 5% of the colorectal cancer patients that were analyzed, compared to 0.1% detected in other types of tumors. Of course, that figure must be taken with a grain of salt – pending further studies in other populations – but it gives an idea of the magnitude of the problem: 5% of the two million annual cases means 100,000 colorectal cancer patients with the mutational signature of these harmful strains of Escherichia coli.Doctor Palm points out that most cases of colorectal cancer occur in people who have no family history. Therefore, environmental factors, including the microbiome, play a key role in most colorectal cancer cases. However, he explains, it is still impossible to calculate the relative importance of the microbiome against other environmental factors.Although currently there are no specific treatments to prevent DNA damage induced by the microbiome, treatments could be developed to neutralize, or even eliminate, these toxin-producing microbes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These screenings would let individuals know their risk of stroke and heart attack without the need for blood tests or even blood pressure measurements.“This AI tool could let someone know in 60 seconds or less their level of risk,” the lead author of the study, Alicja Rudnicka, told The Guardian. The study found that the predictions were as accurate as those produced by current tests.“The eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body.”The software works by analyzing the web of blood vessels contained within the retina of the eye. It measures the total area covered by these arteries and veins, as well as their width and “tortuosity” (how bendy they are). All these factors are affected by an individual’s heart health, allowing the software to make predictions about a subject’s risk from heart disease just by looking at a non-invasive snapshot of their eye.“The study adds to a growing body of knowledge that the eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body,” Pearse Keane, a researcher in ophthalmology and AI analysis not connected to the study, told The Verge. “Doctors have known for more than a hundred years that you could look in the eye and see signs of diabetes and high blood pressure. But the problem was manual assessment: the manual delineation of the vessels by human experts.” The use of machine learning, says Keane, can overcome this challenge.Using AI to diagnose disease from eye scans has proven to be one of the fastest-developing fields of machine learning medicine. The first ever AI diagnostic device approved by the FDA was used to screen for eye disease, and research suggests AI can detect a range of ailments in this way, from diabetic retinopathy to Alzheimer’s (Keane’s own area of research). Tools applying these findings are in various stages of development, but questions do remain about the reliability and universality of their diagnoses.The researcher named their software QUARTZ. Image: Rudnicka et alThis recent study, carried out by a team from St George’s, University of London, was only tested on the eye scans of white patients, for example. The team sourced their test data from the UK Biobank, a database that happens to be 94.6 percent white (reflecting the UK’s own demographics in age range of patients included in the BioBank). Such biases would have to be balanced in the future to ensure any diagnostic tool is equally accurate for different ethnicities.The researchers compared the results from their software, named QUARTZ (an inventive acronym derived from the phrase “QUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessels Topology and siZe”) with 10-year risk predictions produced by the standard Framingham Risk Score test (FRS). They found the two methods had “comparable performance.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites785,https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/967916,New Omicron subvariant largely evades neutralizing antibodies,"A study at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that the coronavirus variant BA.2.75.2, an Omicron sublineage, largely evades neutralizing antibodies in the blood and is resistant to several monoclonal antibody antiviral treatments. The findings, published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggest a risk of increased SARS-CoV-2 infections this winter, unless the new updated bivalent vaccines help to boost immunity in the population.“While antibody immunity is not completely gone, BA.2.75.2 exhibited far more dramatic resistance than variants we’ve previously studied, largely driven by two mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein,” says the study’s corresponding author Ben Murrell, assistant professor at the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet.The study shows that antibodies in random serum samples from 75 blood donors in Stockholm were approximately only one-sixth as effective at neutralizing BA.2.75.2 compared with the now-dominant variant BA.5. The serum samples were collected at three time points: In November last year before the emergence of Omicron, in April after a large wave of infections in the country, and at the end of August to early September after the BA.5 variant became dominant.Only one of the clinically available monoclonal antibody treatments that were tested, bebtelovimab, was able to potently neutralize the new variant, according to the study. Monoclonal antibodies are used as antiviral treatments for people at high risk of developing severe COVID-19.BA.2.75.2 is a mutated version of another Omicron variant, BA.2.75. Since it was first discovered earlier this fall, it has spread to several countries but so far represents only a minority of registered cases.“We now know that this is just one of a constellation of emerging variants with similar mutations that will likely come to dominate in the near future,” Ben Murrell says, adding “we should expect infections to increase this winter.”Some questions remain. It is unclear whether these new variants will drive an increase in hospitalization rates. Also, while current vaccines have, in general, had a protective effect against severe disease for Omicron infections, there is not yet data showing the degree to which the updated COVID vaccines provide protection from these new variants. “We expect them to be beneficial, but we don’t yet know by how much,” Ben Murrell says.The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerland and Imperial College London in the U.K.Funding was provided by SciLifeLab, the Erling-Persson Foundation, the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

By using a personalized cancer vaccine, the patient's immune system can be prepared to generate a mutation-specific anti-tumor response.Moderna's mRNA-4517/V940 is designed to generate Tcell responses based on the mutational signature of the tumor in the patient. T cells are a type of white blood cell that are tasked with defending the body in the event of an infection.Merck's KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that targets the PD-1 protein that cells can use to evade detection by T cells. Since both healthy as well as cancerous cells use this mechanism to evade T cell attack, using KEYTRUDA even puts healthy cells in the firing line.In combination with Moderna's vaccine, the treatment can aim to specifically target tumor cells.KEYNOTE-942 trialMerck's KEYTRUDA is currently being used in over 1,600 trials across a wide range of cancers. Through these trials, Merck is trying to understand the various factors that might affect the effectiveness of the treatment in patients.KEYNOTE 942 is one such trial studying the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in high-risk melanoma patients. Currently, in Phase 2, the trial has enrolled 157 patients who have been randomized into two groups following the surgical removal of their tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting today, the platform will let doctors and nurses apply for verified provider labels and showcase their videos on special healthcare carousels in search results.The announcement was made on Thursday by YouTube’s global head of health Dr. Garth Graham, who pointed out in a blog post that this is the first time the platform will extend its health product features to individual healthcare providers. Previously, the features were available to organizations like universities and government agencies. YouTube has historically struggled to rein in medical misinformation, most recently during the pandemic, and has been criticized for dragging its feet on implementing fixes for the problem.AdvertisementAt the moment, only individuals in the U.S. and Germany will be able to apply to be YouTube Health Sources, although YouTube stated that the company hopes to be able to open up the process to more countries and regions in the future.“This is a big step towards helping people more easily find and connect with content that comes from the extraordinary community of healthcare creators on YouTube–the smart, dedicated and creative folks who are transforming the ways that we share medical information,” Graham said in a YouTube blog post.The company’s global head of health pointed to channels helmed by licensed individuals that provide helpful health content on the platform, such as Doctor Mike, a family doctor who debunks medical myths, and Doctor Ali, a psychologist who makes easily accessible videos on mental health.AdvertisementWhat will qualify someone to be a YouTube Health Source? According to the platform’s support page, the application process is open to licensed doctors, nurses, registered nurses, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, and licensed clinical social workers. All applicants must be licensed, YouTube notes, adding that third-party partner LegitScript will be in charge of coordinating license verification by working with licensing bodies like the Federation of State Medical Boards in the U.S.Besides obtaining license verification, YouTube states that channels must follow its monetization policies, even if it’s not monetizing content. Applicants must also have more than 2,000 valid public watch hours in the past 12 months and primarily focus on covering health information. Finally, individuals interested in being a Health Source must have no active community guidelines strikes.AdvertisementGetting accepted doesn’t mean that you’ll be a YouTube Health Source forever, though. On its support page, the platform points out that channels are periodically reassessed and may lose access to YouTube health features if the company finds they no longer meet the criteria.Interested individuals can apply here. YouTube states that it will review applicants’ channels and get back to them with an answer in within one or two months. Individuals who are accepted may start getting access to the features in early 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites788,https://www.technologynetworks.com/cancer-research/news/new-report-shows-decline-in-us-cancer-deaths-continues-367025,New Report Shows Decline in US Cancer Deaths Continues,"The latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer has provided an update on the most recent statistics and trends in cancer cases and deaths in the United States. This year’s report, published in Cancer, also places focus on pancreatic cancer.Knowledge in the fight against cancerCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is expected that the number of new cancer cases globally will grow to 27.5 million, with 16.3 million cancer deaths, by 2040. Breast, lung, colon and prostate cancers are the four most common cancers worldwide, accounting for approximately 40% of all new cases collectively.In the US, annual reports on the statistical trends in cancer cases have been published since 1998 as part of a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR).These reports examine a plethora of data, analyzing trends in cancer incidence, mortality and survival by cancer type, sex, age and racial/ethnic groups.The current report combined information about race and ethnicity to create five mutually exclusive groups: non‐Hispanic White (White), non‐Hispanic Black (Black), non‐Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), non‐Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and Hispanic (of any race).Additionally, data for the various groups analyzed in the current report were collected at time points ranging from 2001–2019 – therefore, it is important to note that all data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic.Cancer incidence ratesOverall incidence rates per 100,000 individuals were 497 for males and 431 for females from 2014–2018.API and Black males had the lowest and highest incidence rates among men, respectively, and API and AI/AN females also had the lowest and highest rates respectively for women.However, incidence varied across 18 of the most common cancer types included in this report:For males – incidence rates for three of these cancers increased (including pancreas and kidney), seven were stable (including prostate) and eight decreased (including lung and larynx).For females – incidence rates of seven cancers increased (including melanoma, liver and breast), four cancers were stable (including uterine) and seven decreased (including thyroid and ovary).Additionally, for breast cancer – the most common cancer among adolescents and young adults (15–39 years of age) – the incidence rate increased by 1.0% per year on average between 2010 and 2018.Mortality ratesCombining data from males and females showed that the decline in overall death rates from cancer steepened from 2001 to 2019, decreasing by 2.1% per year. Similar trends in overall death rates were also observed in each of the racial/ethnic groups analyzed in the report.Data from adolescents and young adults showed a decrease in death rates by 3% per year between 2001 and 2005, however, this rate of decline slowed to around 0.9% per year thereafter.Racial and ethnic disparitiesThe report also highlighted racial and ethnic disparities, in both the incidence rates (2014–2018) and death rates (2015–2019) across many cancer types, as summarized in the table below.Type of cancer Incidence and death rates Bladder cancer In White, Black, ApI and Hispanic males, incidence of bladder cancer decreased. Incidence increased among AI/ AN males. Uterine cancer Incidence rates remained stable in White females but increased in every other racial/ethnic group. Lung, breast and colon cancer Incidence rates decreased for females in all racial/ethnic groups. For AI/ AN females, death rates for breast cancer increased but remained stable for colon cancer. Breast cancer death rates remained stable among API females. Prostate cancer Death rates decreased for API, AI/AN and Hispanic males. Rates remained stable for Black and White males.Lisa C. Richardson MD, director of the CDC’s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, elaborated on these findings in a press release: “Factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status should not play a role in people’s ability to be healthy or determine how long they live. [The] CDC works with its public health partners – within and outside the government – to address these disparities and advance health equity through a range of key initiatives, including programs, research and policy initiatives. We know that we can meet this challenge together and create an America where people are free of cancer.”A special focus on pancreatic cancerThe pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach which produces enzymes that help digest food, as well as hormones like insulin and glucagon that regulate our blood sugar levels.Cancer of the pancreas is commonly diagnosed once it is already in its advanced stages – early pancreatic cancers often have vague symptoms or even none at all. For these reasons, the combined five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is just 5–10%.In the current report, the researchers explain that diagnoses of pancreatic cancer account for around 3% of new cancer cases – however, it also accounts for 8% of cancer deaths.Nevertheless, the report also highlights significant steps forward for the survival rates of certain types of pancreatic cancer. Between 2001 and 2017, one-year relative survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors increased from 65.9% to 84.2%, and there was also an increase from 24% to 36.7% for patients with adenocarcinomas.“Pancreatic cancer incidence and survival reflect both the underlying risk of disease as well as the difficulty of diagnosing pancreatic cancer at a treatable stage,” said Betsy A. Kohler, M.P.H, NAACCR executive director. “As advancements in screening technology and effective treatments for early-stage disease become available, we are hopeful for greater improvements in pancreatic cancer survival, which historically has been a particularly lethal cancer type.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch789,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/10/mawi-patch/,Mawi launches a patch to track your heart health faster and in real time,"If you’ve ever had the misfortune of needing continuous EKG monitoring, you’ve probably used a Holter monitor. It’s like carrying a 1980s walkman made of metal with a bunch of wires going from it to your chest. If that sounds uncomfortable, and as if you won’t sleep or enjoy showers much for the two weeks you need to carry it around, you’ve neatly stumbled across the use case for the Mawi Heart Patch. The company just released its product, a two-lead cardiac monitor that can be read in real time.There are consumer-grade products that can do EKG readings, including the Withings ScanWatch (and its fancier-looking sibling, the ScanWatch Horizon), and there are other patches on the market, such as the Zio patch, but Mawi claims to have done something unique, and suggests that its Heart Patch is the first ever single-use, two-lead cardiac monitor to reach the market.The company describes it as “a stick-and-go, wireless solution” and further suggests that the disposable nature of the device is a benefit; it means that cardiologists can run tests on as many patients as they need to without having to wait for reusable Holter monitors to come back from other patients and get sanitized and maintained between uses.“Holter monitors aren’t great,” Andrew Klymenko, the CEO of Mawi, says drily in an interview we did last week, and explains that the existing solutions are prone to dislodging, peeling and causing allergic reactions, thus restricting monitoring time. As a result, Mawi claims that more than 50% of arrhythmias go undetected. Equally bad: patients have to wait up to a month to receive the results.Mawi Heart Patch, the company claims, can be applied in under a minute, and you can live like normal as you wear it.“Patients can shower, sleep, work out,” says Klymenko, and highlights that it’s possible to wear the patch and live all aspects of life as normal. “Sex is a big and important part of life, and patients can have sex as normal when wearing the Mawi patch.”“Cardiovascular diseases pose the greatest risk to our long-term health and are the leading cause of death globally. With a lack of or ineffective monitoring often proving critical, many of these deaths can be avoided with the right preventative measures,” Klymenko said. “Too often, sufferers do not realize the severity of their symptoms before it’s too late. Many patients that use the Mawi Heart Patch look healthy, exercise daily and show no signs of disease, yet have a potentially lethal heart condition. We’re on a mission to prevent the heart’s ‘silent killers,’ and we’re already working with like-minded clinics that are seeing amazing results.”The patch connects to a smartphone device in the doctor’s office. That device pipes the data through to the cloud, where an AI analyzes the results and highlights anything unusual for the cardiologists to take a closer look at. The process is very quick indeed, meaning that patients can have feedback and next steps for their treatment.“In less than 24 hours [the doctors] have a very detailed, precise and actionable report,” says Klymenko, suggesting that doctors can focus on treatment, rather than having to spend a lot of time analyzing data. “It takes just two seconds to manage.”The company currently has around 30 staff, primarily concentrated in Europe. Klymenko himself is from Ukraine, and his team is spread across the world, including teams in Thailand and in the U.S. To date, the company has been bootstrapped.Mawi won’t share exactly how many devices it has in the field, but Klymenko admits they are shipping “thousands of devices” every month, to customers across the U.S., the EU, and the Middle East.The devices need to be prescribed by a doctor, and pricing is heavily dependent on whatever medical insurance and what medical care system you are operating on, but Klymenko says that the devices typically cost “under $250 per study.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites790,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/health/ghost-heart-life-itself-wellness/index.html, Ghost heart Built from the scaffolding of a pig and the patient s cellsthis cardiac breakthrough may soon be ready for transplant into humans,"CNN —The first time molecular biologist Doris Taylor saw heart stem cells beat in unison in a petri dish, she was spellbound.“It actually changed my life,” said Taylor, who directed regenerative medicine research at Texas Heart Institute in Houston until 2020. “I said to myself, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s life.’ I wanted to figure out the how and why, and re-create that to save lives.”That goal has become reality. On Wednesday at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN, Taylor showed the audience the scaffolding of a pig’s heart infused with human stem cells – creating a viable, beating human heart the body will not reject. Why? Because it’s made from that person’s own tissues.“Now we can truly imagine building a personalized human heart, taking heart transplants from an emergency procedure where you’re so sick, to a planned procedure,” Taylor told the audience.“That reduces your risk by eliminating the need for (antirejection) drugs, by using your own cells to build that heart it reduces the cost … and you aren’t in the hospital as often so it improves your quality of life,” she said.Debuting on stage with her was BAB, a robot Taylor painstakingly taught to inject stem cells into the chambers of ghost hearts inside a sterile environment. As the audience at Life Itself watched BAB functioning in a sterile environment, Taylor showed videos of the pearly white mass called a “ghost heart” begin to pinken.Video Ad Feedback Can we grow a personalized human heart? 24:16 - Source: CNN“It’s the first shot at truly curing the number one killer of men, women and children worldwide – heart disease. And then I want to make it available to everyone,” said Taylor to audience applause.“She never gave up,” said Michael Golway, lead inventor of BAB and president and CEO of Advanced Solutions, which designs and creates platforms for building human tissues.“At any point, Dr. Taylor could have easily said ‘I’m done, this just isn’t going to work. But she persisted for years, fighting setbacks to find the right type of cells in the right quantities and right conditions to enable those cells to be happy and grow.”Giving birth to a heartTaylor’s fascination with growing hearts began in 1998, when she was part of a team at Duke University that injected cells into a rabbit’s failed heart, creating new heart muscle. As trials began in humans, however, the process was hit or miss.“We were putting cells into damaged or scarred regions of the heart and hoping that would overcome the existing damage,” she told CNN. “I started thinking: What if we could get rid of that bad environment and rebuild the house?”Taylor’s first success came in 2008 when she and a team at the University of Minnesota washed the cells out of a rat’s heart and began to work with the translucent skeleton left behind.Soon, she graduated to using pig’s hearts, due to their anatomical similarity to human hearts.“We took a pig’s heart, and we washed out all the cells with a gentle baby shampoo,” she said. “What was left was an extracellular matrix, a transparent framework we called the ‘ghost heart.’“Then we infused blood vessel cells and let them grow on the matrix for a couple of weeks,” Taylor said. “That built a way to feed the cells we were going to add because we’d reestablished the blood vessels to the heart.”The next step was to begin injecting the immature stem cells into the different regions of the scaffold, “and then we had to teach the cells how to grow up.”“We must electrically stimulate them, like a pacemaker, but very gently at first, until they get stronger and stronger. First, cells in one spot will twitch, then cells in another spot twitch, but they aren’t together,” Taylor said. “Over time they start connecting to each other in the matrix and by about a month, they start beating together as a heart. And let me tell you, it’s a ‘wow’ moment!”This ""ghost heart,"" created by using the scaffolding of a pig's heart and injected it with human stem cells, may soon be ready for human clinical trials. Advanced Solutions Life SciencesBut that’s not the end of the “mothering” Taylor and her team had to do. Now she must nurture the emerging heart by giving it a blood pressure and teaching it to pump.“We fill the heart chambers with artificial blood and let the heart cells squeeze against it. But we must help them with electrical pumps, or they will die,” she explained.The cells are also fed oxygen from artificial lungs. In the early days all of these steps had to be monitored and coordinated by hand 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Taylor said.“The heart has to eat every day, and until we built the pieces that made it possible to electronically monitor the hearts someone had to do it person – and it didn’t matter if it was Christmas or New Year’s Day or your birthday,” she said. “It’s taken extraordinary groups of people who have worked with me over the years to make this happen.”But once Taylor and her team saw the results of their parenting, any sacrifices they made became insignificant, “because then the beauty happens, the magic,” she said.“We’ve injected the same type of cells everywhere in the heart, so they all started off alike,” Taylor said. “But now when we look in the left ventricle, we find left ventricle heart cells. If we look in the atrium, they look like atrial heart cells, and if we look in the right ventricle, they are right ventricle heart cells,” she said.“So over time they’ve developed based on where they find themselves and grown up to work together and become a heart. Nature is amazing, isn’t she?”Billions and billions of stem cellsAs her creation came to life, Taylor began to dream about a day when her prototypical hearts could be mass produced for the thousands of people on transplant lists, many of whom die while waiting. But how do you scale a heart?“I realized that for every gram of heart tissue we built, we needed a billion heart cells,” Taylor said. “That meant for an adult-sized human heart we would need up to 400 billion individual cells. Now, most labs work with a million or so cells, and heart cells don’t divide, which left us with the dilemma: Where will these cells come from?”The answer arrived when Japanese biomedical researcher Dr. Shinya Yamanaka discovered human adult skin cells could be reprogrammed to behave like embryonic or “pluripotent” stem cells, capable of developing into any cell in the body. The 2007 discovery won the scientist a Nobel Prize, and his “induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS),” soon became known as “Yamanaka factors.”“Now for the first time we could take blood, bone marrow or skin from a person and grow cells from that individual that could turn into heart cells,” Taylor said. “But the scale was still huge: We needed tens of billions of cells. It took us another 10 years to develop the techniques to do that.”The solution? A bee-like honeycomb of fiber, with thousands of microscopic holes where the cells could attach and be nourished.“The fiber soaks up the nutrients just like a coffee filter, the cells have access to food all around them and that lets them grow in much larger numbers. We can go from about 50 million cells to a billion cells in a week,” Taylor said. “But we need 40 billion or 50 billion or 100 billion, so part of our science over the last few years has been scaling up the number of cells we can grow.”Another issue: Each heart needed a pristine environment free of contaminants for each step of the process. Every time an intervention had to be done, she and her team ran the risk of opening the heart up to infection – and death.“Do you know how long it takes to inject 350 billion cells by hand?” Taylor asked the Life Itself audience. “What if you touch something? You just contaminated the whole heart.”Once her lab suffered an electrical malfunction and all of the hearts died. Taylor and her team were nearly inconsolable.“When something happens to one of these hearts, it’s devastating to all of us,” Taylor said. “And this is going to sound weird coming from a scientist, but I had to learn to bolster my own heart emotionally, mentally, spiritually and physically to get through this process.”Dr. Doris Taylor (left) is teaching BAB the robot how to properly inject stem cells into a ghost heart. Advanced Solutions Life SciencesEnter BAB, short for BioAssemblyBot, and an “uber-sterile” cradle created by Advance Solutions that could hold the heart and transport it between each step of the process while preserving a germ-free environment. Taylor has now taught BAB the specific process of injecting the cells she has painstakingly developed over the last decade.“When Dr. Taylor is injecting cells, it has taken her years to figure out where to inject, how much pressure to put on the syringe, and the best speed and pace to add the cells,” said BAB’s creator Golway.“A robot can do that quickly and precisely. And as we know, no two hearts are the same, so BAB can use ultrasound to see inside the vascular pathway of that specific heart, where Dr. Taylor is working blind, so to speak,” Golway added. “It’s exhilarating to watch – there are times where the hair on the back of my neck literally stands up.”Taylor left academia in 2020 and is currently working with private investors to bring her creation to the masses. If transplants into humans in upcoming clinical trials are successful, Taylor’s personalized hybrid hearts could be used to save thousands of lives around the world.In the US alone, some 3,500 people were on the heart transplant waiting list in 2021.“That’s not counting the people who never make it on the list, due to their age or heath,” Taylor said. “If you’re a small woman, if you’re an underrepresented minority, if you’re a child, the chances of getting an organ that matches your body are low.If you do get a heart, many people get sick or otherwise lose their new heart within a decade. We can reduce cost, we can increase access, and we can decrease side effects. It’s a win-win-win.”Taylor can even envision a day when people bank their own stem cells at a young age, taking them out of storage when needed to grow a heart – and one day even a lung, liver or kidney.“Say they have heart disease in their family,” she said. “We can plan ahead: Grow their cells to the numbers we need and freeze them, then when they are diagnosed with heart failure pull a scaffold off the shelf and build the heart within two months.“I’m just humbled and privileged to do this work, and proud of where we are,” she added. “The technology is ready. I hope everyone is going to be along with us for the ride because this is game-changing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio either to receive an invitation to undergo a single screening colonoscopy (the invited group) or to receive no invitation or screening (the usual-care group). The primary end points were the risks of colorectal cancer and related death, and the secondary end point was death from any cause.ResultsFollow-up data were available for 84,585 participants in Poland, Norway, and Sweden — 28,220 in the invited group, 11,843 of whom (42.0%) underwent screening, and 56,365 in the usual-care group. A total of 15 participants had major bleeding after polyp removal. No perforations or screening-related deaths occurred within 30 days after colonoscopy. During a median follow-up of 10 years, 259 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the invited group as compared with 622 cases in the usual-care group. In intention-to-screen analyses, the risk of colorectal cancer at 10 years was 0.98% in the invited group and 1.20% in the usual-care group, a risk reduction of 18% (risk ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.93). The risk of death from colorectal cancer was 0.28% in the invited group and 0.31% in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.16). The number needed to invite to undergo screening to prevent one case of colorectal cancer was 455 (95% CI, 270 to 1429). The risk of death from any cause was 11.03% in the invited group and 11.04% in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.04).ConclusionsIn this randomized trial, the risk of colorectal cancer at 10 years was lower among participants who were invited to undergo screening colonoscopy than among those who were assigned to no screening.

techcrunch792,https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/zeits-early-warning-wearable-for-sleep-strokes-could-save-hours-and-lives/,Zeit s early warning wearable for sleep strokes could save hours and lives,"Those at risk are always vigilant for the signs of a stroke in progress, but no one can be vigilant when they’re sleeping, meaning thousands of people suffer “wake-up strokes” that are only identified hours after the fact. Zeit Medical’s brain-monitoring wearable could help raise the alarm and get people to the hospital fast enough to mitigate the stroke’s damage and potentially save lives.A few decades ago, there wasn’t much anyone could do to help a stroke victim. But an effective medication entered use in the ’90s, and a little later a surgical procedure was also pioneered — but both need to be administered within a few hours of the stroke’s onset.Orestis Vardoulis and Urs Naber started Zeit (“time”) after seeing the resources being put toward reducing the delay between a 911 call regarding a stroke and the victim getting the therapy needed. The company is part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 cohort.“It used to be that you couldn’t do anything, but suddenly it really mattered how fast you got to the hospital,” said Naber. “As soon as the stroke hits you, your brain starts dying, so time is the most crucial thing. People have spent millions shrinking the time between the 911 call and transport, and from the hospital door to treatment. but no one is addressing those hours that happen before the 911 call — so we realized that’s where we need to innovate.”If only the stroke could be identified before the person even realizes it’s happening, they and others could be alerted and off to the hospital long before an ambulance would normally be called. As it turns out, there’s another situation where this needs to happen: in the OR.Surgeons and nurses performing operations obviously monitor the patient’s vitals closely and have learned to identify the signs of an impending stroke from the EEG monitoring their brainwaves.“There are specific patterns that people are trained to catch with their eyes. We learned from the best neurologists out there how they process this data visually, and we built a tool to detect that automatically,” said Vardoulis. “This clinical experience really helped, because they assisted in defining features within the signal that helped us accelerate the process of deciding what is important and what is not.”The team created a soft, wearable headband with a compact EEG built in that monitors the relevant signals from the brain. This data is sent to a smartphone app for analysis by a machine learning model trained on the aforementioned patterns, and if anything is detected, an alarm is sent to the user and pre-specified caregivers. It can also be set to automatically call 911.“The vast majority of the data we have analyzed comes out of the OR,” said Vardoulis, where it can immediately be checked against the ground truth. “We saw that we have an algorithm that can robustly capture the onset of events in the OR with zero false positives.”That should translate well to the home, they say, where there are actually fewer complicating variables. To test that, they’re working with a group of high-risk people who have already had one stroke; the months immediately following a stroke or related event (there are various clinically differentiated categories) is a dangerous one when second events are common.“Right now we have a research kit that we’re shipping to individuals involved in our studies that has the headband and phone. Users are wearing it every night,” said Vardoulis. “We’re preparing for a path that will allow us to go commercial at some point in 2023. We’re working with he FDA to define the clinical proof needed to get this clear.”They’ve earned a “Breakthrough Device” classification, which (like stroke rehabilitation company BrainQ) puts them in position to move forward quickly with testing and certification.“We’re going to start in the U.S., but we see a need globally,” said Naber. “There are countries where aging is even more prevalent and the support structure for disability care is even less.” The device could significantly lower the risk and cost of at-home and disability care for many people who might otherwise have to regularly visit the hospital.The plan for now is to continue to gather data and partners until they can set up a large-scale study, which will almost certainly be required to move the device from direct-to-consumer to reimbursable (i.e., covered by insurance). And although they are totally focused on strokes for the present, the method could be adapted to watching for other neurological conditions.“We hope to see a future where everyone with a stroke risk is issued this device,” said Vardoulis. “We really do see this as the missing puzzle piece in the stroke care continuum.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research is ongoing, though, and a project at the University of Ghent shows promise not just in advancing the technology but providing some therapeutic value, as well.Herbert De Smet’s group has been working for some time with EU grant money on initial applications and executions of smart lenses, and some early results were presented at IEEE’s International Electron Devices Meeting this week. Their device embeds a tiny monochrome LCD in the lens that can be set to varying opacities and patterns.Now, these patterns would be far too close to the eye for you to make them out, except perhaps as smudges or dark areas in your vision. They’re not intended to form images, however, but rather to darken the entire field of view for people who can’t do it themselves.Some people suffer from conditions that limit the ability of their eye’s iris — that’s the colored circle — to contract and dilate the pupil and control the amount of light admitted to reach the retina. If the pupil is stuck in the open state, bright situations — normally handled by reducing the pupil to a pinhole — will overwhelm the iris and cause pain or even serious damage.A contact lens that automatically changes its shade from totally transparent to as dark as a pair of sunglasses, as required by the ambient light, would fill this role nicely. That’s exactly what De Smet’s team has created; head over to IEEE Spectrum for a video of the LCD in action.The parts are in place: the LCD-infused lens and the chip that controls it are solid, and the power system, a set of tiny photovoltaic cells, captures enough energy — but the two have yet to be integrated. Once they are, the lenses will still, of course, need to be tested for safety.You can keep up with De Smet’s work at the Centre for Microsystems Technology’s webpage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA)New type of pacemaker is a safer, more advanced option than traditional surgeryThis March, Dr. Kent Nilsson successfully implanted one of the first wireless, dual chamber pacemakers in the world into a patient. This accomplishment makes Piedmont Hospital the first center in the Southeast and fourth in the U.S. to implant this new device. It was only the 32nd implant in a human in the world.A cardiologist at Piedmont Athens Regional Hospital and professor of medicine at the Augusta University/University of Georgia Medical Partnership, Nilsson has become an expert in implanting single chamber, wireless pacemakers. He was called upon again to test the dual chamber version as part of the clinical trial for the Abbott Aveir DR Leadless (wireless) Pacemaker System.The dual chamber wireless pacemaker is honestly one of the most transformative technologies in cardiology. Ever.” —Dr. Kent NilssonWith this procedure, the hospital joined the ranks of leading medical centers and universities in the country. The three locations ahead of Piedmont for the implantation were the University of Arizona, Cleveland Clinic and Cornell University.“The dual chamber wireless pacemaker is honestly one of the most transformative technologies in cardiology. Ever,” said Nilsson. “When the dual chamber launches, it will completely change the field.”How does a pacemaker work?A pacemaker is a device implanted into the chest to stabilize an irregular or slowly beating heart. A traditional pacemaker is inserted through an incision in the chest and is then connected to wires (leads) that have been inserted into the heart through the subclavian vein. The device sits beneath the skin and on top of the chest muscle, and the wires deliver electrical pulses to correct the heartbeat.In 2014, Piedmont joined a clinical trial to test single chamber leadless – or wireless – pacemakers, which are put directly into the lower right ventricle of the heart via the femoral vein and do not require the chest to be opened for implantation. Nilsson gladly came on board for the trial.Piedmont was the first center in Georgia and 15th in the country to implant a wireless pacemaker. By the time the 2014 trial for the single wireless pacemaker was complete, Nilsson had implanted over 30 devices.Although traditional pacemakers have come a long way (the first implantation in 1958 failed within three hours and the patient went on to have 26 pacemakers in his lifetime), Nilsson said this wireless technology is the biggest advancement in the field since the invention.Benefits of wireless pacemakersThe wireless pacemaker is about 90% smaller than the average pacemaker and the surgery lasts around 30 minutes. The battery life is also comparable with a traditional pacemaker’s 10-12 years and could be longer in some cases.Patients also will not have an incision scar on the chest or a bump protruding from the skin.“The psychological aspect of not seeing an incision or having something protruding out of your skin is beneficial,” said Nilsson. “Just being able to not broadcast to the world that there is something wrong.”Another advantage is the elimination of several complications associated with traditional pacemakers. One in 10 patients see complications with pacemaker leads, or wires. Some also experience pocket infections, hematoma, lead dislodgment and lead fracture.Wireless pacemaker patients will also see a shorter, less complicated recovery time. There are no restrictions with taking showers or getting the area wet, and there are also no mobility issues. Traditional pacemaker patients are not able to move their arm above their shoulder for six weeks after surgery.“It’s same day discharge and people are up and moving around and doing everything they need to do,” said Nilsson.The single chamber wireless pacemaker was approved by the FDA in 2016, and Nilsson is now teaching other physicians how to implant the device.“I’m one of 10 proctors teaching close to 5,000 physicians how to implant,” said Nilsson. “The reception nationwide has been overwhelming. Every day my Twitter is blowing up with pictures of people doing their first single chamber implant.”Single chamber pacemakers connect to one chamber of the heart while the dual chamber version connects to both chambers on the right side of the heart. Dual chamber pacemakers are the standard of care for pacemaker patients in the United States, so this new technology will affect more patients than the single chamber version.“Dual chambers are 95% of what we do,” said Nilsson.First implant of the new deviceNilsson kicked off the first dual implantation of the dual chamber, wireless pacemaker in March with a meaningful milestone. “Almost eight years to the day after we implanted the single chamber, we put in the dual chamber,” he said.Sixty-four-year-old Anna McKuhen was Nilsson’s first patient. She was the first in the Southeast to have the dual chamber pacemaker implanted.“I am all about new technology, so when they asked if I’d like to be a part of this trial, I said sure. It sounded exciting,” said McKuhen. “The technology amazes me.”McKuhen said she was interested in receiving the wireless pacemaker, in part, because of the greatly reduced recovery time.“My recovery was fantastic,” said McKuhen. “I did not have any problems whatsoever. I was only confined to a week of not lifting heavy objects. I’ve had zero problems.”Nilsson implanted four dual pacemakers by the time the trial concluded in September.Nilsson hopes the dual chamber will be FDA approved in 2023 and widely available soon after.“I would say this is the future of pacemakers 100 percent,” said Nilsson. “Everyone is trying to catch up at this point. This is really transformative technology.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But today’s ultrasound imaging technology is large and technical, so it’s only available in healthcare facilities and must be operated by highly trained technicians. Plus, patients, who take time out of their schedules to go to an appointment, have to be covered in a sticky gel.Now, researchers say they’ve developed an innovative solution to some of these challenges. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have unveiled a new adhesive ultrasound patch that’s about the size of a postage stamp and can provide continuous imaging of the body’s inner workings for up to 48 hours. The scientists shared their new technology in a paper published last week in the journal Science.“We believe we’ve opened a new era of wearable imaging,” says Xuanhe Zhao, a mechanical engineer at MIT and one of the study’s authors, in a statement. “With a few patches on your body, you could see your internal organs.”In the past, engineers developing wearable ultrasound technologies have run into issues with image quality and flexibility, but the new MIT stickers seem to have struck the right balance. To create the small devices, which are about three millimeters thick and two square centimeters in size, engineers combined rigid transducers with a stretchy, sticky layer that encapsulates a layer of water-based hydrogel.The researchers put the stickers to the test by placing them on various body parts of healthy volunteers, including their neck, abdomen, arms and chest. Then, they asked the volunteers to move their bodies in various ways, including drinking juice, jogging, lifting weights, biking, sitting and standing.Not only did the stickers adhere to the volunteers’ skin, but they also produced clear images of their internal organs and major blood vessels for up to 48 hours. The patches allowed the researchers to watch volunteers’ stomachs expand, then shrink, when they drank juice. They could observe major blood vessels changing sizes when a volunteer was sitting versus standing, and witness the heart change shape while pumping blood during exercise.For now, the stickers must be connected to instruments to make sense of the data they’ve gathered. But in the near future, the scientists hope to refine their design so that the stickers can operate wirelessly, communicating with a patient’s smart phone for real-time, on-demand imaging.“We are working hard on the wireless version,” Zhao tells the Guardian’s Ian Sample. “Because there are already wireless point-of-care handhold ultrasounds, we are confident that we will be able to achieve the wireless version in a few years.”Already, researchers are dreaming up all the ways the stickers could be useful. Patients could wear them at home to help monitor an array of medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. In hospitals, they could free up medical technicians for other tasks or make it possible to obtain ultrasound images in healthcare facilities with staffing issues.Recommended Videos“You don’t need a trained sonographer and you don’t need a huge ultrasound machine,” says Philip Tan, an electrical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin, to New Scientist ’s Jeremy Hsu. “You could deploy it to very low-resource communities.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvements in health care, sanitation, diet, and education over the past century have markedly increased life expectancy, but this has not been paralleled by concomitant increases in healthy life expectancy. Increasing healthspan, which is the time spent free of major illness or disease, is therefore an important priority worldwide. The UK Government, for example, has pledged to increase the healthy life expectancy of the UK population by an extra 5 years by 2035 without increasing inequality. Achieving this goal would simultaneously improve individual quality of life, increase productivity, and boost national wealth. Notably, a gain of just one additional healthy year is predicted to be worth US$38 trillion to the USA.However, a 2021 review of national progress in the UK towards this goal revealed that policy makers have little confidence that healthy life expectancy can be markedly improved either through focusing on technological solutions (which promote independence but not health) or on diet and exercise regimes (which are often out of reach of those who would most benefit, because of socioeconomic inequalities).2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select CommitteeAgeing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. 3 López-Otín CBlasco MAPartridge LSerrano MKroemer G The hallmarks of aging. 4 Fraser HCKuan VJohnen Ret al.

The same reviewrevealed a general lack of awareness and scrutiny of the potential offered for improving health in later life by ameliorating the ageing process itself. This unawareness is alarming when set against the backdrop of a quiet research revolution in biogerontology that has seen the identification of some key hallmarks of ageing,evidence that these hallmarks and underlying mechanisms independently predict the emergence of age-related diseases in real patients,and positive outcomes from preclinical and early-stage human clinical trials based on targeting ageing mechanisms.Humanity stands on the threshold of being able to prevent multimorbidity and age-associated diseases by addressing the underlying biology of ageing; parallels with the era of antibiotics do not seem unduly hyperbolic.7 WHODecade of healthy ageing: baseline report. 8 Cox LSBellantuono ILord JMet al. Tackling immunosenescence to improve COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine response in older adults. Ignorance of these developments carries appalling costs, which have been, and will continue to be, borne by older people unless the situation changes. For example, the UK's 2017 Healthy Ageing Grand Challenge specifically excluded biomedical science research from its funding remit, and the extensive Decade of Healthy Ageing: baseline report,by WHO (2021), fails to mention these advances, or even the word biology, focussing instead on socioeconomic determinants of health and overcoming ageism. Given that hallmark ageing mechanisms cause the progressive failure of innate and adaptive immunity, it is a fascinating counterfactual to consider how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic would have been handled had it been preceded by a sustained international effort to target immune senescence and enhance later life immune function.The need to avoid such mistakes in the future is patent, as are the triple economic benefits (lower health and social care costs, greater economic activity of older adults, and investment into new industries) that will accompany efforts in this area.2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select CommitteeAgeing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. 9 Cox LS The economic and scientific case for therapeutic intervention in ageing. It is perhaps the perceived complexity of ageing biology that has dissuaded policy makers from directly tackling it. As a result, academic research on ageing in many parts of the globe is fragmented and siloed,and driven by funding models and professional metrics that reward specialisation and disease-specific focus. However, the biological mechanisms that cause ageing must be a central focus if integrational and intersectional approaches aimed at improving lifelong health figure ) are to be truly effective.Figure UK Research and Innovation-funded ageing networks addressing ageing processes across the life course Show full caption 8 Cox LSBellantuono ILord JMet al.

This breadth allows the networks to identify interventions appropriate for different stages of the life course, with a shift in focus from disease-preventive approaches in early life and mid-life through to more intense clinical monitoring and interventions in older adults, including development and testing of new geroprotective and gerotherapeutic medicines, such as senolytic drugs.A multiscale, multisystem, and whole of life course approach to improve healthy life expectancy can be achieved by drawing these broad research disciplines together through a core focus on hallmarks that underlie the biology of ageing and drive age-related disease.AGENTS=Ageing and Nutrient Sensing network.

It is therefore hugely exciting that the diversity and complexity of ageing across the life course has now been recognised in a national initiative by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and Medical Research Council of UK Research and Innovation (the national government-sponsored research funder). Launched in March, 2022,the UK Ageing Network comprises 11 new research networks addressing core aspects of ageing biology and health in a national macro network, drawing together ageing research across systems and scales ( figure ). These networks aim to enable knowledge exchange and research beyond the narrow focus of individual research projects and academic disciplines, drawing from the social sciences, humanities, economics, and biomedical and physical sciences, as well as bringing in expertise from industry, biotechnology, the third sector, and policy makers; membership is open and non-prescriptive, and interested individuals and organisations are encouraged to join . Importantly, the networks also include the voice of those with the lived experience of ageing, to enable relevant co-design of future research strategies, together with health practitioners and clinical trialists to ensure that promising interventions can be taken forward from the laboratory into patients. Through workshops, training programmes, grassroots events, and research pump priming, the networks will not only enable integration of expertise and cross-disciplinary working to generate new knowledge and provide solutions to ageing problems, they also aim to build ageing research capacity, enticing researchers from all career stages and disciplines in academia and beyond to embrace ageing research. Dissemination of new findings and development of new training materials for a range of audiences, including clinical practitioners and policy makers, is also key to the networks’ goals, to ensure that actionable findings from ageing research are rapidly adopted into policy and practice.Initially funded for 2 years, positive outcomes from the networks should drive investment to sustain and grow them, with expansion to include colleagues from around the world. We therefore welcome input, suggestions, and support from all who wish to contribute to improve health across the life course and work towards the goal of substantially extending healthy life expectancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites797,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/non-invasive-blood-glucose-measurement-wearables-breakthrough/,Sensor breakthrough brings us closer to blood glucose monitoring on wearables,"Blood glucose monitoring is touted to be the next big breakthrough for wearable devices like the Apple Watch. However, the hardware is yet to be seen on a commercially available, mass-market device. That might change soon.A team from Georgia’s Kennesaw State University claims to have developed a noninvasive system of blood glucose level measurement, thanks to a device called GlucoCheck. It follows the same fundamental approach as the oxygen-level analysis sensor on smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 5.Team lead Maria Valero, an assistant professor at the institution’s College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE), notes that the device delivers 90% accuracy in analyzing glucose concentration in blood samples. The biosensor works in tandem with a phone application, but the team is already at work on integrating Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant.GlucoCheck shines light across the human skin, and then a camera captures the view from the other side. The goal is to study the varying level of light absorption by blood flowing in the vessels to determine the glucose concentration.The team has already filed a patent for the tech and now aims to test it on more body types to diversify the test data. This step is of critical importance, because commercially available wearables like those made by Fitbit and even Apple are known to be inaccurate at reading data from people with dark or tattoed skin types.The latest development is remarkable because it achieves the holy grail of glucose-level monitoring, which is to develop a noninvasive method that can be miniaturized and connected to devices such as phones. Currently, people with diabetes need to prick their fingers to obtain a blood sample to analyze their sugar levels.Commercial players are also at itThis is not the first research of its kind. In July 2020, Samsung showcased a noninvasive method for blood glucose monitoring in partnership with experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The same year, Movano revealed a wearable device that can measure blood sugar levels using a light diffusion method. But it didn’t do much else.A year later, a Japanese company named Quantum Operation showcased a wearable-mounted sensor at CES 2021 that was capable of noninvasive blood glucose analysis. According to multiple reports that have surfaced over the past couple of years, both Apple and Samsung are interested in the promising tech for their smartwatches.Quantum Operation Non-Invasive Blood GlucometerU.K.-based Rockley Photonics is also working toward the same objective, but instead of LEDs, the company is focused more on laser-based analysis. Regarding the in-house tech, CEO Dr. Andrew Rickman told Digital Trends that it “collects incredibly rich data that we extract to measure, amongst other things, hydration, lactate, and blood pressure.”Notably, Apple is said to be one of the biggest clients of Rockley Photonics and is rumored to include the noninvasive blood glucose monitoring tech on the Apple Watch portfolio in the near future.Editors' Recommendations",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites798,https://newatlas.com/medical/cancer-metastasis-breakthrough-rethink/,Cambridge cancer breakthrough may prompt rethink of metastasis,"Cancer’s ability to spread through the body is one of its most devastating tricks. Scientists at Cambridge have now identified a protein that plays a key role in metastasis, which not only hints at a new potential treatment but reveals for the first time that this process isn’t unique to cancer.No matter where in the body it originates, cancer can eventually begin to colonize other organs and tissues through a process known as metastasis, which makes it much harder to treat. Unfortunately, there’s still much about metastasis that scientists don’t understand, but ongoing research is continually uncovering mechanisms that could lead to new therapy options.In the new study, Cambridge scientists discovered not just a new mechanism for metastasis, but completely recontextualized its role. It’s long been thought that metastasis was an abnormal process that arises in cancer, but the new study found that it’s a process used by healthy cells as well – cancer just hijacks it for its own purposes.The team made the discovery while investigating a cellular structure known as sodium leak channel, non-selective (NALCN). These channels are located on cell membranes and control how salt goes in and out of the cell. In the new study, the researchers found that NALCN also regulates the release of cells from tissues into the bloodstream, where they can be taken up by other organs and tissues.In tests in mice, the scientists blocked the function of the NALCN protein, and found that it triggered metastasis in stomach, intestinal and pancreatic cancers. That suggests this could be a new target for preventing metastasis, potentially improving outcomes for patients with cancer.But the most surprising discovery came when the team tested the technique in mice without cancer. Blocking NALCN also caused healthy cells to migrate away from their original organs to other ones – pancreatic cells, for instance, moved to the kidney and became healthy kidney cells instead.“These findings are among the most important to have come out of my lab for three decades,” said Professor Richard Gilbertson, Group Leader of the study. “Not only have we identified one of the elusive drivers of metastasis, but we have also turned a commonly held understanding of this on its head, showing how cancer hijacks processes in healthy cells for its own gains. If validated through further research, this could have far-reaching implications for how we prevent cancer from spreading and allow us to manipulate this process to repair damaged organs.”The team now plans to investigate ways to take advantage of this discovery to prevent metastasis, including repurposing existing drugs.The research was published in the journal Nature Genetics.Source: University of Cambridge",,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the results of the study, the Apple Watch Series 6 is able to “reliably detect states of reduced blood oxygen saturation” in comparison to medical-grade pulse oximeters. Here’s how the study came to determine this…How reliable is the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor?As spotted by MyHealthyApple, the study was published this month in the Digital Health open access journal. The objective of the study was to investigate “how a commercially available smartwatch that measures peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) can detect hypoxemia compared to a medical-grade pulse oximeter.”For the study, researchers recruited 24 healthy participants. Each person wore an Apple Watch Series 6 on their left wrist and a pulse oximeter sensor on their left middle finger (the Masimo Radical-7).The participants breathed via a breathing circuit with a three-way non-rebreathing valve in three phases. First, in the 2-minute initial stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air. Then in the 5-minute desaturation phase, the participants breathed the oxygen-reduced gas mixture (12% O 2 ), which temporarily reduced their blood oxygen saturation. In the final stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air again until SpO 2 returned to normal values. Measurements of SpO 2 were taken from the smartwatch and the pulse oximeter simultaneously in 30-s intervals.The study resulted in 642 individual pairs of blood oxygen measurements:The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%-100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%.As such, the researchers conclude:The bias in SpO 2 between the smartwatch and the oximeter was 0.0% for all the data points. The bias for SpO 2 less than 90% was 1.2%. The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%–100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%.Apple first added blood oxygen measurement support to the Apple Watch Series 6. It’s also a feature on the newest Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra.

other news sites800,https://www.freethink.com/technology/minimally-invasive-surgery,Robotic surgery is a game changer for minimally invasive surgery,"Once the stuff of science fiction, robotic surgery is now used in hospitals across the world for a wide variety of procedures. Across several common procedures, some research has found that robotic surgery can improve outcomes in areas such as blood loss, complications, and recovery times, compared to open and some laparoscopic surgeries.Robotic procedures have been game changers in minimally invasive care, and innovative surgical systems have been crucial. Robotic surgery isn’t performed by a machine; a specially trained surgeon uses advanced medical technology to streamline the surgical process. The end goal is to increase safety, reduce complications, and improve patient outcomes. By reducing surgical trauma and increasing precision, robotic surgery can help pave the way for predictable, reproducible results.Although robotic surgery has made impressive advances over the past two decades, there is much more to be done. As minimally invasive care continues to advance, researchers are finding new ways to help surgeons do more for patients.How robotic surgery worksThe first commercially viable robotic surgical system was developed in the late 1990s by Intuitive. Intuitive’s systems have gone on to become the most advanced and widely used in the world. Four generations of its pioneering da Vinci system have so far been used in more than 10 million procedures.Intuitive’s robotic surgical systems enable surgeons to use a console, precisely guiding surgical instruments inside the patient’s body. The surgeon’s hand movements are translated in real time to the instruments, which are situated on a cart beside the patient. The instruments are small, nimble, and have a greater range of motion than the human wrist and hand, helping to enable surgical precision in moments that matter.In contrast to open surgery, which typically requires a large incision, robotic surgery involves one or more very small incisions to insert the robotic arms. One of the arms has a camera that feeds high-quality 3D video to the surgeon’s console.“I remember distinctly when I first sat at the console,” says Tanuja Damani, a general surgeon at New York University who first began using the da Vinci system in 2011. “I realized right away that this was the future of surgery. But there was tremendous skepticism early on.”Dr. Damani and other early adopters saw the potential of this approach. Their vision, perseverance, and mentoring have smoothed the way for those who have followed.Take Amanda Pysher, a young bariatric and general surgeon with Surgical Consultants of Northern Virginia, who was first introduced to robotics during her residency and fellowship. Unlike Dr. Damani, Dr. Pysher has benefited from a robust network of mentors, who’ve helped her as she’s learned the ropes of using the da Vinci system. She’s become so comfortable with the system that three years ago she focused her practice on robotic surgery. She now mentors other surgeons who are in the process of learning robotic surgery.“I think it has been easier for me to transition to robotics than the first adopters years ago,” she says. “It’s one of the reasons I feel so strongly about mentoring. I want to be able to give back and help others the way that the mentors above me helped me. We’re helping people live longer for their families and their friends. I just can’t think of any other surgery which has a bigger impact than that.”Robotic surgery’s impact on patientsFor both Dr. Pysher and Dr. Damani, the goal is to do more for their patients. One such patient is Jennifer Luebke. Last year, after struggling with her weight for decades, Luebke decided to have a robotic bariatric surgery with Dr. Pysher.That decision stemmed largely from her sense that her weight increased her long-term health risks. “I want to be able to grow old and be a grandmother, and I really didn’t see that in my future,” Luebke says. “I really was concerned. This is the one thing that has completely changed my life.”As an emergency room nurse, Luebke was reluctant to undergo traditional open bariatric surgery – she’d seen patients who’d had to deal with complications. But as her weight increased and her health problems grew, she decided that robotic surgery might reduce the risk of complications.Her decision paid off. After the procedure, she spent the night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning.As the technology continues to advance, more and more surgeons and hospitals are coming on board.The number of worldwide robotic procedures more than doubled between 2012 to 2020. A study published two years ago in JAMA Network Open analyzed records from 73 hospitals in Michigan, finding that 8.7 percent of surgeons performed robotic general surgery in 2012; by 2018, that number had jumped to over 35 percent.“We are turning the skeptics into believers,” Dr. Damani says. “The shared sense of purpose of the robotics surgery community now is something that is so refreshing.”Total da Vinci Practice**Total da Vinci Practice refers to the transferable value of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci system across procedures in a surgeon’s minimally invasive practice. It is at the surgeon’s discretion to determine when a patient is a candidate for minimally invasive surgery and whether robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci system is an option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch801,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/07/flyfeed-angel-round/,FlyFeed flies in the face of the global food crisis,"FlyFeed claims it signed more than $10 million worth of contracts and closed a $3 million round of investment to launch its first insect farm in Vietnam, in its push to produce low-cost, high-nutrient protein for human consumption.The company was founded less than a year ago and is targeting the three billion people who are facing food insecurity due to climate and global financial shifts. The production process uses organic leftovers as food for the black soldier fly (BSF) insects, which significantly reduces the final price of manufactured protein. As a bonus, it also helps reduce local food waste issues.“Five billion dollars invested in agtech in 2021 shows that the fragile global food chain, relying on exhaustible natural resources, faces new challenges and needs a change. In this case, insect proteins are an effective solution that can transform inedible resources into nutritious proteins. Supported by laboratory tests and approved by local authorities, we will open 10 farms in Asia and Africa by 2026 and contribute to solving the global food shortage crisis,” says Arseniy Olkhovskiy, CEO and founder of FlyFeed, in an interview with TechCrunch. “There are many things I find wrong with the world, but the fact that global hunger still exists is the most absurd. There are more than three billion people who cannot afford healthy food, and almost one billion live in food insecurity. The worst part is that this number continues to rise. Until we rethink our food chain, this won’t change because conservative agriculture isn’t designed to feed a growing population.”In the first instance, the insects will be used for animal feed and pet food, with future plans to include turning the insects into flour that can be used for human food in five years or so. The plan is for the first farm in Vietnam to produce 17.5+ thousand tons of insect products per year, including insect fat, protein flour and fertilizers, and process 40+ thousand tons of organic leftovers for BSF feed, gathered and processed for free by a partnership with local authorities.The $3 million angel round will be used to establish operations, further develop technological solutions and construct the first industrial-sized farm in Vietnam in 2023, producing affordable proteins, oils and fertilizers from insects.“With personal money invested and this seed round, we’ve been able to build an infrastructure that unlocks our scale. Our production technology was developed by our specialists and world-class engineering teams, we secured resources in Vietnam for construction and operations, we signed over $10 million in pre-contracts to verify demand and validate our product development strategy, and we built an A-class team and advisory board to support the company,” says Olkhovskiy. “FlyFeed’s goal is to feed 250 million people annually, providing nutritious and wholesome food to those who don’t have access to it or can’t afford it. This means 250 million more people can live healthier and happier lives and focus on what matters to them. And all of these while helping nature instead of harming it and providing other companies producing food with sustainable nutrients and fertilizers.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After peaking in 2014 at 10 percent, the trend has been decreasing, especially since China stopped accepting the West's plastic waste in 2018.Virgin production — of non-recycled plastic, that is — meanwhile is rapidly rising as the petrochemical industry expands, lowering costs.""Industry groups and big corporations have been pushing for recycling as a solution,"" Greenpeace USA campaigner Lisa Ramsden told AFP.""By doing that, they have shirked all responsibility"" for ensuring that recycling actually works, she added. She named Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestle as prime offenders.According to Greenpeace USA's survey, only two types of plastic are widely accepted at the nation's 375 material recovery facilities.The first is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used in water and soda bottles; and the second is high density polyethylene (HDPE), seen in milk jugs, shampoo bottles and cleaning product containers. These are numbered ""1"" and ""2"" according to a standardized system in which there are seven plastic types.But being recyclable in theory doesn't mean products are being recycled in practice.The report found that PET and HDPE products had actual reprocessing rates of 20.9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively — both down slightly from Greenpeace USA's last survey in 2020.Plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" — including children's toys, plastic bags, produce wrappings, yogurt and margarine tubs, coffee cups and to-go food containers — were reprocessed at rates of less than five percent.Despite often carrying the recycling symbol on their labels, products that use plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" fail to meet the Federal Trade Commission classification of recyclable.This is because recycling facilities for these types aren't available to a ""substantial majority"" of the population, defined as 60 percent, and because the collected products are not being used in the manufacturing or assembly of new items.According to the report, there were five main reasons why plastic recycling is a ""failed concept.""First, plastic waste is generated in vast quantities and is extremely difficult to collect — as becomes clear during what the report called ineffective ""volunteer cleanup stunts"" funded by nonprofits such as ""Keep America Beautiful.""Second, even if it were all collected, mixed plastic waste cannot be recycled together, and it would be ""functionally impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of consumer plastic waste produced each year,"" the report said.Third, the recycling process itself is environmentally harmful, exposing workers to toxic chemicals and itself generating microplastics.Fourth, recycled plastic carries toxicity risks through contamination with other plastic types in collection bins, preventing it from becoming food-grade material again.Fifth and finally, the process of recycling is prohibitively expensive.""New plastic directly competes with recycled plastic, and it's far cheaper to produce and of higher quality,"" said the report.Ramsden called on corporations to support a Global Plastics Treaty, which United Nations members agreed to create in February, and move toward refill and reuse strategies.""This isn't actually a new concept — it's how the milkman used to be, it's how Coca-Cola used to get its beverages to people. They would drink their beverage, give the glass bottle back, and it would be sanitized and reused,"" she said.Some countries are leading the way, including India, which recently banned 19 single-use plastic items. Austria has set reuse targets of 25 percent by 2025 and at least 30 percent by 2030 for beverage packaging, while Portugal has also set the 30 percent by 2030 goal. Chile is moving to phase out single-use cutlery and mandating refillable bottles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites803,https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/avoiding-extinction-some-asian-animals-found-thriving-near-humans,Avoiding extinctionSome Asian animals found thriving near humans,"Media releaseThe University of QueenslandSome of Asia’s largest animals, including tigers and elephants, are defying 12,000 years of extinction trends by thriving alongside humans, a University of Queensland-led study has revealed.Researchers scoured paleontological records to compare the historic distribution of Asia’s 14 largest species with their populations in present-day tropical forests.PhD candidate Zachary Amir, from UQ’s School of Biological Sciences and the Ecological Cascades Lab, said four species – tigers, Asian elephants, wild boars and clouded leopards – showed increased populations in areas with human infrastructure.“These results show that, under the right conditions, some large animals can live nearby humans and avoid extinction,” Mr Amir said.“These results challenge the narrative within some conservation circles that humans and megafauna are incompatible.“Globally there is a trend towards ‘trophic downgrading’, a term referring to the disproportionate loss of the world’s largest animals.“Trophic downgrading is usually worst near humans because hunters target larger species.“But in the case of tigers, elephants, wild boars and clouded leopards, their Asian populations are higher nearby humans.“This may be the outcome of tougher anti-poaching efforts in the national parks that are closer to human settlements and are more frequently visited by tourists.”The study also found deforestation was still impacting species, and clouded leopard numbers in particular experienced a strong decline in those areas.But, Mr Amir said the research showed that if the large animal species were not hunted, they could live in relatively small habitats and near humans.“Previously, there have only been a few examples of large Asian species thriving in small habitats near humans, notably in Mumbai, India where leopards in an urban park prey on stray dogs,” Mr Amir said referring to a prior UQ study.“Thankfully, we found that a wider range of animals can coexist with humans.”At one of their study sites in Singapore, where poaching has been eliminated and there are considerable forest restoration efforts, two large animal species are thriving again.“Singapore has actually experienced the natural re-wilding of sambar deer and wild boars, which are now frequently observed in an urban forest, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve,” Mr Amir said.“If we replicate those protection efforts in larger forests and other counties, we may see positive impacts right around the world.“But before this can happen, humans need to get our act together and limit poaching.”While there are some positive results, UQ’s Dr Matthew Luskin said the study also noted strong declines in tapirs, Sumatran rhinoceros, sun bears, guar and other large animals.“The key innovation of this work was to systematically investigate the population trends of many different wildlife species across the region,” Dr Luskin said.“Then we tested if all species showed consistent trends and if similar parks retained similar species.“Remarkably, we found no two forests currently possess the same group of wildlife compared to thousands of years ago.”Dr Luskin said the research offered an opportunity to shape the future of nature.“These results provide hope for wildlife in forests previously considered too far degraded or too close to cities,” he said.“Now we’re exploring new conservation strategies for these surprising places.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

His previous projects, LayWoo-d3 and Laybrick, are two non-warping plastics that offer wood and brick-like consistencies when extruded. Oddly, LayWoo-d3 actually smells like wood when printed.Now he’s created a bendable printing filament called BENDLAY that is 91% transparent and remains “bendable” after printing.One of the problems with ABS plastic is that it can split and warp as it is formed and it isn’t quite food safe. It is also very brittle and will “whiten” when bent, resulting in a messy final object. This filament is made of stretchy Butadiene, a form of synthetic rubber. It is foodsafe and can be used for clear bottles and containers and works well for flexible straps.While ABS can be used to create flexible items like bracelets, this material will truly bend without breaking, allowing for hinges and other mechanical parts to be built into other, stiffer parts.It costs $42 a roll, which is about right for a pound or so of 3mm filament, and comes on 750 gram rolls. It should work with almost any extruder-based device but, sadly, doesn’t smell like fresh rubber.via 3DPrintingIndustry",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups — the robots can even identify the brands on packaging.So far, AMP’s robots have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.In January, before the pandemic began, AMP Robotics worked with its investor, Sidewalk Labs on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits.Working with the building and a waste hauler, Sidewalk Labs transported the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics. Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how they’re doing in their recycling efforts.Sidewalk says that the tips were communicated through email, an online portal and signage throughout the building every two weeks over a three-month period.For residents, it was an opportunity to have a better handle on what they can and can’t recycle and Sidewalk Labs is betting the information will help residents improve their habits. And for folks who don’t want their trash to be monitored and sorted, they could opt out of the program.Recyclers like Waste Connections should welcome the commercialization of robots tackling industry problems. Their once-stable business has been turned on its head by trade wars and low unemployment. About two years ago, China decided it would no longer serve as the world’s garbage dump and put strict standards in place for the kinds of raw materials it would be willing to receive from other countries. The result has been higher costs at recycling facilities, which actually are now required to sort their garbage more effectively.At the same time, low unemployment rates are putting the squeeze on labor availability at facilities where humans are basically required to hand-sort garbage into recyclable materials and trash.AMP Robotics is backed by Sequoia Capital, BV, Closed Loop Partners, Congruent Ventures and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, a spin-out from Alphabet that invests in technologies and new infrastructure projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company has started doing drone deliveries to select Intermountain Healthcare patients in the Salt Lake Valley area. For now, it can only do drops for local communities within several miles of its distribution center. Zipline intends to add more centers over the next five years, though, so it can eventually expand beyond Salt Lake Valley and deliver medicine throughout Utah.As TechCrunch notes, Zipline has long been deploying drones for delivery in Africa, and it wasn't until the pandemic that it started doing drops in the US. In 2020, it teamed up with Novant Health to ferry personal protective gear and other types of medical equipment to frontline healthcare workers tending to COVID-19 patients in North Carolina. Later that year, it signed a deal with Walmart to deliver health and wellness supplies to customers near the retailer's headquarters in northwest Arkansas.In June this year, the FAA authorized Zipline to conduct long range on-demand commercial drone deliveries in the US. The company said that the certification it received from the agency allows it to significantly expand its services in the country.

""A key benefit (of a cyborg insect) is that when it comes to an insect's movements, the insect is causing itself to move, so the electricity required is nowhere near as much.""[1/5] A Madagascar hissing cockroach, mounted with a ""backpack"" of electronics and a solar cell that enable remote control of its movement, is pictured during a photo opportunity at the Thin-Film Device Laboratory of Japanese research institution Riken in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, Japan September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 1 2 3 4 5Fukuda and his team chose Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the experiments because they are big enough to carry the equipment and have no wings that would get in the way. Even when the backpack and film are glued to their backs, the bugs can traverse small obstacles or right themselves when flipped over.The research still has a long way to go. In a recent demonstration, Riken researcher Yujiro Kakei used a specialized computer and wireless Bluetooth signal to tell the cyborg roach to turn left, causing it to scramble in that general direction. But when given the ""right"" signal, the bug turned in circles.The next challenge is miniaturising the components so that the insects can move more easily and to allow for mounting of sensors and even cameras. Kakei said he constructed the cyborg backpack with 5,000 yen ($35) worth of parts purchased at Tokyo's famed Akihabara electronics district.The backpack and film can be removed, allowing the roaches to go back to life in the lab's terrarium. The insects mature in four months and have been known to live up to five years in captivity.Beyond disaster rescue bugs, Fukuda sees broad applications for the solar cell film, composed of microscopic layers of plastic, silver, and gold. The film could be built into clothing or skin patches for use in monitoring vital signs.On a sunny day, a parasol covered with the material could generate enough electricity to charge a mobile phone, he said.($1 = 143.3100 yen)Writing by Rocky Swift Editing by Mark HeinrichOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Above, members of the Anderson lab at work. Credit: John Zich/University of ChicagoScientists with the University of Chicago have discovered a way to create a material that can be made like a plastic, but conducts electricity more like a metal.The research, published Oct. 26 in Nature, shows how to make a kind of material in which the molecular fragments are jumbled and disordered, but can still conduct electricity extremely well.This goes against all of the rules we know about for conductivity—to a scientist, it's kind of like seeing a car driving on water and still going 70 mph. But the finding could also be extraordinarily useful; if you want to invent something revolutionary, the process often first starts with discovering a completely new material.""In principle, this opens up the design of a whole new class of materials that conduct electricity, are easy to shape, and are very robust in everyday conditions,"" said John Anderson, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and the senior author on the study. ""Essentially, it suggests new possibilities for an extremely important technological group of materials,"" said Jiaze Xie (Ph.D. '22, now at Princeton), the first author on the paper.'There isn't a solid theory to explain this'Conductive materials are absolutely essential if you're making any kind of electronic device, whether it be an iPhone, a solar panel, or a television. By far the oldest and largest group of conductors is the metals: copper, gold, aluminum. Then, about 50 years ago, scientists were able to create conductors made out of organic materials, using a chemical treatment known as ""doping,"" which sprinkles in different atoms or electrons through the material.This is advantageous because these materials are more flexible and easier to process than traditional metals, but the trouble is they aren't very stable; they can lose their conductivity if exposed to moisture or if the temperature gets too high.But fundamentally, both of these organic and traditional metallic conductors share a common characteristic. They are made up of straight, closely packed rows of atoms or molecules. This means that electrons can easily flow through the material, much like cars on a highway. In fact, scientists thought a material had to have these straight, orderly rows in order to conduct electricity efficiently.Then Xie began experimenting with some materials discovered years ago, but largely ignored. He strung nickel atoms like pearls into a string of of molecular beads made of carbon and sulfur, and began testing.To the scientists' astonishment, the material easily and strongly conducted electricity. What's more, it was very stable. ""We heated it, chilled it, exposed it to air and humidity, and even dripped acid and base on it, and nothing happened,"" said Xie. That is enormously helpful for a device that has to function in the real world.But to the scientists, the most striking thing was that the molecular structure of the material was disordered. ""From a fundamental picture, that should not be able to be a metal,"" said Anderson. ""There isn't a solid theory to explain this.""Xie, Anderson, and their lab worked with other scientists around the university to try to understand how the material can conduct electricity. After tests, simulations, and theoretical work, they think that the material forms layers, like sheets in a lasagna. Even if the sheets rotate sideways, no longer forming a neat lasagna stack, electrons can still move horizontally or vertically—as long as the pieces touch.The end result is unprecedented for a conductive material. ""It's almost like conductive Play-Doh—you can smush it into place and it conducts electricity,"" Anderson said.The scientists are excited because the discovery suggests a fundamentally new design principle for electronics technology. Conductors are so important that virtually any new development opens up new lines for technology, they explained.One of the material's attractive characteristics is new options for processing. For example, metals usually have to be melted in order to be made into the right shape for a chip or device, which limits what you can make with them, since other components of the device have to be able to withstand the heat needed to process these materials.The new material has no such restriction because it can be made at room temperatures. It can also be used where the need for a device or pieces of the device to withstand heat, acid or alkalinity, or humidity has previously limited engineers' options to develop new technology.The team is also exploring the different forms and functions the material might make. ""We think we can make it 2D or 3D, make it porous, or even introduce other functions by adding different linkers or nodes,"" said Xie.More information: John Anderson, Intrinsic glassy-metallic transport in an amorphous coordination polymer, Nature (2022).

other news sites813,https://www.axios.com/2022/10/06/boston-dynamics-pledges-weaponize-robots,ExclusiveBoston Dynamics pledges not to weaponize its robots,"Several robotics companies, including Boston Dynamics, are pledging not to support the weaponization of their products and are calling for others in the industry to do the same, according to a letter shared first with Axios.Why it matters: Robots, like drones before them, have a wide range of peaceful and even life-saving uses, but can be turned into war-fighting machines, too.Details: The open letter highlights the erosion of consumer trust in robots as among the reasons not to allow them to be used as weapons.""We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues,"" the companies said in the letter.The companies pledged not to add weapons technology themselves or to support others doing so. And ""when possible"" they said they will review customers' plans in hopes of avoiding those who would turn the robots into weapons, in addition to exploring technical features that could prevent such use.In addition to Boston Dynamics, five other firms signed on to the commitment: Agility Robotics, ANYbotics, Clearpath Robotics, Open Robotics and Unitree Robotics.What they're saying: Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said, in an e-mailed statement: ""We are concerned about recent increases in makeshift efforts by individuals attempting to weaponize commercially available robots... For this technology to be broadly accepted throughout society, the public needs to know they can trust it. And that means we need policy that prohibits bad actors from misusing it.""Go deeper: Here's the full text of the letter:An Open Letter to the Robotics Industry and our Communities,General Purpose Robots Should Not Be WeaponizedWe are some of the world’s leading companies dedicated to introducing new generations of advanced mobile robotics to society. These new generations of robots are more accessible, easier to operate, more autonomous, affordable, and adaptable than previous generations, and capable of navigating into locations previously inaccessible to automated or remotely-controlled technologies. We believe that advanced mobile robots will provide great benefit to society as co-workers in industry and companions in our homes.As with any new technology offering new capabilities, the emergence of advanced mobile robots offers the possibility of misuse. Untrustworthy people could use them to invade civil rights or to threaten, harm, or intimidate others. One area of particular concern is weaponization. We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues. Weaponized applications of these newly-capable robots will also harm public trust in the technology in ways that damage the tremendous benefits they will bring to society. For these reasons, we do not support the weaponization of our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots. For those of us who have spoken on this issue in the past, and those engaging for the first time, we now feel renewed urgency in light of the increasing public concern in recent months caused by a small number of people who have visibly publicized their makeshift efforts to weaponize commercially available robots.We pledge that we will not weaponize our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots or the software we develop that enables advanced robotics and we will not support others to do so. When possible, we will carefully review our customers’ intended applications to avoid potential weaponization. We also pledge to explore the development of technological features that could mitigate or reduce these risks. To be clear, we are not taking issue with existing technologies that nations and their government agencies use to defend themselves and uphold their laws.We understand that our commitment alone is not enough to fully address these risks, and therefore we call on policymakers to work with us to promote safe use of these robots and to prohibit their misuse. We also call on every organization, developer, researcher, and user in the robotics community to make similar pledges not to build, authorize, support, or enable the attachment of weaponry to such robots. We are convinced that the benefits for humanity of these technologies strongly outweigh the risk of misuse, and we are excited about a bright future in which humans and robots work side by side to tackle some of the world’s challenges.Signed,Boston DynamicsAgility RoboticsANYboticsClearpath RoboticsOpen RoboticsUnitree Robotics",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites814,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lithograhy-tool-russia-7nm-2028,Russian University Vows to Buildnm Chipmaking Tools,"A Russian institute is developing its own lithography scanner that could produce chips using 7nm-class fabrication technologies. The machine is under development, with the plan to build it by 2028. When it is ready, it should be more efficient than ASML's Twinscan NXT:2000i tool, whose development took over a decade.After Russia unleashed its bloody war against Ukraine on February 24, Taiwan was quick to ban shipments of advanced chips to the nation. The U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. then followed up with sanctions that effectively prohibit virtually all contract chipmakers with advanced fabs from working with Russian entities. In addition, companies like Arm cannot license their technologies to Russia-based chip designers. As a result, the Russian government rolled out a national program to develop the country's own 28nm-class fabrication technology by 2030, reverse engineer as many foreign chips as possible, and educate local talent to work on domestic chips.However, there is a problem with a 28nm-class production node by 2030. Russia's most advanced fab can produce chips using a 65nm fabrication technology. Meanwhile, American and European makers of fab tools cannot supply their equipment to Russia due to sanctions, so the country has to design and build domestic wafer production equipment if it wants to adopt a 28nm node. Essentially, what has taken companies like ASML and Applied Materials decades to develop and iterate has to be done in about eight years.Apparently, the Russian Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences intends to beat all expectations and produce a 7nm-capable lithography scanner by 2028, according to its plans published on Nizhy Novgorod Strategy Development website (via CNews).A modern lithography scanner capable of processing wafers using a 7nm-class process technology is a highly complex apparatus that involves a high-performance light source, sophisticated optics, and precise metrology, just to name a few critical parts. However, as a leading applied physics university in Russia, IAP believes that it can develop such a tool in a relatively short amount of time.The tool will be somewhat different from scanners produced by companies like ASML or Nikon. For example, IAP plans to use a >600W light source (total power, not intermediate focus power) with an 11.3nm exposure wavelength (EUV wavelength is 13.5nm), which will require considerably more sophisticated optics than exists today. Because the light source of the device will be relatively low power, it will make the tool more compact and easier to build. Yet, it also means that its production of the scanner will be considerably lower than that of modern deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools. That might not be a problem, according to IAP.When it comes to timing, IAP may be slightly too optimistic. For everything below 32nm, chipmakers use the so-called immersion lithography (which is essentially a booster to DUV tools). ASML introduced its first immersion lithography system — the Twinscan XT:1250i — in late 2003 with a plan to deliver one in Q3 2004 to produce 65nm logic chips and 70nm half-pitch DRAMs. It took the company about five years and another generation of tools to announce its 32nm-capable Twinscan NXT:1950i in late 2008, with customer deliveries starting in 2009.Then, it took the market leader some nine years to deliver its 7nm and 5nm-capable Twinscan NXT:2000i DUV tool in 2018. TSMC used less advanced tools with multi-patterning for its first-generation N7 fabrication technology, but the timing of ASML’s introductions demonstrate how hard it is to transition from 65nm to 7nm. It took ASML 14 years to go from 65nm to 7nm. Now, IAP, which does not have any experience in chip production or ties with chipmakers, intends to build a 7nm-capable machine for volume production from scratch in about six years. While the plan does not sound feasible, it looks like IAP is full of enthusiasm.""ASML, the global lithography leader, has been developing its EUV lithography system for almost 20 years and the technology has turned out to be incredibly complex,"" said Nikolai Chkhalo, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences for scientific and technological development. ""The main objective of ASML in this case was to maintain the extremely high productivity that is needed only at the world's largest factories. In Russia, no one needs such high productivity. In our work, we start from the needs and tasks faced by domestic microelectronics — and this is not so much about quantity, but about quality. First of all, we need to transit to our own fabrication processes, develop our own design standards, our own tools, engineering, materials, so our own path is inevitable here. In fact, we need to balance between simplicity and performance.""IAP plans to build a fully functional alpha scanner by 2024. This one will not have to offer high productivity or maximum resolution but will have to work and be attractive to potential investors. IAP intends to build a beta version of the scanner with higher productivity and resolution by 2026. This machine should be mass production ready, but its productivity is not expected to be at its maximum. The final iteration of the litho scanner is said to emerge in 2028. It should get a high-performance light source (hence better productivity), better metrology and overall capabilities. There is no word how many of such machines IAP and/or its production partners will be able to produce by 2028.It should be noted that fab equipment is not limited to lithography scanners. There are other types of machines performing etching, deposition, resist removal, metrology, and inspection operations that are not made in Russia. Furthermore, there is somewhat less advanced machinery like ultrapure air and water generators which also are not produced in Russia. Even if IAP RAS manages to build a lithography tool, Russia will still be a few hundred tools short of building a modern fab. Also, fabs need ultrapure raw materials produced in countries that will not supply to Russia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch815,https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/recycling-robotics-company-amp-robotics-could-raise-up-to-70-million-sources-say/,Recycling robotics company AMP Robotics could raise up toM,"AMP Robotics, the recycling robotics technology developer backed by investors including Sequoia Capital and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, is close to closing on as much as $70 million in new financing, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the company’s plans.The new financing speaks to AMP Robotics’ continued success in pilot projects and with new partnerships that are exponentially expanding the company’s deployments.Earlier this month the company announced a new deal that represented its largest purchase order for its trash-sorting and recycling robots.That order, for 24 machine learning-enabled robotic recycling systems with the waste-handling company Waste Connections, was a showcase for the efficacy of the company’s recycling technology.That comes on the back of a pilot program earlier in the year with one Toronto apartment complex, where the complex’s tenants were able to opt into a program that would share with the building’s renters recycling habits monitored by AMP Robotics in an effort to improve their recycling behavior.The potential benefits of AMP Robotic’s machine learning-enabled robots are undeniable. The company’s technology can sort waste streams in ways that traditional systems never could and at a cost that’s far lower than most waste-handling facilities.As TechCrunch reported earlier, the tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups — the robots can even identify the brands on packaging.AMP’s robots already have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.At the beginning of the year, AMP Robotics worked with its investor, Sidewalk Labs, on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits. Sidewalk Labs is transporting the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics.Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how they’re doing in their recycling efforts.It was only last November that the Denver-based AMP Robotics raised a $16 million round from Sequoia Capital and others to finance the early commercialization of its technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites816,https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23401381/great-lakes-plastic-pollution-cleanup-tech-robots,How a fleet of robots could help solve the Great Lakes plastic pollution problem,"In the murky waters of Lake Ontario just off the Toronto harbor, a stream of trash inches toward a round, tubular-looking device floating in the water. A piece of white styrofoam bumps up against the device’s lip. Then, in one fluid motion, it tumbles over the edge. With tendrils of marine plants circling the waste, it looks like the styrofoam could have entered a portal to an undersea world. Instead, the device is a gateway to a less mystical — yet vital — destination: the garbage dump.“It’s basically like a floating trash can,” says Chelsea Rochman, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto, who has worked with a team at the university to capture trash in Lake Ontario with bins like these since 2019. Powered from shore, the device, called a Seabin, uses a motor to create a vortex that gently pulls in floating waste from a 160-foot radius and then stores the trash in an attached basket.Across the Great Lakes, which stretch from Duluth, Minnesota, to the border between the United States and Canada in northern New York, dozens of Seabins now work alongside stormwater filters in a cross-border project dubbed the Great Lakes Plastic Cleanup. In mid-September, they were also joined by aquatic waste-collection drones and beach-cleaning roving robots — all to remove some of the 22 million pounds of plastic that enter the lakes each year and help researchers like Rochman understand the Great Lakes waste problem.People can’t remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can“We know that the amount of litter we have out there needs more power than the people power that we have,” Rochman explains. Though local groups have organized beach cleanups for decades, people can’t remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can, nor can they pick up the tiny pieces that machines are able to capture.Standing on the shore of Lake Ontario, with Toronto’s streetcars rattling by, Rochman points out the overflowing municipal trash bin along the sidewalk — one of several sources of the trash. Municipal sewage systems, industrial spills, stormwater runoff, recreational boating and beach waste, and agricultural debris all wind up in the lakes as well. In one bin, toothbrushes, tampon applicators, dental flossers, shoe strings, eyeglasses, food scraps, and syringes are entwined in the tendrils of marine plants. Between the leaves, tiny flecks of plastic poke out.Bright colored plastic floats among leaves and other debris in one of the Great Lakes Image: Great Lakes Plastic CleanupIn the lakes, which 40 million people rely on as their primary drinking water source, this waste breaks down, turning into microscopic pieces of plastic and debris, which are then eaten by fish, sucked into surrounding water treatment plants, or pulled to shore or out into the ocean. When plastic is consumed by fish, it can release chemicals like dyes and flame retardants, irritating and potentially damaging their digestive systems. In big sport fish, like lake trout or salmon, Rochman expects to find hundreds of pieces of plastic. Microplastics have also been found in drinking water in the region, where many water treatment plants are ill-equipped to filter the tiny pieces out. (The risk of consuming microplastics for humans remains unclear, though researchers continue to investigate the potential problem.)Once captured by researchers like Rochman, each piece of trash becomes another data point. Each day during the summer, students haul out the bins to count, classify, and dispose of their contents. “They know how many cigarette butts we collect, how many straws we collect, how many foam containers we collect,” Rochman says. Some days, the catch is more surprising — students have counted slices of deli meat, old shoes, and, once, a coconut in Seabins this summer.The Seabins capture 28 grams of waste, on average, each day. “It’s going to sound like a small number because plastic is light,” says Rochman. That weight translates to a couple hundred to 2,000 pieces of microplastic, along with multiple pieces of larger waste. This summer, Rochman expects her team to remove the amount of plastic equivalent to 7,000 plastic water bottles — and that’s only in the 12 bins the university oversees, which make up just a fraction of the devices deployed at 45 marinas across the Great Lakes region.From the northern shores of Lake Superior in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to the harbor of Buffalo, New York, just a short drive from Niagara Falls, Seabins like the ones in the Toronto harborfront are deployed at 44 other locations, typically in operation from May to November. These bins are monitored not by researchers but by marina owners or local organizations. Partners at the participating sites weigh and dispose of the bins’ contents as they fill up and perform full waste characterizing audits five to 10 times each year. Many marinas also have catch basin baskets installed, called LittaTraps, that sit inside stormwater drains to capture waste before it enters the lake system. Between 2020 and 2021, the project’s technology captured over 74,000 pieces of trash, a number that the team expects will increase as they continue outreach to marinas and municipalities in the region.A promotional photo of the beach-cleaning BeBot. Image: The Searial CleanersIn September, a waste collecting drone and beach-cleaning robot also joined the project’s fleet of trash catching technology. The devices, built by French waste capture technology company The Searial Cleaners, collect waste from lakes and beaches, working both via remote control and autonomously. The roving robots are also key public engagement tools, says Claire Touvier, the company’s chief executive. “That’s why this robot needed to be sexy and cool and fun, and to also have a cool name — these are extremely efficient tools when it comes to raising awareness,” she says.Still, the technology remains a reactive approach. Robots can help clean up the lakes, but human choices about how much plastic to produce, consume, and throw out are at the core of the Great Lakes trash problem. Changing them will be key to any long-term solution, says Melissa De Young, policy and programs director at the Canadian nonprofit Pollution Probe, one of the project’s main funders. “We’re doing what we can to remove plastic from the water, but we know that the technologies alone are not going to solve the problem,” she explains. “The data that we’re collecting is really critical because it provides, first, an understanding of the extent of the problem.”If large macroplastics wind up in capture devices in a certain area, for example, that can indicate communities nearby may lack easy access to disposal facilities or may be uninformed on why proper waste disposal is important. Alternatively, if small plastic pieces used to build other products, called preproduction pellets, or nurdles, are more common, that can indicate that somewhere upstream, a manufacturer may be improperly disposing of its trash.The PixieDrone collects plastic. Image: The Searial CleanersThe captured waste then informs the group’s approach to local solutions, whether that means starting a new educational campaign, meeting with policymakers, or advocating for new industry mandates. Last year, the team consulted on a new Ontario law that requires the foam used to build floating docks for cottages and marinas to be fully enclosed so it does not break down into the water. The group has also contributed to proposed legislation to include mandates for filters on washing machines to prevent microfibers from entering the sewage system in Ontario and stronger laws regarding preproduction plastic disposal in Illinois.“When we go to government policymakers, when we go to industry in the region, when we go to others to say, ‘Listen, we’ve got a problem here and we need to fix it,’ having that localized data, having that regional data, really aids us in those conversations in terms of capturing people’s attention and really motivating them to do something,” says Mark Fisher, head of the Council for the Great Lakes, a binational organization that also funds the project.“We don’t want to have to have trash traps in the water forever.”Other researchers in the region are hopeful about the new technology in the lakes, too. No initiative is going to be able to pick up 22 million pounds of plastic out of the Great Lakes every year, but a project that can motivate public and political action can have magnifying results, explains Timothy Hoellein, a biology professor at Loyola University Chicago who has worked on separate lake cleanup projects but is not involved in this one. When it comes to the Seabins, “Their individual footprint is pretty small,” Hoellein says. “But on a collective basis, it could really make a difference.”As the strategy garners success in the region, its lessons have begun to reach far beyond the shores of the Great Lakes. Rochman and the team at the University of Toronto have partnered with the nonprofit environmental group Ocean Conservancy to found the International Trash Trap Network, which works with groups from Fiji to Florida to help create more trash trapping strategies. Wherever trash traps capture waste, data collection follows.It’s all part of the goal of achieving a future where freshwater sources, like the Great Lakes, are no longer dumping zones for waste, Rochman says. “We don’t want to have to have trash traps in the water forever,” she adds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to data cited by the World Economic Forum, the textile industry accounts for 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per-year — nearly as much as the auto industry. Nylon production alone is responsible for about 60 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to the companies.The multi-year agreement with European-based Aquafil expands on the two companies’ existing relationship. Earlier this year the two companies produced the first ton of bio-nylon-6 precursor material at a pilot scale. Now, the move to a demonstration scale plant will give Genomatica the ability to move ahead with supply agreements to certain brand partners.Clothing maker Far Eastern New Century uses Genomatica’s products in its clothes, and other partnerships are in the works, the company said.Genomatica is backed by Casdin Capital, Viking Global Investors, which continues as Genomatica’s largest shareholder, and organism engineering partner Ginkgo Bioworks.“Bio-nylon is positioned to replace a material that’s used in millions of applications every day,” said Christophe Schilling, Genomatica CEO. “Our research shows that despite health and economic turmoil, 56% of Americans still want brands to prioritize sustainability. With this scale, Genomatica is offering our brand partners a key way to meet their sustainability objectives, differentiate themselves, and meet surging consumer demand.”Aquafil is building the plant in Slovenia, where the Genomatica biological precursor material will be converted into bio-nylon-6 yarns, films and engineered plastics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the innovations, a reconfigurable wheel-track, comes out of Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Engineering Center in partnership with DARPA. The wheel-track is just one of a handful of designs meant to improve survivability of combat vehicles beyond just up-armoring them.As you can see in the video, the reconfigurable wheel-track demonstrates a seamless transition between a round wheel shape and a triangular track in about two seconds, and the shift between its two modes can be executed while the vehicle is in motion without cutting speed. Round wheels are optimal for hard terrain while track-style treads allow an armored vehicle to move freely on softer ground.According to Ground X-Vehicle Program Manager Major Amber Walker, the tech offers “instant improvements to tactical mobility and maneuverability on diverse terrains” — an advantage you can see on display in the GIF below.While wheel technology doesn’t sound that exciting, the result is visually impressive and smooth enough to prompt a double-take.The other designs featured in the video are noteworthy as well, with one offering a windowless navigation technology called Virtual Perspectives Augmenting Natural Experiences (V-PANE) that integrates video from an array of mounted LIDAR and video cameras to recreate a real-time model of a windowless vehicle’s surroundings. Another windowless cockpit design creates “virtual windows” for a driver, with 3D goggles for depth enhancement, head-tracking and wraparound window display screens displaying data outside the all-terrain vehicle in real time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This site features several honeybee hives that are used for research. In the event of overcrowding of a beehive, the original queen leaves the hive with a fraction of the workers (on average around 12,000 bees) (), resulting in occasional swarming events near PG measuring equipment at our study site. When honeybees swarm, they usually cluster on a limb of a tree for several days while scout bees search for suitable cavities to nest in. After an appropriate nest is found, the swarm will collectively migrate. An electric field monitor was placed near the swarm. A camera (AKASO V50×, 30 fps) was positioned next to the field mill with an upward orientation to record the swarm in flight ( Figure 1 B). A second electric field monitor was placed in an open field, 50m away from the other electric field monitor and swarm to ascertain any dynamics in the electric field monitor was caused by the presence of a swarm. For about three minutes, part of the swarm passed over the electric field monitor.Modelling of electric fields was performed using finite element analysis within COMSOL Multiphysics® v. 5.4 (COMSOL AB, Stockholm, Sweden) utilising the “Electrostatics” interface within the “AC/DC” module. The three-dimensional geometry consisted of a 60 m × 60 m x 40 m (length, width, height) cuboid within which the model operated. The two runs made for differently sized and charged ellipsoids represented insect swarms of honeybees and locusts. The honeybee swarm was represented as an ellipsoid with semi-axes 2 m x 1 m x 0.5 m ellipsoid at a height of 3 m, and the locust swarm an ellipsoid with semi-axes 4 m x 1 m x 1 m at a height of 15 m. The swarm charge was distributed evenly as a volume charge within the ellipsoids, with the total charge calculated respectively as the sum of 500 bees each carrying +100 pC (order of magnitude from ()) and 1000 locusts carrying +850 pC each. An approximately 8 m tall deciduous tree was included in each model to provide scale and an electrical landmark for comparison (). The remainder of the model domain was assigned as air. The upper surface of this air column was given an electrical potential typical of a 40 m altitude in fair-weather conditions (+4 kV), with the bottom surface defined as zero potential, equivalent to the established surface (first meter) atmospheric potential gradient of 100 V/m (). The surface of the tree was also defined as ground (). Meshing of the geometry was physics-controlled, set to “extremely fine”. The relative permittivity, ε, was defined as ε= 12 for living trees (), ε= 1 for air, and ε= 80 inside the insect swarms (likely an overestimate, based on the permittivity of water). Model outputs presented for this study were produced by plotting data from two-dimensional slices through the centre of the three-dimensional dataset.Quantification and statistical analysisThe video recording capturing the swarm event was cropped to a 500 by 220-pixel window to remove foreground objects obstructing the view of the swarm and was analysed using a custom script in Python 3.8.1. The video was converted to black and white pixels such that the background was white and any non-background objects, comprising the swarm, were black. The ratio of black to white pixels was calculated for each frame of the video resulting in a proxy measure for bee density, defined as relative pixel density here. At points during the swarm’s passage, flowering heads of grass entered the frame, increasing the relative pixel density. Such affected data were therefore removed. The relative pixel densities were filtered by a moving mean over 10 data points (corresponding to 0.5 s) to emphasise the long-term trend of the data. These data were compared to data collected by the electric field monitor using cross correlation and linear regression in PAST v.4. Since insect charges can be expected to influence PGs directly, data were aligned (zero lag) based on the highest cross correlation coefficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch823,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/replacing-plastic-with-plant-pulp-for-sustainable-packaging-attracts-a-billionaire-backer/,Replacing plastic with plant pulp for sustainable packaging attracts a billionaire backer,"In a small suburb of Melbourne, two entrepreneurs are developing a technology that could mean big changes for the packaging industry.Stuart Gordon and Mark Appleford are the co-founders of Varden, a company that has developed a process to take the waste material from sugarcane and convert it into a paper-like packaging product with the functional attributes of plastic.Their technology managed to grab the attention of — and $2.2 million in funding from — Horizons Ventures, the venture capital fund managing the money of Li Ka-shing, one of the world’s wealthiest men.It’s an opportune time to launch a novel packaging technology, as the European Union has already instituted a ban on single-use plastic items, which will go into effect in 2021. Taking their lead, companies like Nestlé and Walmart have pledged to use only sustainable packaging for products beginning in 2025.The environmental toll that packaging takes on the earth’s habitats is already a concern for many, and the urgency to find a solution is only mounting with consumers and businesses actually producing more waste in the rush to change consumer behavior and socially distance as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.“I like technologies that focus on carbon reductions,” said Chris Liu, Horizons Ventures’ representative in Australia.A longtime tech and product executive who had stints at Intel and Fjord, a digital design studio, Liu relocated to Australia recently and has actually taken himself off the grid.Living in Western Australia, the climate emergency was brought directly to the top of Liu’s mind when the wildfires, which raged through the country, came within two kilometers of his new home.For Mark Appleford, it wasn’t so much the fires as it was the garbage that kept washing up on the shores of his beloved beaches.Over beers at a barbecue he began talking to his eventual co-founder, Stuart Gordon, about the environmental problem they’d solve if they had the ability to change things. They settled on plastics.Working in Appleford’s laundry room they started developing the technology that would become Varden. That early laundry room-work in 2015 led to a small seed round and the company’s long slog to get an initial product in the hands of test customers.Finagling some time with the New Zealand manufacturer Fisher and Paykel, the two co-founders put together an early prototype of their coffee pods made from sugarcane bagasse, a waste byproduct of the sugar feedstock.“We worked backwards through customers to supply chain, which led us to material selection, which was something that would allow us to create a product that people understood,” said Gordon.The production process has evolved to fit inside a 40-foot container that holds the firm’s machine, which takes agricultural waste and converts that waste into packaging.Instead of using rollers like a paper mill, Varden’s technology uses a thermoform to mold the plant waste into a product that has the same properties as plastic.It removes a complicated step that’s been essential to the current crop of bioplastics, which use bacteria to convert plant waste into plastic substitutes that are then sold to the industry.“It looks like paper… you can tear it in half and it sounds like paper when you rip it, and you can throw it in the bin,” said Appleford.Gordon said that the company’s containers are outperforming commodity based plastics. And the first target for replacement, the founders said, is coffee capsules.“We went for coffee because it’s the hardest,” said Appleford.It’s also a huge market, according to the company. Varden estimates there are more than 20 billion coffee pods consumed every year.With the new money, Varden will begin manufacturing at scale to meet initial demand from pilot customers and is hoping to expand its product line to include medical blister packs in addition to the coffee pods.“A pilot plant on the products we’re looking at is a pilot plant that can generate 20 million units a year,” said Gordon.Both men are hoping that their product — and others like it — can usher in a generation of new sustainable packaging materials that are better for the environment at every stage of their life cycle.“The next generation of packaging will be better… there are plant-based flexibles for your salads, for your potato chips… [But] the next generation of molded packaging is us… bioplastic will ultimately go.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The algae provide movement through the lungs, which is key to the treatment being targeted and effective.In experiments, the infections in the mice treated with the algae bots all cleared up, whereas the mice that weren't treated all died within three days.The technology is still at a proof-of-concept stage, but the early signs are very promising.""Based on this mouse data, we see that the microrobots could potentially improve antibiotic penetration to kill bacterial pathogens and save more patients' lives,"" says Victor Nizet, a physician and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego.The nanoparticles on the algae cells are made of tiny polymer spheres coated with the membranes of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. These membranes neutralize inflammatory molecules produced by bacteria and the body's own immune system, and both the nanoparticles and the algae degrade naturally.Harmful inflammation is reduced, improving the fight against infection, and the swimming microbots are able to deliver their treatment right where it's needed – it's the precision that makes this approach work so well.The researchers also established that the microbot treatment was more effective than an intravenous injection of antibiotics – in fact, the injection dose had to be 3,000 times higher than the one loaded on to the algae cells to achieve the same effect in the mice.""These results show how targeted drug delivery combined with active movement from the microalgae improves therapeutic efficacy,"" says Joseph Wang, nanoengineer from UC San Diego.In humans, the pneumonia caused byPseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria used in this study occurs after patients are put on a mechanical ventilator in intensive care. The infection often prolongs stays in hospital and significantly increases the risk of death.The researchers are confident that their new method can be scaled up as required, and would be straightforward to administer to the lungs of ventilated patients (the microbots were delivered to the mice through a tube in the windpipe).Next up for the team is more research into how the microbots interact with the immune system, then scaling up the work and getting it ready to be tested in larger animals – and then eventually, humans.""Our goal is to do targeted drug delivery into more challenging parts of the body, like the lungs,"" says chemical engineer Liangfang Zhang from UC San Diego. ""And we want to do it in a way that is safe, easy, biocompatible, and long-lasting.""""That is what we've demonstrated in this work.""The research has been published in Nature Materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites825,https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/969866,Bats protect young trees from insect damagewith three times fewer bugs,"URBANA, Ill. – Bats help keep forests growing. Without bats to hold their populations in check, insects that munch on tree seedlings go wild, doing three to nine times more damage than when bats are on the scene. That’s according to a groundbreaking new study from the University of Illinois.“A lot of folks associate bats with caves. But as it turns out, the habitat you could really associate with almost every bat species in North America is forest. And this is true globally. Forests are just really important to bats,” says Joy O’Keefe, study co-author and assistant professor and wildlife extension specialist in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. “We wanted to ask the question: Are bats important to forests? And in this study, we've demonstrated they are.”Other researchers have demonstrated bats’ insect-control services in crop fields and tropical forest systems, but no one has shown their benefits in temperate forests until now.“It's especially important for us to learn how bats affect forests, given that bats are declining due to diseases like white-nose syndrome or collisions with wind turbines. This type of work can reveal the long-term consequences of bat declines,” says Elizabeth Beilke, postdoctoral researcher and lead author on the study.The research team built giant mesh-enclosed structures in an Indiana forest to exclude the eight bat species that frequent the area, including two federally threatened or endangered species. The mesh openings were large enough to allow insects free movement in and out, but not flying bats. Every morning and evening for three summers, Beilke opened and closed the mesh sides and tops of the structures to ensure birds had daytime access to the plots. That way, she could be sure she was isolating the impacts of bats.Beilke then measured the number of insects on oak and hickory seedlings in the forest understory, as well as the amount of defoliation per seedling. Because she erected an equal number of box frames without mesh, Beilke was able to compare insect density and defoliation with and without bats.Overall, the researchers found three times as many insects and five times more defoliation on the seedlings when bats were excluded than in control plots that allowed bats in each night. When analyzed separately, oaks experienced nine times more defoliation and hickories three times more without bats.“We know from other research that oaks and hickories are ecologically important, with acorns and hickory nuts providing food sources for wildlife and the trees acting as hosts to native insects. Bats use both oaks and hickories as roosts, and now we see they may be using them as sources of prey insects, as well. Our data suggest bats and oaks have a mutually beneficial relationship,” Beilke says.While insect pressure was intense in plots without bat predation, the seedlings didn’t succumb to their injuries. But the researchers say long-term bat declines could prove fatal for the baby trees.“We were observing sublethal levels of defoliation, but we know defoliation makes seedlings more vulnerable to death from other factors such as drought or fungal diseases. It would be hard to track the fate of these trees over 90 years, but I think a natural next step is to examine the impact of persistent low levels of defoliation on these seedlings,” Beilke says. “To what extent does repeated defoliation reduce their competitive ability and contribute to oak declines?”The researchers point out that birds, many of which share the same insect diets as bats, are also declining. While they specifically sought to isolate bats’ impact on forest trees, the researchers are confident insect density and defoliation rates would have been higher if they had excluded both birds and bats in their study. In fact, similar exclusion studies focusing on birds failed to account for bats in their study designs, leaving mesh enclosures up all night.“When we were initially working on the proposal for this research, we looked at 37 different bird exclusion studies, across agriculture and forest systems. We found nearly all of them had made this mistake. Most of them had not opened or removed their treatment plots to bats,” Beilke says.In other words, before Beilke’s study, birds were getting at least partial credit for work bats were doing in the shadows.Clearly, both types of winged predators are important for forest health in temperate systems. And, according to O’Keefe, that makes these studies even more critical to inform forest management.“I think it’s important to stress the value of this type of experimental work with bats, to really try to dig into what their ecosystem services are in a deliberate manner. While we can probably extrapolate out and say bats are important in other types of forest, I wouldn't discount the value of doing the same kind of work in other systems, especially if there are questions about certain insect or tree species and how bats affect them. So rather than extrapolating out across the board, let's do the work to try to figure out how bats are benefiting plants,” she says. “And before they're gone, hopefully.”The article, “Bats reduce insect density and defoliation in temperate forests: an exclusion experiment,” is published in Ecology [DOI: 10.1002/ecy.3903]. The research was supported by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the Indiana State Department of Natural Resources, the Indiana Space Grant Consortium, the Department of Biology at Indiana State University, and the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at Illinois.The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences is in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncontrolled hemorrhaging accounts for more than 30% of trauma deaths. To stop the bleeding, doctors often apply pressure to the wound and seal the site with medical glue. But what happens when applying pressure is difficult or could make things worse? Or the surface of the wound is too bloody for glue? Drawing inspiration from nature, researchers from McGill University have developed a medical adhesive that could save lives, modeled after structures found in marine animals like mussels and flatworms.“When applied to the bleeding site, the new adhesive uses suction to absorb blood, clear the surface for adhesion, and bond to the tissue providing a physical seal. The entire application process is quick and pressure-free, which is suitable for non-compressible hemorrhage situations, which are often life-threatening,” says lead author Guangyu Bao, a recently graduated PhD student under the supervision of Professor Jianyu Li of Department of Mechanical Engineering.In putting the new technology to the test, the researchers found that the adhesive promotes blood coagulation. The adhesive can also be removed without causing re-bleeding or even left inside the body to be absorbed. “Our material showed much better-improved safety and bleeding control efficiency than other commercial products. Beyond bleeding control, our material could one day replace wound sutures or deliver drugs to provide therapeutic effects,” says senior author Professor Jianyu Li.About this study“Liquid-infused microstructured bioadhesives halt non-compressible hemorrhage” by Guangyu Bao et al. was published in Nature Communications.About McGill UniversityFounded in Montreal, Quebec, in 1821, McGill University is Canada’s top ranked medical doctoral university.

Luckily there is no shortage of sustainable packaging startups in Europe. Just take a look: Circleback (Germany), Recup (Germany), Sourceful (U.K.), one • five (Germany), Shellworks (U.K.), Woola (Estonia), Papkot (France), Biotic (Israel), FunCell (France) and Traceless (Germany).The latest to join the ranks is Magical Mushroom Company (MMC). It’s now raised a £3 million seed round led by Ecovative Design LLC with participation by Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity (a green energy company in the U.K.); Robert Del Naja (activist); and Marcus Watson, co-founder of Adoreum Partners, who brought 30 other investors.The investment will be used to fund the opening of its first raw material production plant.MMC’s solution is a direct replacement for plastic-based packaging such as polystyrene and cardboard. It does this by combining agricultural waste with mycelium — the root structure of a mushroom. The result, claims the company, is biodegradable (in 45 days), durable and comparable in price to traditional packaging derived from fossil fuels like polystyrene.Launched in 2019, MMC’s clients include Raymarine, BA Components, Castrads, Ffern, Selfridges, Lush, Seedlip and ID Watch, among many others.Paul Gilligan, CEO and founder at Magical Mushroom Company, said in a statement: “We have just eight years to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and businesses have a crucial role to play – but they need viable and cost-effective solutions that significantly reduce the carbon footprint across their entire supply chain.

That number is expected to drop further as more plastic is produced.Greenpeace found that no plastic — not even soda bottles, one of the most prolific items thrown into recycling bins — meets the threshold to be called ""recyclable"" according to standards set by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation New Plastic Economy Initiative. Plastic must have a recycling rate of 30% to reach that standard; no plastic has ever been recycled and reused close to that rate.""More plastic is being produced, and an even smaller percentage of it is being recycled,"" says Lisa Ramsden, senior plastic campaigner for Greenpeace USA. ""The crisis just gets worse and worse, and without drastic change will continue to worsen as the industry plans to triple plastic production by 2050.""Waste management experts say the problem with plastic is that it is expensive to collect and sort. There are now thousands of different types of plastic, and none of them can be melted down together. Plastic also degrades after one or two uses. Greenpeace found the more plastic is reused the more toxic it becomes.New plastic, on the other hand, is cheap and easy to produce. The result is that plastic trash has few markets — a reality the public has not wanted to hear.Trent Carpenter, the general manager of Southern Oregon Sanitation, says when they told customers a couple years ago that they could no longer take any plastic trash other than soda bottles and jugs — like milk containers and detergent bottles — people were upset. They wanted to put their strawberry containers, bags, yogurt cups and all manner of plastic trash in their recycling bin.""We had to re-educate individuals that a great deal of that material is ending up in a landfill,"" Carpenter said. ""It's not going to a recycling facility and being recycled. It's going to a recycling facility and being landfilled someplace else because [you] can't do anything with that material.""That message has been difficult for the public to absorb with so many different bins in public spaces, and their own communities telling them to put their plastic in recycling containers.Carpenter says they wanted to be transparent with their customers and tell them the truth, unlike companies that continue to tell customers that plastic, such as bags and containers, is being turned into new things.""Politically it's easier to just say 'Gosh, we're going to take everything and we think we can get it recycled,' and then look the other way,"" Carpenter said of the other companies. ""That's greenwashing at its best.""Greenpeace found a couple facilities are trying to reprocess cups and containers — sometimes called ""number 5s"" because of the markings on the containers. But the numbers are low. While 52% of recycling facilities in the U.S. accept that kind of plastic, the report found less than 5% of it is actually repurposed — and the rest is put into a landfill.Similarly, the National Association for PET Container Resources, an industry trade group, found in 2017 that only 21 percent of the plastic bottles collected for recycling were turned into new things.The low reprocessing rates are at odds with plans from the oil and gas industry. Industry lobbyists say they plan to recycle every piece of plastic they make into something new by 2040. In interviews with NPR, industry officials were unable to explain how they planned to reach a 100 percent recycling rate.An NPR investigative report found in 2020 that industry officials misled the public about the recyclability of plastic even though their own reports showed they knew as early as the 1970s and 1980s that plastic could not be economically recycled.The American Chemistry Council, an industry lobby group, initially did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the Greenpeace report. After publication, Joshua Baca, vice president of plastics for the group, sent an email to NPR calling Greenpeace's views ""misleading, out of touch and misguided.""He said the industry believes it is ""on the cusp of a circularity revolution"" when it comes to recycling plastic by ""scaling up sortation, advanced recycling, and new partnerships that enable used plastic to be remade again and again.""Environmentalists and lawmakers in some states are now pushing for legislation that bans single use plastics, and for ""bottle bills"" which pay customers to bring back their plastic bottles. The bills have led to successful recycling rates for plastic bottles in places like Oregon and Michigan, but have faced steep resistance from plastic and oil industry lobbyists.""The real solution is to switch to systems of reuse and refill,"" Ramsden said. ""We are at a decision point on plastic pollution. It is time for corporations to turn off the plastic tap.""After years of embracing plastic recycling, many environmental groups say they hope the public will finally see plastic for what they say it is — trash — and that people will ask themselves if there is something else they could be using instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new approach will allow researchers to build better soft robots that can navigate hard-to-reach places, complicated terrain, and potentially areas within the human body.The paper is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), a peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary, high-impact scientific journal.“This is the first time these concepts have been fundamentally demonstrated,” said Chris Ellison, a lead author of the paper and professor in the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. “Developing new ways of manufacturing are paramount for the competitiveness of our country and for bringing new products to people. On the robotic side, robots are being used more and more in dangerous, remote environments, and these are the kinds of areas where this work could have an impact.”Soft robotics is an emerging field where robots are made of soft, pliable materials as opposed to rigid ones. Soft growing robots can create new material and “grow” as they move. These machines could be used for operations in remote areas where humans can’t go, such as inspecting or installing tubes underground or navigating inside the human body for biomedical applications.Current soft growing robots drag a trail of solid material behind them and can use heat and/or pressure to transform that material into a more permanent structure, much like how a 3D printer is fed solid filament to produce its shaped product. However, the trail of solid material gets more difficult to pull around bends and turns, making it hard for the robots to navigate terrain with obstacles or winding paths.The University of Minnesota team solved this problem by developing a new means of extrusion, a process where material is pushed through an opening to create a specific shape. Using this new process allows the robot to create its synthetic material from a liquid instead of a solid.“We were really inspired by how plants and fungi grow,” said Matthew Hausladen, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. student in the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. “We took the idea that plants and fungi add material at the end of their bodies, either at their root tips or at their new shoots, and we translated that to an engineering system.”Plants use water to transport the building blocks that get transformed into solid roots as the plant grows outward. The researchers were able to mimic this process with synthetic material using a technique called photopolymerization, which uses light to transform liquid monomers into a solid material. Using this technology, the soft robot can more easily navigate obstacles and winding paths without having to drag any solid material behind it.This new process also has applications in manufacturing. Since the researchers’ technique only uses liquid and light, operations that use heat, pressure, and expensive machinery to create and shape materials might not be needed.“A very important part of this project is that we have material scientists, chemical engineers, and robotic engineers all involved,” Ellison said. “By putting all of our different expertise together, we really brought something unique to this project, and I’m confident that not one of us could have done this alone. This is a great example of how collaboration enables scientists to address really hard fundamental problems while also having a technological impact.”The research was funded by the National Science Foundation.In addition to Ellison and Hausladen, the research team included University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science researchers Boran Zhao (postdoctoral researcher) and Lorraine Francis (College of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor); and University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering researchers Tim Kowalewski (associate professor) and Matthew Kubala (graduate student).Watch a video of a soft growing robot navigating a tortuous path.Watch a video explaining the idea behind the plant-inspired research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites832,https://scitechdaily.com/for-the-first-time-a-robot-has-learned-to-imagine-itself/,A swarm of tiny robots could soon brush and floss your teeth for you,"A robot created by Columbia Engineers learns to understand itself rather than the environment around it.Our perception of our bodies is not always correct or realistic, as any athlete or fashion-conscious person knows, but it’s a crucial factor in how we behave in society. Your brain is continuously preparing for movement while you play ball or get dressed so that you can move your body without bumping, tripping, or falling.Humans develop our body models as infants, and robots are starting to do the same. A team at Columbia Engineering revealed today that they have developed a robot that, for the first time, can learn a model of its whole body from scratch without any human aid. The researchers explain how their robot built a kinematic model of itself in a recent paper published in Science Robotics, and how it utilized that model to plan movements, accomplish objectives, and avoid obstacles in a range of scenarios. Even damage to its body was automatically detected and corrected.The robot watches itself like an infant exploring itself in a hall of mirrorsThe researchers placed a robotic arm within a circle of five streaming video cameras. The robot watched itself through the cameras as it undulated freely. Like an infant exploring itself for the first time in a hall of mirrors, the robot wiggled and contorted to learn how exactly its body moved in response to various motor commands. After about three hours, the robot stopped. Its internal deep neural network had finished learning the relationship between the robot’s motor actions and the volume it occupied in its environment.“We were really curious to see how the robot imagined itself,” said Hod Lipson, professor of mechanical engineering and director of Columbia’s Creative Machines Lab, where the work was done. “But you can’t just peek into a neural network, it’s a black box.” After the researchers struggled with various visualization techniques, the self-image gradually emerged. “It was a sort of gently flickering cloud that appeared to engulf the robot’s three-dimensional body,” said Lipson. “As the robot moved, the flickering cloud gently followed it.” The robot’s self-model was accurate to about 1% of its workspace.A technical summary of the study. Credit: Columbia EngineeringSelf-modeling robots will lead to more self-reliant autonomous systemsThe ability of robots to model themselves without being assisted by engineers is important for many reasons: Not only does it save labor, but it also allows the robot to keep up with its own wear-and-tear, and even detect and compensate for damage. The authors argue that this ability is important as we need autonomous systems to be more self-reliant. A factory robot, for instance, could detect that something isn’t moving right, and compensate or call for assistance.“We humans clearly have a notion of self,” explained the study’s first author Boyuan Chen, who led the work and is now an assistant professor at Duke University. “Close your eyes and try to imagine how your own body would move if you were to take some action, such as stretch your arms forward or take a step backward. Somewhere inside our brain we have a notion of self, a self-model that informs us what volume of our immediate surroundings we occupy, and how that volume changes as we move.”Self-awareness in robotsThe work is part of Lipson’s decades-long quest to find ways to grant robots some form of self-awareness. “Self-modeling is a primitive form of self-awareness,” he explained. “If a robot, animal, or human, has an accurate self-model, it can function better in the world, it can make better decisions, and it has an evolutionary advantage.”The researchers are aware of the limits, risks, and controversies surrounding granting machines greater autonomy through self-awareness. Lipson is quick to admit that the kind of self-awareness demonstrated in this study is, as he noted, “trivial compared to that of humans, but you have to start somewhere. We have to go slowly and carefully, so we can reap the benefits while minimizing the risks.”Reference: “Fully body visual self-modeling of robot morphologies” by Boyuan Chen, Robert Kwiatkowski, Carl Vondrick and Hod Lipson, 13 July 2022, Science Robotics.DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.abn1944The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation, Facebook, and Northrop Grumman.The authors declare no financial or other conflicts of interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the drone flies away, the robot gets up on four legs and then begins to scan for targets around the building with what appears to be some sort of automatic weapons attached to its back.According to a report from WarZone, the weapon mounted on the robot dog is possibly a Chinese QBB-97 light machine gun, which is capable of firing 650 rounds per minute at an effective range of 400 meters.A description of the robot posted by Kestrel Defense Blood-Wing and automatically translated to English boasts that the weapon can easily “launch a surprise attack.”“War dogs descending from the sky, air assault, Red Wing Forward heavy-duty drones deliver combat robot dogs, which can be directly inserted into the weak link behind the enemy to launch a surprise attack or can be placed on the roof of the enemy to occupy the commanding heights to suppress firepower.

techcrunch834,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-vine-reboot-poll/,Chief TwitElon Musksignals interest in reviving Vine,"New Twitter owner Elon Musk has signalled a potential interest in reviving Vine, the social video app Twitter gave up on six years ago.In the last few hours the self styled “Chief Twit”) has tweeted a yes/no poll to his 112.4 million followers — pithily positing: “Bring back Vine?”.The question — whether serious product idea or another Elon flight of fancy/’trollercoaster’ tweet — quickly drew millions of votes (most in favor) and thousands of responding tweets. This engagement in turn garnered a bit of additional attention from Musk who responded to some of his followers’ questions/suggestions on the social video topic.In response to a tweet from YouTuber, Mr Beast — which jokily referenced TikTok — Musk struck a serious tone, asking: “What could we do to make it better than TikTok?”He also took the time to publicly agree with another Twitter user — who had chimed in to opine that “video shouldn’t be a separate app” but should rather be “within Twitter”. That observation earned the ‘Tesla Owners Silicon Valley’ account an ‘100’ emoji reply from Musk, to signal (apparent) total approval of the idea that any Vine/video revival should be a feature inside Twitter, not a standalone product.So make of that what you will.The Vine revival poll (plus Musk’s wider engagement to the chatter it generated) could imply his attention to the topic of video is, at least, genuine — although it’s anyone’s guess whether a Vine reboot is actually being seriously considered, or what that would even mean beyond reviving a brand name if his plan would include a major feature set makeover. (Twitter’s press team did not respond to requests for comment.)It’s equally plausible Musk is doing the equivalent of throwing spaghetti at a wall and seeing which/if bits stick. Or he’s just bored in the small hours and thought he’d bounce another shower thought off-of his fanbase. And/or fancied indulging in a spot of ‘lazy web’ brainstorming outsourcing.As ever where Elon is concerned, the usual caveats apply.Still, Vine’s demise was a pretty self-defeating chapter in Twitter’s company history — so a reboot could offer Musk the chance to rewrite that particular bit of the script and claim incoming hero status with former Vine fans.Bring back Vine? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 31, 2022At the time of writing, more than 2.8M votes had been cast in Musk’s poll about bringing back Vine, with a strong majority (69.4%) voting for a return — although the poll still has 14 hours left to run.Twitter acquired the short form video platform Twitter back in 2013. But, in typical clown car fashion, the company ended up squandering the opportunity to build the fledgling social video platform into a TikTok-style juggernaut, after then-CEO Jack Dorsey opted to ditch the app a few short years later.The shuttering of Vine earned Twitter the baldest of subtweets from Vine’s founder, Rus Yusupov — who had this straight-up warning to other entrepreneurs at the time: “Don’t sell your company!”Ironically enough (given it’s *Twitter* that’s now been sold), Yusupov has chipped into the Musk-initiated chatter around reviving Vine — offering up the (non-serious?) suggestion that Vine should have “69 second videos”.69 second videos — Rus (@rus) October 31, 2022While Vine launched with hyper short videos (of up to 6 seconds), the max upload length was later expanded to 140 seconds — and social video behemoth TikTok has gone way beyond that and even began letting its users upload videos of up to 10mins long earlier this year — so 69 second videos is probably just an attempt to grab Musk’s attention (with a puerile joke), not a serious product suggestion.Regardless, the interaction does indicate that Yusupov is watching what’s unfolding at Twitter with interest.And that’s relevant because this is also not his first foray into tweeting at Musk about Vine: His public timeline remains topped with an earlier tweet — from April 25 — when he posted a photo of himself with the (then) would-be Twitter owner, asking Musk a (rhetorical?) question: “Hey @elonmusk was this meeting about saving Vine? I forget… ”Public response from Musk to that tweet there came none. But the Chief Twit is king of keeping everyone else guessing over what he’s actually going to do next — so, again, you can’t read much/anything into his public silence back then. (Musk did also try to wiggle out of buying Twitter entirely prior to agreeing to closing the deal last week; ergo, there have been a fair few cycles of ups and downs even just over these past few months.)Hey ⁦@elonmusk⁩ was this meeting about saving Vine? I forget…. pic.twitter.com/FgmxIfS8Vx — Rus (@rus) April 25, 2022If Yusupov and Musk have been talking about a Vine reboot, the former’s response to another Twitter user’s question last month — when author Eli Pariser asked the Twitterverse for “the smart take on why Vine died even though it was basically TikTok” — might offer a few clues about what any discussions might have focused on.The Vine founder responded to Pariser by lamenting over not having built the right features “in time” — likely linked to another blindspot he conceded around not understanding the importance of building on trends like lip-sync video — as well as blaming the app’s demise on a failure to help creators monetize.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch835,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/10/agriwebbs-software-seeks-to-boost-yields-lower-environmental-impacts-for-farmers-and-ranchers/,AgriWebb s software seeks to boost yieldslower environmental impacts for farmers and ranchers,"AgriWebb is on a mission to help livestock producers feed the world efficiently, profitably and sustainably by providing its comprehensive, ground-truth database for beef production worldwide.The Australian startup, which builds a livestock management platform for ranchers and farmers, wants to digitize farm records and the meat production process from the cow to the consumer and drive the industry’s animal and environmental welfare transparency.The startup said today it has raised another $6.8 million of funding led by Germin8 Ventures and iSelect Fund. In total, AgriWebb has raised $27 million in Series B and about $29.3 million since its inception in 2014. It did not disclose its valuation when asked.Its app allows users to visualize their operations and give insights on animals and grazing, including the best grass location and which animals gain weight. On top of that, it lets ranchers improve their sustainable land management for better profits and leverage the on-farm data they’re recording to make more intelligent business decisions, according to the company.AgriWebb claims more than 16,000 farmers and ranchers globally are using its cloud-based platform and managing approximately 19 million animals on over 136 million acres of grazing land across the globe, including Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.The global beef market is estimated at $500 billion, but the pure farm management software market in its core geographies is estimated at around $3.5 billion, the company executive chairman Justin Webb told TechCrunch. AgriWebb’s key markets include Australia — where more than 15% of the national herd is managed using its platform — the U.K. and the U.S. Additionally, AgriWebb has partnerships in Brazil and South Africa, Webb said.Unlike most competitors who act as a point solution focused on one or two areas of farm management, AgriWebb’s platform brings together animal management, grazing management and team communication; task and compliance management; and daily record-keeping in one place, Webb explained. “Its grazing insights enable ranchers to maximize productivity, eliminate waste, and validate grazing and animal management decisions in a way that other record-keeping systems can’t touch,” Webb pointed out.Webb founded AgriWebb with John Fargher (chief revenue officer) and Kevin Baum (chief executive officer) in 2014. In Australia, the three founders discovered that farmers were not only interested in the advantages of technology but were also desperately cobbling their own solutions with scrappy spreadsheets and notebooks.“Livestock producers deserve better technology to help them maximize their business and consumers need more reliable provenance for the animal and environmental welfare of their food,” Webb said. “AgriWebb has always been about serving the farmers, and this round of funding doesn’t change our mission; it simply magnifies it.”The latest funding will be used for the international expansion of AgriWebb to ranchers and farmers in the U.S., the U.K., and Latin America, both directly and via partnerships. AgriWebb has secured customers in 28 of the 50 states since its U.S. launch in 2021 and plans to continue rapidly expanding. In addition, the latest funding will enable the company to establish its database.Apart from the funding, AgriWebb recently joined two project proposals to the USDA CSC program, one led by American Farmland Trust and the other by Farm Journal’s Trust in Food initiative, Webb said. Both aim to improve the U.S. beef supply chain’s climate footprint and scale regenerative agriculture practices, Webb continued. One project is focused on improving transparency in the beef supply chain and understanding the GHG impact of different practices; the second aims to scale the adoption of practices through payments for practice changes.“There’s a misconception that agriculture is at odds with climate, but the importance of sustainability and implementing sustainable practices is far from lost on farmers and producers,” Webb said. “In fact, the long-term sustainability and viability of their land are of utmost importance. Talk to any landholder and you’ll understand their long-term goal is to pass on their land in better condition to the next generation. Sustainable and regenerative practices can and do exist in tandem with productive and profitable farms, and we remain steadfast in our endeavor to support producers now and in the future through data that measures, manages and improves the sustainability of the food supply chain from farm to plate.”The company raised its first Series B from investors, including Telus Ventures, Grosvenor Food & AgTech and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in January 2021.“AgriWebb fits with Germin8’s thesis to invest in the full-stack enterprise software companies within AgTech that bring essential enterprise value to farmers in alignment with practices that are sustainable,” said managing partner at Germin8 Ventures Michael Lavin. “There are very few software offerings capable of accelerating the regenerative agriculture practices our climate stands to benefit from, and even fewer that target livestock production rather than being at odds with it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch836,https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/agbiome-lands-166m-for-safer-crop-protection-technology/,AgBiome lands M for safer crop protection technology,"AgBiome, developing products from microbial communities, brought in a $116 million Series D round as the company prepares to pad its pipeline with new products.The company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., was co-founded in 2012 by a group including co-CEOs Scott Uknes and Eric Ward, who have known each other for over 30 years. They created the Genesis discovery platform to capture diverse microbes for agricultural applications, like crop protection, and screen the strains for the best assays that would work for insect, disease and nematode control.“The microbial world is immense,” said Uknes, who explained that there is estimated to be a trillion microbes, but only 1% have been discovered. The microbes already discovered are used by humans for things like pharmaceuticals, food and agriculture. AgBiome built its database in Genesis to house over 100,000 microbes and every genome in every microbe was sequenced into hundreds of strains.The company randomly selects strains and looks for the best family of strains with a certain activity, like preventing fungus on strawberries, and creates the product.Its first fungicide product, Howler, was launched last year and works on more than 300 crop-disease combinations. The company saw 10x sales growth in 2020, Uknes told TechCrunch. As part of farmers’ integrated pest program, they often spray fungicide applications 12 times per year in order to yield fruits and vegetables.Due to its safer formula, Howler can be used as the last spray in the program, and its differentiator is a shorter re-entry period — farmers can spray in the morning and be able to go back out in the field in the afternoon. It also has a shorter pre-harvest time of four hours after application. Other fungicides on the market today require seven days before re-entry and pre-harvest, Uknes explained.AgBiome aims to add a second fungicide product, Theia, in early 2022, while a third, Esendo was submitted for Environmental Protection Agency registration. Uknes expects to have 11 products, also expanding into insecticides and herbicides, by 2025.The oversubscribed Series D round was co-led by Blue Horizon and Novalis LifeSciences and included multiple new and existing investors. The latest investment gives AgBiome over $200 million in total funding to date. The company’s last funding round was a $65 million Series C raised in 2018.While competitors in synthetic biology often sell their companies to someone who can manufacture their products, Uknes said AgBiome decided to manufacture and commercialize the products itself, something he is proud of his team for being able to do.“We want to feed the world responsibly, and these products have the ability to substitute for synthetic chemicals and provide growers a way to protect their crops, especially as consumers want natural, sustainable tools,” he added.The company has grown to over 100 employees and will use the new funding to accelerate production of its two new products, building out its manufacturing capacity in North America and expanding its footprint internationally. Uknes anticipates growing its employee headcount to 300 in the next five years.AgBiome anticipates rolling up some smaller companies that have a product in production to expand its pipeline in addition to its organic growth. As a result, Uknes said he was particular about the kind of investment partners that would work best toward that goal.Przemek Obloj, managing partner at Blue Horizon, was introduced to the company by existing investors. His firm has an impact fund focused on the future of food and began investing in alternative proteins in 2016 before expanding that to delivery systems in agriculture technology, he said.Obloj said AgBiome is operating in a $60 billion market where the problems include products that put toxic chemicals into the ground that end up in water systems. While the solution would be to not do that, not doing that would mean produce doesn’t grow as well, he added.The change in technology in agriculture is enabling Uknes and Ward to do something that wasn’t possible 10 years ago because there was not enough compute or storage power to discover and sequence microbes.“We don’t want to pollute the Earth, but we have to find a way to feed 9 billion people by 2050,” Obloj said. “With AgBiome, there is an alternative way to protect crops than by polluting the Earth or having health risks.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cost, flavor, and convenience are all factors in this imbalance, but as health statistics show, we should be working harder to reverse our dietary trends.A startup called PairWise is out to help change the way we eat by making fruits and vegetables more appealing. The company is zeroing in on traits that may deter people from consuming produce and tweaking those traits using CRISPR gene editing. Their hope is that the resulting products will not only pique consumers’ interest, but keep them healthy and keep them coming back. Tom Adams, PairWise cofounder and CEO, shared details about the company and its products in an interview.CRISPR’d ProduceCRISPR was first used to edit bacterial DNA in 2012. Since then, scientists have used the tool to edit the genomes of crops, animals, and even humans, and have begun testing it as a means of curing inherited conditions from blindness to muscular dystrophy and other genetic diseases.CRISPR is made up of a synthesized sequence of guide RNA that matches a target DNA sequence—that is, the portion of DNA to be altered—and a Cas enzyme. Once in a cell’s nucleus, the guide RNA links up with the target DNA sequence. The Cas enzyme cuts the DNA at that point, and the cell repairs the cut. The repairs can either knock out a gene, inactivating it, or insert a new sequence.Modifying a gene that encodes for a given trait either eliminates or alters that trait; in the case of fruits and vegetables, say, the bitterness of mustard greens or the seeds in blackberries. Given that the genomes of PairWise products are modified, some consumers may want to know whether the fruits and vegetables are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs).The short answer is no. The USDA doesn’t regulate gene-edited plants as long as their traits could have occurred through traditional breeding methods or a whim of nature. The CRISPR technique PairWise uses involves manipulating genes that exist naturally in a given species’ genome. “The changes PairWise has made in our greens are no different than what can be achieved through conventional breeding, contain no foreign DNA, and therefore are not considered GMOs,” Adams said.GMOs, on the other hand, can contain genes from other species, and wouldn’t come about naturally even after decades of traditional breeding. Bt crops, for example, are engineered to contain a natural form of pesticide derived from bacteria, which means they don’t need to be sprayed with chemical pesticides.Adams pointed out that the anti-GMO sentiment out there isn’t necessarily about resistance to the technology itself. “There’s a lot of reasons GMOs may be less popular, and one of them is that people didn’t feel there was transparency,” he said. “Most of the products that fall under the category GMO are things that get added to foods as ingredients, and nobody knew when they were getting it and when they weren’t, and it created this stigma.”He wants PairWise to take a more proactive and transparent approach. “We’re going to be very clear about the processes we’re using to create the products, and it’s your choice whether you like the benefits or you’re worried about the technology,” he said.Next-Gen ProduceThe first product PairWise will bring to market is a milder-tasting version of mustard greens. “Almost four years ago, we were searching for things we could do that were amenable to the technology but also were addressing a consumer need,” Adams said.The company’s market research found that people often ended up buying romaine lettuce even after saying they’d prefer kale or another green because of their greater nutritional value. “People want healthy salads, but they keep buying romaine because they’re used to the flavor,” Adams said. Ease of preparation is a factor too.Mustard greens, Adams told me, are a relative of kale, but they taste like horseradish when you bite into them. Two components come together that react and cause the horseradish flavor. PairWise used CRISPR-Cas12a to edit the green’s genome and remove one of those components. “It’s really just removing something that the plant doesn’t need for survival and doesn’t contribute to the nutritional benefits,” Adams said. The mustard greens have already been approved by the FDA and will start being sold in California and the Pacific Northwest in early 2023 under the brand Conscious Foods.The company’s not stopping there, though; they have multiple fruit and veggie improvement projects underway.One is a softer version of kale. If you’ve ever made a kale salad from the stuff that comes still on the stalk, you know it’s labor-intensive: there’s the washing, the de-stemming, the chopping, the massaging… (that’s right, massaging!). PairWise kale will retain all of the leafy green’s nutritional properties, but have a texture more like lettuce, making it easier to prepare and eat.Another is seedless berries, including blackberries and raspberries. Hate how those tiny seeds get stuck in your teeth, always in the hardest-to-reach places? CRISPR to the rescue.One of the company’s most intriguing projects, in my opinion, is pitless cherries.“I love cherries, but they’re a pain to eat,” Adams said. “Your fingers are all red when you’re done with a few of them, and if there’s not a trash can nearby you don’t know what to do with the pit.” I asked him how it’s possible to grow a cherry—or any other stone fruit, like plums, peaches, or apricots—without the pit, as it connects to the fruit’s stem and is its lifeline to the tree.“It’s easiest to think about it like a seedless grape,” he said. “It actually still has a seed in it, but the seed has lost its hard outer shell. There’s still that nutritious plant embryo that’s normally protected by the shell, we’re just making it so it’s all edible.” If they succeed, eating pitless cherries will be a different experience altogether; isn’t having to remove the pit the only thing keeping us from stuffing handfuls of the scrumptious fruit into our mouths at once?A Whole New PlantWhen it comes to cherries, it’s not just the end product PairWise is focusing on. Currently 90 percent of sweet cherries are grown in Washington state, where there’s little to no rain in the summer. The fruit is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and can only thrive in a dry climate; this specificity and the fact that the fruit needs to be shipped from the far northwest corner of the country pushes up its price. But what if cherries could grow in, say, Michigan, or Kansas, or Vermont?“We think we understand the genetics well enough that we could modify the architecture of the tree so that it’s more like a blueberry bush,” Adams said. “And then you can grow them in more environments and put them at less risk.”PairWise is also trying to alter the way blackberries grow. The moisture sensitivity has already been taken care of by nature, as has the bush-not-tree situation—but the bushes have thorns, and thorns make fruit hard to harvest. The company is working on cutting out the thorns.Here’s an idea: blueberry-sized cherries without a pit that grow on bushes without thorns in any climate. Seems like a product that would need a whole new name, and heck if I have any suggestions. (Not to mention, it probably wouldn’t occur naturally no matter how many generations you waited.)Getting HealthierBe it softer kale, pitless cherries, or thornless bushes, PairWise’s mission is to create a healthier world by taking away barriers to eating fresh produce. “We’re interested in anything that moves the needle on the fact that only 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables,” Adams said. “It really doesn’t change very much just by telling people they should eat more of them. Our idea is, you need to take down the barriers.”It’s certainly a noble aim. But how likely is engineered produce to play an instrumental role in changing consumers’ habits, or in attracting a previously-veggie-averse demographic? People who already buy and eat kale on a regular basis may opt for a smoother kale 2.0, but people who have never bought kale may not be so easily swayed by a newfangled version of the green.Adams believes there’s a consumer base out there who will benefit from products like PairWise’s. “There are people who are looking for a healthy lifestyle,” he said. “And they’re looking for something different in salads. We’re coming in with a new category: a nutritious green that still tastes good.”Physical traits of produce may be one barrier that deters people from buying them, but cost is equally important (if not more so). With years of research and development going into CRISPR’d produce, my assumption was that it won’t be affordable. Ten dollars for a bag of lettuce-like kale? No thanks.Not the case, according to Adams. “There’s a fairly wide range of pricing within the salad space. We expect to be in the top quartile of the pricing, but we’re not going to be above it,” he said. Production of PairWise greens, he added, is actually quite cost-competitive with other types of salad greens.Based on marketing activation events the company ran over the summer in Seattle, Austin, and Palo Alto, the outlook for their first product looks pretty rosy. They gave away bags of salad (which were clearly labeled as being gene-edited) consisting of red- and green-leaf mustard greens, and asked people to complete a short survey about it. Adams estimated that more than 6,000 people tried the salads, and over 90 percent responded that they were “very motivated” or “somewhat motivated” to buy the product.A New Green Revolution?Helping people make healthier dietary choices is just one benefit that CRISPR could bring to produce. Its possibilities are wide-ranging, as evidenced by PairWise’s work to create fruit trees that can grow in different climates and yield food that’s easier to harvest. It’s not unlike Norman Borlaug’s work back in the 1940s to create a high-yield wheat seed that was resistant to stem rust—a project that ended up saving millions of people from hunger and famine.The difference is that technology has taken over the painstaking, time-consuming steps Borlaug had to slog through, like pollinating and inspecting thousands of plants by hand (a hundred and ten thousand in just one growing season! Talk about labor-intensive).Adams sees PairWise’s work similarly and believes CRISPR holds all sorts of possibilities for a new frontier of engineered foods. “We’re doing the same thing as traditional plant breeders, but it’s just faster,” he said. “We could create a lot more resilience for the whole food system.”Image Credit: Anrita from Pixabay",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a big category that’s going to require a number of solutions to various problems, though lately it’s been hit by a number of false starts. Abundant Robotics, for instance, went under, only to be resurrected by a new brand currently exploring the equity crowdfunding route. Meanwhile, strawberry-picking Traptic quite literally took itself out of the field, getting snapped up by Bowery for vertical farming applications.Founded in 2018, East Bay-based Verdant Robotics has raised $21.5 million to date, including an $11.5 million Series A, back in 2019. The firm appears to be casting its net fairly wide, though it’s starting specifically with carrot crops, offering up its system through a RaaS (robotics as a service) model to select farmers.The model seems to make the most sense for these systems — at least during the early stages. Likely most important to a company like Verdant is getting as many of its robotic systems as possible out to farms for real-world testing and data collection. Rental is a much easier way to do that, versus selling them outright — especially for an as of yet early technology, which likely requires technicians to implement (or at least monitor) these systems.The “autonomous farm-robot” does dual-duty — spraying and laser weeding — while building AI-based crop modeling, designed to give farmers a better picture of what their plants crave.“Farmers told us not to give them more data, but to figure out what to do with the mountains of data they already have, or better yet just go do it,” Verdant co-founder and CEO Gabe Sibley says. “They want a complete solution that takes action in real time and keeps farmers in control — all while improving profitability and automating dangerous, back-breaking field work.”The company says it logged “thousands” of hours over the course of 2021 and plans to fully commercialize a “precision multi-action machine for orchard” next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most notably, Telefarm connects consumers with organic farmers and their produce, while it also helps with processes such as storage, transportation, manufacturing, and even the hiring of farm workers.It’s an interesting move for Rakuten, which is best known for its online shopping empire in Japan, where it has also expanding into financial, a mobile service and more. Rakuten’s presence outside of Japan has been less successful. While it has invested in a range of U.S. companies including Lyft and Pinterest, and it has acquired firms like chat app Viber, video platform Viki, and U.S. coupon site Ebates, the company has withdrawn from less lucrative regions as part of a new strategy.Organic farming, or organic products, could be a part of that new focus in Japan. Rakuten said that this invest in Telefarm would lead to it launching new products in its domestic market.With the working population in the agricultural industry steadily declining, coupled with Japan’s aging population, labor shortages in the industry are becoming a serious problem, and the amount of deserted arable land is increasing every year. Farmers are facing serious challenges, with initial investment and unstable revenues posing obstacles for new farmers, and the securement of stable sales channels and a shortage of successors presenting challenges for established, small-scale farmers. Going forward, Rakuten will explore the development of new services in the agriculture field through the internet, while aiming to contribute to regional revitalization through the utilization of deserted arable land and support for new farmers.Beyond scaling back parts of its global business, Rakuten recently embraced drones — running its first trial on a golf course — and earlier this month it struck an agreement to bring a selection of premium Japanese goods to China via Kaola, the cross-border e-commerce service operated by Chinese internet giant NetEase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

other news sites844,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/sep/18/leading-the-whey-the-synthetic-milk-startups-shaking-up-the-dairy-industry,Leading the wheythe synthetic milk startups shaking up the dairy industry,"In 1931, Winston Churchill predicted the rise of animal-free food. Then an opposition MP in his wilderness years, Churchill wrote an essay that imagined life in 50 years’ time. “Synthetic food will, of course, be used in the future,” he wrote.The artificial stuff would “be practically indistinguishable from the natural products, and any changes will be so gradual as to escape observation,” Churchill wrote. “Microbes, which at present convert the nitrogen of the air into proteins by which animals live, will be fostered and made to work under controlled conditions just as yeast is now.”Though several decades later than envisaged, Churchill’s prediction has been borne out by the development of lab-grown meat and, more recently, animal-free dairy products.Synthetic milk has emerged as a new potential alternative to cow’s milk, one that – unlike plant-based oat, nut and soy milks – purports to replicate its taste, appearance and mouthfeel. Described by experts as the future of milk, it has been touted as an environmentally friendly option that may shake up the dairy industry – and leave small-scale farmers in the lurch.“Lab-grown milk is considered the next food frontier,” says Dr Diana Bogueva, of Curtin University’s Sustainability Policy Institute, citing the growing popularity of dairy alternatives. Compared with dairy production, synthetic milk is likely to have a smaller carbon footprint and cause less pollution, and obviously eliminates animal welfare concerns, she says.The industry is expanding rapidly. In the US, cow-free dairy proteins produced by the firm Perfect Day are now widely used in products including ice-cream, cream cheese, chocolate and protein powders. Another American startup, New Culture, is commercialising a synthetic milk-based mozzarella, while the Israeli firm Remilk has set up a giant facility in Denmark to produce cheese, yoghurt and ice-cream.It will be some time before cow-free milk arrives in Australian supermarkets, but startups such as All G Foods and the CSIRO spin-off company Eden Brew are racing to bring products to market within the next two years.Yeast of EdenChemically, milk is mostly water – about 87%, to be precise. Milk solids comprise the rest: fats, proteins, sugars – primarily lactose – and minerals. By Australian law, at least 3.2% of the liquid in full-cream milk must be fat and another 3% protein.Most synthetic dairy companies are focusing on producing milk proteins using a process known as precision fermentation. It involves genetically programming yeast or other microorganisms using synthetic DNA to produce a specific protein. Jim Fader, the co-founder of Eden Brew, compares the process to beer brewing.“We use yeast to make a protein to make a drink. They use yeast to make alcohol to make a drink,” he says.There are at least 20 proteins in cow’s milk, about 80% of which are casein proteins, found in the curds; the rest are whey proteins, perhaps most familiar as a component of powdered protein shakes.Aggregates of casein, known as micelles, give milk its characteristic appearance and heat stability.“The micelle plays a fundamental role in many parts of milk,” Fader says. “For example, when it binds with calcium, it makes the milk look white. If you want to froth your milk and put it in your cappuccino, the ability for the milk to withstand that heat and the bubbles to be able to form … is also down to the micelle.”Synthetic milk technology is ‘less about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairy’ but ‘augmenting supply’, Jim Fader says. Photograph: ReutersEden Brew is producing six proteins that are most abundant in milk. Once brewed, these will be purified and dried.A key investor in the firm is the New South Wales dairy cooperative Norco, which will be responsible for rehydrating and blending the proteins. At this stage, other components such as minerals and coconut-based fat will be added. The end product will be lactose-free, with a small quantity of table sugar used to approximate the sweetness of cow’s milk.Fader says the firm will launch an ice-cream – simpler than milk because it can be made with just two proteins – around December next year. Milk will follow, likely in August 2024.All G Foods is focusing its efforts on whey proteins. The firm’s plant-based meat products are already served in commercial burger chains and sold in some supermarkets.The company’s chief scientific officer, Jared Raynes, says the ultimate goal is to produce yoghurts, cheese and fresh milk. But the firm’s focus for now is on beta-lactoglobulin, the main protein in whey.“We are going to be applying for regulatory approval with our protein powder,” he says.Parallels with synthetic fabricsMilena Bojovic, who is completing a PhD at Macquarie University, says while the promise of cow-free fresh milk has been widely trumpeted, the impact of synthetic dairy is likely to be greater on products such as milk powder.“Fresh milk consumption is on the decline,” she says and consumers may be wary of drinking a synthetic version of a natural product. She points out that traditional dairy production is also “very much technologically mitigated, from conception to the birth of calves to the milking process”.“If synthetic milk really takes off, the biggest disruption I think will be if it can be powdered and used in the ingredients space … as an additive like milk solids, which is in a lot of processed foods,” Bojovic says. “I don’t think most consumers are questioning where the milk solids in their KitKat came from.”“If and possibly when that happens, that will be one of the major disruptions for dairy industries that are producing exclusively for export in the form of powdered milk.”Bojovic, who has analysed global dairy trends as part of her research, is concerned that technological advances may leave farmers behind. Large dairy players such as Norco and Fonterra, a New Zealand multinational cooperative, have begun to invest in synthetic protein production.“Small-scale operations are really going to struggle in the context of global dairy consolidation,” she says. “There’s more pressure on farmers to innovate and also to invest in technology to make sure that they’re at the standard that bigger corporates are at.”Bojovic sees parallels with the rise of synthetic fabrics. “When synthetic fibres hit the market, that decimated the wool industry in a lot of regions,” she says. “It’s not the first time that farmers have been faced with the threat of synthetics, but they’ve adapted, they’ve innovated.”Melissa Cameron, Dairy Australia’s human health and nutrition policy manager, says it is yet to be seen how consumers will respond to a synthetic product. She points to statistics suggesting that 58% of Australian households exclusively buy fresh and long-life cow’s milk.“People are not abandoning dairy,” she says. “The commercialisation of synthetic proteins and products to a scale that makes these products available widely to consumers is yet quite a while off. As our populations grow around the world, synthetic products will deliver complementary protein and products. There will be room for all.”Dairy demand worldwide grew by 36% between 2007 and 2017 and is expected to keep rising as the world’s population increases and per-capita consumption grows.Fader says the technology that companies such as Eden Brew are developing is “less about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairy”. Rather, “it’s about augmenting the current supply because demand is forecast to go up by so much”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch845,https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/source-seed-funding/,Source makes greenhouses smarter to secure the future of food supply,"Agtech startup Source.ag today announced it harvested a $10 million investment to make greenhouses smarter. The founders have set their eyes on a horizon where, driven by climate change and a rapid increase in global food demand as population continues to increase, more crops are being forced indoors to secure greater crop yields. You wouldn’t believe the amount of restraint it takes to not make a pun about seed funding in a piece about greenhouses. I have no such restraint, so let’s report on this, ahem, growth industry.The $10 million funding round was led by Acre Venture Partners, with participation from the E14 fund and food-focused venture firm Astanor ventures. The company also raised from industry insiders, including the international association of (mostly) salad growers Harvest House, tomato specialists Agrocare and bell pepper specialists Rainbow Growers.The company is developing software to empower greenhouses to get smarter. The company argues that greenhouse agriculture is a safer, more reliable and more climate-resilient mode of food production, producing up to 15 times higher yields, using a twentieth as much water as traditional agriculture. What Source adds to the mix is the ability to use data and AI to help greenhouses operate at even higher levels of efficiency and repeatability of high-yield harvests.“Climate change is driving substantial scarcity and strains in our global food supply. As this accelerates in the coming years, we must find ways to scale efficient growing solutions that lighten the footprint of agriculture,” said Lucas Mann, managing partner at Acre. “Greenhouse agriculture is a proven and viable solution, but without innovation, demand will be impossible to meet. We believe Source.ag can play a vital role in driving its global scalability.”The funding will be used to accelerate product development and expand commercial collaborations.“Greenhouses come in all shapes and forms — both more and less technically advanced. On the higher-tech side, want to have control over every dimension you can imagine, including humidity, irrigation and nutrition. Tomatoes, for example, don’t grow in soil. They go in substrate slabs. That means that these operations are arable land independent,” explains Rien Kamman, co-founder ad CEO at Source. “Because you have more control, you’ll have to make more decisions every day. Growers are making decisions on 60-70 parameters every day, which influences how this crop will grow for the rest of the season. You need to get the decision right every day. This might include what to feed the plant, plant-specific parameters, pruning, etc. It’s really a craft and this is why it’s still so hard. You need decades of experience to be doing well at it.”The complexity of the farming operation itself isn’t in doubt, and Source’s pitch is to take all of these growth parameters, combine that with historical crop yield data and market pricing etc., to create a better experience for the growers.“Our system is comprised of two aspects. One is a recommendation system that assesses the current state of the plant. It looks at forward-looking predictors like resource prices, weather, etc. And then gives very concrete recommendations to the grower. What should you do today and tomorrow, both on the plant (i.e. how should you trim it, prune it, etc.) and on the indoor climate around the plants to maximize sustainability and production. The second part is what happens when something doesn’t go to plan? This is where the algorithms come in,” Kamman says. “They collaborate with the different control systems to take that strategy and actually make sure to do so implemented in the most efficient way possible.”Indoor farming still requires a fair chunk of manual labor, especially for big-vine crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, etc.; but Source suggests that it can be helpful there, too — by choosing how and where to prune or how many crops to leave to ripen on the vine, you can affect various aspects of the plants’ growth. The interesting thing is overlaying real-time pricing data here — by speeding up or slowing down ripening, I can imagine that could potentially time the harvest time around when your competitors have ripe products, potentially even trading lower yields for better prices, or working with temperatures and weather conditions to reduce production costs, for example.The company is running on a SaaS model, charging growers on a sliding scale depending on the amount of space they are using for growing.“Our belief is that agriculture is at an inflection point in history. [Farming] that brought us to where we are today won’t bring us to 10 billion people with a more changing extreme climate. This is a massive market — the need for climate-resilient food systems is going to increase. And then we haven’t even talked about what other traditional agriculture crops could be moved indoors in the next decades,” says Kamman. “I think that what unites our investors and our team is that we’re not so much looking at these advantages short term, but we can build knowledge that is scalable globally.”The company declined to share screenshots of its product, stating it was “competitively sensitive”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch846,https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/solar-foods-solein/,Solar Foods wants to replace industrial animal farming with a high tech protein harvest,"Fermentation has a long, rich history in food production, from beer and wine to yogurt and cheese, leavened bread and coffee, miso and tempeh, sauerkraut and kimchi, to name just a few of the tasty things we can consume thanks to a chemical process thought to date back to the Neolithic period. But if this 2017-founded Finnish startup, Solar Foods, has its way, fermentation could have a very special place in the future of human food too.The industrial biotech startup is working on bringing a novel protein to market — one it says will offer a nutritious, sustainable alternative to animal-derived proteins. The product, a single-cell protein it’s branding Solein, is essentially an edible bacteria; a single-cell microbe grown using gas fermentation. Or, put another way, they’re harvesting edible calories from hydrogen-oxyidizing microbes.“Technically it’s like a brewery,” explains CEO and co-founder Dr. Pasi Vainikka in an interview with TechCrunch. “Like fermentation technologies are. It’s not that strange [a process] — there is this one difference, which is the feedstock.”The production of Solein requires just a handful of ‘ingredients’: Air, water and energy (electricity) — which means there’s no need for vast tracts of agricultural land to be given out to making this future foodstuff. It could be produced in factories located in remote areas or inside cities and urban centers.Nor indeed are other foods needed to feed it to create an adequate yield, as is the case with rearing livestock for human consumption. So the promise looks immense. (As Vainikka argues: “Land use and energy use are the two main problems of human kind — and the rest follows from these two.)Nutritionally speaking, Solein resembles some existing foodstuffs — sitting between dried meat, dried carrot or dried soy in terms of the blend of vitamins, amino acids, proteins (overall, it’s 65% protein), per Vainikka. “So it’s very familiar but it’s a bit [of a] new combination,” he suggests, adding: “The taste is very mild, very neutral.” (A mild taste may not sound especially scintillating for the tastebuds but it means it’s easy to include as an ingredient in a wide range of foods without the need for a strong flavor to be masked.)While Solar Foods has essentially discovered a new species through its fermentation process, the microbe itself obviously hasn’t just appeared on planet Earth — and is likely very ancient; perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. So there’s a fascinating blend of old and new coming together in the startup’s bioreactor.Why is finding new forms of protein important? The problem Solar Foods is aiming to tackle is that the environmental costs of livestock-based meat production are indisputably massive — whether you’re talking unsustainable land and water use; climate-heating emissions and pollution; or animal welfare concerns. But what if you could produce billions of nutritious meals without the need to deforest huge swathes of land and slaughter masses of livestock to produce the food? What if humanity could feed itself and stop consuming the planet in the process?That’s the promise and the core differentiator that Solar Foods claims vs. animal-derived proteins.If you compare Solein to the growing gaggle of plant-based meat alternatives, they do still rely upon land being farmed to produce the necessary plants — whether soy or pea or oat, etc. — that form the basis of their products. Although they need far less land than meat production requires so the environment upside is still very real. But Solar Foods sees itself blending into this competitive mix — selling Solein to companies producing plant-based foods as another ingredient they can use to cook up nutritious, environmentally friendly meals.“Cereals, vegetables, fruits, herbs aren’t going anywhere,” says Vainikka, discussing how Solein might fit into an evolved food production system. “So if we go back to the original problem — 80% of all the problems that have to do with food, whether it’s loss of natural habitat or forest loss or whatever, has to do with the industrialized animal production … So actually Solein could solve 80% of the problem but 20% of the calories because mostly we are, on a calorie basis, eating carbohydrates.”And if you’re excited about the promise of lab-grown meat — which is also seeking to delink protein production from land use — Vainikka says the startup is supportive of such efforts since, once again, it’s spying potential customers as he says cultivated/lab-grown meat producers could use Solein to feed the cell cultures they’re using to grow slaughter-free steaks.So use cases for Solar Foods’ edible bacteria look broad, provided people are willing to eat it (or have it fed to something in their food chain). Conceivably it could even be used as a feedstock for livestock — although the startup’s messaging is focused on the need to transform a broken food system and enter “the era of sustainable food production,” as its website puts it.It is also working on developing a closed-loop system in which the sole byproduct of its production process — water containing bits of the Solein protein — would be continuously recycled back into production of more of the foodstuff. And if it can pull that off, the edible bacteria could potentially function as a life support system for humans on space missions where the timescales are too long for astronauts to rely on food supplies brought with them from Earth (such as, for example, a mission to Mars).“The specific thing that we think is different in what we’re doing — compared to anything else on the market today — is that we don’t use any agriculture in the foods,” Vainikka tells TechCrunch. “Electricity and carbon dioxide are the main ingredients — instead of sunlight and carbohydrates or oils. So that’s the fundamental point where the disconnection of food production from agriculture happens.“That’s our thing. And the reason to do that is once you can delink the connection between use of land and land-use impacts and food production then basically all the environmental benefits fall on your lap that there can be in relation to food production.”Down here on Earth, being able to unhitch food production from the vagaries of seasonal weather and other factors that can have major impacts on agricultural yields — such as pests, natural disasters, issues with supply chains specific to farming and so on — is another touted advantage for Solar Foods’ approach. “Security of supply … consistency and quality,” says Vainikka, checking off some of the added advantages he says the edible protein offers vs. traditional farming, i.e., on top of the massive heap of land-delinking-based environmental gains which could — for example — support a mass reforestation of farm land, promoting biodiversity and fighting global warming since trees suck up CO2.Europe’s energy crisis bitesSolein looks like a no-brainer on the environmental front. But one key component of its production — energy, i.e., electricity — is facing supply issues of its own in Europe at present in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. (Russia being a major but unreliable supplier of gas to Europe.)Solar Foods’ long-term bet is on energy production costs being brought down (or, well, stabilized) by widespread access to cheap renewables — such as wind and hydro energy in the north of Europe and solar in the sunny south. Thing is, for now, the European energy markets are typically structured so that the wholesale price of energy is linked to the cost of the most expensive type of energy (fossil fuel derived) despite there already being a fair amount of renewable energy available which is far cheaper to produce. (Hence why if the price of gas goes up the wholesale price of energy rises, and the bill payer must pay more even if their energy supplier sources their energy from cheaper to produce renewable sources.)Since the Ukraine war started, Europe has been facing an exacerbated supply vs. demand issue. And over the past several months it’s been hard for Europeans to escape energy price spikes as their governments have sought to reduce reliance on Russian gas imports — shrinking energy supply options and helping keep war-spiked wholesale prices high.The coming winter looks very grim, with Russia recently electing to entirely shutter gas exports via its Nord Stream pipeline to Germany in what looks like an attempt to weaken Western support for the pro-Ukraine sanctions. So energy supply in Europe has become a weapon of economic war.It’s an incredibly volatile situation but one thing is clear: Europe’s ‘competitive’ marginal-cost-based energy markets are in desperate need of structural reform — to reflect the cheaper production costs of renewables and ensure consumers and businesses aren’t at the mercy of fossil fuel volatility and cripplingly high prices linked to Russian aggression.But, in the meanwhile, with electricity being a key component of Solar Foods’ process, the startup is having to manage what Vainikka — who has a background in energy economics that he says allows him to understand where the markets are headed — refers to with classic Nordic understatement as “turbulence.”He suggests Solar Foods may therefore need to wait out the current energy crisis before it’s able to scale commercial production of Solein in a way that’s economically viable — though it’s banking on Europe being able to find a way through to more stable electricity prices in the not too distant future. (In recent days, the Commission has said it will be coming with an emergency reform plan to curb energy prices — both in the short term and over the longer run, to ensure prices reflect cheaper renewables.)“At the moment we shouldn’t make electricity supply agreements for our factory. We can’t be on the market today to make those agreements,” confirms Vainikka. “Because of this [energy price volatility] — it’s a fact. The second [thing] is we are quite happy that we are not fermenting natural gas — we are fermenting electricity. So we have an opportunity to make a good deal after turbulence.”“We need to replace fossil fuels with electricity so we need a lot of new generation capacity which is also a problem in the market but we’re confident that this works,” he adds. “Unfortunately there is this turbulence now.”Solar Foods is pressing on regardless of the current energy crisis.It’s in the process of building its first factory — actually a demo facility, as a step on the road to future commercial scaling up of Solein production — at a cost of around €40 million, drawing on backing from a number of VC funds since 2017, over seed and Series A rounds, as well as raising debt financing (such as €15 million from Danske Bank Growth earlier this year).The demo facility at least won’t have major energy requirements to run. (Although he says it’s still holding off on signing an energy supply contract for now.)“We’ll manage the turbulence but of course it would be better for it not to continue too long,” says Vainikka. “We’re using this demo [facility] operated by one wind turbine to prove that this scales — but the real factories would be 100x larger in terms of energy use, 50x larger — and it would need rather 50 turbines to run a huge facility that will produce half a billion meals. Then you must get a good [energy supply] contract and if we were investing into that factory now it might be postponed because of the turbulence.”Good food and food for good?With the demo factory set to come on stream in 2023, Solar Foods’ hope is the first consumer product containing Solein will be on the market by the end of next year (or, failing that, in early 2024). Which global market will get the first commercial taste of the novel protein will depend on regulatory clearances.Solar Foods has applied for clearance in multiple jurisdictions but can’t predict whether regulators in Europe or the U.S. or Asia will be first with approval, given variances in this process. (But Vainikka says it’s possible the first clearance could happen this year.)What the first product for sale to consumers that contains Solein will be also isn’t yet clear.Vainikka suggests a few possibilities — such as that it could be added to existing foods like breakfast cereals or vegan meals for fortification purposes (owing to its vitamin and mineral content, such as iron and B vitamins); or as a main ingredient in plant-based meat replacement products, replacing stuff like pea protein. Or he says it could be used as an egg replacement in pasta or pastry production. Or as a principle ingredient in ice cream or yogurt (or even to make a spreadable faux cheese).“We leave the final formulation and product development for our customers so that we can empower them to renew categories,” he suggests. “And make having a food an act for good.”“Frankly as a company we think that it might be a good idea to focus on what we master — which is this conversion-fermentation; producing this ingredient and so that it would have the functionalities needed for food products,” he continues, expanding on Solar Foods’ decision to stay in its biotech lane. “There are so many, so huge, or so experienced or so old [food] companies on the market who have already access to the consumer, all the experience regarding textures, product development regarding all kinds of plant-based ingredients and so on. So when we introduce Solein into the market you would not only need to get everything right, what we are doing and mastering now, but also the final product — of course taste and texture is decisive.”“So that’s a heavy investment program that we’ve dived into,” he adds, emphasizing the still extensive range of requirements for developing a product that’s designed even to be an ingredient in processed foods that people eat.“Nutrition must be there … then second is safety, then functionality, of course — how it works and forms texture — and then scaling and production technology; who has it, how does it work, is it scalable, and how does the supply chain work — so who’s really the gatekeeper? So this we are in the middle of now … A lot will happen in the next 12-16 months.”While Solar Foods won’t be a food product maker itself it does have an R&D lab where it carries out culinary experiments with its product — and images on its website show a selection of demo foodstuffs, from chicken-style chunks served with pasta to soup, bread and a breakfast smoothies, all with a distinctive rich yellow hue.In its refined form — i.e., after it’s passed through Solar Foods’ electrolyzing and fermenting bioreactors and been dried — Solein takes the form of a yellow powder (the hue is down to betacarotene it naturally contains).The strong color makes it looks a bit like a custom blend of turmeric and cumin. But tastewise it’s nothing like that strong. Per Vainikka, one expert taster who sampled it suggested it was akin to dried carrot. But whether you’re a fan of carrots is beside the point; he emphasizes that the taste is mild enough that it can be easily masked in whatever food product it was being incorporated into — just without the added nutrients going anywhere.For example, in the sample case of adding Solein to pasta, Vainikka says it would — nutritionally speaking — be akin to eating, say, a plate of spaghetti bolognese with all the nourishment derived from an animal-based ingredient but without the need to have any minced meat on the plate. Which, well, might take some swallowing for those used to consuming traditional (and oftentimes culturally significant) recipes. (An Italian I described this meatless but nutritionally meat-like pasta dish to at a dinner party I attended recently was visibly shocked at the prospect and a second Italian she started to explain the concept to responded by suggesting we should focus on having fun eating the actual food on our plates instead of talking about, er, such high-concept stuff, so, well, there may be some acceptance humps in the short term.)But as plant-based faux meats advance in taste and texture it’s easy to envisage creative food producers being able to whip up something that has a meat-like taste and texture and — thanks to the addition of Solein — is also imbued with similar levels of protein, iron and vitamins as actual meat. And that could be a strong selling point for consumers, especially with the current food fad for high-protein eating.Other food ideas Solar Foods has been experimenting with in its labs are ‘cheese’ ball lollypops, mayonnaises and dressings, pancakes and plenty more besides.Vainikka says he hopes the first commercial food to contain the ingredient won’t be a burger — since there are so many meat-alternative patty options out there already. But he suggests it could be a “meat-like bite” — something akin to a nugget — such as might be be served in an Asian hot pot or similar. “Then yogurt, ice cream, soup, bakery pastry application is something that might go first,” he postulates.“You could imagine it could be a frozen food, fresh or even on the street kitchen of an Asian city,” he also suggests, saying the startup is keen to branch out and “appreciate different food cultures on the planet” — so it can “try to explain how Solein could be an ingredient in different kinds of dishes from the Asian hot pots to burger patties to soups or pastries or whatever.”Food is of course not only cultural but individual tastes can be hugely personal — and/or political. So once Solein leaves Solar Foods’ factories and arrives in customers’ commercial kitchens that’s where all these localizing product and branding challenges will really kick in — as buyers will have to work on figuring out how best to blend it in with other taste and cultural considerations or indeed make its presence stick out loudly (at least on the packet) where shouting about sustainability benefits might be the best way to reap big sales in their particular target market.One thing looks clear: The future of food won’t be dull — or even uniformly yellow hued. A full rainbow of possibilities for alternative eats are coming down the pipe — and the environmental challenges we face, as a species, demand we find the appetite to consume them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch847,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/05/7-investors-discuss-how-agtech-can-solve-agricultures-biggest-problems/,investors discuss how agtech can solve agriculture s biggest problems,"Climate change and geopolitical instability are wreaking havoc on agriculture. To gauge how VCs are responding to these issues, we spoke with seven investors.For starters, rising greenhouse gas emissions are driving punishing droughts and storms, which are harming crops, exacerbating food insecurity and threatening countless livelihoods. At the same time, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is rattling the world’s grain supply, driving up costs and further aggravating supply chains.Even as these and other crises hammer the multitrillion-dollar industry, startup investors see potential for huge returns with tech that could boost yields, slash emissions and mitigate waste.“There are opportunities to develop [and] adopt new technologies all along the food value chain that will impact key issues like food security and emissions,” Adam Anders, a managing partner at Anterra Capital, told TechCrunch. Among the areas where he sees the biggest potential impact, the investor cited improving plant genetics, boosting the shelf life of more products and putting digital tools in the hands of farmers.Consumer behavior is another piece of the proverbial puzzle as climate literacy increasingly alters how folks shop.“Over the last few years, we have seen skyrocketing interest in sustainability from consumers and food brands, and awareness over the negative impacts of agriculture continues to grow,” said Ting-Ting Liu, investor at Prosus Ventures. “People are not only paying more attention to agricultural-related emissions but also how much land and water is required to support the world’s food supply and the amount of runoff being generated,” she said.Liu argued that this demand is creating strong tailwinds for businesses that strive to address agriculture’s environmental impact, ultimately driving more capital into everything from cellular agriculture to methane reduction solutions for livestock.Still, agtech is not immune to some of the broader trends in venture.While the value of agtech VC deals rose to $11.4 billion in 2021 from $6.5 billion in 2020, several investors told TechCrunch they’ve noticed a slowdown in agtech deals this year amid the wider tech downturn of 2022.“2021 was a record year for VC across the board. In 2022, VC investments across the board are about 30% lower year on year, and I would expect a similar slowdown for agtech,” Monica Varman, a partner at G2 Venture Partners, told TechCrunch. “Over the medium to long term, however, I do expect agtech VC funding to grow, given supply chain challenges, traceability concerns and advancements in enabling technologies in synbio and robotics,” she added.Agtech investors are also still largely funding men. Out of the nearly $11 billion dispensed into agtech in 2021, 78% went to firms with all-male founders, according to PitchBook. The disparity has only worsened so far in 2022, rising to 81% (out of nearly $7.3 billion) as of September 14, per the data firm.To gauge whether (and how) VCs are responding to these issues and more, we reached out to:Brett Brohl, managing director, Techstars Farm to Fork, and managing partner, Bread and Butter VenturesAgtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue?It’s not going to continue in the short run largely because of macroeconomic factors you’re just not seeing — for example, many late-stage deals are going through recently — so in the short term, definitely not.In the long run, the sector has a tremendous amount of opportunity and room for innovation, so with time, you will see continued growth and investor focus on agtech.Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global GhG emissions. How has the climate crisis changed how you invest?It is a huge reason deal value skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. Investors understand that this challenge creates an opportunity. Agtech is not as mainstream as many other sectors, so we need more eyeballs and capital. If you are making the food system more effective and efficient, you are making it more sustainable.We aren’t a big enough fund to finance a startup forever, and we depend on later-stage investors, so this attention and resulting influx of capital helps remove some risk from our portfolio.Which emerging technologies, such as cellular agriculture and AI-powered robots, have the greatest potential to impact key issues like food security and emissions in the next decade?We 100% believe in cellular agriculture and are also huge fans of the robotics space, especially robotics that solve very specific pain points and have low BOMs.“Automation and computer vision will be transformative for agriculture over the next decade, particularly as food production is moved closer to the point of consumption due to food security concerns.” Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture PartnersWe also love the packaging space — lots of packaging goes into the transportation and movement of food. We’re also excited about anything to do with logistics, manufacturing or transportation that makes the food chain more sustainable.When investing in an agtech startup, which green flags do you look for? Are you open to backing founders who don’t have experience in the industry?Investing in agtech startups is no different from any other company. A great team can take a C- idea, pivot, iterate and make it work. But a C- founder will run any idea into the ground, regardless of how good it is.While founder-market fit can be a benefit to a company, great entrepreneurs are smart, have a great work ethic, are coachable and know how to surround themselves with people who make up for their weaknesses. So industry experience isn’t a requirement for us.Which areas of agtech have received the most attention from early-stage founders in recent years? In which areas would you like to see more work done or investments?The obvious answer is alternative proteins. So much capital has been invested and so many founders are building cool things in the space.I’d love to see more attention paid to things that are a bit downstream, such as manufacturing, logistics and the future of food retail. Over the last few years, you have seen traditional agtech investors move their thesis further downstream, so it is happening.I’m also really interested in fintech applications in the agriculture space, like what Traive and Milk Moovement are doing.What are you doing to fund underrepresented founders in agtech?We actively seek out investors, forums and networks that support underrepresented founders and invest or work with entrepreneurs that are a stage earlier than where we invest. We also maintain a diverse investment team — 75% of our fund are women.Finally, we hold open office hours for anyone every week and provide free public education through multiple channels to help founders level up.Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 28% of wheat and 15% of corn exports globally. How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected agtech VC deal-making given its impact on the global supply chain and the world’s grain supply?I don’t think it’s done much to early-stage agtech founders or venture capital. The macroeconomic effect of the war has at least, in part, been a tightening of monetary supply, which will trickle down to early-stage startups. However, the impact has not been significant at early stages yet.Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, and a year earlier, ChemChina acquired Syngenta for $43 billion. Today, Bayer’s market cap is less than that deal’s value, and China’s ambassador to Switzerland has called the Syngenta acquisition a bad deal for Beijing. Have the outcomes of these deals affected investors’ hopes for blowout late-stage exits?I wouldn’t call these acquisitions of “modern” agtech companies. Monsanto has been around for 100+ years, and Syngenta was formed over 20 years ago, and even then it was a spin-off. Additionally, these happened in 2017 and 2018. Investment in agtech has exploded since then, indicating that the market does not think these two acquisitions are indicative of underperforming venture investments.The outcomes of companies like Upside Foods, FBN and Indigo Ag will be far more important to the agtech ecosystem. Unfortunately, it’s a very tough market for late-stage companies right now, and that will slow exits and depress ROI on many venture investments, not just agtech deals.How do you prefer to receive pitches? What’s the most important thing a founder should know before they get on a call with you?I’m open to warm intros, thoughtful cold emails or pitches during my open office hours. If you’re pitching me on a call, the number one thing is to be yourself.Anything else you’d like to comment on?I think the blurred lines between food tech and agtech are really interesting. What is agtech? It’s not just farm inputs; there is a lot more to it and that, to me, is exciting.Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture PartnersAgtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue?2021 was a record year for VC.

This new technique simplifies the production process of cell-based meat by reducing reliance on animal products, and it is also greener, cleaner, safer and more cost-effective.Cultured meat is an alternative to animal farming with advantages such as reducing carbon footprint and the risk of transmitting diseases in animals. However, the current method of producing cultured meat involves using other animal products, which largely defeats the purpose, or drugs to stimulate the growth of the meat.To cultivate cell-based meat, animal cells are fed animal serum – usually foetal bovine serum (FBS), which is a mixture harvested from the blood of foetuses excised from pregnant cows slaughtered in the dairy or meat industries – to help them grow and proliferate. This is a critical, yet cruel and expensive, step in the current cell-based meat production process. Ironically, many of these molecules come from the muscles within the slaughtered animal, but scientists did not know how to stimulate their release in production scale bioreactors. Other methods to promote cell growth are using drugs or relying on genetic engineering.The complex production process for cell-based meat increases cost, limits the manufacturing scale and undermines the commercial viability of cell-based meat.To help address this challenge, a multidisciplinary research team led by Associate Professor Alfredo Franco-Obregón, who is from the NUS Institute for Health Innovation & Technology and the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, came up with an unconventional method of using magnetic pulses to stimulate the growth of cell-based meat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond ousted Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey after he was arrested for allegedly biting another man's nose. The company also announced plans to cut 19% of its workforce, or roughly 200 employees, as well as the departure of its chief financial officer and the elimination of the chief growth officer role.Amid the chaos, Beyond and Yum Brands' Taco Bell started testing meatless carne asada using its Beyond Steak product at restaurants in Dayton, Ohio.The Beyond Steak that will be sold in grocery stores comes packaged in bite-sized pieces. It uses faba bean protein as its base and contains 21 grams of protein per serving, according to the company. It also has lower saturated fat content than beef steak and contains no cholesterol. The 10-ounce package will retail for $7.99.Historically, product launches have boosted Beyond's sales, driving new and returning customers to try the item. That would be welcome news for the company, which has seen its sales slide and investors lose hope in its long-term growth prospects.In the second quarter, Beyond reported U.S. grocery sales rose just 2.2% while restaurant revenue was off 2.4%. This year, shares of the company have lost 80% of their value, shrinking its market value to $821 million. At its record high in July 2019, Beyond was valued at $13.4 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch852,https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/19/labby-product-launch/,Labby wants to make milk healthier and cows happier with better sensors,"For most dairy farmers, milk flowing from their cows is tested by a traveling technician once per month. But in a world where bovine mastitis can appear from one day to the next, it is udderly ridiculous to test milk flowing from cows once per month. Today at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield, Labby offered a different solution, with an inline optical sensor that can test cows every time they are milked. For now, the product detects potential issues early, but over time, the company believes it can start predicting issues before they occur.The company’s product is called MilKey and comes in two variants: a hand-held product that can be used anywhere, or an inline product that can be hooked into the milking machines, which enables daily farmers to test continuously.The main difference between the two products is also their strengths. The handheld device can be used by any technician out in the (literal) field; you select the cow you’re testing on a smartphone app, and the test results show up with the right animal. That’s great when a cow is wandering about or if you have suspicions about a particular animal having an illness. The inline device is fully automatic and works over Wi-Fi. For this device, the results need to be assigned to the right cow manually, but it makes it feasible to test every cow, every milking.Labby tells TechCrunch that the device takes spectral measurements of milk samples and uploads them to the cloud. From there, the company uses machine-learning models to take spectral readings as inputs. It can estimate the content of the milk, broken down into fats, proteins and somatic cell counts. Once the measurements are taken and assigned to an animal, the farmers can use an app or any web browser to see the full testing history of any animal, to ensure they are going a-bovine and beyond in terms of milk production.“Animal health records are like human records; they give critical indications about animal health and feed efficiency. It turns out that milk is the best biomarker for everything. Currently, the industry only tests once a month for each animal. We think this is a systemic failure for the farmers and for the animals,” says Julia Somerdin, CEO and founder of Labby, in an interview with TechCrunch. “One complication for animal health is mastitis. It one of the most common yet expensive diseases, and it can change from day to day. So when they do 30-day testing, the test will tell you everything is fine, but the next day the animal could develop a case, which can be subclinical with no symptoms. So for farmers, between testing days, they have no idea how the animal is doing.”You may be wondering “who cares,” but dairy farming is a hell of an industry. There are 9 million cows across 40,000 farms in the U.S. Worldwide, there are 250 million cows across 115 million farms; it all adds up.“With our solution, we can provide on-farm real-time testing to help provide the farmer with daily, weekly and monthly health records,” says Somerdin. “Animal health is the critical indicator that’s missing from today’s industry practices.”From the numbers and the impact, you’ll be unsurprised that there are big sums of money involved. The best milk gets farmers the best price, which means that milk quality is directly linked to revenue, the Labby team tells me. The benefit is two-fold: Healthier cows need less veterinary attention, and higher-quality milk nets the milk producers more money per gallon of milk delivered.“We can insert Labby in the value chain. Dairy is a very input-intensive industry so we have all kinds of suppliers that help farmers produce more and better milk, and then the dairy farmers sell their milk to dairy processors. With our service, the big battle, besides the money-saving aspect, is we create all this real-time data,” says Somerdin. “Animal genetics companies can use that data, helping them refine their algorithms. We can also bridge the gap between dairy producers and veterinarians, enabling telehealth for cows.”Apart from the fact that when I hear “telehealth for cows,” I giggle at the thought of a cow staring into a Zoom screen and talking about its feelings and its four upset stomachs, it’s easy to understand how Labby adds significant value and the ability to be an early warning system for animal health.“The most important thing is that you don’t need a technician to sample the milk anymore. The cleaning can also be integrated with the current system,” says Somerdin, explaining how the company has designed a set-it-and-forget-it approach to continuous testing.Labby was part of Techstars, and raised a total of $1.3 million from them and a number of other investors, including MIT Media lab’s E14 fund.The company officially started selling its products in early October, and has only just started shipping its products to customers. In the short term, it’s a hardware+SaaS business, but after that, it’s time to start milking the data itself for wisdom.“Our business model has three revenue streams. For the dairy farmers, they pay once for the hardware equipment, then monthly for us to provide the testing in the cloud. The farmer pays per cow per day,” says Somerdin. “In addition, we’re looking at data. We believe we are generating significant value for the industry, such as for genetic companies. We will have a data licensing fee, but we will wait to offer that until we have half a million cows on the platform.”Over time, the company hopes to be able to use big data to catch a glimpse of the future, too.“The data will help us develop a reliable benchmark for each animal,” says Somerdin, and suggests that deviations from the benchmark could tell you something about what’s going on for the cows, health-wise. “Based on that, we can look at pattern recognition for disease onset among the herd. We could also predict patterns for milk production, which currently relies only on historical data, which limits their accuracy.”All in all, the company seems eager to (milk)shake up the industry, and bring all the farmers to the yard. And they’re like, it’s better than yours. They will teach you, but they’ll have to charge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites853,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/17/business-food/purple-tomato-gmo-scn-trnd/index.html,A newgenetically modified purple tomato may hit the grocery market stands,"CNN —It tastes like a tomato, smells like a tomato, and even looks (mostly) like a tomato. There’s just one catch: It’s purple.The USDA has approved a genetically modified purple tomato, clearing the path for the unique fruit to be sold in American stores next year.“From a plant pest risk perspective, this plant may be safely grown and used in breeding,” the agency said in a September 7 news release.The approval moves the purple tomato one step closer to widespread distribution. In addition to its unique color, the purple tomato also has health benefits and a longer shelf life than garden variety red tomatoes, scientists say.The tomato was developed by a team of scientists, including British biochemist Cathie Martin, who is a professor at the University of East Anglia and a project leader at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, England.Martin worked on pigment production in flowers for over 20 years, she told CNN. “I wanted to start projects where we could look and see whether there were health benefits for this particular group of pigments,” she said.The pigments that drew Martin’s interest are anthocyanins, which give blueberries, blackberries and eggplants their rich blue-purple hues. With funding from a German consortium, she decided to engineer tomatoes that were rich in anthocyanins, hoping to “increase the antioxidant capacity” of the fruits.By comparing regular tomatoes to the engineered purple tomatoes, she would be able to easily identify whether the anthocyanins were linked to any specific health benefits.To engineer the purple tomatoes, the scientists used transcription factors from snapdragons to trigger the tomatoes to produce more anthocyanin, creating a vibrant purple color.Martin and her colleagues published the first results of their research in 2008 in an article in Nature Biotechnology.The results were “stunning,” she said. Cancer-prone mice that ate the purple tomatoes lived around 30% longer than those that ate normal tomatoes, according to the study.Martin said there are “many explanations” as to why anthocyanin-rich tomatoes may have health benefits. There are “probably multiple mechanisms involved,” she said. “It’s not like a drug, where there’s a single target. It’s about them having antioxidant capacity. It also may influence the composition of the microbiome, so it’s better able to deal with digestion of other nutrients.”And in 2013, Martin and colleagues released a study that found the purple tomatoes had double the shelf life of their red cousins.Martin established a spinout company, Norfolk Plant Sciences, to bring the purple tomatoes to market. Nathan Pumplin, the CEO of Norfolk’s US-based commercial business, told CNN that the purple tomato “strikes a cord with people in this very basic way.”The distinctive purple color means that “it takes no imagination to see that it’s different,” Pumplin said. “It really allows people to make a choice.”FDA approval and commercialization are next stepsIn the past, forays into genetically modified foods have often focused on engineering crops that are more sustainable to produce, he added. But for consumers, the benefits of eating a genetically modified food are murky.“It’s very abstract, hard to understand,” Pumplin said. “But a purple tomato – you either choose or choose not to consume.” The difference between the GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) product and the non-modified tomato are stark – and the possible health benefits for consumers are also clear.Pumplin says that consumers are “warming up” to genetically modified foods across the world.“We look at the problems facing our society as far as sustainability, climate change, health tied to diet and nutrition, and what’s clear from the response from our announcement is that it’s a really important topic to a lot of people,” he said. “I’m encouraged that a lot of people are starting to relook at biotechnology in light of the important challenges.”At the same time, “GMOs are not a silver bullet,” he said. “It’s one tool in our toolbox as plant scientists, as scientists, agronomists, to improve the food production system.”The next steps for the purple tomato are FDA approval and commercialization, Pumplin said. “We need to breed excellent, delicious purple tomatoes. We need to work with producers to produce them and distribute them.”Norfolk will begin to launch limited test markets in 2023 to identify which consumers are most interested in purple tomatoes.As for the taste? The purple tomato is indistinguishable from your standard red tomato, Pumplin said.“It tastes like a great tomato,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

other news sites855,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/how-deere-plans-to-build-a-world-of-fully-autonomous-farming-by-2030.html,How John Deere plans to build a world of fully autonomous farming by ,"Deere's autonomous 8R is the culmination of nearly two decades of work in automation, data analytics, GPS-guidance, internet-of-things connectivity and software engineering.Can John Deere become one of the leading AI and robotics companies in the world alongside Tesla and Silicon Valley technology giants over the next decade?That notion may seem incongruous with the general perception of the 185-year-old company as a heavy-metal manufacturer of tractors, bulldozers and lawnmowers painted in the signature green and yellow colors.But that is what the company sees in its future, according to Jorge Heraud, vice president of automation and autonomy for Moline, Illinois-based Deere, a glimpse of which was showcased at last January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Deere unveiled its fully autonomous 8R farm tractor, driven by artificial intelligence rather than a farmer behind the wheel.The autonomous 8R is the culmination of Deere's nearly two decades of strategic planning and investment in automation, data analytics, GPS guidance, internet-of-things connectivity and software engineering. While a good deal of that R&D has been homegrown, the company also has been on a spree of acquisitions and partnerships with agtech startups, harvesting know-how as well as talent.""This comes from our realization that technology is going to drive value creation and increase productivity, profitability and sustainability for farmers,"" Heraud said.While Deere made a big splash at CES and intrigued the investment community, Stephen Volkmann, equity research analyst at Jefferies, said, ""We are very, very, very early in this process.""""The total global fleet of autonomous Deere tractors is less than 50 today,"" he added. And even though Deere's goal is to have a fully autonomous farming system for row crops in place by 2030, Volkmann said, ""in Wall Street time, that's an eternity.""For the time being, Deere is creating value and profits with well-established automated systems that can be retrofitted to its existing tractors, such as GPS-based self-steering and precision seeding that measures how deep and far apart to plant. Those steps have to be in place, Volkmann said, before you can put full autonomy around them.The autonomous 8R represents a giant leap in current agtech, not to mention the marketing benefit. ""Prior to its introduction at CES, everybody thought [full autonomy] was pie in the sky,"" said Scott Shearer, chair of the department of food, agricultural and biological engineering at Ohio State University.Around the world, Shearer said, there are probably 30 different autonomous tractor projects in the works, though none are commercially available. ""But when Deere, with 60% of the tractor market share in North America, comes out with one, that's when reality sets in,"" Shearer said.That reality reflects Deere's autonomy strategy. ""The AI we use involves computer vision and machine learning,"" Heraud said, science that was well underway at Silicon Valley startup Blue River Technology, which Deere bought in 2017 for $305 million — a deal that also brought on Blue River co-founder and CEO Heraud. Blue River's ""see and spray"" robotics platform utilizes dozens of sophisticated cameras and processors to distinguish weeds from crop plants when applying herbicides.Attached to the autonomous tractor are six pairs of stereo cameras that can ""see"" an obstacle in the field — whether it's a rock, a log or a person — and determine its size and relative distance. Images captured by the cameras are passed through a deep neural network that classifies each pixel in approximately 100 milliseconds and decides whether the tractor should keep moving or stop.""We've curated hundreds of thousands of images from different farm locations and under various weather and lighting conditions,"" Heraud said, ""so that with machine learning, the tractor can understand what it's seeing and react accordingly. This capability also allows the farmer, instead of being in the tractor, to operate it remotely while doing something else.""Heraud was referring to autonomous driving, another piece of Deere's agtech puzzle that came together when it purchased Bear Flag Robotics last year for $250 million. Also a Silicon Valley startup, launched in 2017, Bear Flag's autonomous navigation system can be retrofitted onto existing tractors. In the case of Deere's 8R model, a tractor which first went on the market in 2020, the latest version with autonomous capabilities uses technology from Blue River.Since the CES rollout, Deere has acquired AI assets from two other agtech pioneers. In April, Deere formed a joint venture with GUSS Automation, which has devised semi-autonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers. Using AI and IoT, multiple GUSS (Global Unmanned Spray System) sprayers can be remotely controlled by a single operator, running up to eight sprayers simultaneously from a laptop. GUSS can detect trees and determine how much to spray on each one, regardless of height or canopy size.A month later, Deere announced the acquisition of numerous patents and other intellectual property from AI startup Light, according to The Robot Report. Light's depth-perception platform improves upon existing stereo-vision systems by using additional cameras, mimicking the structure of a human eye to enable more accurate 3D vision. Deere plans to integrate Light's platform into future versions of its autonomous farm equipment.To keep a close eye on other agtech R&D, Deere has established a Startup Collaborator program to test innovative technologies with customers and dealers without a more formal business relationship. ""The hope is that they find the diamonds before they become obvious to [competitors] and keep them in the fold,"" Volkmann said. Among the current crop are Four Growers, a Pittsburgh-based startup providing robotic harvesting and analytics for high-value crops, starting with greenhouse tomatoes, and Philadelphia-based Burro, which is producing small, autonomous robots that can assist farm workers with various conveyance tasks.Not surprisingly, Deere's biggest competitors have been developing automation and autonomy for its farm machinery, too. AGCO, whose brands include Massey Ferguson and Fendt, ""has been automating farming operations since the mid-1990s,"" said Seth Crawford, senior vice president and general manager of the Duluth, Georgia-based company's precision agriculture and digital division. ""We're at a stage we call supervised autonomy, where we still have someone in the cab of the machine,"" he said. ""The buzz is around fully autonomous operations, but where farmers are willing to pay for automation is feature by feature.""Whereas Deere is focused on adding full autonomy to its own farm equipment, AGCO is eying the wider retrofit market, Crawford said. ""In summer 2023, we'll have a performance-enhancing retrofit kit available for multiple brands of machines,"" he said. ""Where others say we bring you autonomy with a half-million-dollar tractor,"" he said, alluding to the price tag of Deere's 8R, ""we have kits that allow you to do that with your existing fleet. We see a huge opportunity with the installed base, where farmers want to adopt technology to enhance their outcomes, and yet don't want to flip their entire fleet and make that massive investment.""In 2016, Case IH, a subsidiary of CNH Industrial, headquartered in London, rolled up to the Farm Progress Show with what it called the Autonomous Concept Vehicle. The sleek prototype tractor, minus a driver's cab, hinted at the view of autonomy at the time. Fast forward six years, to September's Farm Progress Show, where Case IH unveiled its Trident 5550 autonomous applicator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
techcrunch856,https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/cmu-demonstrates-nanoscale-technology-that-causes-plants-to-absorb-nutrients-with-nearly-100-efficiency/,CMU demonstrates nanoscale technology that causes plants to absorb nutrients with nearlyefficiency,"Spraying plants with fertilizers and pesticides is typically a highly lossy affair — as little as 1% of the substances currently used in industrial and food production farming is actually taken up by the plant, while the rest leaches off into the soil. A new technology demonstrated for the first time by Carnegie Mellon University’s Greg Lowry and his team reverses that — causing a plant to absorb molecules with up to 99% efficiency, meaning only 1% is wasted.There are efficiency improvements, and then there are technology demonstrations that could completely upend current methods of doing things — like this one. Lowry’s research, which has been demonstrated as outlined in a peer-review publication now available in Nanoscale Communications, makes use of nanoparticles to coat molecular substances that you would want to be absorbed by a plant. These could include nutrients designed to optimize growth and crop yields, for instance, or pesticides that could protect them from destructive bugs and infestations.We covered this work last year, when it was still just at the pre-demonstration stage — now, Lowry’s team has shown that you can indeed engineer nanoparticles specifically to target pores on the surface of a leaf. Essentially, it’s like custom-creating Lego blocks for receptors on the leaf’s surface and then tying the nutrients you want to deliver to those custom Lego blocks for a perfect fit.This demonstration bears out the team’s hypothesis, which sets the stage for potential further development and, eventually, commercial application. The biggest potential commercial use of this technology could be in pesticides, as it’s estimated that as much as 40% of potential crop yield is still lost to plant disease that’s preventable with effective use of pesticides that can block them from entering through pores on leaves. They could also improve absorption of plant food and fertilizer designed to stimulate growth, and potentially these two uses could be combined into a single “dose” of nanoparticles that can do double duty, with great potential to increase plant and crop output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, when crops are sprayed with stuff that’s supposed to help them grow faster or better, the vast majority of that (up to 95 percent, according to CMU’s engineering blog) will just end up either as concentrated deposits in the surrounding soil, or dissolving into ground water. In both cases, accumulation over time can have negative knock-on effects, in addition to being terribly inefficient at their primary task.This method, described by researchers in detail in a new academic paper, would manage to improve efficiency to nearly 100% absorption of nutrients and pesticides delivered as nanoparticles (particles smaller than 50 nanometers across – a human hair is about 75,000 nanometers wide, for context) sprayed onto the leaves of plants, which then make their way through the plant’s internal vascular system all the way down into the root system.Using this method, agricultural professionals could also greatly improve delivery of plant antibiotics, making it easier and more cost-effective to treat plant diseases affecting crop yields. It would be cheaper to delivery all nutrients and pesticides, too, because the big bump in efficiency of uptake by the plants means you can use much less of anything you want to deliver to achieve your desired effect.This research could have huge impact in terms of addressing growing global food supply needs while making the most existing agricultural land footprint and decreasing the need for potentially damaging expansion of the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has the capacity to produce over 2 million pounds of leafy greens annually.The facility got its start in 2018 when Crop One, an indoor vertical farming company, and Emirates Flight, the airline Emirates catering arm, signed a $40 million joint venture to build Emirates Crop One. AgFunder reported the $40 million was a majority debt funded.Dubbed ECO 1, the farm uses 95% less water than field-grown produce and is guaranteed an output of three tons per day, according to the companies. Passengers on Emirates and other airlines will be able to eat the leafy greens, which include lettuces, arugula, mixed salad greens and spinach on their flights starting this month.Those local to the United Arab Emirates will be able to buy the produce at stores under the Bustanica brand. The greens require no pre-washing and are grown without pesticides, herbicides or chemicals.“We are proud to bring Crop One’s best-in-class technology to this innovative food production facility alongside our joint venture partner,” said Craig Ratajczyk, CEO at Crop One., in a written statement.” ECO 1 will address growing supply chain challenges and food security issues, while introducing millions of new consumers to the benefits of vertically farmed produce.

The wheel is used in only one of MIRI 's four observation modes, the medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode, in which the camera takes not images but light spectra (fingerprints of light absorption of the various chemical elements in the observed objects).The ground control teams first detected friction in the wheel in late August, NASA officials wrote in a statement (opens in new tab) released on Tuesday (Sept. 20), and after further investigation decided to pause observations in the affected mode. On Sept. 6, the agency convened an anomaly review board ""to assess the best path forward,"" the statement added.Related: Marvel at the James Webb Space Telescope's largest image of the cosmos yet""The Webb team has paused in scheduling observations using this particular observing mode while they continue to analyze its behavior and are currently developing strategies to resume MRS observations as soon as possible,"" NASA officials wrote in the statement.

That's an issue everywhere mobile networks are found, including the UK, where 17% of those who live outside of urban areas say they've never been able to connect to a 5G signal—three times more than those in cities.Some mobile users in the countryside can't even get reliable connections to older networks. Only 48% of people in the county of Yorkshire said they could access 4G reliably, and 14% said they often had to revert to 2G.5G advocates have talked about its lower latency and higher speeds enabling more applications for consumers, including the use of mobile virtual and augmented reality. Many point to the metaverse as one of the biggest areas that will benefit from 5G connectivity. But most people remain apathetic towards the concept, and a recent report predicting most business projects in this virtual realm will close by 2025 hasn't helped increase enthusiasm.While it might not be living up to the hype for some users, 5G still has the distinction of being the fastest-growing mobile communications technology ever. Ericsson said coverage reached roughly 25% at the end of 2021, hitting the milestone about 18 months faster than 4G. 5G is also expected to have around one billion users by the end of the year.Part of the reason why people feel somewhat disappointed in 5G is that we're yet to see its full potential; the technology is still in its relative infancy. As 5G expands—it's expected to be the dominant network with 4.4 billion users by 2027—so will the number of applications that take advantage of it. At least that's the plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites863,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/26/physics-particles-physicists#comments,No one in physics dares say sobut the race to invent new particles is pointless,"Imagine you go to a zoology conference. The first speaker talks about her 3D model of a 12-legged purple spider that lives in the Arctic. There’s no evidence it exists, she admits, but it’s a testable hypothesis, and she argues that a mission should be sent off to search the Arctic for spiders.The second speaker has a model for a flying earthworm, but it flies only in caves. There’s no evidence for that either, but he petitions to search the world’s caves. The third one has a model for octopuses on Mars. It’s testable, he stresses.Kudos to zoologists, I’ve never heard of such a conference. But almost every particle physics conference has sessions just like this, except they do it with more maths. It has become common among physicists to invent new particles for which there is no evidence, publish papers about them, write more papers about these particles’ properties, and demand the hypothesis be experimentally tested. Many of these tests have actually been done, and more are being commissioned as we speak. It is wasting time and money.Since the 1980s, physicists have invented an entire particle zoo, whose inhabitants carry names like preons, sfermions, dyons, magnetic monopoles, simps, wimps, wimpzillas, axions, flaxions, erebons, accelerons, cornucopions, giant magnons, maximons, macros, wisps, fips, branons, skyrmions, chameleons, cuscutons, planckons and sterile neutrinos, to mention just a few. We even had a (luckily short-lived) fad of “unparticles”.All experiments looking for those particles have come back empty-handed, in particular those that have looked for particles that make up dark matter, a type of matter that supposedly fills the universe and makes itself noticeable by its gravitational pull. However, we do not know that dark matter is indeed made of particles; and even if it is, to explain astrophysical observations one does not need to know details of the particles’ behaviour. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) hasn’t seen any of those particles either, even though, before its launch, many theoretical physicists were confident it would see at least a few.Talk to particle physicists in private, and many of them will admit they do not actually believe those particles exist. They justify their work by claiming that it is good practice, or that every once in a while one of them accidentally comes up with an idea that is useful for something else. An army of typewriting monkeys may also sometimes produce a useful sentence. But is this a good strategy?Experimental particle physicists know of the problem, and try to distance themselves from what their colleagues in theory development do. At the same time, they profit from it, because all those hypothetical particles are used in grant proposals to justify experiments. And so the experimentalists keep their mouths shut, too. This leaves people like me, who have left the field – I now work in astrophysics – as the only ones able and willing to criticise the situation.There are many factors that have contributed to this sad decline of particle physics. Partly the problem is social: most people who work in the field (I used to be one of them) genuinely believe that inventing particles is good procedure because it’s what they have learned, and what all their colleagues are doing.But I believe the biggest contributor to this trend is a misunderstanding of Karl Popper’s philosophy of science, which, to make a long story short, demands that a good scientific idea has to be falsifiable. Particle physicists seem to have misconstrued this to mean that any falsifiable idea is also good science.In the past, predictions for new particles were correct only when adding them solved a problem with the existing theories. For example, the currently accepted theory of elementary particles – the Standard Model – doesn’t require new particles; it works just fine the way it is. The Higgs boson, on the other hand, was required to solve a problem. The antiparticles that Paul Dirac predicted were likewise necessary to solve a problem, and so were the neutrinos that were predicted by Wolfgang Pauli. The modern new particles don’t solve any problems.In some cases, the new particles’ task is to make a theory more aesthetically appealing, but in many cases their purpose is to fit statistical anomalies. Each time an anomaly is reported, particle physicists will quickly write hundreds of papers about how new particles allegedly explain the observation. This behaviour is so common they even have a name for it: “ambulance-chasing”, after the anecdotal strategy of lawyers to follow ambulances in the hope of finding new clients.Ambulance-chasing is a good strategy to further one’s career in particle physics. Most of those papers pass peer review and get published because they are not technically wrong. And since ambulance-chasers cite each other’s papers, they can each rack up hundreds of citations quickly. But it’s a bad strategy for scientific progress. After the anomaly has disappeared, those papers will become irrelevant.This procedure of inventing particles and then ruling them out has been going on so long that there are thousands of tenured professors with research groups who make a living from this. It has become generally accepted practice in the physics community. No one even questions whether it makes sense. At least not in public.I believe there are breakthroughs waiting to be made in the foundations of physics; the world needs technological advances more than ever before, and now is not the time to idle around inventing particles, arguing that even a blind chicken sometimes finds a grain. As a former particle physicist, it saddens me to see that the field has become a factory for useless academic papers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just as its creators had hoped, the multibillion-dollar machine is flawlessly ""unfolding the universe"" by revealing cosmic light we cannot see with our own eyes -- and its excellent results make even the most unlikely of stargazers feel alive.Because of this gold-plated telescope, Twitter went wild one day over a bleary red dot. For 48 hours, people worldwide were gawking at a galaxy born shortly after the birth of time itself.

Please check your email and try againBut here's the thing.Amid personal awe, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warn that we ought to consider one crucial scientific consequence of having a superhero telescope.If the JWST is like a zero-to-100 'scope upgrade, they wonder, is it possible our science models need a zero-to-100 reboot, too? Are the datasets scientists have been using for decades unable to match the device's power and therefore falling short in revealing what it's trying to tell us?""The data we will be getting from the JWST will be incredible, but ... our insights will be limited if our models don't match it in quality,"" Clara Sousa-Silva, a quantum astrochemist at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, told CNET.And, according to a new study of which she's a co-author, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, the answer is yes.More specifically, this paper suggests some of the light-parsing tools scientists normally use to understand exoplanet atmospheres aren't totally equipped to deal with the JWST's exceptional light data. In the long run, such a hindrance may impact the most massive JWST quest of all: the hunt for extraterrestrial life.""Currently, the model we use to decrypt spectral information is not up to par with the precision and quality of data we have from the James Webb telescope,"" Prajwal Niraula, graduate student at MIT's department of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ""We need to up our game.""NASAHere's one way to think about the conundrum.Imagine pairing the newest, most powerful Xbox console with the very first iteration of a TV. (Yes, I know the extreme hypothetical nature of my scenario). The Xbox would be trying to give the TV awesome high-resolution, colorful, beautiful graphics to show us -- but the TV wouldn't have the capacity to compute any of it.I wouldn't be surprised if the TV straight up exploded. But the point is you wouldn't know what the Xbox is trying to provide for you, unless you get an equally high-res TV.Similarly, in the vein of exoplanet discoveries, scientists feed a bunch of deep-space light, or photon, data into models that test for ""opacity."" Opacity measures how easily photons pass through a material and differs depending on things like light wavelength, material temperature and pressure.This means every such interaction leaves behind a telltale signature of what the photon's properties are, and therefore, when it comes to exoplanets, what kind of chemical atmosphere those photons passed through to get to the light detector. That's how scientists sort of reverse-calculate, from light data, what an exoplanet's atmosphere is composed of.In this case, the detector liaison lies on the James Webb Space Telescope -- but in the team's new study, after putting the most commonly used opacity model to the test, the researchers saw JWST light data hitting what they call an ""accuracy wall.""The model wasn't sensitive enough to parse stuff like whether a planet has an atmospheric temperature of 300 or 600 Kelvin, the researchers say, or whether a certain gas takes up 5% or 25% of the atmosphere. Such a difference is not only statistically significant, but per Niraula, also ""matters in order for us to constrain planetary formation mechanisms and reliably identify biosignatures.""That is, evidence of alien life.""We need to work on our interpretive tools,"" Sousa-Silva said, ""so that we don't find ourselves seeing something amazing through JWST but not knowing how to interpret it.""T. Treu/GLASS-JWST/NASA/CSA/ESA/STScIFurther, the team also found its models kind of disguising its uncertain readings. A few adjustments can easily paper over uncertainty, deeming results a good fit when they're incorrect.""We found that there are enough parameters to tweak, even with a wrong model, to still get a good fit, meaning you wouldn't know that your model is wrong and what it's telling you is wrong,"" Julien de Wit, assistant professor at MIT's EAPS and study co-author, said in a statement.Going forward, the team urges opacity models be improved to accommodate our spectacular JWST revelations – especially calling for crossover studies between astronomy and spectroscopy.""There is so much that could be done if we knew perfectly how light and matter interact,"" Niraula says. ""We know that well enough around the Earth's conditions, but as soon as we move to different types of atmospheres, things change, and that's a lot of data, with increasing quality, that we risk misinterpreting.""De Wit compares the current opacity model to the ancient language translation tool the Rosetta Stone, explaining that so far, this Rosetta Stone has been doing OK, such as with the Hubble Space Telescope.""But now that we're going to the next level with Webb's precision,"" the researcher said, ""our translation process will prevent us from catching important subtleties, such as those making the difference between a planet being habitable or not.""As Sousa-Silva puts it, ""it's a call to improve our models, so that we will not miss the subtleties of data.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other news sites865,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/21/1062001/spacex-starlink-signals-reverse-engineered-gps/,Starlink signals can be reverse engineered to work like GPS whether SpaceX likes it or not,"In a non peer-reviewed paper published on arXiv, Humphreys claims to have provided the most complete characterization of Starlink’s signals to date. This information, he says, is the first step toward developing a new global navigation technology that would operate independently of GPS or its European, Russian, and Chinese equivalents.“The Starlink system signal is a closely guarded secret,” says Humphreys. “Even in our early discussions, when SpaceX was being more cooperative, they didn’t reveal any of the signal structure to us. We had to start from scratch, building basically a little radio telescope to eavesdrop on their signals.”To get the project started, UT Austin acquired a Starlink terminal and used it to stream high-definition tennis videos of Rafael Nadal from YouTube. This provided a constant source of Starlink signals that a separate nearby antenna could listen in on.Humphreys quickly realized that Starlink relies on a technology called orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is an efficient method of encoding digital transmissions, originally developed at Bell Labs in the 1960s and now used in Wi-Fi and 5G. “OFDM is all the rage,” says Mark Psiaki, a GPS expert and aerospace professor at Virginia Tech. “It’s a way to pack the most bits per second into a given bandwidth.”The UT Austin researchers did not try to break Starlink’s encryption or access any user data coming down from satellites. Instead, they sought out synchronization sequences—predictable, repeating signals beamed down by the satellites in orbit to help receivers coordinate with them. Not only did Humphreys find such sequences, but “we were pleasantly surprised to find that they [had] more synchronization sequences than is strictly required,” he says.Each sequence also contains clues to the satellite’s distance and velocity. With the Starlink satellites transmitting about four sequences every millisecond “that’s just wonderful for dual use of their system for positioning,” says Humphreys.If the terrestrial receiver has a good idea of the satellites’ movements—which SpaceX shares online to reduce the risk of orbital collisions—it can use the sequences’ regularity to work out which satellite they came from, and then calculate the distance to that satellite. By repeating this process for multiple satellites, a receiver can locate itself to within about 30 meters, says Humphreys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Companies use GPS to track trucks and keep them on time and their cargo secure.Little wonder, then, that criminals are turning to cheap GPS jamming devices to ransack the cargo on roads and at sea, a problem that's getting worse but may be ameliorated with a new generation of safety technology designed to overcome threats from jamming.In case you aren't a master criminal or a secret agent, here's some background. The core problem for any system using GPS is that the signals are extremely weak, an inevitable byproduct of the vast distances those signals need to travel. Jammers work by overpowering GPS signals by emitting a signal at the same frequency, just a bit more powerful than the original. The typical jammers used for cargo hijackings are able to jam frequencies from up to 5 miles away rendering GPS tracking and security apparatuses, such as those used by trucking syndicates, totally useless.In Mexico, jammers are used in some 85% of cargo truck thefts. Statistics are harder to come by in the United States, but there can be little doubt the devices are prevalent and widely used. Russia is currently availing itself of the technology to jam commercial planes in Ukraine.As we've covered, the proliferating commercial drone sector is also prey to attack. Drones often rely on GPS for navigation as well as security tracking, making them especially vulnerable. Drones equipped with back-up methods still often rely on GPS for positioning, navigation, and stabilization, making jammers a way to take a drone down and potentially cause harm to life and property. During a light show in Hong Kong in 2018, a jamming device caused 46 drones to fall out of the sky, raising public awareness of the issue.Technologies are emerging to counter this problem. A company called infiniDome has developed an anti-jamming solution that is compatible with almost any GPS-based telematics unit, a catch-all term for the technologies trucking companies use to track and monitor their assets on the road. InfiniDome's ""OtoSphere"" is a small add-on device created for commercial GNSS receivers, providing protection and increasing the resiliency of GPS devices against jamming attacks. By identifying and preventing instances of jamming, fleet operators are able to prevent cargo theft.Other companies, such as Sepentrio, are also taking GPS jamming in drone applications seriously with integrated sensor solutions.In the meantime, governments are hoping to fight back through regulation, although that may be a losing battle. Mexico passed an anti-jamming law in late 2020, allowing for penalties of 12-15 years in prison for persons caught using such devices while committing crimes.Nevertheless, jammers remain widely available online, where they can be purchased for as little as $50.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But until the full report is released to the public in mid-2023, NASA says everything will be kept a secret.UAPs get their classification due to their puzzling behavior in the sky, which doesn’t fit into the known behavior of aircraft or known natural phenomena. NASA will unpack the data to come up with a way to study the unknown.NASA says their work will “lay the groundwork” for future UAP studies. This first phase is a brainstorm, to see how observations that civilian government entities and commercial data have gathered could be analyzed. And then, they’ll look at how future data can be collected.NASA will hold a public meeting after the report is released to discuss the study’s findings, an event that curious onlookers might want to earmark.The space agency says officials are excited to see what the team uncovers. “NASA is going in with an open mind,” the space agency writes in a Frequently Asked Questions webpage devoted to UAPs. “And we expect to find that explanations will apply to some events and different explanations will apply to others. We will not underestimate what the natural world contains, and we believe there is a lot to learn.”Is it aliens? The short answer is, NASA doesn’t know. The space agency chooses to highlight its search for extraterrestrial life when it publishes new information about the new UAP study. But agency officials have also been candid about where the data stands. They explicitly stated back in June that, “there is no evidence UAPs are extra-terrestrial in origin.”Meet the UAP teamDaniel Evans, the assistant deputy associate administrator for research at NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, orchestrated the study.The 16-member team includes:",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these technologies have not been able to identify where it came from, how much water there is or even if it is, in fact, water. Now, utilizing Goddard technology, engineer Dr. Berhanu Bulcha has developed an instrument to definitively locate and identify water sources on the Moon, according to a NASA post.""Other missions found hydration on the Moon, but that could indicate hydroxyl or water. If it's water, where did it come from? Is it indigenous to the formation of the Moon, or did it arrive later by comet impacts? How much water is there?

A stable, high-power terahertz laser that is needed for the spectrometer was prototyped in collaboration with Longwave Photonics through NASA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.""The problem with existing laser technology is that no materials have the right properties to produce a terahertz wave,"" said Dr. Bulcha.SEE: NASA is blazing an inspirational trail.

The probe itself seemed to be in good shape, with a signal that's still strong enough to beam back information, and nothing was triggering its fault protection systems that would put it in ""safe mode."" According to NASA, the Voyager team has not only figured the problem out since then — it has also solved the issue.Turns out we're getting jumbled data here on Earth, because the probe's attitude articulation and control system (AACS) has been sending back information through an onboard computer that had stopped working years ago. The computer was corrupting the data before it even went out. Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd said that when her team suspected that this was the issue, they implemented a low-risk fix: They commanded the AACS to send its data through the probe's working computer again.While the engineers have fixed the glitch, they've yet to figure out why the AACS started routing information through the old computer in the first place. They believe it was triggered by a faulty command by another onboard computer, which was itself triggered by an underlying issue with the spacecraft. Voyager's engineers will keep looking for the problem's root case, NASA said, but they don't think it will have a huge effect on the spacecraft's operations.Turn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from Engadget You can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu.

But with its latest set of branding and logo guidelines it’s going even further, simplifying its legacy branding and signaling the end of the decade-old SuperSpeed branding. If the name doesn’t ring any bells, then that’s probably because you (like most other people) simply referred to it by its USB 3 version number. Alongside it, the USB-IF is also ditching USB4 as a consumer-facing brand name.An old Certified SuperSpeed logo. Photo by The VergeThe changes came into effect this quarter, and could start appearing on products and packaging as early as by the end of the year, according to the USB-IF’s president and chief operating officer Jeff Ravencraft. But any products that were certified prior to the shift will still be able to use the old brand names.In a Zoom call, Ravencraft explains that the new branding is designed to prioritize what the standards can actually do, rather than the USB version they’re based on. “As we started to update our branding we did a lot of focus group studies with many different types of consumers,” he tells The Verge, “and none of those people understood the messaging and the branding, and they don’t understand revision control or spec names.”The new range of USB packaging and device logos, no “SuperSpeed” or “USB4” branding in sight. Image: USB-IF“What consumers want to know — and what we learned — is they want to know two things: What’s the highest data performance level the product can achieve? And what’s the highest power level I can get or drive from this product,” he says. “That’s all they want to know.”So, instead of referring to USB devices by a version number or vague name like “SuperSpeed,” the USB-IF wants companies to use branding that reflects these all-important specs. “SuperSpeed USB 5Gbps” and “SuperSpeed USB 10Gbps” are now just “USB 5Gbps” and “USB 10Gbps” respectively, while “USB4 40Gbps” and “USB4 20Gbps” are becoming “USB 40Gbps” and “USB 20Gbps.”Branding for certified USB Type-C cables is also being updated. Rather than simply listing their data transfer speeds, cables will also (for the most part) have to list the charging wattage they’re capable of carrying. So a cable can’t just be branded as being a 40Gbps cable as with last year’s guidelines, it’ll now also have to list a charging speed like 60W or 240W.It’s important to note that using these brandnames is far from mandatory. They apply to USB devices certified by the USB-IF, but these only cover a fraction of the total number of USB products out on the market. That’s because unlike specifications like Thunderbolt 4, which manufacturers have to license directly from Intel, USB is an open standard that anyone is free to use. That’s allowed it to become as ubiquitous as it is, but means the USB-IF is all-but-powerless to stop companies from building USB products that don’t use the specification properly. And no one’s going to stop them from branding a device as USB4 Version 2, or offer no branding at all.Certified cables will now need to show maximum wattage alongside data transfer speeds, unless they’re using the older Hi-Speed standard. Image: USB-IFThe underlying USB version numbers aren’t going anywhere. But while manufacturers and OEMs still have to wrap their heads around specs like USB4 Gen3x2 and USB4 Version 2, the USB-IF doesn’t want customers to care what version number their devices or cables are using. Yes, USB4 Version 2.0 is a terrible name, but the idea is that most consumers should end up seeing it branded as USB 80Gbps.This branding applies regardless of the specific USB port being used, whether it’s old fashioned USB Type-A, microUSB, or USB Type-C. But naturally the higher performance logos will only be applicable to USB Type-C, which is the only connector to support transfer speeds over 10Gbps.Putting the two most important specs front-and-centerA key exception to all these rules is USB Hi-Speed, more commonly known by its version number USB 2.0, which maxes out at a now achingly slow 480Mbps. But the USB-IF’s reasoning is that if it were to be completely consistent, and brand USB 2.0 ports as “USB 480Mbps,” then it’d risk confusing customers who might see the branding next to a “USB 5Gbps” device and wrongly assume it’s faster because of the higher number. Original USB 1.0 branding is also unaffected by this year’s changes.As my former colleague Chaim Gartenberg wrote last year, even with new simplified branding the situation is still far from perfect. Ideally we wouldn’t need half a dozen different logos to describe all the variations of a single connector. But Ravencraft argues that it wouldn’t make sense to force every manufacturer to support the highest specs.“A USB printer will never be USB4 Version 2,” he says. “There’s no need for it, and no one’s going to put the cost of this higher end technology into a printer or a keyboard or a mouse.” Instead, the “billions” of devices on the market that only need the transfer speeds of older standards like USB 2.0 (ahem, sorry, USB Hi-Speed) can continue to use them.There’ll still be lots of different USB versions out thereThe new branding guidelines also don’t cover absolutely everything that a USB cable can do. There’s no information on resolutions or refresh rates if you need a cable that’s going to carry a DisplayPort video signal, nor is there anything to say how a cable might handle taking a PCIe signal.

The DART mission launched on Nov. 23, 2021 on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and is now hurtling through deep space toward the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos.The mission, which is managed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL), is humanity's first attempt to determine if we could alter the course of an asteroid, a feat that might one day be required to save human civilization. While changing the orbit of an asteroid 7 million miles away sounds daunting, DART team members from NASA and JHUAPL said during a media briefing on Thursday (Sept. 22) that they are confident that the years of planning that have gone into the mission will lead to success.Related: NASA's DART asteroid-impact mission will be a key test of planetary defenseTraveling at speeds of 4.1 miles per second (6.6 km/s), or 14,760 mph (23,760 kph), the DART spacecraft will impact the 560-foot-wide (170 meters) Dimorphos, a moonlet that orbits the other member of its binary system, the 2,600-foot-wide (780 m) asteroid Didymos.Doing so, NASA believes, will shift Dimorphos' orbital period enough to alter its gravitational effects on the larger Didymos, changing the trajectory of the pair.DART will crash into Dimorphos, causing a change to the moonlet's orbit. (Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL)Katherine Calvin, chief scientist and senior climate advisor at NASA, said that while DART will be a key test of this ""kinetic impactor"" planetary defense strategy, the mission will also produce valuable science that will allow astronomers to peer back into the deep history of the solar system.""We're looking at asteroids to make sure that we don't find ourselves in their path. We also study asteroids to learn more about the formation and history of our solar system. Every time we see an asteroid, we're catching a glimpse of a fossil of the early solar system,"" Calvin said.""These remnants capture a time when planets like Earth were forming,"" she added. ""Asteroids and other small bodies also delivered water, other ingredients of life to Earth as it was maturing. We're studying these to learn more about the history of our solar system.""Lindley Johnson, planetary defense officer at NASA, said that DART marks a turning point in the history of the human species.""This is an exciting time, not only for the agency, but for space history and the history of humankind,"" Johnson said during Thursday's briefing. ""It's quite frankly the first time that we are able to demonstrate that we have not only the knowledge of the hazards posed by these asteroids and comets that are left over from the formation of the solar system, but also have the technology that we could deflect one from a course inbound to impact the Earth. So this demonstration is extremely important to our future.""That sentiment was echoed by Tom Statler, a DART program scientist at NASA. ""The first test is a test of our ability to build an autonomously guided spacecraft that will actually achieve the kinetic impact on the asteroid. The second test is a test of how the actual asteroid responds to the kinetic impact,"" Statler said. ""Because, at the end of the day, the real question is: How effectively did we move the asteroid, and can this technique of kinetic impact be used in the future if we ever needed to?""Read more: DART asteroid mission: NASA's first planetary defense spacecraftThe asteroid Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos are shown in a composite image taken by DART's DRACO instrument on July 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA JPL DART Navigation Team)The outcome of the DART mission on Monday (Sept. 26) will certainly help answer that question, and many of the DART team members shared their confidence in the mission during the briefing. Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at JHUAPL, said the spacecraft is ready to smash itself to pieces on the surface of Dimorphos when the time comes.""What we can say at this point is that all subsystems on the spacecraft are green, they're healthy, they're performing very well. We have plenty of propellant and we have plenty of power,"" Reynolds said. ""We've been doing a bunch of rehearsals, and some of the rehearsals are very nominal.""""At this point, I can say that the team is ready,"" Reynolds added. ""The ground systems are ready, and the spacecraft is healthy and on track for an impact on Monday.""Engineers on the DART team are watching the spacecraft's trajectory carefully over the coming days leading up to the impact, which should occur at 7:14 p.m. EDT (2314 GMT) on Monday (Sept. 26). Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at JHUAPL, said that the team is still making sure the impactor spacecraft is on course.""Over the next couple of days, we're actually still performing some trajectory correction maneuvers to make sure that we are on the right path to hit the asteroid,"" Adams said. ""We rehearsed a lot. But as we go through the cruise phase, we update parameters in the spacecraft to make sure that we can actually hit the asteroid. And so in the last couple of days, we'll update those parameters; we'll do checks like streaming images back to Earth.""""So in the next few days, we'll take more images of the Didymos system, we'll do trajectory correction maneuvers, and then at 24 hours prior to impact, it's all hands on deck,"" she added.Adams said the team has 21 contingencies in place in case DART's Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real Time Navigation (Smart Nav) system determines that the spacecraft is off course. ""We've planned for all the things, and we're ready to intervene. And we have been rehearsing this for quite some time.""NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, is moved into a shipping container for its trip to the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for a launch on Nov. 24, 2021. (Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ed Whitman)The 21st contingency the team has planned for is DART's survival. In the event that DART misses Dimorphos, Adams says the team will immediately begin processing the data the spacecraft collected and plan for a possible impact with other objects.""We're going to sit down back into our seats and we're going to start preserving all the data on board if it misses. And we'll have time with our Deep Space Network right afterwards to be able to actually get all that data down,"" Adams said. ""And then we'll start conserving propellant and we'll start looking for [other] objects to come back to.""In response to a question from Space.com concerning any flight testing the team has conducted, Adams mentioned a recent set of images the DART spacecraft's DRACO camera took of Jupiter and its four big Galilean moons . The DART team captured the images in order to ""fool"" the DART spacecraft's SMART Nav system so that its tracking capabilities could be tested.""We actually watched Europa exit from behind Jupiter. And we fooled our Smart Nav that Jupiter was Didymos and Europa was Dimorphos, and we actually watched the separation happen,"" Adams said.That's important, she added, ""because in the last four hours during our terminal phase, when the spacecraft is completely autonomous, we're going to watch Dimorphos emerge from behind Didymos. So, we already trained the system to do this in flight. So we're looking forward to it. I think we can do it.""Statler reiterated that confidence, adding that, while this type of mission was once the stuff of fantasy, the DART team believes we now have the tools and the knowledge to carry out a successful planetary defense mission.""We're moving an asteroid. We are changing the motion of a natural celestial body in space,"" Statler said. ""Humanity has never done that before. And this is the stuff of science fiction books, and really corny episodes of 'Star Trek' from when I was a kid. And now it's real. And that's kind of astonishing that we are actually doing that and what that bodes for the future: What we can do, as well as our discussions of what humanity should do.""It opens up an amazing frontier,"" he added.

How about several?"" has successfully collided with the Dimorphos asteroid. Results and data from the collision are still coming in but NASA ground control confirms that the DART impact vehicle has intercepted the target asteroid. Yes, granted, Dimorphos is roughly the size of an American football stadium but space is both very large and very dark, and both asteroid and spacecraft were moving quite fast at the time.NASA""It's been a successful completion of the first part of the world's first planetary defense test,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said after the impact. ""I believe it's going to teach us how one day to protect our own planet from an incoming asteroid. We are showing that planetary defense is a global endeavor and it is very possible to save our planet.""NASA launched the DART mission in November, 2021 in an effort to explore the use of defensive satellites as a means of planetary defense against Near Earth Objects. The vending machine-sized DART impactor vehicle was travelling at roughly 14,000 MPH when it fatally crossed Dimorphos' path nearly 68 million miles away from Earth.Whether future iterations of a planetary defense system brimming with satellites willing to go all June Bug vs Chrysler Windshield against true planet-killer asteroids remains to be seen. Dimorphos itself is the smaller of a pair of gravitationally-entangled asteroids — its parent rock is more than five times as large — but both are dwarfed by the space rock that hit Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out 75 percent of multicellular life on the planet while gouging out the Gulf of Mexico.NASAThe DART team will likely be poring over the data generated by both the impactor and cameras released before the spacecraft made its final approach for days to come. However the team will consider shortening the orbital track of Dimorphos around Didymos by 10 minutes an ideal outcome, though any change of at least 73 seconds will still be hailed as a rousing success. The team will have to observe Dimorphos' orbit for half a day to confirm their success, as the moonlet needs nearly 12 hours to complete an circuit around Didymos.ATLAS observations of the DART spacecraft impact at Didymos! pic.twitter.com/26IKwB9VSo — ATLAS Project (@fallingstarIfA) September 27, 2022Update 9/27/2022 2:29 AM ET: The NASA funded ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) managed to record video of the impact (above).

other news sites875,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy,The James Webb Space Telescope spied the earliest born stars yet seen,"Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, astronomers report in the Oct. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it’s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (SN: 7/11/22). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.“When we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called ‘the sparkles,’” says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (SN: 10/15/20).“The outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?” Mowla says. Were they born at “cosmic noon,” 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at “cosmic dawn,” when stars were first able to form at all (SN: 3/4/22)?Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.Zooming into one part of JWST’s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler. Some of the dots may be globular clusters of same-age stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. L. Mowla et al/The Astrophysical Journal Letters 2022Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.“When we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,” says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, “there’s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,” he says.In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe’s history. They could also help unravel galaxies’ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST’s first year that could do just that.Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Adélaïde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster.“It’s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,” Claeyssens says. “James Webb will be a game changer for this field.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But NASA officials hailed the immediate outcome of Monday's test, saying the spacecraft achieved its purpose.""NASA works for the benefit of humanity, so for us it’s the ultimate fulfillment of our mission to do something like this - a technology demonstration that, who knows, some day could save our home,"" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, a retired astronaut, said minutes after the impact.DART, launched by a SpaceX rocket in November 2021, made most of its voyage under the guidance of NASA's flight directors, with control handed over to an autonomous on-board navigation system in the final hours of the journey.Monday evening's bullseye impact was monitored in near real time from the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.Cheers erupted from the control room as second-by-second images of the target asteroid, captured by DART's onboard camera, grew larger and ultimately filled the TV screen of NASA's live webcast just before the signal was lost, confirming the spacecraft had crashed into Dimorphos.DART's celestial target was an oblong asteroid ""moonlet"" about 560 feet (170 meters) in diameter that orbits a parent asteroid five times larger called Didymos as part of a binary pair with the same name, the Greek word for twin.Neither object presents any actual threat to Earth, and NASA scientists said their DART test could not create a new hazard by mistake.Dimorphos and Didymos are both tiny compared with the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out about three-quarters of the world's plant and animal species including the dinosaurs.[1/4] The last complete image of asteroid moonlet Dimorphos, taken by the DRACO imager on NASA's DART mission 12 kilometers from the asteroid and 2 seconds before impact, showing a patch of the asteroid that is 31 meters across, released September 26, 2022. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Handout via REUTERS 1 2 3 4Smaller asteroids are far more common and present a greater theoretical concern in the near term, making the Didymos pair suitable test subjects for their size, according to NASA scientists and planetary defense experts. A Dimorphos-sized asteroid, while not capable of posing a planet-wide threat, could level a major city with a direct hit.Also, the two asteroids' relative proximity to Earth and dual configuration make them ideal for the first proof-of-concept mission of DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test.ROBOTIC SUICIDE MISSIONThe mission represented a rare instance in which a NASA spacecraft had to crash to succeed. DART flew directly into Dimorphos at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph), creating the force scientists hope will be enough to shift its orbital track closer to the parent asteroid.APL engineers said the spacecraft was presumably smashed to bits and left a small impact crater in the boulder-strewn surface of the asteroid.The DART team said it expects to shorten the orbital path of Dimorphos by 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success, proving the exercise as a viable technique to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth - if one were ever discovered.A nudge to an asteroid millions of miles away years in advance could be sufficient to safely reroute it.Earlier calculations of the starting location and orbital period of Dimorphos were made during a six-day observation period in July and will be compared with post-impact measurements made in October to determine whether the asteroid budged and by how much.Monday's test also was observed by a camera mounted on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART days in advance, as well as by ground-based observatories and the Hubble and Webb space telescopes, but images from those were not immediately available.DART is the latest of several NASA missions in recent years to explore and interact with asteroids, primordial rocky remnants from the solar system's formation more than 4.5 billion years ago.Last year, NASA launched a probe on a voyage to the Trojan asteroid clusters orbiting near Jupiter, while the grab-and-go spacecraft OSIRIS-REx is on its way back to Earth with a sample collected in October 2020 from the asteroid Bennu.The Dimorphos moonlet is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name and is one of 27,500 known near-Earth asteroids of all sizes tracked by NASA. Although none are known to pose a foreseeable hazard to humankind, NASA estimates that many more asteroids remain undetected in the near-Earth vicinity.(This story corrects name in paragraph 6 to Pam from Palm)Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Joey Roulette in Los Angeles; Editing by Sandra Maler and Stephen CoatesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company’s key innovation was the development of a water-based plasma propulsion system for low-cost transportation in space. That’s what powers the company’s Vigoride orbital shuttle.Meanwhile, Relativity Space is barreling ahead with its own technology development.With the goal of building a rocket that goes from raw materials to launch-ready in less than 60 days with a payload capacity of up to 1250 kilograms, the company is planning its first test launch in 2020 with a commercial payload ready for 2021.So far the company has performed 200 engine tests to date across 14 different serial numbers and begun conducting turbo pump testing as well. Testing has also begun on the company’s initial avionics hardware, according to company co-founder Tim Ellis.Relativity has also started printing and stress testing some second stage structures and is beginning to print its larger primary stage structures now.“With Momentus’ innovations in sustainable in-space ‘last mile’ solutions, we look forward to working together to expand Terran 1’s flexibility and offering beyond LEO, offering small and medium satellite launch opportunities with industry-defining lead time, flexibility, and cost,” Ellis said in a statement. “This partnership will enable us to build the space economy faster, and accelerate the future of humanity in space.”The company has dramatically expanded its production, testing and launch facilities to include 280,000 square feet of operations on facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida and the NASA Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.Relativity also has customer agreements with Telesat, to support their low Earth orbit constellation; the Thai satellite and space technology company, mu Space; and Spaceflight Industries to launch their smallsat ride-shares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

See More →Humans have spent centuries wondering if we are alone in the universe, or if there are alien beings somewhere in the vast reaches of space. Given that Earth remains the only planet that we know supports life—and we are not even sure how it arose here—it remains challenging to assess the odds that extraterrestrial life exists based on this lonely sample size of one.These limitations in our knowledge prompted the theoretical physicist Brandon Carter to propose decades ago that the presence of life on Earth does not indicate that the mysterious process of abiogenesis, in which living organisms arise from inanimate matter, is more or less likely to occur on other planets. Now, a mathematician has revisited this idea and come to a very different conclusion with a more optimistic view about the existence of alien life.AdvertisementDuring the 1970s, Carter developed an influential series of arguments based on this “selection effect” of our own existence. This view suggests that humans, as a species that lives on a planet where life emerged, cannot make objective inferences about the possibility that life may be present on other worlds, in part because we have no idea if Earth is typical of planets that might host life. For this reason, we cannot exclude the possibility that Earth may be the only world in the universe that supports living beings.This argument is widely accepted in the scientific community. But now, Daniel Whitmire, an astrophysicist who teaches mathematics at the University of Arkansas, has presented a new challenge to Carter’s assumptions that suggests “the occurrence of abiogenesis on Earth-like planets is not rare,” according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Astrobiology.Whitmire told Motherboard over email that up until last year, he was one of countless researchers who thought that the Carter argument was “unassailable.” But he started to have doubts about its foundations during the peer review process for a different paper, when an anonymous reviewer offered an analogy between abiogenesis and human conception that inspired Whitmire to counter these long-held assumptions.In order to rethink Carter’s assertion that we can’t judge if abiogenesis on Earth was easy or hard, Whitmire draws a comparison to his own existence, noting that he is here regardless of whether his conception, or origin, was easy or hard. For the purposes of this thought experiment, conception would be “hard” if contraception was used, and “easy” if it was not used. The basic idea is that, rather than a person’s existence not telling us anything about whether conceiving them was easy or hard, it can be shown mathematically that it was most likely easy.Advertisement“The Conception analogy stuck in my mind and ultimately I came to believe that the Carter argument must be wrong,” Whitmire said. “But at that point I didn't know why it was wrong.”To tug on this thread, Whitmire developed a mathematics-based argument that builds on the analogy with the help of the so-called “old evidence problem” in Bayesian Confirmation Theory, which concerns the incorporation of newly-acquired data into existing hypotheses.The details are pretty complicated, but the gist is that while Carter holds that old evidence (i.e. the existence of life on Earth) has no influence on the probability of its occurrence elsewhere, Whitmire’s paper attempts to show that, actually, this “old evidence” does in fact increase the probability of it occurring in the first place. Under this novel framework, both abiogenesis on Earth and Whitmire’s conception are more likely to have been easy than hard, which suggests that life on other planets may be common.These ideas are a bit heady, and Whitmire notes that they might not actually have that much of an impact on anyone’s hopes or doubts about the probability of alien life existing somewhere in space.“My opinion is that what many scientists believe about life and intelligent life in the universe is almost political or psychological,” Whitmire said. “If they want to believe life is rare they will point to the Carter argument or some other argument, like the statistical improbability of abiogenesis, to make their case.”AdvertisementWhitmire's formula. AB means abiogenesis, and LoE means life on Earth.Likewise, Whitmire added that those who want to believe life is abundant can find evidence for that position in other studies, including his new paper.“There is no reason that I know of (outside of my paper) for any objective optimism about abiogenesis being easy, yet this is the belief of most astrobiologists in spite of the Carter argument,” he said. “Perhaps my paper will give some objective credence to this subjective belief. That said, I think that arguments like mine and Carter's have some influence but the dominant attitude is that since none of the arguments are 100 percent, only future observations will decide.”Fortunately, we live in an era packed with exciting missions focused on the search for extraterrestrial life, both inside our solar system and beyond it. NASA’s Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life on Mars, and future missions may scout out Jupiter’s moon Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus, which are both considered to be potentially habitable. Next-generation observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope, have the capacity to spot signs of life (or biosignatures) on planets in other star systems, and astronomers are scanning the skies for messages from technologically advanced aliens.Of course, all of these efforts could come up short in the search for life beyond Earth. But just one detection of life beyond our planet—even if it were microbial, or long-extinct—would validate Whitmire’s new argument that abiogenesis is not rare in the universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been difficult to safely send enough power over meter-level distances. To overcome this challenge, the researchers optimized a method called distributed laser charging, which has recently gained more attention for this application because it provides safe high-power illumination with less light loss.""While most other approaches require the receiving device to be in a special charging cradle or to be stationary, distributed laser charging enables self-alignment without tracking processes as long as the transmitter and receiver are in the line of sight of each other,"" said Ha. ""It also automatically shifts to a safe low power delivery mode if an object or a person blocks the line of sight.""Going the distanceDistributed laser charging works somewhat like a traditional laser but instead of the optical components of the laser cavity being integrated into one device, they are separated into a transmitter and receiver. When the transmitter and receiver are within a line of sight, a laser cavity is formed between them over the air—or free space—which allows the system to deliver light-based power. If an obstacle cuts the transmitter-receiver line of sight, the system automatically switches to a power-safe mode, achieving hazard-free power delivery in the air.In the new system, the researchers used an erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical power source with a central wavelength of 1550 nm. This wavelength range is in the safest region of the spectrum and poses no danger to human eyes or skin at the power used. Another key component was a wavelength division multiplexing filter that created a narrowband beam with optical power within the safety limits for free space propagation.""In the receiver unit, we incorporated a spherical ball lens retroreflector to facilitate 360-degree transmitter-receiver alignment, which maximized the power transfer efficiency,"" said Ha. ""We experimentally observed that the system's overall performance depended on the refractive index of the ball lens, with a 2.003 refractive index being the most effective.""Laboratory testingTo demonstrate the system, the researchers set up a 30-meter separation between a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter was made of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical source, and the receiver unit included a retroreflector, a photovoltaic cell that converts the optical signal to electrical power and an LED that illuminates when power is being delivered. This receiver, which is about 10 by 10 millimeters, could easily be integrated into devices and sensors.The experimental results showed that a single-channel wireless optical power transfer system could provide an optical power of 400 mW with a channel linewidth of 1 nm over a distance of 30 meters. The photovoltaic converted this to an electrical power of 85 mW. The researchers also showed that the system automatically shifted to a safe power transfer mode when the line of sight was interrupted by a human hand. In this mode, the transmitter produced an incredibly low intensity light that did not pose any risk to people.""Using the laser charging system to replace power cords in factories could save on maintenance and replacement costs,"" said Ha. ""This could be particularly useful in harsh environments where electrical connections can cause interference or pose a fire hazard.""Now that they have demonstrated the system, the researchers are working to make it more practical. For example, the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell could be increased to better convert light into electrical power. They also plan to develop a way to use the system to charge multiple receivers simultaneously.More information: Nadeem Javed et al, Long-range wireless optical power transfer system using an EDFA, Optics Express (2022).

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.CNN —The Artemis I mega moon rocket is gearing up for another test Wednesday before its next launch attempt to journey around the moon and back.The Artemis I cryogenic demonstration test began with fueling at 7:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.Since the second scrubbed launch attempt of the uncrewed Artemis I mission on September 3, engineers have replaced two seals on an interface for the liquid hydrogen fuel line between the rocket and mobile launcher, according to NASA officials. These seals were associated with a large hydrogen leak that led to the scrub of the launch attempt.Engineers found an indentation on the seal on an 8-inch (20-centimeter) quick disconnect line for hydrogen, said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, at a Monday NASA press conference.The team did not recover any piece of debris, but the dent was clear and pointed to a problem that contributed to the hydrogen leak, Sarafin said.The indentation on the seal was under 0.01 inch (0.3 millimeter), but it allowed pressurized gas to leak through, something that can be very dangerous given the flammability of hydrogen when it meets air. The team believes the dent was associated with the leak, but the results of the test could confirm it. They have since replaced the seal.On September 3, the large hydrogen leak was between two and three times the accepted limit, Sarafin said.Testing ‘kinder’ proceduresThe purpose of the cryogenic demonstration is to test the seals and use updated, “kinder and gentler” loading procedures of the supercold propellant, which is what the rocket would experience on launch day.Unlike the wet dress rehearsals, the previous tests of Artemis I that simulated every stage leading up to launch, the cryo test focuses on a very specific aspect in the countdown: loading supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage and upper stage.The Orion spacecraft and rocket boosters remained unpowered during the test, and the team does not intend to go into terminal count, or the final 10 minutes that occur in the countdown before launch, said Jeremy Parsons, deputy manager for NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program at Kennedy Space Center.The kinder and gentler loading procedure is to minimize pressure spikes and thermal spikes witnessed during prior launch attempts.“It’s going to be a very slow, steady ramp,” Parsons said. “So (we’re) really just trying to slowly introduce some of those thermal differences and reduce thermal and pressure shock.”Liquid oxygen is relatively dense, about the density of water, and it is pumped into the rocket. Meanwhile, hydrogen is very light, so it is moved using pressure rather than being pumped, said Tom Whitmeyer, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s common exploration systems development.The new loading operations will use a slower rate of pressure with more gradual temperature changes, Whitmeyer said.The call to stations for the test, when all of the teams associated with the mission arrive at their consoles and report they’re ready, begins today at 3 p.m. ET. The mission team anticipates receiving a “go” to begin loading the rocket with propellant around 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday. If all goes well, the team expects the test to be completed by 3 p.m. ET that day, Parsons said.The test will also include an engine bleed, which chills the engines for launch. The mission team scrubbed the first Artemis I launch attempt on August 29 largely due to an issue with a faulty sensor that occurred during this bleed.So far, the forecast looks promising for the test. The Artemis team is receiving daily briefings about Hurricane Fiona in case it has any impact on whether or not the rocket stack needs to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that can take three days.Preparing for launchIf the cryo test goes well, the next launch attempt could take place on Tuesday, September 27, with a 70-minute window that opens at 11:37 a.m. ET. The mission managers will meet to discuss the test results on September 25 to assess the potential launch date.If Artemis I launches on September 27, it would go on a 39-day mission and return to Earth on November 5. Another backup launch date is possible on October 2. While these launch dates are recommended by NASA, the team ultimately depends on a decision by the US Space Force, which would need to issue a waiver for the launch.The US Space Force, an arm of the military, still oversees all rocket launches from the United States’ East Coast, including NASA’s Florida launch site, and that area is known as the Eastern Range.The officials at the range are tasked with making sure there’s no risk to people or property with any launch attempt.The Artemis team continues to have “productive and collaborative” discussions with the Eastern Range, NASA officials said, and NASA is sharing additional detailed information requested by the Space Force for review.The team is taking things one step at a time and wants to get through the test before other decisions are made, Whitmeyer said.“We’re going to go when we’re ready,” Sarafin said. “But in terms of the reward of flying this flight, we have said from the outset that this is the first in an increasingly complex series of missions, and it is a purposeful stress test of the rocket.”The inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of NASA space exploration that intends to land diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon – on the Artemis II and Artemis III missions, slated for 2024 and 2025, respectively – and eventually deliver crewed missions to Mars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
