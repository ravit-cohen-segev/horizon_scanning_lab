According to the results of the study, the Apple Watch Series 6 is able to “reliably detect states of reduced blood oxygen saturation” in comparison to medical-grade pulse oximeters. Here’s how the study came to determine this…

How reliable is the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor?

As spotted by MyHealthyApple, the study was published this month in the Digital Health open access journal. The objective of the study was to investigate “how a commercially available smartwatch that measures peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) can detect hypoxemia compared to a medical-grade pulse oximeter.”

For the study, researchers recruited 24 healthy participants. Each person wore an Apple Watch Series 6 on their left wrist and a pulse oximeter sensor on their left middle finger (the Masimo Radical-7).

The participants breathed via a breathing circuit with a three-way non-rebreathing valve in three phases. First, in the 2-minute initial stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air. Then in the 5-minute desaturation phase, the participants breathed the oxygen-reduced gas mixture (12% O 2 ), which temporarily reduced their blood oxygen saturation. In the final stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air again until SpO 2 returned to normal values. Measurements of SpO 2 were taken from the smartwatch and the pulse oximeter simultaneously in 30-s intervals.

The study resulted in 642 individual pairs of blood oxygen measurements:

The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%-100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%.

As such, the researchers conclude:

The bias in SpO 2 between the smartwatch and the oximeter was 0.0% for all the data points. The bias for SpO 2 less than 90% was 1.2%. The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%–100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%.

Apple first added blood oxygen measurement support to the Apple Watch Series 6. It’s also a feature on the newest Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra. Apple has been hesitant to promote the feature with any actual medical claims, and the company hasn’t advertised any significant improvements to the technology since it first debuted on the Series 6 in 2020.

1,"This week, the US Department of Energy's Berkeley Lab released its annual analysis of solar energy in the US. It found that nearly half the generating capacity was installed in the US during 2021 and is poised to dominate future installs. That's in part because costs have dropped by more than 75 percent since 2010; it's now often cheaper to build and operate a solar plant than it is to simply buy fuel for an existing natural gas plant.

The analysis was performed before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains many incentives and tax breaks that should expand solar's advantages in the coming years.

Solar, by the numbers

In terms of large, utility-scale solar installs, the US added over 12.5 gigawatts of new capacity last year, bringing the total installed capacity to over 50 gigawatts. Texas led the way, with about a third of the total capacity added (3.9 GW) going online in the Lone Star State. Combined with residential and other distributed solar installations, solar alone accounted for 45 percent of the new generating capacity added to the grid last year.

That growth showed up in figures on how much energy solar supplies. Five states now receive more than 15 percent of their electricity from solar power, including Massachusetts and Vermont, with California receiving 25 percent of its electricity from the Sun.

Solar's expansion has largely been driven by falling costs. The DOE estimates that the price of building a solar plant has been dropping by an average of about 10 percent a year, leading to a fall of over 75 percent since 2010. That has left prices averaging about $1.35 for each watt of capacity in 2021. Large-scale plants benefit the most, with projects over 50 megawatts costing about 20 percent less than those under 20 MW.

The drop in prices is causing some somewhat odd trends, driven by the fact that it's becoming increasingly economical to install large facilities in states that don't get as much sun, like Maine, Michigan, and Wisconsin. As a result, the past several years have seen the average incoming energy at newly constructed facilities (measured as daily kilowatt-hours per square meter) drop by about 20 percent.

That has helped cause a large spread in what's called the capacity factor, which is calculated by dividing the amount of energy produced at a facility by the maximum energy it could have generated if it produced 24 hours a day. The median capacity factor of solar plants in the US was 24 percent, but outliers were as low as 9 percent and as high as 35 percent. As prices continue to fall, this spread may become more pronounced, with more plants at the low end of the range."
2,"In July, an HIV-positive man became the first volunteer in a clinical trial aimed at using Crispr gene editing to snip the AIDS-causing virus out of his cells. For an hour, he was hooked up to an IV bag that pumped the experimental treatment directly into his bloodstream. The one-time infusion is designed to carry the gene-editing tools to the man’s infected cells to clear the virus.

Later this month, the volunteer will stop taking the antiretroviral drugs he’s been on to keep the virus at undetectable levels. Then, investigators will wait 12 weeks to see if the virus rebounds. If not, they’ll consider the experiment a success. “What we’re trying to do is return the cell to a near-normal state,” says Daniel Dornbusch, CEO of Excision BioTherapeutics, the San Francisco-based biotech company that’s running the trial.

The HIV virus attacks immune cells in the body called CD4 cells and hijacks their machinery to make copies of itself. But some HIV-infected cells can go dormant—sometimes for years—and not actively produce new virus copies. These so-called reservoirs are a major barrier to curing HIV.

“HIV is a tough foe to fight because it’s able to insert itself into our own DNA, and it’s also able to become silent and reactivate at different points in a person’s life,” says Jonathan Li, a physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and HIV researcher at Harvard University who’s not involved with the Crispr trial. Figuring out how to target these reservoirs—and doing it without harming vital CD4 cells—has proven challenging, Li says.

While antiretroviral drugs can halt viral replication and clear the virus from the blood, they can’t reach these reservoirs, so people have to take medication every day for the rest of their lives. But Excision BioTherapeutics is hoping that Crispr will remove HIV for good.

Crispr is being used in several other studies to treat a handful of conditions that arise from genetic mutations. In those cases, scientists are using Crispr to edit peoples’ own cells. But for the HIV trial, Excision researchers are turning the gene-editing tool against the virus. The Crispr infusion contains gene-editing molecules that target two regions in the HIV genome important for viral replication. The virus can only reproduce if it’s fully intact, so Crispr disrupts that process by cutting out chunks of the genome.

In 2019, researchers at Temple University and the University of Nebraska found that using Crispr to delete those regions eliminated HIV from the genomes of rats and mice. A year later, the Temple group also showed that the approach safely removed viral DNA from macaques with SIV, the monkey version of HIV."

Quantum researchers require access to different types of quantum hardware from digital, also known as gate-based, quantum processing units (QPUs) to analog devices that are capable of addressing specific problems that are hard to solve using classical computers. Today, Amazon Braket, the quantum computing service from AWS, continues to deliver on its commitment to provide that choice by launching Aquila, pictured in Figure 1 below, a new neutral-atom QPU from QuEra Computing with up to 256 qubits. As a special purpose device designed for solving optimization problems and simulating quantum phenomena in nature, it enables researchers to explore a new analog paradigm of quantum computing.

Analog Hamiltonian Simulation

The QuEra QPU is the first device available on Amazon Braket capable of a paradigm of quantum computing known as Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS). AHS refers to the ability to encode a problem of interest into a mathematical object known as the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian represents the energy levels of a quantum system such as interacting spins on a lattice. The computer is then tuned such that it directly simulates the continuous time evolution of the quantum system under that Hamiltonian.

In traditional gate-based quantum computers, users can program gates acting on the qubits directly. Quantum processors such as the Oxford Quantum Circuits, or Rigetti devices on Amazon Braket function that way, with qubits consisting of the ground and excited states of an anharmonic oscillator. The QuEra QPU operates by trapping atoms with lasers, arranging them in programmable one or two-dimensional layouts, and inducing interatomic interactions via van der Waals forces. The qubit consists of the ground state of the atom and a highly excited state, known as a Rydberg state. By exciting atoms from the ground to the excited state, the QuEra QPU is able to realize a phenomenon known as Rydberg blockade, whereby the quantum states of neighboring qubits are fixed by the state of a control qubit. Furthermore, customers can dynamically tune driving field parameters, thus controlling qubit states and their interactions.

What can I do with the QuEra QPU?

The QuEra QPU is a special purpose device, trading-off the ability to perform universal or gate-based computation for the ability to efficiently solve specific tasks. The flexible atom arrangements and tunability of optical controls enable Aquila to realize a rich class of Hamiltonians. Customers can explore the static and dynamic properties of quantum states under these Hamiltonians by adiabatic or diabatic quantum evolution. To date, the Hamiltonian realized by the QuEra QPU has already been used to study several scientific questions of interest in condensed matter and quantum many-body physics. One such example is observing the emergence of a spin-liquid phase, a state of matter with non-local, topological order. These phases are hard to study numerically owing to the system sizes needed to demonstrate non-local order. The QuEra QPU allows customers to program complex lattice geometries such as the Kagome lattice with up to 256 qubits, a system size large enough to explore these novel states.

“Special purpose analog quantum devices are likely to outperform classical computation for direct simulation of other quantum systems before we realize a fault-tolerant, universal quantum computer” said Ignacio Cirac, Director and Head of Theory Division, Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics (MPQ). “In the Theory Division of MPQ we are excited by the launch of the QuEra device on Amazon Braket which enables our team of researchers to experiment and pursue new ideas in the field of analog quantum simulation.”

Aquila’s users are not constrained to specific lattice geometries, or limited to arranging qubits in any regular pattern at all, as shown in Fig 2 above. In addition to strongly correlated many-particle systems, scientists were able to show that neutral-atom processors such as Aquila are suited to arranging atoms in graph patterns, and solving certain combinatorial optimization problems. Namely, these machines can encode the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, which has broad applications in optimization such as resource allocation, network design and others. The MIS problem can be cast as a variational problem which can be computed using iterative optimization cycles that combine a hybrid of quantum and classical operations. With the launch of the QuEra QPU on Amazon Braket, researchers can leverage Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs to study hybrid algorithms using Aquila.

Getting Started

Over forty years ago, Richard Feynman proposed harnessing quantum computers to simulate nature at the quantum scale. Aquila, the neutral-atom QPU available on Amazon Braket does just that: it uses an inherently quantum system, atoms on a tunable lattice, to solve specific problems that are of interest to a wide community of researchers. Aquila is now available in the Northern Virginia (us-east-1) region, and can be accessed using the same Amazon Braket SDK and APIs that you use to access other QPUs.

4,"Antibiotic resistance is a worry for human and plant health alike. The more we use existing antibiotics in clinical settings and in agriculture, the more antibiotic resistance develops. Without new antibiotic compounds, we will struggle to treat once-controlled diseases in both humans and plants.

Exciting new research from Europe details the discovery of a new antifungal antibiotic called solanimycin hiding within a bacteria which causes disease in potatoes.

Most therapeutic antibiotics actually come from soil microbes, so this discovery broadens the search for new compounds to plant-based microorganisms.

“We have to look more expansively across much more of the microbial populations available to us,” said Dr. Rita Monson a microbiologist at the University of Cambridge and one of the study’s authors.

The bacteria itself, known as Dickeya solani, has been known for over 15 years, with another antibiotic called oocydin A originally isolated from the bacteria and used as an effective fungicide against many plant ailments.

From this, and a sequencing of the bacterium’s genome, the researchers realised the potential for other antibiotic compounds to be hiding in the background. When they switched off the genes responsible for producing oocydin A and when the bacteria were within an acidic background – such as that found inside a potato – it would switch on genes responsible for creating solanimycin.

“It’s an antifungal that we believe that will work by killing fungal competitors, and the bacteria benefit so much from this,” said Monson. “But you don’t turn it on unless you’re in a potato.”

Antiobiotic resistance: an arms race going on millions of years

Solanimycin has been demonstrated to act against fungal disease in both plants and also on a common organism known as Candida albicans, which is present inside the body naturally, but can become out of control and cause dangerous infections.

Monson and colleagues want to understand more about solanimycin and how it works, so they have teamed up with chemists to investigate the molecular structure in detail. From there, they hope to progress to testing the compound in plant and animal models."
5,"The world’s largest flow battery has opened, using a newer technology to store power.

The Dalian Flow Battery Energy Storage Peak-shaving Power Station, in Dalian in northeast China, has just been connected to the grid, and will be operating by mid-October.

The vanadium flow battery currently has a capacity of 100 MW/400 MWh, which will eventually be expanded to 200 MW/800 MWh.

According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who helped develop the project, it can supply enough electricity to meet the daily demands of 200,000 residents.

It will be used to smooth peaks and troughs in Dalian’s electricity demand and supply, making it easier to use solar and wind power.

Flow batteries are a newer type of battery technology that operate by combining tanks of liquid electrolytes, rather than using static electrodes.

They use cheaper and more sustainable materials than lithium-ion batteries, and are longer-lasting: theoretically, vanadium flow batteries could charge and discharge indefinitely.

Flow batteries aren’t as energy dense as lithium-ion batteries, however, meaning they’re unlikely to be viable alternatives in electric vehicles or other places where the weight of the battery needs to be minimised.

Instead, most interest in flow batteries is on static applications, like the big grid-scale battery in Dalian.

6,"Stockholm-headquartered renewable energy developer OX2 has signed letters of intent with Swedish edible seaweed companies Nordic SeaFarm and KOBB to explore the possibility of seaweed farming at one of OX2’s offshore wind farms.

Seaweed and offshore wind

OX2’s Galatea-Galene huge 1.7 gigawatt offshore wind farm will be sited off Halland, a county on the western coast of Sweden. It’s named after two Greek sea nymphs, Galatea and Galene, and consists of two sub-areas around 15.5 miles (25 km) outside the cities of Falkenberg and Varberg.

Galatea-Galene is expected to consist of up to 101 wind turbines and generate around 6 to 7 terawatt-hours of clean electricity per year. That’s the equivalent of the average annual electricity consumption of more than 1.2 million Swedish households. (There are 4.8 million households in Sweden, for perspective.)

This offshore wind farm will be developed in a single phase. Construction is expected to commence in 2028 and enter into commercial operation in 2030.

Simon Johansson, CEO of Nordic SeaFarm, and Benjamin Ajo, chairman of the board of KOBB, said in a joint statement [via Offshorewind.biz]:

We see great opportunities, in collaboration with both the fishing industry and the wind power industry, to both maintain and create new jobs when we investigate the possibilities of creating a new industry in Sweden in the form of large-scale aquaculture. Developing the national food supply while [offshore wind] farms contribute to stopping the negative effects of climate change are more positive aspects.

All seaweed needs to grow is saltwater and sunlight. It’s a superfood that’s rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, and particularly high in iodine, so it’s very nutritious. (Note that crispy seaweed in Chinese restaurants is actually cabbage.)

It can be used to wrap sushi, in soups and salads, in snacks and instant noodles, and as livestock food.

Seaweed also provides a source of food for marine life. In April, Electrek reported that a groundbreaking study found that the first US offshore wind farm has had no negative effect on fish and has even proven to be beneficial.

Here’s a short video from Nordic SeaFarm that shows how the company grows and harvests seaweed for consumption:

Electrek’s Take

Pairing seaweed farms and offshore wind farms seems like an inspired idea.

Seaweed’s ability to absorb toxins and other contaminants from the sea make it environmentally friendly, but that’s not what humans want to consume. That’s where seaweed growers come in: they test the seaweed for safety and quality.

Any multipurpose sustainable use of an offshore wind farm, particularly one that provides both clean energy and nutritious food that doesn’t require either fertilizer or fresh water to grow, is a win. It’s also another example of innovation that the clean energy revolution is bringing about in the climate change fight.

7,"Renewables met all of the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of 2022, preventing any growth in coal and gas generation, according to a new report published by London-based energy think tank Ember.

The rise in wind and solar generation met over 75% of the demand growth in the first half of 2022, while hydro met the remainder, preventing a possible 4% increase in fossil-fuel generation and avoiding $40 billion in fuel costs and 230 Mt CO2 in emissions.

Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior analyst at Ember, said:

Wind and solar are proving themselves during the energy crisis. The first step to ending the grip of expensive and polluting fossil fuels is to build enough clean power to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity.

The report analyzes electricity data from 75 countries representing 90% of global electricity demand. It compares the first six months of 2022 to the first half of 2021 to show how the electricity transition has progressed.

The report finds that global electricity demand grew by 389 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first half of 2022. Renewables – wind, solar, and hydro – increased by 416 TWh, slightly exceeding the rise in electricity demand.

Wind and solar alone rose by 300 TWh, which was equal to 77% of the rise in global electricity demand. In China, the rise in wind and solar generation alone met 92% of its electricity demand rise. In the United States it was 81%, and in India it was 23%.

Rise in fossil-fuel generation unchanged

As a result of the growth in renewables, fossil-fuel generation was almost unchanged (+5 TWh, +0.1%). Coal fell by 36 TWh (-1%) and gas by 1 TWh (-0.05%). This offset a slight rise in other fossil fuels (mainly oil) of 42 TWh. Consequently, global CO2 power sector emissions were unchanged in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year, despite the rise in electricity demand.

Coal in the EU rose 15% only to cover a temporary shortfall in nuclear and hydro generation. Coal in India rose 10% because of a sharp rebound in electricity demand from lows early last year when the pandemic struck hardest. Globally, these rises were offset by coal-power falls of 3% in China and 7% in the United States.

The growth in wind and solar prevented a 4% rise in fossil fuel electricity generation worldwide. In China, the growth in wind and solar enabled fossil fuel power to fall by 3%. Without this growth, fossil fuels would have risen by 1%. In India, fossil fuel power rose by 9%, but it would have been 12% without growth in wind and solar. In the United States, it slowed down the rise in fossil fuel power from 7% to just 1%. In the EU, fossil fuel power rose by 6%, but it would have been 16% without growth in wind and solar.

Despite the halt in fossil-fuel generation in the first half of 2022, coal and gas generation increased in July and August. It leaves open the possibility that power sector emissions in 2022 may yet rise, following last year’s all-time high.

Further, a new report from San Francisco-based NGO Global Energy Monitor found that approximately 89.6 gigawatts (GW) of gas plants in development globally, totaling 5,070 million metric tons of CO2e lifetime emissions if built, are coal-to-gas conversions or replacements.

These conversions are proceeding despite data showing that gas projects are increasingly uncompetitive with renewables and are just as bad, if not worse, for the environment than coal.

Wiatros-Motyka said:

We can’t be sure if we’ve reached peak coal and gas in the power sector. Global power sector emissions are still pushing all-time highs when they need to be falling very quickly. And the same fossil fuels pushing us into a climate crisis are also causing the global energy crisis. We have a solution: Wind and solar are homegrown and cheap, and are already cutting both bills and emissions fast.

8,"While you may notice more electric vehicles on the road today than ever before, the technology is now making its way to miners, the companies extracting the critical minerals needed to build EVs, ensure adequate global food supply, etc. A new contract to supply battery electric vehicles to the Jansen potash project (potentially the world’s largest potash mine) expects to slash carbon emissions in half compared to its peers. What if we could apply this technology to miners in the EV industry, creating a full circle sustainable supply chain?

BHP’s Jansen potash project is expected to be the largest of its kind, with initial capacity forecasts of 4.3 to 4.5 Mtpa.

Potash is often found in fertilizer and is a rich source of potassium, a mineral essential for our health. Since potassium is not produced by the body naturally, it must be consumed through food. Potash is the most commonly used potassium fertilizer, but over 70% is based on conventional underground mining that uses heavy-duty equipment to extract it.

Although underground mining can release half the CO2 emissions of open-pit mining, the company is taking it further by introducing several battery electric vehicles.

Normet Canada, the mining company behind the project, was awarded a new contract to use battery electric vehicles at the Jansen potash project, including 10 underground EV loaders and one electric tethered loader.

With these heavy-duty electric vehicles, BHP says the Jansen project is forecast to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% compared to the Saskatchewan potash mine.

The electric vehicle deliveries are expected to begin in March 2023 and run through 2024, which will work perfectly as the miners aim to start production in 2026.

Like potassium is critical for humans, electric vehicles also require certain minerals such as lithium and nickel. These miners are looking for ways to build on the momentum electric vehicles are establishing in reducing carbon emissions, completing a complete sustainability supply chain. Several companies are now working to make this a reality.

Normet electric mining equipment (Source: Normet)

Miners using electric vehicles can complete the sustainability supply chain

Almost every automaker has set its intentions to scale production of its electric vehicles to meet the growing demand for zero-emission cars while setting carbon reduction targets.

For example, GM is going all-electric by 2035, Ford looks to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026, and Volkswagen plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2035, while North America follows.

Tesla, only selling electric cars, continues breaking records with 343,000 EVs delivered in Q3 on its way to producing 20 million annually.

However, getting to these numbers will require mining. A few companies have already begun working to build a sustainable EV supply chain.

Snow Lake Lithium outlined its plans in February to develop the world’s first all-electric lithium mine, one of the most critical minerals used to build EV batteries. The mining company’s CEO said at the time if you are going to mine for these resources that will be used to protect the environment, then obtaining them must also be done in a sustainable matter.

The company is working with Meglab, an electrical equipment provider and mining solutions company, to make the dream a reality.

There are operations around the world working to reduce emissions in the mining sector. In July 2021, Opibus (now ROAM) converted a Toyota Land Cruiser fitted with an electric powertrain to use a mining vehicle.

Miners using electric vehicles can significantly reduce the heat and carbon exposure they typically experience with diesel-powered equipment. Furthermore, EV mining technology can cost less as it requires less ventilation and cooling.

The point is, as the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, companies are figuring out ways to build on the momentum EVs are establishing in reducing emissions. If miners get on board, it will come full circle, creating a complete sustainable EV supply chain."
9,"Rise of the cyborg cockroaches.

Cyborg Cockroach

An international team of scientists has created cyborg cockroaches, with electronics wired to their nervous systems that allow them to be remote controlled.

The researchers fitted wireless control modules powered by rechargeable batteries to the backs of Madagascar cockroaches, which can grow up to 2.4 inches long.

By stimulating each of the cockroaches' cerci, which are appendages that act like sensory nerves, via their tiny backpacks, the scientists were able to tell them where to go from a distance — a wild showcase of cutting-edge tech that they say could one day be harnessed to aid during search and rescue missions or help monitor the environment.

Solar Backpack

While these aren't aren't the first cyborg cockroaches, the team write in a new paper published in the journal npj Flexible Electronics that these new ones have a number of innovations that allowed them to assume control for longer periods of time.

Specifically, a tiny and extremely thin solar cell also ensured that the battery stays charged, allowing the researchers to remote control the cockroaches for extended periods of time.

""The body-mounted ultrathin organic solar cell module achieves a power output of 17.2 microwatts, which is more than 50 times larger than the power output of current state-of-the-art energy harvesting devices on living insects,"" lead author Kenjiro Fukuda, a senior research scientist at Riken University, said in a statement.

Urban Rescue

But the cockroaches aren't being dispatched during search and rescue missions any time soon.

""The current system only has a wireless locomotion control system, so it's not enough to prepare an application such as urban rescue,"" Fukuda told CNET. ""By integrating other required devices such as sensors and cameras, we can use our cyborg insects for such purposes.""

According to the researcher, the same technology could be applied to beetles and cicadas as well.

It's a fun and futuristic vision: an army of remotely controlled cyborg insects that can infiltrate hard to reach locations or monitor crops.

But scientists will have to advance the tech carefully — nobody wants to risk a cyborg cockroach uprising.

Three babies have been born after receiving the world’s first spina bifida treatment combining surgery with stem cells. This was made possible by a landmark clinical trial at UC Davis Health. The one-of-a-kind treatment, delivered while a fetus is still developing in the mother’s womb, could improve outcomes for children with this birth defect. Launched in the spring of 2021, the clinical trial is known formally as the “CuRe Trial: Cellular Therapy for In Utero Repair of Myelomeningocele.” Thirty-five patients will be treated in total. The three babies from the trial that have been born so far will be monitored by the research team until 30 months of age to fully assess the procedure’s safety and effectiveness. The first phase of the trial is funded by a $9 million state grant from the state’s stem cell agency, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). Emily with baby Robbie, 15 days after her birth. “This clinical trial could enhance the quality of life for so many patients to come,” said Emily, the first clinical trial participant who traveled from Austin, Tex. to participate. Her daughter Robbie was born last October. “We didn’t know about spina bifida until the diagnosis. We are so thankful that we got to be a part of this. We are giving our daughter the very best chance at a bright future.” Spina bifida, also known as myelomeningocele, occurs when spinal tissue fails to fuse properly during the early stages of pregnancy. The birth defect can lead to a range of lifelong cognitive, mobility, urinary and bowel disabilities. It affects 1,500 to 2,000 children in the U.S. every year. It is often diagnosed through ultrasound. While surgery performed after birth can help reduce some of the effects, surgery before birth can prevent or lessen the severity of the fetus’s spinal damage, which worsens over the course of pregnancy. “I’ve been working toward this day for almost 25 years now,” said Diana Farmer, the world’s first woman fetal surgeon, professor and chair of surgery at UC Davis Health and principal investigator on the study.

I’ve been working toward this day for almost 25 years now.” — Diana Farmer

The path to a future cure

As a leader of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) clinical trial in the early 2000s, Farmer had previously helped to prove that fetal surgery reduced neurological deficits from spina bifida. Many children in that study showed improvement but still required wheelchairs or leg braces.

Farmer recruited bioengineer Aijun Wang specifically to help take that work to the next level. Together, they launched the UC Davis Health Surgical Bioengineering Laboratory to find ways to use stem cells and bioengineering to advance surgical effectiveness and improve outcomes. Farmer also launched the UC Davis Fetal Care and Treatment Center with fetal surgeon Shinjiro Hirose and the UC Davis Children’s Surgery Center several years ago.

Farmer, Wang and their research team have been working on their novel approach using stem cells in fetal surgery for more than 10 years. Over that time, animal modeling has shown it is capable of preventing the paralysis associated with spina bifida.

It’s believed that the stem cells work to repair and restore damaged spinal tissue, beyond what surgery can accomplish alone.

Preliminary work by Farmer and Wang proved that prenatal surgery combined with human placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, held in place with a biomaterial scaffold to form a “patch,” helped lambs with spina bifida walk without noticeable disability.

“When the baby sheep who received stem cells were born, they were able to stand at birth and they were able to run around almost normally. It was amazing,” Wang said.

When the team refined their surgery and stem cells technique for canines, the treatment also improved the mobility of dogs with naturally occurring spina bifida.

A pair of English bulldogs named Darla and Spanky were the world’s first dogs to be successfully treated with surgery and stem cells. Spina bifida, a common birth defect in this breed, frequently leaves them with little function in their hindquarters.

By their post-surgery re-check at 4 months old, Darla and Spanky were able to walk, run and play.

The world’s first human trial

When Emily and her husband Harry learned that they would be first-time parents, they never expected any pregnancy complications. But the day that Emily learned that her developing child had spina bifida was also the day she first heard about the CuRe trial.

For Emily, it was a lifeline that they couldn’t refuse.

Participating in the trial would mean that she would need to temporarily move to Sacramento for the fetal surgery and then for weekly follow-up visits during her pregnancy.

After screenings, MRI scans and interviews, Emily received the life-changing news that she was accepted into the trial. Her fetal surgery was scheduled for July 12, 2021, at 25 weeks and five days gestation.

Farmer and Wang’s team manufactures clinical grade stem cells – mesenchymal stem cells – from placental tissue in the UC Davis Health’s CIRM-funded Institute for Regenerative Cures. The cells are known to be among the most promising type of cells in regenerative medicine.

The lab is a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Laboratory for safe use in humans. It is here that they made the stem cell patch for Emily’s fetal surgery.

“It’s a four-day process to make the stem cell patch,” said Priya Kumar, the scientist at the Center for Surgical Bioengineering in the Department of Surgery, who leads the team that creates the stem cell patches and delivers them to the operating room. “The time we pull out the cells, the time we seed on the scaffold, and the time we deliver, is all critical.”

A first in medical history

During Emily’s historic procedure, a 40-person operating and cell preparation team did the careful dance that they had been long preparing for.

After Emily was placed under general anesthetic, a small opening was made in her uterus and they floated the fetus up to that incision point so they could expose its spine and the spina bifida defect. The surgeons used a microscope to carefully begin the repair.

Then the moment of truth: The stem cell patch was placed directly over the exposed spinal cord of the fetus. The fetal surgeons then closed the incision to allow the tissue to regenerate.

“The placement of the stem cell patch went off without a hitch. Mother and fetus did great!” Farmer said.

The team declared the first-of-its-kind surgery a success.

Delivery day

On Sept. 20, 2021, at 35 weeks and five days gestation, Robbie was born at 5 pounds, 10 ounces, 19 inches long via C-section.

“One of my first fears was that I wouldn’t be able to see her, but they brought her over to me. I got to see her toes wiggle for the first time. It was so reassuring and a little bit out of this world,” Emily said.

This experience has been larger than life and has exceeded every expectation. I hope this trial will enhance the quality of life for so many patients to come.” — Emily

For Farmer, this day is what she had long hoped for, and it came with surprises. If Robbie had remained untreated, she was expected to be born with leg paralysis.

“It was very clear the minute she was born that she was kicking her legs and I remember very clearly saying, ‘Oh my God, I think she’s wiggling her toes!’” said Farmer, who noted that the observation was not an official confirmation, but it was promising. “It was amazing. We kept saying, ‘Am I seeing that? Is that real?’”

Both mom and baby are at home and in good health. Robbie just celebrated her first birthday.

The CuRe team is cautious about drawing conclusions and says a lot is still to be learned during this safety phase of the trial. The team will continue to monitor Robbie and the other babies in the trial until they are 6 years old, with a key checkup happening at 30 months to see if they are walking and potty training.

“This experience has been larger than life and has exceeded every expectation. I hope this trial will enhance the quality of life for so many patients to come,” Emily said. “We are honored to be part of history in the making.”

11,"Professor Trevor Graham, Director of the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), said in a statement: ""We've unveiled an extra level of control for how cancers behave – something we liken to cancer’s 'dark matter.' For years, our understanding of cancer has focused on genetic mutations which permanently change the DNA code. But our research has shown that the way the DNA folds up can change which genes are read without altering the DNA code and this can be very important in determining how cancers behave.""

The research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, Human Technopole in Milan, and the Queen Mary University of London.

Epigenetic changes are involved in cancer's evolution

In the first paper, the researchers collected 1,373 samples from 30 bowel cancers and looked at epigenetic changes as cancers grew. Their observations showed that epigenetic changes are common in cancerous cells, are heritable, and were present in cancer cells that had ""survival advantages.""

The second paper intended to study why cancer cells within the same tumor can be different from one another. So, the researchers looked at the DNA sequence in diverse samples taken from different parts of the same tumor. The study revealed that less than two percent of ""changes in the DNA code in independent areas of a tumor were associated with changes in gene activity and variation in cancer cell characteristics throughout tumors is often governed by factors other than DNA mutations"".

With these studies, scientists were able to track the influence of epigenetic control on the growth and evolution of bowel cancers. They also noted that epigenetic changes are heavily involved in cancer's evolution.

""I hope our work will change the way we think about cancer and its treatment – and should ultimately affect the way patients are treated. Genetic testing for cancer mutations only gives us part of the picture about a person’s cancer – and is blind to ‘epigenetic’ changes to how genes are read. By testing for both genetic and epigenetic changes, we could, potentially, much more accurately predict which treatments will work best for a particular person’s cancer,"" said Graham."
12,"Now, Merck has exercised its option by agreeing to pay a sum of $250 million to Moderna, which will pave the way for further development and commercialization of the vaccine, a Merck press release said.

How will the vaccine work?

Cancerous cells can have mutations — changes in their DNA sequence that make conventional treatment ineffective. By using a personalized cancer vaccine, the patient's immune system can be prepared to generate a mutation-specific anti-tumor response.

Moderna's mRNA-4517/V940 is designed to generate Tcell responses based on the mutational signature of the tumor in the patient. T cells are a type of white blood cell that are tasked with defending the body in the event of an infection.

Merck's KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that targets the PD-1 protein that cells can use to evade detection by T cells. Since both healthy as well as cancerous cells use this mechanism to evade T cell attack, using KEYTRUDA even puts healthy cells in the firing line.

In combination with Moderna's vaccine, the treatment can aim to specifically target tumor cells.

KEYNOTE-942 trial

Merck's KEYTRUDA is currently being used in over 1,600 trials across a wide range of cancers. Through these trials, Merck is trying to understand the various factors that might affect the effectiveness of the treatment in patients.

KEYNOTE 942 is one such trial studying the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in high-risk melanoma patients. Currently, in Phase 2, the trial has enrolled 157 patients who have been randomized into two groups following the surgical removal of their tumors."
13,"Work on the project will begin “before 2025.” It will surpass the largest wind farm in the world once it is finished, according to Guangdong province officials.

The Jiuquan Wind Power base in China, a huge facility with a 20 gigawatt capacity, presently holds the distinction of being the world’s largest wind farm.

A city in the nearby Fujian Province earlier this year proposed a 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) project that included 50 gigawatts of offshore wind.

With more than 25 percent of the world's wind power capacity, China is claimed to be a world leader in wind energy.

Capacity: 13 million homes

The 10-kilometer-long farm, which will have thousands of strong wind turbines, will operate between 75 and 185 kilometers (47 and 115 miles) offshore.

And because of the region's distinctive topographical features and windy location, these turbines will be able to run between 43 percent to 49 percent of the time, meaning 3,800 to 4,300 hours each year.

A gigawatt is one billion watts, and 3 million solar panels are required to produce one gigawatt of power. 100 million LEDs or 300,000 typical European homes may each be powered by one gigawatt.

The facility's 43.3 GW of power-generating capacity could supply electricity to 13 million households, which is equal to 4.3 billion LED lights, as per Euronews.

Over 99 percent of Norway's electricity comes from hydropower plants with a 31 GW capacity, which is less than the new Chinese wind farm project. The record-breaking offshore farm would be bigger than all of the power plants in Norway combined."
14,"It saw the use of a photonic chip, a microchip containing two or more photonic components which form a functioning circuit. This technology detects, generates, transports, and processes light to divide a stream of data into thousands of separate channels and transmit them all at once over 7.9 kilometers.

“First, the team split the data stream into 37 sections, each of which was sent down a separate core of the fibre-optic cable. Next, each of these channels was split into 223 data chunks that existed in individual slices of the electromagnetic spectrum. This 'frequency comb' of equidistant spikes of light across the spectrum allowed data to be transmitted in different colours at the same time without interfering with each other, massively increasing the capacity of each core,” explained New Scientist.

In the past, we have witnessed data transfer rates of up to 10.66 petabits per second but they were created through the use of bulky inefficient and impractical equipment. This new and improved research sets a record for transmission using a single computer chip as a light source. The technology could see energy costs significantly slashed and bandwidths severely increased.

Using dummy data

The experiment used so much data that no computer today exists that could supply or receive this much information at this rate. The team had to therefore pass “dummy data” through all channels, says Jørgensen, and experiment on the output one channel at a time to ensure that it was all being sent and recovered adequately."

Azure also unveiled what it called the world's first 3D printed ""backyard studio"" made with recycled plastic materials in the same month.

The plastic 3D printed studios and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) - meaning legal and regulatory terms for a secondary house or apartment that shares the building lot of a larger, primary home - are now available for preorder as the startup prepares to ramp up its production line in the Culver City neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Azure uses recyclable plastics to build homes. Azure

Faster, cheaper, and sustainable homes with 3D printing

Azure sticks up for building homes 70 percent faster and 30 percent cheaper than ""traditional home construction methods."" As Business Insider says, most 3D home builders use a form of mixed or pure concrete to build a home. However, Azure is ""saying goodbye"" to this by using sustainable materials.

Azure's printing materials consist of the waterproof plastic polymer generally found in plastic bottles and packaging food, according to the startup.

""Our supply chain should never be short in our lifetime,"" told Ross Maguire to Business Insider.

""We have created production efficiencies not only by capitalizing on the advances in 3D printing but by creating a design and process that is completed in only 20 hours. When compared with conventional construction, we produce the entire structural skeleton, the exterior sheathing, the water control barrier, the exterior finish, the passageways for utilities, and the grounding for interior finishes, in a fraction of the time and cost. By revolutionizing a new age of the home building with our sustainable, automated, and exact production processes, we see a very, very exciting future ahead,"" further added Maguire in April to describe the startup's goal."
16,"Aeromine says its unique ""motionless"" rooftop wind generators deliver up to 50% more energy than a solar array of the same price, while taking up just 10% of the roof space and operating more or less silently. In independent tests, they seem legit.

Distributed energy generation stands to play a growing part in the world's energy markets. Most of this currently comes in the form of rooftop solar, but in certain areas, wind could definitely play a bigger part. Not every spot is appropriate for a bladed wind turbine, though, and in this regard, University of Houston spinoff Aeromine Technologies has designed a very different, very tidy form of rooftop wind energy capture that looks like it could be a real game-changer.

As with traditional wind turbines, size is key. So while Aeromine's wind energy boxes take up a relatively small footprint on your roof, they're still pretty bulky. The wings themselves are maybe 10 feet (3 m) high, at a rough guess, and looking at the latest imagery they're now sitting on top of boxes that might add another 6 ft (1.8 m) or more to their height – so they're no shrinking violets. On the other hand, they don't create the noise, or the constantly moving visual distraction of a regular, bladed turbine, so they may prove to be less unwelcome in populated areas.

They work differently too – kind of like a set of race-car spoiler wings sandwiched together facing each other, with a round pole in between them. Angled into the wind, these stationary wings generate a low pressure vacuum in the center of the device, which sucks air through perforations either in the wings themselves or in the round pole, which also aids in accelerating the ambient airflow over the wings.

(rendered image) the design places a couple of racecar spolier-like wings in a sandwich orientation, to create a low-pressure vacuum that sucks air through from below. The turbine is thus kept out of harm's way Aeromine

So where's the turbine? Depending on the installation, it can either be at the bottom of that central pole, surrounded by a duct, or in more compact designs that sit right down on the roof instead of up on top of a box, the fan can be down in the roof of the building itself, in a pipe connecting either to that central pole or to hollow chambers in the perforated wings. Either way, the wings create a low-pressure zone, air is sucked through a tube to fill that low-pressure zone, and Aeromine places a relatively small, cheap internal propeller (perhaps 36 inches/91 cm in diameter) in that tube to run a generator.

It's very quiet, very safe and very cheap to build; you don't need any fancy materials like carbon fiber, there's nothing special about the fan itself, and the whole thing comes apart for transport and a relatively simple construction process on site.

Aeromine hasn't yet nominated a standard capacity for its devices in their latest iteration – indeed, we had to go digging to find much information at all about the device. But in a solution presented to the AFWERX Reimagining Energy challenge in January 2021, these units were each rated for 5 kW – pretty close to the output of a typical 21-panel, household rooftop solar system. Multiple units can of course be run along the leading edge of a building, spaced around 15 ft (4.6 m) apart, and each unit in this (now outdated) AFWERX challenge promised to generate around 14.3 MWh annually. Just for perspective, my 6.5-kW home rooftop solar system makes somewhere around 9 MWh a year.

Aeromine Wind-Harvesting Unit, installed as a pilot trial on top of BASF's manufacturing facilities in Wyandotte, Michigan. We expect the large box at the bottom will disappear in commercial applications, with the air intake and turbine running below the roof line Aeromine

The potential here is pretty clear; solar and wind work well in a complementary fashion. Solar's only generating during the sunniest hours, wind can be 24 hours but is totally dependent on conditions. The small rooftop footprint of an Aeromine system makes it possible to cover the rest of the roof in solar panels, then get some on-site battery storage happening and run a decent-sized business more or less off the grid.

So what are the downsides? Well, these things need to be installed in spots where the wind direction is pretty constant, because they don't angle themselves to catch a breeze – and they probably never will, since they're designed to be such a cost-conscious machine. Their height might make them a visual or civic planning issue in some areas, and what's more, they'll cast shadows, which will block the sun from reaching rooftop PV panels unless the building is oriented such that the sun comes from one side and the wind from the other. So there's certainly going to be a limited number of places where they'll work optimally in a hybrid system.

But that's about it at first glance. They're certainly cheaper, hardier, safer and less intrusive than windmill-style designs, and they offer a highly-accessible way to introduce reliable wind energy into a distributed power system.

(Rendered image) Many Aeromine units can be run together, with proper spacing, and there's plenty of rooftop left for solar panels to run a hybrid system Aeromine

Before getting too excited about any strange new wind energy tech, it's always worth revisiting Mike Barnard's excellent checklist to weed out dodgy wind power claims. Written in 2013, it's as relevant as ever today as more and more money flows into clean energy tech.

Aeromine fares well against the Barnard test. With the University of Houston behind it, it has also submitted its gear to the gold-standard Sandia National Laboratories for testing – indeed Sandia has been involved directly in the development. It claims to harvest no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of the Betz limit of potential wind energy.

A technical performance analysis prepared in partnership with Sandia, using wind tunnels at Texas Tech University, states that ""by sweeping a large area of wind with a reliable design, AeroMINEs overcome the challenges that have plagued other distributed wind solutions and have hindered distributed wind from playing a significant role in energy markets."" The report also notes a boost in energy extraction, coupled with some aerodynamic instability, when the airflow reaches the device from higher angles of attack.

Aeromine motionless wind unit

Aeromine says that BASF is testing the system at its manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan – although it doesn't say how many units have been installed, or of what capacity. Hunting through the satellite overlays in Google Maps, it seems that the pilot test unit in the video above is situated right here, judging by the unique markings on the roof – but the satellite image isn't recent enough to show the wind power system, so we can't figure out much more.

We expect this extra-tall unit sitting on a box is simply a temporary prototype designed to be super-easy to add and remove, where the final product will sit flush against the roof and have its piping and turbine installed under the surface. We wish Aeromine would be more forthcoming in its marketing.

Either way, despite the limited information the company is willing to release at this point, this looks like it could be an impressive step forward for distributed rooftop wind energy. We hope Aeromine proves capable of scaling this tech up and making a serious contribution in the race to zero carbon.

17,"Cancer’s ability to spread through the body is one of its most devastating tricks. Scientists at Cambridge have now identified a protein that plays a key role in metastasis, which not only hints at a new potential treatment but reveals for the first time that this process isn’t unique to cancer.

No matter where in the body it originates, cancer can eventually begin to colonize other organs and tissues through a process known as metastasis, which makes it much harder to treat. Unfortunately, there’s still much about metastasis that scientists don’t understand, but ongoing research is continually uncovering mechanisms that could lead to new therapy options.

In the new study, Cambridge scientists discovered not just a new mechanism for metastasis, but completely recontextualized its role. It’s long been thought that metastasis was an abnormal process that arises in cancer, but the new study found that it’s a process used by healthy cells as well – cancer just hijacks it for its own purposes.

The team made the discovery while investigating a cellular structure known as sodium leak channel, non-selective (NALCN). These channels are located on cell membranes and control how salt goes in and out of the cell. In the new study, the researchers found that NALCN also regulates the release of cells from tissues into the bloodstream, where they can be taken up by other organs and tissues.

In tests in mice, the scientists blocked the function of the NALCN protein, and found that it triggered metastasis in stomach, intestinal and pancreatic cancers. That suggests this could be a new target for preventing metastasis, potentially improving outcomes for patients with cancer.

But the most surprising discovery came when the team tested the technique in mice without cancer. Blocking NALCN also caused healthy cells to migrate away from their original organs to other ones – pancreatic cells, for instance, moved to the kidney and became healthy kidney cells instead.

“These findings are among the most important to have come out of my lab for three decades,” said Professor Richard Gilbertson, Group Leader of the study. “Not only have we identified one of the elusive drivers of metastasis, but we have also turned a commonly held understanding of this on its head, showing how cancer hijacks processes in healthy cells for its own gains. If validated through further research, this could have far-reaching implications for how we prevent cancer from spreading and allow us to manipulate this process to repair damaged organs.”

The team now plans to investigate ways to take advantage of this discovery to prevent metastasis, including repurposing existing drugs.

The research was published in the journal Nature Genetics.

18,"Engineers at Duke University have developed a novel delivery system for cancer treatment and demonstrated its potential against one of the disease’s most troublesome forms. In newly published research in mice with pancreatic cancer, the scientists showed how a radioactive implant could completely eliminate tumors in the majority of the rodents, demonstrating what they say is the most effective treatment ever studied in these pre-clinical models.

Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat, with tumor cells of this type highly evasive and loaded with mutations that make them resistant to many drugs. It accounts for just 3.2 percent of all cancers, yet is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. One way of tackling it is by deploying chemotherapy to hold the tumor cells in a state that makes them vulnerable to radiation, and then hitting the tumor with a targeted radiation beam.

But doing so in a way that attacks the tumor but doesn’t expose the patient to heavy doses of radiation is a fine line to tread, and raises the risk of severe side effects. Another method scientists are exploring is the use of implants that can be placed directly inside the tumor to attack it with radioactive materials from within. They have made some inroads using titanium shells to encase the radioactive samples, but these can cause damage to the surrounding tissue.

""There's just no good way to treat pancreatic cancer right now,"" said study author Jeff Schaal.

Schaal and his team explored an alternative type of implant, one made from more biocompatible materials that wouldn’t post the same risks to the human body. The scientists used synthetic chains of amino acids known as elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), which remain in a liquid state at room temperature but form a stable gel-like material in the warmer environment of the body.

This substance was injected into tumors in various mouse models of pancreatic cancer along with a radioactive element called iodine-131, an isotope that is well-studied and widely used in medical treatment. In this environment, the ELP entombs the iodine-131 and prevents it leaking into the body, but allows it to emit beta radiation that penetrates into the surrounding tumor. Once the radiation is spent, the ELP biogel safely degrades into harmless amino acids.

The treatment was tested in combination with a common chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. The radioactive implants were injected into cancer tumors just beneath the skin, but with mutations known to occur in pancreatic cancer, and into tumors within the pancreas itself that are historically more difficult to treat.

Across all the models tested, the scientists report a 100% response rate to the treatment. In three quarters of the models, the dual treatment completely eliminated the tumors 80% of the time. The scientists deployed the novel treatment against pancreatic cancer because they wanted to explore its potential against one of the trickiest forms of the disease, but believe these results bode well for its wider application.

""We think the constant radiation allows the drugs to interact with its effects more strongly than external beam therapy allows,"" Schaal said. ""That makes us think that this approach might actually work better than external beam therapy for many other cancers, too.""

There is lots to play out before that happens, with trials on larger animals the immediate next step for the researchers. They do say these findings are unparalleled in terms of how effectively the treatment was able to disintegrate the tumors, with team member Ashutosh Chilkoti describing them as “perhaps the most exciting” results against late-stage pancreatic cancer his lab has produced in almost 20 years.

""We did a deep dive through over 1,100 treatments across preclinical models and never found results where the tumors shrank away and disappeared like ours did,"" said Schaal. “When the rest of the literature is saying that what we're seeing doesn't happen, that's when we knew we had something extremely interesting.""

19,"Taking advantage of a phenomenon known as emergent behavior in the microscale, MIT engineers have designed simple microparticles that can collectively generate complex behavior, much the same way that a colony of ants can dig tunnels or collect food.

Working together, the microparticles can generate a beating clock that oscillates at a very low frequency. These oscillations can then be harnessed to power tiny robotic devices, the researchers showed.

“In addition to being interesting from a physics point of view, this behavior can also be translated into an on-board oscillatory electrical signal, which can be very powerful in microrobotic autonomy. There are a lot of electrical components that require such an oscillatory input,” says Jingfan Yang, a recent MIT PhD recipient and one of the lead authors of the new study.

The particles used to create the new oscillator perform a simple chemical reaction that allows the particles to interact with each other through the formation and bursting of tiny gas bubbles. Under the right conditions, these interactions create an oscillator that behaves similar to a ticking clock, beating at intervals of a few seconds.

“We're trying to look for very simple rules or features that you can encode into relatively simple microrobotic machines, to get them to collectively do very sophisticated tasks,” says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT.

Strano is the senior author of the new paper, which appears today in Nature Communications. Along with Yang, Thomas Berrueta, a Northwestern University graduate student advised by Professor Todd Murphey, is a lead author of the study.

Collective behavior

Demonstrations of emergent behavior can be seen throughout the natural world, where colonies of insects such as ants and bees accomplish feats that a single member of the group would never be able to achieve.

“Ants have minuscule brains and they do very simple cognitive tasks, but collectively they can do amazing things. They can forage for food and build these elaborate tunnel structures,” Strano says. “Physicists and engineers like myself want to understand these rules because it means we can make tiny things that collectively do complex tasks.”

In this study, the researchers wanted to design particles that could generate rhythmic movements, or oscillations, with a very low frequency. Until now, building low-frequency micro-oscillators has required sophisticated electronics that are expensive and difficult to design, or specialized materials with complex chemistries.

The simple particles that the researchers designed for this study are discs as small as 100 microns in diameter. The discs, made from a polymer called SU-8, have a platinum patch that can catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

When the particles are placed at the surface of a droplet of hydrogen peroxide on a flat surface, they tend to travel to the top of the droplet. At this liquid-air interface, they interact with any other particles found there. Each particle produces its own tiny bubble of oxygen, and when two particles come close enough that their bubbles interact, the bubbles pop, propelling the particles away from each other. Then, they begin forming new bubbles, and the cycle repeats over and over.

“One particle by itself stays still and doesn’t do anything interesting, but through teamwork, they can do something pretty amazing and useful, which is actually a difficult thing to achieve at the microscale,” Yang says."
20,"The study is a collaboration between Dagdeviren’s lab; Siqi Zheng, the STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; and Tolga Durak, managing director of MIT’s Environment, Health, and Safety programs. Jin-Hoon Kim, an MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Electronics.

The researchers hope that their sensor will help people to find masks that fit them better, and that designers could use it to create masks that fit a wider variety of face shapes and sizes. The sensor can also be used to monitor vital signs such as breathing rate and temperature, as well as environmental conditions such as humidity.

“What we realized by analyzing our collected data from the individuals in the study was that the masks that we use in daily life are not very suitable for female participants,” says Canan Dagdeviren, the LG Career Development Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT and the corresponding author of the study.

Using this sensor, the researchers analyzed the fit of surgical masks on male and female subjects, and found that overall, the masks fit women’s faces much less closely than they fit men’s faces.

Currently, there are no simple ways to measure the fit of a mask, but a new sensor developed at MIT could make it much easier to ensure a good fit. The sensor, which measures physical contact between the mask and the wearer’s face, can be applied to any kind of mask.

Wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, but a mask’s effectiveness depends on how well it fits.

Fit quality

The researchers began working on this project before mask-wearing became common during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their original intention was to use sensors embedded in masks to measure the effectiveness of mask-wearing in areas with high levels of air pollution. However, once the pandemic started, they realized that such a sensor could have more widespread applications.

With so many different kinds of masks available during the pandemic, the researchers thought this kind of sensor could be useful to help individuals find the best-fitting mask for them. Currently, the only way to measure mask fit is to use a machine called a mask fit tester, which evaluates the mask fit by comparing air particle concentrations inside and outside of the face mask. However, this type of machine is only available in specialized facilities such as hospitals, which use them to evaluate mask fit for health care workers.

The MIT team wanted to create a more user-friendly, portable device to measure mask fit. Dagdeviren’s lab, the Conformable Decoders group, specializes in developing flexible, stretchable electronics that can be worn on the skin or incorporated into textiles to detect signals from the body.

“In this project, we wanted to monitor both biological and environmental conditions simultaneously, such as breathing pattern, skin temperature, human activities, temperature and humidity inside the face mask, and the position of the mask, including whether people are wearing it properly or not,” Kim says. “We also wanted to check the fit quality.”

To integrate their sensors into face masks, the researchers created a device that they call a conformable multimodal sensor face mask (cMaSK). Sensors that measure a variety of parameters are embedded in a flexible polymer frame that can be reversibly attached to the inside of any mask, around the edges.

To measure fit, the cMaSK has 17 sensors around the edge of the mask that measure capacitance, which can be used to determine whether the mask is touching the skin at each of those locations.

The cMaSK interface also has sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure, which can detect activities such as speaking and coughing. An accelerometer within the device can reveal if the wearer is moving around. All of the sensors are embedded into a biocompatible polymer called polyimide, which is used in medical implants such as stents.

The conformable electronics are laminated and delaminated on a surgical mask.

The researchers tested the cMaSK interface in a group of five men and five women. All of the subjects wore surgical masks, and the researchers monitored the readings from the sensors as the participants performed a variety of activities, such as speaking, walking, and running. They also tested the sensors in a variety of temperature conditions.

Using data obtained by the capacitance sensors, the researchers created a machine-learning algorithm to calculate mask fit quality for each subject in the study. These measurements revealed that mask fit was significantly worse for women than men, due to differences in face shape and size. However, the fit for women could be improved slightly by wearing smaller surgical masks. The researchers also found that mask fit quality was low for one of the male subjects who had a beard, which created gaps between the mask and the skin.

To verify their results, the researchers also collaborated with MIT’s Environment, Health, and Safety Office on the design and evaluation of the fit, and found that the fit results for each study participant were very similar to what they found using the cMaSK.

Customized fit

The researchers hope that their findings will encourage mask manufacturers to design masks that fit a variety of face shapes and sizes, especially women’s faces. Dagdeviren’s lab is planning to work on mass production and large-scale deployment of the cMaSK interface.

“We hope to think about ways to design masks and come up with the best fit for individuals,” Dagdeviren says. “We have different sizes for shoes, and you can even customize your shoes. So why can’t you customize and design your mask, for your own health and for societal benefit?”

The researchers also hope to return to their original idea of studying the effects of air pollution on people who work outside.

“Our technology can really help to quantify the social costs of these environmental hazards, and also to measure the benefits of any kind of policy intervention,” Zheng says.

“We envision a few patches adhered to different locations on the body, and the patches would communicate with your cellphone, where AI algorithms would analyze the images on demand,” says the study’s senior author, Xuanhe Zhao, professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering at MIT. “We believe we’ve opened a new era of wearable imaging: With a few patches on your body, you could see your internal organs.”

If the devices can be made to operate wirelessly — a goal the team is currently working toward — the ultrasound stickers could be made into wearable imaging products that patients could take home from a doctor’s office or even buy at a pharmacy.

The current design requires connecting the stickers to instruments that translate the reflected sound waves into images. The researchers point out that even in their current form, the stickers could have immediate applications: For instance, the devices could be applied to patients in the hospital, similar to heart-monitoring EKG stickers, and could continuously image internal organs without requiring a technician to hold a probe in place for long periods of time.

The researchers applied the stickers to volunteers and showed the devices produced live, high-resolution images of major blood vessels and deeper organs such as the heart, lungs, and stomach. The stickers maintained a strong adhesion and captured changes in underlying organs as volunteers performed various activities, including sitting, standing, jogging, and biking.

In a paper appearing today in Science, the engineers present the design for a new ultrasound sticker — a stamp-sized device that sticks to skin and can provide continuous ultrasound imaging of internal organs for 48 hours.

Currently, ultrasound imaging requires bulky and specialized equipment available only in hospitals and doctor’s offices. But a new design by MIT engineers might make the technology as wearable and accessible as buying Band-Aids at the pharmacy.

Ultrasound imaging is a safe and noninvasive window into the body’s workings, providing clinicians with live images of a patient’s internal organs. To capture these images, trained technicians manipulate ultrasound wands and probes to direct sound waves into the body. These waves reflect back out to produce high-resolution images of a patient’s heart, lungs, and other deep organs.

A sticky issue

To image with ultrasound, a technician first applies a liquid gel to a patient’s skin, which acts to transmit ultrasound waves. A probe, or transducer, is then pressed against the gel, sending sound waves into the body that echo off internal structures and back to the probe, where the echoed signals are translated into visual images.

For patients who require long periods of imaging, some hospitals offer probes affixed to robotic arms that can hold a transducer in place without tiring, but the liquid ultrasound gel flows away and dries out over time, interrupting long-term imaging.

In recent years, researchers have explored designs for stretchable ultrasound probes that would provide portable, low-profile imaging of internal organs. These designs gave a flexible array of tiny ultrasound transducers, the idea being that such a device would stretch and conform with a patient’s body.

But these experimental designs have produced low-resolution images, in part due to their stretch: In moving with the body, transducers shift location relative to each other, distorting the resulting image.

“Wearable ultrasound imaging tool would have huge potential in the future of clinical diagnosis. However, the resolution and imaging duration of existing ultrasound patches is relatively low, and they cannot image deep organs,” says Chonghe Wang, who is an MIT graduate student.

An inside look

The MIT team’s new ultrasound sticker produces higher resolution images over a longer duration by pairing a stretchy adhesive layer with a rigid array of transducers. “This combination enables the device to conform to the skin while maintaining the relative location of transducers to generate clearer and more precise images.” Wang says.

The device’s adhesive layer is made from two thin layers of elastomer that encapsulate a middle layer of solid hydrogel, a mostly water-based material that easily transmits sound waves. Unlike traditional ultrasound gels, the MIT team’s hydrogel is elastic and stretchy.

“The elastomer prevents dehydration of hydrogel,” says Chen, an MIT postdoc. “Only when hydrogel is highly hydrated can acoustic waves penetrate effectively and give high-resolution imaging of internal organs.”

The bottom elastomer layer is designed to stick to skin, while the top layer adheres to a rigid array of transducers that the team also designed and fabricated. The entire ultrasound sticker measures about 2 square centimeters across, and 3 millimeters thick — about the area of a postage stamp.

The researchers ran the ultrasound sticker through a battery of tests with healthy volunteers, who wore the stickers on various parts of their bodies, including the neck, chest, abdomen, and arms. The stickers stayed attached to their skin, and produced clear images of underlying structures for up to 48 hours. During this time, volunteers performed a variety of activities in the lab, from sitting and standing, to jogging, biking, and lifting weights.

From the stickers’ images, the team was able to observe the changing diameter of major blood vessels when seated versus standing. The stickers also captured details of deeper organs, such as how the heart changes shape as it exerts during exercise. The researchers were also able to watch the stomach distend, then shrink back as volunteers drank then later passed juice out of their system. And as some volunteers lifted weights, the team could detect bright patterns in underlying muscles, signaling temporary microdamage.

“With imaging, we might be able to capture the moment in a workout before overuse, and stop before muscles become sore,” says Chen. “We do not know when that moment might be yet, but now we can provide imaging data that experts can interpret.”

The team is working to make the stickers function wirelessly. They are also developing software algorithms based on artificial intelligence that can better interpret and diagnose the stickers’ images. Then, Zhao envisions ultrasound stickers could be packaged and purchased by patients and consumers, and used not only to monitor various internal organs, but also the progression of tumors, as well as the development of fetuses in the womb.

“We imagine we could have a box of stickers, each designed to image a different location of the body,” Zhao says. “We believe this represents a breakthrough in wearable devices and medical imaging.”

22,"Scientist from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have found a novel way of growing cell-based meat by zapping animal cells with a magnet. This new technique simplifies the production process of cell-based meat by reducing reliance on animal products, and it is also greener, cleaner, safer and more cost-effective.

Cultured meat is an alternative to animal farming with advantages such as reducing carbon footprint and the risk of transmitting diseases in animals. However, the current method of producing cultured meat involves using other animal products, which largely defeats the purpose, or drugs to stimulate the growth of the meat.

To cultivate cell-based meat, animal cells are fed animal serum – usually foetal bovine serum (FBS), which is a mixture harvested from the blood of foetuses excised from pregnant cows slaughtered in the dairy or meat industries – to help them grow and proliferate. This is a critical, yet cruel and expensive, step in the current cell-based meat production process. Ironically, many of these molecules come from the muscles within the slaughtered animal, but scientists did not know how to stimulate their release in production scale bioreactors. Other methods to promote cell growth are using drugs or relying on genetic engineering.

The complex production process for cell-based meat increases cost, limits the manufacturing scale and undermines the commercial viability of cell-based meat.

To help address this challenge, a multidisciplinary research team led by Associate Professor Alfredo Franco-Obregón, who is from the NUS Institute for Health Innovation & Technology and the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, came up with an unconventional method of using magnetic pulses to stimulate the growth of cell-based meat."
23,"A worm could be the answer to solving the problem of what to do about one of the commonest forms of plastic pollution.

Spanish researchers have found that chemicals in the saliva of the wax worm can break down polyethylene, a particularly hard-wearing material.

Their research found that exposing the plastic to the creature's saliva caused it to degrade as much in a single hour as several years worth of normal exposure to the elements.

Wax worms, the larvae of the wax moth, usually feed on the tough wax bees use to make honeycombs and are actually considered pests by beekeepers.

The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, discovered that two enzymes in the worm's saliva - which it uses to break down the wax - also break down the plastic.

For plastic to degrade, oxygen needs to penetrate the plastic's molecules, known as polymers, a process known as oxidation.

The research found that the enzymes in the saliva caused this process to occur in a matter of hours without any need to pre-treat the plastic by exposing it to heat or radiation.

Polyethylene is the most widely used plastic in the world and responsible for vast amounts of pollution.

First created in 1933, it is inexpensive, hard wearing and doesn't interact with food, making it widely used.

Enzymes have been produced synthetically

However, this breakthrough could be set to change that with molecular biologist Federica Bertocchini of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), who led the study, saying it was ""changing the paradigm of plastic biodegradation"".

She went on to explain that they had not only found out which enzymes break down the plastic, but had also managed to produce them synthetically, avoiding the need to use billions of wax worms to do the job.

Doing it that way would have several practical drawbacks and would also generate a large amount of carbon dioxide as the worms metabolise the polyethylene.

Plastic use has skyrocketed over the past 30 years, with hundreds of millions of tons ending up as waste every year, and less than 10% of that being recycled.

24,"A multi-disciplinary team at UNSW has found a way to convert nerve impulses into light, opening the way for more scalable neural implants.

Optrodes have the potential to make future prosthetics as functional as the limb they replace. Image: Shutterstock

Biomedical and electrical engineers at UNSW Sydney have developed a new way to measure neural activity using light – rather than electricity – which could lead to a complete reimagining of medical technologies like nerve-operated prosthetics and brain-machine interfaces.

Professor François Ladouceur, with UNSW’s School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, says the multi-disciplinary team has just demonstrated in the lab what it proved theoretically shortly before the pandemic: that sensors built using liquid crystal and integrated optics technologies – dubbed ‘optrodes’ – can register nerve impulses in a living animal body.

Not only do these optrodes perform just as well as conventional electrodes – that use electricity to detect a nerve impulse – but they also address “very thorny issues that competing technologies cannot address”, says Prof. Ladouceur.

“Firstly, it’s very difficult to shrink the size of the interface using conventional electrodes so that thousands of them can connect to thousands of nerves within a very small area.

“One of the problems as you shrink thousands of electrodes and put them ever closer together to connect to the biological tissues is that their individual resistance increases, which degrades the signal-to-noise ratio so we have a problem reading the signal. We call this ‘impedance mismatch’.

“Another problem is what we call ‘crosstalk’ – when you shrink these electrodes and bring them closer together, they start to talk to, or affect each other because of their proximity.”

“The real advantage of our approach is that we can make this connection very dense in the optical domain and we don’t pay the price that you have to pay in the electrical domain,” Prof. Ladouceur says.

In research published recently in the Journal of Neural Engineering, Prof. Ladouceur and fellow researchers at UNSW wanted to show that they could use optrodes to accurately measure the neural impulses as they travel along a nerve fibre in a living animal.

Scientia Professor Nigel Lovell, who heads the Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering and is Director of the Tyree Foundation Institute of Health Engineering, was part of the research team that sought to demonstrate this in the lab.

He says the team connected an optrode to the sciatic nerve of an anaesthetised animal. The nerve was then stimulated with a small current and the neural signals were recorded with the optrode. Then they did the same using a conventional electrode and a bioamplifier.

“We demonstrated that the nerve responses were essentially the same,” says Prof. Lovell. “There’s still more noise in the optical one, but that’s not surprising given this is brand new technology, and we can work on that. But ultimately, we could identify the same characteristics by measuring electrically or optically.”

New dawn for prosthetics

So far the team has been able to show that nerve impulses – which are relatively weak and measured in microvolts – can be registered by optrode technology. The next step will be to scale up the number of optrodes to be able to handle complex networks of nervous and excitable tissue.

Prof. Ladouceur says at the beginning of the project, his colleagues asked themselves, how many neural connections does a man or woman need to operate a hand with a degree of finesse?

“That you can pick up an object, that you can judge the friction, you can apply just the right pressure to hold it, you can move from A to B with precision, you can go fast and slow – all these things that we don’t even think about when we perform these actions. The answer is not so obvious, we had to search quite a bit in the literature, but we believe it’s about 5000 to 10,000 connections.”

In other words, between your brain and your hand there is a bundle of nerves that travels down from your cortex and eventually divides into those 5000 to 10,000 nerves that control the delicate operations of your hand.

If a chip with thousands of optical connections could connect to your brain, or some place in the arm before the nerve bundle separates, a prosthetic hand could potentially be able to function with much the same ability as a biological one.

That’s the dream, anyway, and Prof. Ladouceur says there are likely decades of further research before it’s a reality. This would include developing the ability for optrodes to be bidirectional. Not only would they receive and interpret signals from the brain on the way to the body, they could receive feedback in the form of neural impulses going back to the brain.

The long game: brain-machine interface

Neural prosthetics isn’t the only space that optrode technology has the potential to redefine. Humans have long fantasised about integrating technology and machinery into the human body to either repair or enhance it.

Some of this is now a reality, such as Cochlear implants, pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, not to mention smart watches and other tracking devices giving continual biofeedback.

But one of the more ambitious goals in biomedical engineering and neuroscience is the brain-machine interface that aims to connect the brain to not only the rest of the body, but potentially the world.

“The area of neural interfacing is an incredibly exciting field and will be the subject of intense research and development over the next decade,” says Prof. Lovell.

While this is more fiction than fact right now, there are many biotech companies taking this very seriously. Entrepreneur Elon Musk was one of the co-founders of Neuralink that aims to create brain-computer interfaces with the potential to help people with paralysis as well as incorporating artificial intelligence into our brain activities.

The Neuralink approach uses conventional wire electrodes in its devices so it must overcome impedance mismatch and crosstalk – among many other challenges – if they are to develop devices that host thousands, if not millions, of connections between the brain and the implanted device. Recently Mr Musk was reported as being frustrated at the slow pace in developing the technology.

Prof. Ladouceur says time will tell whether Neuralink and its competitors succeed in removing these obstacles. However, given that implantable, in vivo devices that capture neural activity are currently constrained to about 100 or so electrodes, there is still a long way to go.

“I'm not saying that it's impossible, but it becomes really problematic if you were to stick to standard electrodes,” Prof. Ladouceur says.

“We don't have these problems in the optical domain. In our devices, if there is neural activity, its presence influences the orientation of the liquid crystal which we can detect and quantify by shining light on it. It means we don't extract current from the biological tissues as the wire electrodes do. And so the biosensing can be done much more efficiently.”

Now that the researchers have shown that the optrode method works in vivo, they will shortly publish research that shows the optrode technology is bidirectional – that it can not only read neural signals, but can write them too."
25,"A group of scientists with the University of Chicago have discovered a way to create a material that can be made like a plastic, but conducts electricity more like a metal. Above, members of the Anderson lab at work. Credit: John Zich/University of Chicago

Scientists with the University of Chicago have discovered a way to create a material that can be made like a plastic, but conducts electricity more like a metal.

The research, published Oct. 26 in Nature, shows how to make a kind of material in which the molecular fragments are jumbled and disordered, but can still conduct electricity extremely well.

This goes against all of the rules we know about for conductivity—to a scientist, it's kind of like seeing a car driving on water and still going 70 mph. But the finding could also be extraordinarily useful; if you want to invent something revolutionary, the process often first starts with discovering a completely new material.

""In principle, this opens up the design of a whole new class of materials that conduct electricity, are easy to shape, and are very robust in everyday conditions,"" said John Anderson, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and the senior author on the study. ""Essentially, it suggests new possibilities for an extremely important technological group of materials,"" said Jiaze Xie (Ph.D. '22, now at Princeton), the first author on the paper.

'There isn't a solid theory to explain this'

Conductive materials are absolutely essential if you're making any kind of electronic device, whether it be an iPhone, a solar panel, or a television. By far the oldest and largest group of conductors is the metals: copper, gold, aluminum. Then, about 50 years ago, scientists were able to create conductors made out of organic materials, using a chemical treatment known as ""doping,"" which sprinkles in different atoms or electrons through the material.

This is advantageous because these materials are more flexible and easier to process than traditional metals, but the trouble is they aren't very stable; they can lose their conductivity if exposed to moisture or if the temperature gets too high.

But fundamentally, both of these organic and traditional metallic conductors share a common characteristic. They are made up of straight, closely packed rows of atoms or molecules. This means that electrons can easily flow through the material, much like cars on a highway. In fact, scientists thought a material had to have these straight, orderly rows in order to conduct electricity efficiently.

Then Xie began experimenting with some materials discovered years ago, but largely ignored. He strung nickel atoms like pearls into a string of of molecular beads made of carbon and sulfur, and began testing.

To the scientists' astonishment, the material easily and strongly conducted electricity. What's more, it was very stable. ""We heated it, chilled it, exposed it to air and humidity, and even dripped acid and base on it, and nothing happened,"" said Xie. That is enormously helpful for a device that has to function in the real world.

But to the scientists, the most striking thing was that the molecular structure of the material was disordered. ""From a fundamental picture, that should not be able to be a metal,"" said Anderson. ""There isn't a solid theory to explain this.""

Xie, Anderson, and their lab worked with other scientists around the university to try to understand how the material can conduct electricity. After tests, simulations, and theoretical work, they think that the material forms layers, like sheets in a lasagna. Even if the sheets rotate sideways, no longer forming a neat lasagna stack, electrons can still move horizontally or vertically—as long as the pieces touch.

The end result is unprecedented for a conductive material. ""It's almost like conductive Play-Doh—you can smush it into place and it conducts electricity,"" Anderson said.

The scientists are excited because the discovery suggests a fundamentally new design principle for electronics technology. Conductors are so important that virtually any new development opens up new lines for technology, they explained.

One of the material's attractive characteristics is new options for processing. For example, metals usually have to be melted in order to be made into the right shape for a chip or device, which limits what you can make with them, since other components of the device have to be able to withstand the heat needed to process these materials.

The new material has no such restriction because it can be made at room temperatures. It can also be used where the need for a device or pieces of the device to withstand heat, acid or alkalinity, or humidity has previously limited engineers' options to develop new technology.

The team is also exploring the different forms and functions the material might make. ""We think we can make it 2D or 3D, make it porous, or even introduce other functions by adding different linkers or nodes,"" said Xie.

China’s total annual solar cell and module production capacity may increase from 361 GW at the end of last year to up to 600 GW at the end of 2022, according to the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA).

“Since January, 20 companies disclosed to expand module production totaling 380 GW, planned to be executed within the next few months or up to 1,5 years,” the analyst firm said, noting that most of this capacity relates to n-type modules produced with tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells or panels based on cells with a heterojunction (HJT) design. “Reportedly, TOPCon related expansion plans exceed 220 GW, whereas HJT is nearing the 150 GW mark. As an example, recently one HJT company conducted an online pitching and according to them almost 800 people joined that call,” it added.

So far this year, the output of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules has already beaten the achievements of the Chinese PV industry in 2021 by some 50%. “By June, module shipments of the TOP 10 manufacturer crossed the 100 GW and by the end of September may have reached 140-150 GW (2021: 133 GW),” said the AECEA. “Just five of these top 10 have set shipment targets of between 183-205 GW.”

Furthermore, the AECEA revealed that the country’s polysilicon capacity should grow from around 530,000 MT at the end of 2021 to up to 1.2 million MT in 2022, jumping to 2.5 million MT in 2023, and up to 4 million MT in 2024.

“In the near term, the overall industrial landscape won’t fundamentally change. Incumbent companies are further consolidating their market positions through backward/forward integration,” the AECEA stated. “By and large, vertical integration remains their favored business model, which in times of external supply constraints or external supply dependencies has gained ever more weight.”"
27,"A compound that both inhibits the MRSA superbug and renders it more vulnerable to antibiotics in lab experiments has been discovered by researchers at the University of Bath in the UK.

Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to human health around the world, and Staphylococcus aureus has become one of the most notorious multidrug-resistant pathogens. Led by Dr. Maisem Laabei and Dr. Ian Blagbrough at the University of Bath, scientists have discovered a compound that both inhibits the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) superbug and renders it more vulnerable to antibiotics.

Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a type of bacteria found on people’s skin. Staph bacteria are usually harmless, but they can cause serious infections that can lead to sepsis or death. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a cause of staph infection that is difficult to treat because of resistance to some antibiotics.

The novel compound – a polyamine – seems to destroy S. aureus, the bacterium that causes (among other things) deadly MRSA infections, by disrupting the pathogen’s cell membrane.

The compound was tested in-vitro against 10 different antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus. Some of the strains tested are known to be resistant to vancomycin – the final drug of choice given to patients fighting an MRSA infection. The new compound was completely successful against all strains, resulting in no further bacterial growth.

As well as destroying S. aureus directly, the study demonstrates that the compound is able to restore the sensitivity of multidrug resistant strains of the bacteria to three important antibiotics (daptomycin, oxacillin, and vancomycin). This could mean that antibiotics that have lost their effectiveness through decades of overuse may, in time, reclaim their capacity to bring serious infections under control.

“We’re not entirely sure why these synergies occur between the compound and antibiotics, but we’re keen to explore this further,” said Dr. Laabei, researcher from the Department of Live Sciences at Bath.

The pathogen’s vulnerability

Polyamines are naturally occurring compounds found in most living organisms that interact with negatively charged molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. Until a decade ago, they were thought to be essential to all life, but scientists now know they are both absent in, and toxic to, S. aureus. Since making this discovery, scientists have been attempting to exploit the pathogen’s unusual vulnerability to polyamines to inhibit bacterial growth.

Now Dr. Laabei and his colleagues have found that a modified polyamine (named AHA-1394) is far more effective at destroying antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus than even the most active natural polyamine.

Explaining, Dr. Laabei said: “Using our novel compound, the pathogen is destroyed – meaning growth is inhibited – when it’s used at a concentration that’s over 128 times lower than that required to destroy the pathogen when we use a natural polyamine.

“This is important, as drugs that have the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration are likely to be more effective antimicrobial agents, and to be safer to the patient.”

Though further research is needed, Dr. Laabei believes the new compound “could have important implications in a clinical setting as a new treatment option.”

He said: “Preliminary research suggests the compound is non-toxic to humans, which of course is essential. In our next study, for which we’re seeking funding, we hope to focus on the precise mechanisms used by the compound to inhibit S. aureus. We believe the compound attacks the membrane of S. aureus, resulting in the membrane becoming permeable, resulting in bacterial death.”

The compound was also tested against biofilm – the thin, hard-to-treat layer of microorganisms that grows on hard surfaces (seen, for instance, as plaque on teeth or a stubborn film on urinary catheters) and can result in serious infection. The results were promising here too, with the compound preventing the formation of new biofilm, though not disrupting established biofilm.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistance (or antimicrobial resistance – AMR) poses a major threat to human health around the world, and S. aureus has become one of the most notorious multidrug-resistant pathogens.

A recent study looking back at the health effects of AMR in 2019 finds the pathogen was associated with one-million deaths worldwide, as a result of infections not responding to antibiotics.

S. aureus is found in 30% of the population, living in people’s nasal passages and on the skin, and mostly it does not cause infection. Until quite recently, an MRSA infection was regarded as a hospital problem, and those affected were mostly people with an already compromised immune system. Over the past 20 years, however, for complex and only partially understood reasons, there has been an upswing in community-wide infections even among otherwise healthy individuals, bringing a sense of urgency to the quest to find fresh ways to tackle the problem.

“New treatments are urgently needed to treat infections,” said Dr. Laabei.

28,"Through the Quantum Looking Glass

By helping scientists control a strange but useful phenomenon of quantum mechanics, an ultrathin invention could make future computing, sensing, and encryption technologies remarkably smaller and more powerful. The device is described in new research that was recently published in the journal Science.

This device could replace a roomful of equipment to link photons in a bizarre quantum effect called entanglement, according to scientists at Sandia National Laboratories and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light. It is a kind of nano-engineered material called a metasurface and paves the way for entangling photons in complex ways that have not been possible with compact technologies.

When photons are said to be entangled, it means they are linked in such a way that actions on one affect the other, no matter where or how far apart the photons are in the universe. It is a spooky effect of quantum mechanics, the laws of physics that govern particles and other very tiny things.

Although the phenomenon might seem bizarre, researchers have harnessed it to process information in new ways. For example, entanglement helps protect delicate quantum information and correct errors in quantum computing, a field that may someday have sweeping impacts on science, finance, and national security. Entanglement is also enabling advanced new encryption methods for secure communication.

Research for the groundbreaking device, which is a hundred times thinner than a sheet of paper, was conducted, in part, at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, a Department of Energy Office of Science user facility operated by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories. Sandia’s team received funding from the Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences program.

Light goes in, entangled photons come out

The new metasurface acts as a portal to this unusual quantum phenomenon. In some ways, it’s like the mirror in Lewis Carroll’s “Through the Looking-Glass,” through which the young protagonist Alice experiences a strange, new world.

Instead of walking through their new device, scientists shine a laser through it. The beam of light passes through an ultrathin sample of glass covered in nanoscale structures made of a common semiconductor material called gallium arsenide.

“It scrambles all the optical fields,” said Sandia senior scientist Igal Brener. He is an expert in a field called nonlinear optics and led the Sandia team. Occasionally, he said, a pair of entangled photons at different wavelengths emerge from the sample in the same direction as the incoming laser beam.

Brener said he is enthusiastic about this device because it is designed to produce complex webs of entangled photons. Instead of just one pair at a time, it can produce several pairs all entangled together, and some that can be indistinguishable from each other. Some technologies require these complex varieties of so-called multi-entanglement for sophisticated information processing schemes.

Although other miniature technologies based on silicon photonics can also entangle photons, they lack the much-needed level of complex, multi-entanglement. Until now, the only way to produce such results was with multiple tables full of lasers, specialized crystals, and other optical equipment.

“It is quite complicated and kind of intractable when this multi-entanglement needs more than two or three pairs,” Brener said. “These nonlinear metasurfaces essentially achieve this task in one sample when before it would have required incredibly complex optical setups.”

The Science paper outlines how the team successfully tuned their metasurface to produce entangled photons with varying wavelengths. This was a critical precursor to generating several pairs of intricately entangled photons simultaneously.

However, the scientists note in their paper that the efficiency of their device — the rate at which they can generate groups of entangled photons — is lower than that of other techniques and will need to be improved.

What is a metasurface?

A metasurface is a synthetic material that interacts with light and other electromagnetic waves in ways conventional materials can’t. Brener said that commercial industries are busy developing metasurfaces because they take up less space and can do more with light than, for instance, a traditional lens.

“You now can replace lenses and thick optical elements with metasurfaces,” Brener said. “Those types of metasurfaces will revolutionize consumer products.”

Sandia is one of the leading institutions in the world performing research in metasurfaces and metamaterials. Between its Microsystems Engineering, Science and Applications complex, which manufactures compound semiconductors, and the nearby Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, scientists have access to all the specialized tools they need to design, fabricate, and analyze these ambitious new materials.

“The work was challenging as it required precise nanofabrication technology to obtain the sharp, narrowband optical resonances that seed the quantum process of the work,” said Sylvain Gennaro, a former postdoctoral researcher at Sandia who worked on several aspects of the project.

The device was designed, fabricated, and tested through a partnership between Sandia and a research group led by physicist Maria Chekhova. She is an expert in the quantum entanglement of photons at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light.

“Metasurfaces are leading to a paradigm shift in quantum optics, combining ultrasmall sources of quantum light with far-reaching possibilities for quantum state engineering,” said Tomás Santiago-Cruz. He is a member of the Max Plank team and first author on the paper.

Brener, who has studied metamaterials for more than a decade, said this newest research could possibly spark a second revolution — one that sees these materials developed not just as a new kind of lens, but as a technology for quantum information processing and other new applications.

“There was one wave with metasurfaces that is already well established and on its way. Maybe there is a second wave of innovative applications coming,” he said.

29,"Error correction in a silicon qubit system was demonstrated by the researchers.

By demonstrating error correction in a three-qubit silicon-based quantum computing device, researchers from RIKEN in Japan have made a significant advancement toward large-scale quantum computing. This research, which was published in Nature, could help make practical quantum computers a reality.

Quantum computers are a prominent field of study right now because they promise to solve important problems that are unsolvable with conventional computers. Instead of employing the straightforward 1 or 0 binary bits inherent in traditional computers, they use superimposition states of quantum physics. They are, however, very sensitive to ambient noise and other difficulties, such as decoherence, due to their fundamentally different design and need error correction to do precise calculations.

The selection of systems that can serve as the best “qubits,” or basic units needed to do quantum calculations, is a significant challenge today. Each prospective system has advantages and disadvantages of its own. Today’s popular systems include superconducting circuits and ions, which have the benefit of having some type of error correction demonstrated, enabling them to be used in real-world applications, although on a limited scale.

Silicon-based quantum technology, which has just recently started to be developed, is known to offer an advantage in that it uses a semiconductor nanostructure comparable to what is frequently used to integrate billions of transistors on a compact chip, and hence potentially benefits from existing manufacturing technology.

However, one major problem with silicon-based technology is that there is a lack of technology for error connection. Researchers have previously demonstrated control of two qubits, but that is not enough for error correction, which requires a three-qubit system.

In the current research, conducted by researchers at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science and the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing, the group achieved this feat, demonstrating full control of a three-qubit system (one of the largest qubit systems in silicon), thus providing a prototype for the first time of quantum error correction in silicon. They achieved this by implementing a three-qubit Toffoli-type quantum gate.

According to Kenta Takeda, the first author of the paper, “The idea of implementing a quantum error-correcting code in quantum dots was proposed about a decade ago, so it is not an entirely new concept, but a series of improvements in materials, device fabrication, and measurement techniques allowed us to succeed in this endeavor. We are very happy to have achieved this.”

According to Seigo Tarucha, the leader of the research group, “Our next step will be to scale up the system. We think scaling up is the next step. For that, it would be nice to work with semiconductor industry groups capable of manufacturing silicon-based quantum devices on a large scale.

30,"Ninety percent of American adults don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables, opting for fast food and processed foods instead. Cost, flavor, and convenience are all factors in this imbalance, but as health statistics show, we should be working harder to reverse our dietary trends.

A startup called PairWise is out to help change the way we eat by making fruits and vegetables more appealing. The company is zeroing in on traits that may deter people from consuming produce and tweaking those traits using CRISPR gene editing. Their hope is that the resulting products will not only pique consumers’ interest, but keep them healthy and keep them coming back. Tom Adams, PairWise cofounder and CEO, shared details about the company and its products in an interview.

CRISPR’d Produce

CRISPR was first used to edit bacterial DNA in 2012. Since then, scientists have used the tool to edit the genomes of crops, animals, and even humans, and have begun testing it as a means of curing inherited conditions from blindness to muscular dystrophy and other genetic diseases.

CRISPR is made up of a synthesized sequence of guide RNA that matches a target DNA sequence—that is, the portion of DNA to be altered—and a Cas enzyme. Once in a cell’s nucleus, the guide RNA links up with the target DNA sequence. The Cas enzyme cuts the DNA at that point, and the cell repairs the cut. The repairs can either knock out a gene, inactivating it, or insert a new sequence.

Modifying a gene that encodes for a given trait either eliminates or alters that trait; in the case of fruits and vegetables, say, the bitterness of mustard greens or the seeds in blackberries. Given that the genomes of PairWise products are modified, some consumers may want to know whether the fruits and vegetables are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

The short answer is no. The USDA doesn’t regulate gene-edited plants as long as their traits could have occurred through traditional breeding methods or a whim of nature. The CRISPR technique PairWise uses involves manipulating genes that exist naturally in a given species’ genome. “The changes PairWise has made in our greens are no different than what can be achieved through conventional breeding, contain no foreign DNA, and therefore are not considered GMOs,” Adams said.

GMOs, on the other hand, can contain genes from other species, and wouldn’t come about naturally even after decades of traditional breeding. Bt crops, for example, are engineered to contain a natural form of pesticide derived from bacteria, which means they don’t need to be sprayed with chemical pesticides.

Adams pointed out that the anti-GMO sentiment out there isn’t necessarily about resistance to the technology itself. “There’s a lot of reasons GMOs may be less popular, and one of them is that people didn’t feel there was transparency,” he said. “Most of the products that fall under the category GMO are things that get added to foods as ingredients, and nobody knew when they were getting it and when they weren’t, and it created this stigma.”

He wants PairWise to take a more proactive and transparent approach. “We’re going to be very clear about the processes we’re using to create the products, and it’s your choice whether you like the benefits or you’re worried about the technology,” he said.

Next-Gen Produce

The first product PairWise will bring to market is a milder-tasting version of mustard greens. “Almost four years ago, we were searching for things we could do that were amenable to the technology but also were addressing a consumer need,” Adams said.

The company’s market research found that people often ended up buying romaine lettuce even after saying they’d prefer kale or another green because of their greater nutritional value. “People want healthy salads, but they keep buying romaine because they’re used to the flavor,” Adams said. Ease of preparation is a factor too.

Mustard greens, Adams told me, are a relative of kale, but they taste like horseradish when you bite into them. Two components come together that react and cause the horseradish flavor. PairWise used CRISPR-Cas12a to edit the green’s genome and remove one of those components. “It’s really just removing something that the plant doesn’t need for survival and doesn’t contribute to the nutritional benefits,” Adams said. The mustard greens have already been approved by the FDA and will start being sold in California and the Pacific Northwest in early 2023 under the brand Conscious Foods.

The company’s not stopping there, though; they have multiple fruit and veggie improvement projects underway.

One is a softer version of kale. If you’ve ever made a kale salad from the stuff that comes still on the stalk, you know it’s labor-intensive: there’s the washing, the de-stemming, the chopping, the massaging… (that’s right, massaging!). PairWise kale will retain all of the leafy green’s nutritional properties, but have a texture more like lettuce, making it easier to prepare and eat.

Another is seedless berries, including blackberries and raspberries. Hate how those tiny seeds get stuck in your teeth, always in the hardest-to-reach places? CRISPR to the rescue.

One of the company’s most intriguing projects, in my opinion, is pitless cherries.

“I love cherries, but they’re a pain to eat,” Adams said. “Your fingers are all red when you’re done with a few of them, and if there’s not a trash can nearby you don’t know what to do with the pit.” I asked him how it’s possible to grow a cherry—or any other stone fruit, like plums, peaches, or apricots—without the pit, as it connects to the fruit’s stem and is its lifeline to the tree.

“It’s easiest to think about it like a seedless grape,” he said. “It actually still has a seed in it, but the seed has lost its hard outer shell. There’s still that nutritious plant embryo that’s normally protected by the shell, we’re just making it so it’s all edible.” If they succeed, eating pitless cherries will be a different experience altogether; isn’t having to remove the pit the only thing keeping us from stuffing handfuls of the scrumptious fruit into our mouths at once?

A Whole New Plant

When it comes to cherries, it’s not just the end product PairWise is focusing on. Currently 90 percent of sweet cherries are grown in Washington state, where there’s little to no rain in the summer. The fruit is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and can only thrive in a dry climate; this specificity and the fact that the fruit needs to be shipped from the far northwest corner of the country pushes up its price. But what if cherries could grow in, say, Michigan, or Kansas, or Vermont?

“We think we understand the genetics well enough that we could modify the architecture of the tree so that it’s more like a blueberry bush,” Adams said. “And then you can grow them in more environments and put them at less risk.”

PairWise is also trying to alter the way blackberries grow. The moisture sensitivity has already been taken care of by nature, as has the bush-not-tree situation—but the bushes have thorns, and thorns make fruit hard to harvest. The company is working on cutting out the thorns.

Here’s an idea: blueberry-sized cherries without a pit that grow on bushes without thorns in any climate. Seems like a product that would need a whole new name, and heck if I have any suggestions. (Not to mention, it probably wouldn’t occur naturally no matter how many generations you waited.)

Getting Healthier

Be it softer kale, pitless cherries, or thornless bushes, PairWise’s mission is to create a healthier world by taking away barriers to eating fresh produce. “We’re interested in anything that moves the needle on the fact that only 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables,” Adams said. “It really doesn’t change very much just by telling people they should eat more of them. Our idea is, you need to take down the barriers.”

It’s certainly a noble aim. But how likely is engineered produce to play an instrumental role in changing consumers’ habits, or in attracting a previously-veggie-averse demographic? People who already buy and eat kale on a regular basis may opt for a smoother kale 2.0, but people who have never bought kale may not be so easily swayed by a newfangled version of the green.

Adams believes there’s a consumer base out there who will benefit from products like PairWise’s. “There are people who are looking for a healthy lifestyle,” he said. “And they’re looking for something different in salads. We’re coming in with a new category: a nutritious green that still tastes good.”

Physical traits of produce may be one barrier that deters people from buying them, but cost is equally important (if not more so). With years of research and development going into CRISPR’d produce, my assumption was that it won’t be affordable. Ten dollars for a bag of lettuce-like kale? No thanks.

Not the case, according to Adams. “There’s a fairly wide range of pricing within the salad space. We expect to be in the top quartile of the pricing, but we’re not going to be above it,” he said. Production of PairWise greens, he added, is actually quite cost-competitive with other types of salad greens.

Based on marketing activation events the company ran over the summer in Seattle, Austin, and Palo Alto, the outlook for their first product looks pretty rosy. They gave away bags of salad (which were clearly labeled as being gene-edited) consisting of red- and green-leaf mustard greens, and asked people to complete a short survey about it. Adams estimated that more than 6,000 people tried the salads, and over 90 percent responded that they were “very motivated” or “somewhat motivated” to buy the product.

A New Green Revolution?

Helping people make healthier dietary choices is just one benefit that CRISPR could bring to produce. Its possibilities are wide-ranging, as evidenced by PairWise’s work to create fruit trees that can grow in different climates and yield food that’s easier to harvest. It’s not unlike Norman Borlaug’s work back in the 1940s to create a high-yield wheat seed that was resistant to stem rust—a project that ended up saving millions of people from hunger and famine.

The difference is that technology has taken over the painstaking, time-consuming steps Borlaug had to slog through, like pollinating and inspecting thousands of plants by hand (a hundred and ten thousand in just one growing season! Talk about labor-intensive).

Adams sees PairWise’s work similarly and believes CRISPR holds all sorts of possibilities for a new frontier of engineered foods. “We’re doing the same thing as traditional plant breeders, but it’s just faster,” he said. “We could create a lot more resilience for the whole food system.”

Researchers at the University of California, Irvine and four national laboratories have devised a way to make lithium-ion battery cathodes without using cobalt, a mineral plagued by price volatility and geopolitical complications.

In a paper published today in Nature, the scientists describe how they overcame thermal and chemical-mechanical instabilities of cathodes composed substantially of nickel—a common substitute for cobalt—by mixing in several other metallic elements.

""Through a technique we refer to as 'high-entropy doping,' we were able to successfully fabricate a cobalt-free layered cathode with extremely high heat tolerance and stability over repeated charge and discharge cycles,"" said corresponding author Huolin Xin, UCI professor of physics & astronomy. ""This achievement resolves long-standing safety and stability concerns around high-nickel battery materials, paving the way for broad-based commercial applications.""

Cobalt is one of the most significant supply chain risks threatening widespread adoption of electric cars, trucks and other electronic devices requiring batteries, according to the paper's authors. The mineral, which is chemically suited for the purpose of stabilizing lithium-ion battery cathodes, is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of Congo under abusive and inhumane conditions.

""Electric vehicle manufacturers are eager to curtail the use of cobalt in their battery packs not only for cost reduction but to counter the child labor practices used to mine the mineral,"" Xin said. ""Research has also shown that cobalt can lead to oxygen release at high voltage, causing damage to lithium-ion batteries. All of this points to a need for alternatives.""

However, nickel-based cathodes come with their own problems, such as poor heat tolerance, which can lead to oxidization of battery materials, thermal runaway and even explosion. Although high-nickel cathodes accommodate larger capacities, volume strain from repeated expansion and contraction can result in poor stability and safety concerns.

The researchers sought to address these issues through compositionally complex high-entropy doping using HE-LMNO, an amalgamation of transition metals magnesium, titanium, manganese, molybdenum and niobium in the structure's interior, with a subset of these minerals used on its surface and interface with other battery materials.

Xin and his colleagues employed an array of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and 3D nanotomography instruments to determine that their zero-cobalt cathode exhibited an unprecedented volumetric change of zero during repeated use. The highly stable structure is capable of withstanding more than 1,000 cycles and high temperatures, which makes it comparable to cathodes with much lower nickel content.

For some of these research tools, Xin collaborated with researchers at the National Synchrotron Light Source II, located at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. As a DOE Office of Science user facility, NSLS-II offered the team access to three of its 28 scientific instruments—called beamlines—to study the internal structure of the new cathode.

""The combination of the different methods at NSLS II beamlines enabled the discovery of a trapping effect of oxygen vacancies and defects inside the material, which effectively prevents the crack formation in the HE-LMNO secondary particle, making this structure extremely stable during cycling,"" said co-author Mingyuan Ge, a scientist at NSLS-II.

Added Xin: ""Using these advanced tools, we were able to observe the dramatically increased thermal stability and zero-volumetric-change characteristics of the cathode, and we've been able to demonstrate extraordinarily improved capacity retention and cycle life. This research could set the stage for the development of an energy-dense alternative to existing batteries.""

He said the work represents a step toward achieving the dual goal of spurring the proliferation of clean transportation and energy storage while addressing environmental justice issues around the extraction of minerals used in batteries.

34,"NREL's communication-less microgrid method allows grid frequency to vary across a wider range than normal. Devices watch the frequency and adjust their power output according to the frequency's changes. Credit: NREL

During a power outage or after a disaster, it is hard to beat the simplicity of a diesel generator. Just supply fuel and start it up—so easy, anyone could do it. Renewable microgrids, on the other hand, are not so simple, with their suite of controls, software, and asset coordination. But the beauty of renewables is that fuel is free and already available on-site, even in remote disaster areas.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has now published a description of the improvised controls that saved NREL during its own outage, which could make microgrids easy and low cost where they are needed most.

The publication, titled ""Unleashing the Frequency: Multi-Megawatt Demonstration of 100% Renewable Power Systems with Decentralized Communication-less Control Scheme,"" describes a microgrid approach that sidesteps the central controller—an expensive and complicated component—and its reliance on communications, instead using native controls of battery, solar, and wind systems.

""NREL's approach makes it possible to assemble devices into a microgrid without arduous configuration, relying on just renewable energy and amateur electrical experience—perfect for recoveries in a pinch,"" said Przemyslaw Koralewicz, NREL engineer and co-developer of the communication-less method.

A low-cost recovery resource

When NREL experienced a surprise power outage, the laboratory had few options for recovery: No microgrid controller and no preconfigured setup. Just a large battery, solar panels, and wind turbines. Other campuses—or districts, neighborhoods, and homes—could find themselves in similar circumstances, and during an outage is no time to be fumbling with complicated configurations. Like NREL, communities can now implement a resilient microgrid off the cuff, using controls that exist on essentially any energy resource.

While microgrids are an apparent answer for recovery and resilience, the costs of a controller present a barrier to communities. In 2019, NREL found that microgrid controllers have a mean cost of $155,000/megawatt, potentially putting resilient microgrids out of reach for vulnerable areas.

Besides costs, controllers introduce a tangle of communications and system settings, often opaque, proprietary, and designed to suit particular scenarios. These features can be useful for minimizing energy use and costs, but recoveries often call for a quick-and-ready option. NREL's method prioritizes fail-safe startup, foregoing elaborate programs and communications in favor of exceedingly basic controls, while still allowing more advanced designs to be built on top.

How does it work?

NREL's scheme is decentralized—the devices do not exchange data or issue commands (i.e., they are ""communication-less""). Instead, devices self-regulate using system frequency as the common language. In short, a battery or other power source forms the grid by supplying power at a set frequency. Other generators like solar panels and wind turbines follow the grid by watching frequency and changing their power accordingly.

The method is nothing too new—so-called ""droop"" controls are familiar in standard fossil fuel generators—which is part of the appeal. The NREL researchers showed that the method works with 100% renewable energy, can be scaled, and is feasible with most any energy device.

What is innovative is that NREL's method frees the grid frequency from a tight 60 hertz (Hz). Unbound by mechanical rotation, the microgrid frequency can take a wider range. In fact, that range is precisely how the devices coordinate without communicating: As frequency rises past 60 Hz, generators reduce power. At even higher frequencies, the generators reduce their power further, rebalancing the frequency around 60 Hz. The system self-stabilizes, never overcharging the batteries or underserving the loads.

If this sounds more difficult than a diesel generator, it might be. It still requires some device programming and parameter setting, which are detailed in the report.

""NREL's method is the very first step in a design that could become the standard for fail-safe microgrids,"" Koralewicz said. ""Our communication-less method could be natively configured in future devices or possibly certified for easy access by operators. With standardized adoption, microgrids of any type—military bases, hospital backups, even networked districts—could count on an unfailing foundation to their day-to-day operations.""

The frontier of renewable energy systems

At the frontier of power systems, engineers are addressing the technical matters of operating the grid with mostly renewables. Outstanding questions relate to inverters, which are the power electronic devices that interface renewable energy to the grid, and particularly, how inverters can form the grid in ways that fossil-based resources traditionally have. The UNIFI consortium is taking on the inverter challenge with the combined effort of dozens of research institutions, led by NREL.

NREL's communication-less method is one example of a grid-forming strategy, the sort that will be needed as systems push toward higher levels of renewables. In proposing the method, NREL is breaking ground into some of the trickier topics that confront UNIFI and power systems everywhere, such as how to handle grid protection and which controls should be essential on grid-forming devices. The authors approach these questions in the report, offering one direction that future energy systems can take on the path to decarbonization."

As climate change intensifies summer heat, demand is growing for technologies to cool buildings. Now, researchers report in ACS Energy Letters that they have used advanced computing technology and artificial intelligence to design a transparent window coating that could lower the temperature inside buildings, without expending a single watt of energy.

Studies have estimated that cooling accounts for about 15% of global energy consumption. That demand could be lowered with a window coating that could block the sun's ultraviolet and near-infrared light—the parts of the solar spectrum that typically pass through glass to heat an enclosed room. Energy use could be reduced even further if the coating radiates heat from the window's surface at a wavelength that passes through the atmosphere into outer space. However, it's difficult to design materials that can meet these criteria simultaneously and can also transmit visible light, meaning they don't interfere with the view. Eungkyu Lee, Tengfei Luo and colleagues set out to design a ""transparent radiative cooler"" (TRC) that could do just that.

The team constructed computer models of TRCs consisting of alternating thin layers of common materials like silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide or titanium dioxide on a glass base, topped with a film of polydimethylsiloxane. They optimized the type, order and combination of layers using an iterative approach guided by machine learning and quantum computing, which stores data using subatomic particles. This computing method carries out optimization faster and better than conventional computers because it can efficiently test all possible combinations in a fraction of a second. This produced a coating design that, when fabricated, beat the performance of conventionally designed TRCs in addition to one of the best commercial heat-reduction glasses on the market.

In hot, dry cities, the researchers say, the optimized TRC could potentially reduce cooling energy consumption by 31% compared with conventional windows. They note their findings could be applied to other applications, since TRCs could also be used on car and truck windows. In addition, the group's quantum computing-enabled optimization technique could be used to design other types of composite materials.

Noctua presents NA-TPG1 thermal paste guard for AMD AM5

Vienna, October 6th 2022 – Noctua today announced its new NA-TPG1 thermal paste guard for AMD’s latest AM5 based Ryzen processors. When the mounting pressure of the cooling solution is applied, excess thermal paste will be squeezed outwards. With AM5 CPUs, this excess paste tends to accumulate in the cut-outs at the sides of the heat-spreader and may become difficult to remove. Simple and risk-free to apply, the NA-TPG1 prevents this undesired phenomenon.

“While there’s no denying that AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 processors perform fantastic, we found that the cut-outs at the side of the heat-spreader tend to attract thermal paste that can be challenging to clean off” says Roland Mossig (Noctua CEO). “This is where our new thermal paste guard steps in: it’s a simple yet highly effective tool for keeping your new Ryzen 7000 series CPU nice and clean.”

Made from highly heat-resistant polycarbonate and forming a tight seal around the edges of the CPU’s heat-spreader , the NA-TPG1 is simple and risk free to apply and remove. Despite its simplicity, it is highly efficient at preventing thermal paste from accumulating in the cut-outs at the sides of AM5 CPUs.

The NA-TPG1 will be available in a separate set with ten NA-CW1 cleaning wipes (NA-STPG1) as well as with new AM5 editions of Noctua’s award-winning NT-H1 and NT-H2 thermal pastes. All three products are scheduled to become available in December.

The manufacturer’s suggested retail price will be EUR/USD 7.90 for the NA-STPG1, EUR/USD 9.90 for the NT-H1 3.5g AM5 Edition and EUR/USD 13.90 for the NT-H2 3.5g AM5 Edition.

37,"CNN —

The first time molecular biologist Doris Taylor saw heart stem cells beat in unison in a petri dish, she was spellbound.

“It actually changed my life,” said Taylor, who directed regenerative medicine research at Texas Heart Institute in Houston until 2020. “I said to myself, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s life.’ I wanted to figure out the how and why, and re-create that to save lives.”

That goal has become reality. On Wednesday at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN, Taylor showed the audience the scaffolding of a pig’s heart infused with human stem cells – creating a viable, beating human heart the body will not reject. Why? Because it’s made from that person’s own tissues.

“Now we can truly imagine building a personalized human heart, taking heart transplants from an emergency procedure where you’re so sick, to a planned procedure,” Taylor told the audience.

“That reduces your risk by eliminating the need for (antirejection) drugs, by using your own cells to build that heart it reduces the cost … and you aren’t in the hospital as often so it improves your quality of life,” she said.

Debuting on stage with her was BAB, a robot Taylor painstakingly taught to inject stem cells into the chambers of ghost hearts inside a sterile environment. As the audience at Life Itself watched BAB functioning in a sterile environment, Taylor showed videos of the pearly white mass called a “ghost heart” begin to pinken.

Video Ad Feedback Can we grow a personalized human heart? 24:16 - Source: CNN

“It’s the first shot at truly curing the number one killer of men, women and children worldwide – heart disease. And then I want to make it available to everyone,” said Taylor to audience applause.

“She never gave up,” said Michael Golway, lead inventor of BAB and president and CEO of Advanced Solutions, which designs and creates platforms for building human tissues.

“At any point, Dr. Taylor could have easily said ‘I’m done, this just isn’t going to work. But she persisted for years, fighting setbacks to find the right type of cells in the right quantities and right conditions to enable those cells to be happy and grow.”

Giving birth to a heart

Taylor’s fascination with growing hearts began in 1998, when she was part of a team at Duke University that injected cells into a rabbit’s failed heart, creating new heart muscle. As trials began in humans, however, the process was hit or miss.

“We were putting cells into damaged or scarred regions of the heart and hoping that would overcome the existing damage,” she told CNN. “I started thinking: What if we could get rid of that bad environment and rebuild the house?”

Taylor’s first success came in 2008 when she and a team at the University of Minnesota washed the cells out of a rat’s heart and began to work with the translucent skeleton left behind.

Soon, she graduated to using pig’s hearts, due to their anatomical similarity to human hearts.

“We took a pig’s heart, and we washed out all the cells with a gentle baby shampoo,” she said. “What was left was an extracellular matrix, a transparent framework we called the ‘ghost heart.’

“Then we infused blood vessel cells and let them grow on the matrix for a couple of weeks,” Taylor said. “That built a way to feed the cells we were going to add because we’d reestablished the blood vessels to the heart.”

The next step was to begin injecting the immature stem cells into the different regions of the scaffold, “and then we had to teach the cells how to grow up.”

“We must electrically stimulate them, like a pacemaker, but very gently at first, until they get stronger and stronger. First, cells in one spot will twitch, then cells in another spot twitch, but they aren’t together,” Taylor said. “Over time they start connecting to each other in the matrix and by about a month, they start beating together as a heart. And let me tell you, it’s a ‘wow’ moment!”

This ""ghost heart,"" created by using the scaffolding of a pig's heart and injected it with human stem cells, may soon be ready for human clinical trials. Advanced Solutions Life Sciences

But that’s not the end of the “mothering” Taylor and her team had to do. Now she must nurture the emerging heart by giving it a blood pressure and teaching it to pump.

“We fill the heart chambers with artificial blood and let the heart cells squeeze against it. But we must help them with electrical pumps, or they will die,” she explained.

The cells are also fed oxygen from artificial lungs. In the early days all of these steps had to be monitored and coordinated by hand 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Taylor said.

“The heart has to eat every day, and until we built the pieces that made it possible to electronically monitor the hearts someone had to do it person – and it didn’t matter if it was Christmas or New Year’s Day or your birthday,” she said. “It’s taken extraordinary groups of people who have worked with me over the years to make this happen.”

But once Taylor and her team saw the results of their parenting, any sacrifices they made became insignificant, “because then the beauty happens, the magic,” she said.

“We’ve injected the same type of cells everywhere in the heart, so they all started off alike,” Taylor said. “But now when we look in the left ventricle, we find left ventricle heart cells. If we look in the atrium, they look like atrial heart cells, and if we look in the right ventricle, they are right ventricle heart cells,” she said.

“So over time they’ve developed based on where they find themselves and grown up to work together and become a heart. Nature is amazing, isn’t she?”

Billions and billions of stem cells

As her creation came to life, Taylor began to dream about a day when her prototypical hearts could be mass produced for the thousands of people on transplant lists, many of whom die while waiting. But how do you scale a heart?

“I realized that for every gram of heart tissue we built, we needed a billion heart cells,” Taylor said. “That meant for an adult-sized human heart we would need up to 400 billion individual cells. Now, most labs work with a million or so cells, and heart cells don’t divide, which left us with the dilemma: Where will these cells come from?”

The answer arrived when Japanese biomedical researcher Dr. Shinya Yamanaka discovered human adult skin cells could be reprogrammed to behave like embryonic or “pluripotent” stem cells, capable of developing into any cell in the body. The 2007 discovery won the scientist a Nobel Prize, and his “induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS),” soon became known as “Yamanaka factors.”

“Now for the first time we could take blood, bone marrow or skin from a person and grow cells from that individual that could turn into heart cells,” Taylor said. “But the scale was still huge: We needed tens of billions of cells. It took us another 10 years to develop the techniques to do that.”

The solution? A bee-like honeycomb of fiber, with thousands of microscopic holes where the cells could attach and be nourished.

“The fiber soaks up the nutrients just like a coffee filter, the cells have access to food all around them and that lets them grow in much larger numbers. We can go from about 50 million cells to a billion cells in a week,” Taylor said. “But we need 40 billion or 50 billion or 100 billion, so part of our science over the last few years has been scaling up the number of cells we can grow.”

Another issue: Each heart needed a pristine environment free of contaminants for each step of the process. Every time an intervention had to be done, she and her team ran the risk of opening the heart up to infection – and death.

“Do you know how long it takes to inject 350 billion cells by hand?” Taylor asked the Life Itself audience. “What if you touch something? You just contaminated the whole heart.”

Once her lab suffered an electrical malfunction and all of the hearts died. Taylor and her team were nearly inconsolable.

“When something happens to one of these hearts, it’s devastating to all of us,” Taylor said. “And this is going to sound weird coming from a scientist, but I had to learn to bolster my own heart emotionally, mentally, spiritually and physically to get through this process.”

Enter BAB, short for BioAssemblyBot, and an “uber-sterile” cradle created by Advance Solutions that could hold the heart and transport it between each step of the process while preserving a germ-free environment. Taylor has now taught BAB the specific process of injecting the cells she has painstakingly developed over the last decade.

“When Dr. Taylor is injecting cells, it has taken her years to figure out where to inject, how much pressure to put on the syringe, and the best speed and pace to add the cells,” said BAB’s creator Golway.

“A robot can do that quickly and precisely. And as we know, no two hearts are the same, so BAB can use ultrasound to see inside the vascular pathway of that specific heart, where Dr. Taylor is working blind, so to speak,” Golway added. “It’s exhilarating to watch – there are times where the hair on the back of my neck literally stands up.”

Taylor left academia in 2020 and is currently working with private investors to bring her creation to the masses. If transplants into humans in upcoming clinical trials are successful, Taylor’s personalized hybrid hearts could be used to save thousands of lives around the world.

In the US alone, some 3,500 people were on the heart transplant waiting list in 2021.

“That’s not counting the people who never make it on the list, due to their age or heath,” Taylor said. “If you’re a small woman, if you’re an underrepresented minority, if you’re a child, the chances of getting an organ that matches your body are low.

If you do get a heart, many people get sick or otherwise lose their new heart within a decade. We can reduce cost, we can increase access, and we can decrease side effects. It’s a win-win-win.”

Taylor can even envision a day when people bank their own stem cells at a young age, taking them out of storage when needed to grow a heart – and one day even a lung, liver or kidney.

“Say they have heart disease in their family,” she said. “We can plan ahead: Grow their cells to the numbers we need and freeze them, then when they are diagnosed with heart failure pull a scaffold off the shelf and build the heart within two months.

“I’m just humbled and privileged to do this work, and proud of where we are,” she added. “The technology is ready. I hope everyone is going to be along with us for the ride because this is game-changing.”"

Buildings don’t collapse very often – but when they do, it’s catastrophic for those trapped inside. Natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes can level entire towns, and for the search and rescue teams trying to find survivors, it’s a painstaking task.

But an unlikely savior is being trained up to help out: rats.

The project, conceived of by Belgian non-profit APOPO, is kitting out rodents with tiny, high-tech backpacks to help first responders search for survivors among rubble in disaster zones.

“Rats are typically quite curious and like to explore – and that is key for search and rescue,” says Donna Kean, a behavioral research scientist and leader of the project.

In addition to their adventurous spirit, their small size and excellent sense of smell make rats perfect for locating things in tight spaces, says Kean.

The rats are currently being trained to find survivors in a simulated disaster zone. They must first locate the target person in an empty room, pull a switch on their vest that triggers a beeper, and then return to base, where they are rewarded with a treat.

While the rodents are still in the early stages of training, APOPO is collaborating with the Eindhoven University of Technology to develop a backpack, which is equipped with a video camera, two-way microphone, and location transmitter to help first responders communicate with survivors.

“Together with the backpack and the training, the rats are incredibly useful for search and rescue,” says Kean.

APOPO has been training dogs and rats at its base in Tanzania in the scent detection of landmines and tuberculosis for over a decade. Its programs use African Giant Pouched Rats, which have a longer lifespan in captivity of around eight years compared to the four years of the common brown rat.

While the search and rescue project only officially launched in April 2021, when Kean joined the team, APOPO had been trying to get the idea off the ground for years but lacked funding and a search and rescue partner to support it. But when volunteer search and rescue organization GEA approached APOPO in 2017 about the possibility of using rats in its missions, the team began exploring the idea.

A key component to the search and rescue mission was the technology to allow first responders to communicate with victims via the rats. APOPO didn’t have this – until electrical engineer Sander Verdiesen got involved.

Looking to “apply technology to improve lives” during his master’s studies at Eindhoven University of Technology, Verdiesen interned with APOPO in 2019 and was tasked with creating the first prototype of the rat backpack, to help rescuers get a better idea of what was going on inside disaster zones.

The prototype consisted of a 3D-printed plastic container with a video camera that sent live footage to a receiver module on a laptop, while also saving a high-quality version on an SD card. It attached to the rats with a neoprene vest, the same material that’s used for scuba suits.

Verdiesen flew to Tanzania to test out the equipment and says that initially, the rats “didn’t really know how to deal with it” but adapted quickly. “By the end, they were just running around with the backpack on, no problem at all,” he adds.

Big challenges for tiny tech

With the backpacks working “better than expected,” Verdiesen continued to refine the design even after his internship ended, as a volunteer.

But sizing down technology and adapting it for disaster zones hasn’t been easy.

GPS can’t penetrate the dense rubble and debris of collapsed buildings, says Verdeisen. An alternative is the Inertial Measurement Unit, a location tracker used in the heels of firefighters’ boots.

“If you’re walking, your foot is going to be still every step or so – that’s where you can recalibrate. With the rats, we’re yet to find that,” he says. Other engineers are working on similar projects, so he’s hopeful they can find a solution.

The backpack currently contains a video camera, but APOPO hopes to also include a location tracker and two-way microphone. APOPO

Verdeisen is also trying to pack more technology into the next version, such as a two-way microphone, while reducing its size. Weighing around 140 grams (4.9 ounces), the prototype was twice as heavy as originally intended – although Verdeisen says that bulkiness was more of an issue, at 10 centimeters long (3.9 inches) and 4 centimeters deep (1.6 inches).

“The rats were walking up against something that they would normally be able to go under, and suddenly they can’t anymore,” he explains.

To make it “as small as possible” without losing any functionality, Verdeisen plans to integrate everything onto a single printed circuit board, which will free up more space. This upgraded version of the backpack should be ready later this year, and he hopes one day it can help first responders “to locate somebody that would otherwise not be rescued.”

Rodents to the rescue

Meanwhile, in Tanzania, Kean is increasing the complexity of the rats’ training environment, “to make it more like what they might encounter in real life.” That includes adding industrial sounds like drilling to mimic real emergencies.

So far, the results are promising: from her observations, Kean says the rats are responding well to the increasingly difficult simulations: “They have to be super confident in any environment, under any conditions, and that’s something that these rats are naturally good at.”

Handled from birth, the rats are exposed to a variety of environments, sights, sounds, and people as part of a “habituation process,” which makes their gradual exposure to more extreme situations less stressful, according to Kean.

As animals are at the center of APOPO’s projects and missions, welfare is a priority. The animals are trained in 15-minute sessions five days a week, and live alone or with same-sex siblings in home cages, which is also where they live out their days once they retire from working life.

Eating a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, they also get daily playtime in a custom-built playroom – although, for the search and rescue rats, training is very similar, “just with a little bit of direction,” says Kean.

The program is still in development, but Kean estimates it will take at least nine to 12 months to train each rat.

For the next stage of training, Kean says the team will create “levels to mimic multiple floors of a collapsed building” and move closer to “real world scenarios.” Once the rats are confident in more complex environments, the project will move to Turkey, where GEA is based, for further preparation in more realistic environments. If that goes well, then the rats would potentially enter real-life situations.

For now, though, Kean and the team in Tanzania are focused on getting the rats through their first phase of training – and hopefully one day, into the field.

“Even if our rats find just one survivor at a debris site, I think we would be happy to know it’s made a difference somewhere,” says Kean."
39,"Blood glucose monitoring is touted to be the next big breakthrough for wearable devices like the Apple Watch. However, the hardware is yet to be seen on a commercially available, mass-market device. That might change soon.

A team from Georgia’s Kennesaw State University claims to have developed a noninvasive system of blood glucose level measurement, thanks to a device called GlucoCheck. It follows the same fundamental approach as the oxygen-level analysis sensor on smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 5.

Team lead Maria Valero, an assistant professor at the institution’s College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE), notes that the device delivers 90% accuracy in analyzing glucose concentration in blood samples. The biosensor works in tandem with a phone application, but the team is already at work on integrating Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant.

GlucoCheck shines light across the human skin, and then a camera captures the view from the other side. The goal is to study the varying level of light absorption by blood flowing in the vessels to determine the glucose concentration.

The team has already filed a patent for the tech and now aims to test it on more body types to diversify the test data. This step is of critical importance, because commercially available wearables like those made by Fitbit and even Apple are known to be inaccurate at reading data from people with dark or tattoed skin types.

The latest development is remarkable because it achieves the holy grail of glucose-level monitoring, which is to develop a noninvasive method that can be miniaturized and connected to devices such as phones. Currently, people with diabetes need to prick their fingers to obtain a blood sample to analyze their sugar levels.

Commercial players are also at it

This is not the first research of its kind. In July 2020, Samsung showcased a noninvasive method for blood glucose monitoring in partnership with experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The same year, Movano revealed a wearable device that can measure blood sugar levels using a light diffusion method. But it didn’t do much else.

A year later, a Japanese company named Quantum Operation showcased a wearable-mounted sensor at CES 2021 that was capable of noninvasive blood glucose analysis. According to multiple reports that have surfaced over the past couple of years, both Apple and Samsung are interested in the promising tech for their smartwatches.

U.K.-based Rockley Photonics is also working toward the same objective, but instead of LEDs, the company is focused more on laser-based analysis. Regarding the in-house tech, CEO Dr. Andrew Rickman told Digital Trends that it “collects incredibly rich data that we extract to measure, amongst other things, hydration, lactate, and blood pressure.”

Notably, Apple is said to be one of the biggest clients of Rockley Photonics and is rumored to include the noninvasive blood glucose monitoring tech on the Apple Watch portfolio in the near future.

The battery pack will be based on GM's Ultium platform, which it's using to power its own electric vehicles. Due to the type of battery cells it employs, Ultium is billed as a modular and scalable system that can be adapted to different needs, so it may just fit the bill for the military.

GM said the military wants a light- to heavy-duty EV for use in garrison and operational environments in order to reduce fossil fuel use. As a result, that should reduce the military's carbon emissions.

41,"Whales face numerous threats from humans, not the least of which are ship collisions — the World Sustainability Organization estimates 18,000 to 25,000 animals die each year. There may be a technological way to minimize those deaths, however. Reuters reports Chile's government and the MERI Foundation have deployed the first smart buoy from the Blue Boat Initiative, an effort to both safeguard whales and track undersea ecosystems. The device, floating in the Gulf of Corcovado 684 miles away from Chile, alerts ships to nearby blue, humpback, right and sei whales to help avoid incidents.

The technology uses oceanographic sensors and AI-powered Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment (LIDO) software to determine a waterborne mammal's type and location. It also checks the ocean's health by monitoring oxygen levels, temperature and other criteria. That extra data could help study climate change and its impact on sea life.

The Blue Boat Initiative currently aims to install six or more buoys to protect whales across the gulf. In the long term, though, project members hope to blanket the whales' complete migratory route between Antarctica and the equator. This could reduce collisions across the creatures' entire habitat, not to mention better inform government decisions about conservation and the environment.

The technology may be as important for humans as for the whales. On top of their roles in delicately balanced ecosystems, whales both help capture CO2 and redistribute heat through ocean currents. The more these animals are allowed to flourish, the better the ocean is at limiting global warming and its harmful effects."
42,"Despite being the wealthiest nation on the face of the planet, the United States chronically runs short of transplantable organs . Kidneys are far and away the most sought-after organ for transplantation , followed by livers. While the liver is the only human organ known capable of regenerating itself, if you damage yours badly enough for long enough — as some 30 million Americans have — then the only treatment is a transplant. Assuming you can even acquire one for doctors to stick in you. Every year demand for replacement livers outstrips supply by a scope of tens of thousands.

“Only one-third of those on the liver transplant waiting list will be transplanted, and the demand for livers is projected to increase 23 percent in the next 20 years,” a multidisciplinary team of researchers observed in 2016’s Liver-Regenerative Transplantation: Regrow and Reset . “Exacerbating the organ shortage problem, the donor pool is expected to shrink further because of the obesity epidemic. Liver steatosis [aka fatty liver disease ] is increasingly common in donors and is a significant risk factor in liver transplantation.”

To address this critical shortage, the study authors note that doctors have explored a variety of cutting-edge regimens, from cell repopulation and tissue engineering, nanoparticles to genomics, mechanical aids to porcine-derived xenotransplantation, all with varying degrees of success. Cellular repopulation has been used for years, a process that injects healthy liver cells into the patient’s damaged organ through a portal vein where they adhere themselves to the existing cellular scaffolding and grow into new, functional liver tissue.

“Creating an immediately available and inexhaustible supply of functioning liver cells from autologous tissue would allow early intervention in patients with hepatic failure and would allow liver cells to be infused over a longer period of time,” the 2016 study’s authors note. “Combined with recent advances in genome-editing technology, such liver cells could be used widely to treat devastating liver-based inborn errors of metabolism and to eliminate the need for a life-long regimen of immunosuppressive drugs and their complications.” The downside to this technique is the pace at which the donor cells proliferate, making it a poor tool against acute liver failure.

Extracellular Vesicle-based therapies, on the other hand, leverage the body’s intracellular communications pathways to deliver drugs with, “high bioavailability, exceptional biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity,” according to 2020’s Extracellular Vesicle-Based Therapeutics: Preclinical and Clinical Investigations . “They provide a means for intercellular communication and the transmission of bioactive compounds to targeted tissues, cells, and organs” including “fibroblasts, neuronal cells, macrophages, and even cancer cells.”

EVs are the postal letters that cells send one another. They come in a variety of sizes from 30 to 1000 nm and have exterior membranes studded with multiple adhesive proteins that grant them entry into any number of different types of cells. Exploiting the biological equivalent to a janitor’s key ring, researchers have begun tucking therapeutic nanoparticles into EVs and using them to discreetly inject treatments into the targeted cells. However, these treatments are still in the experimental stages and are most effective against acute liver failure and inborn metabolic diseases rather than end-stage liver failure.

Mayo Clinic

Mechanical aids, the hepatocytic equivalent to a dialysis machine, like the Mayo Spheroid Reservoir Bioartificial Liver (SRBAL, above) are ideal for treating cases of acute liver failure, able to take over the entirety of the patient’s liver function externally and immediately. However, such procedures are both expensive and temporary. The SRBAL can only support a patient for up to two weeks, making it more suitable for keeping someone alive until a donor can be located rather than as a permanent, pacemaker-like solution.

The bioprinting and implantation of replacement livers has also shown promise, though they too are still in early development and largely not near ready for widespread adoption. Interspecies transplantation using genetically-engineered pig organs are a bit closer to clinical use , with surgeons successfully transplanting a porcine heart into a human patient for the first time this past January (though he died of complications two months later). Pig kidneys and livers have similarly been transplanted into human recipients, often with less drastic side effects than death.

No matter where the transplanted organ comes from, getting it into the patient is invariably going to involve a significant surgical procedure. However, the Lygenesis company recently unveiled its non-invasive solution: tricking the patient’s body into growing a series of miniature, ectopic liver “organoids” in its own lymphatic system like a crop of blood-scrubbing potatoes.

For those of you who dozed through high school bio, a quick recap of terms. The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system that serves to circulate some 20 liters of lymph throughout your body, absorb excess interstitial fluids back into the bloodstream, and incubate critical lymphocytes like T-cells . Organoids, on the other hand, are biological masses artificially grown from stem cells that perform the same functions as natural organs , but do so ectopically, in that they function in a different part of the body as a regular liver. Blood-scrubbing potatoes are self-explanatory.

“Fundamentally, Lygenesis uses the lymph node, your body's natural bio reactors typically used for T-cells,” company CEO and co-founder Michael Hufford, told Engadget. “We hijacked that same biology, we engraft our therapies into the lymph nodes to grow functioning ectopic organs.”

“We use an outpatient endoscopic ultrasound procedure where we're going down through the mouth of the patient using standard endoscopic equipment,” Hufford continued. “We engraft ourselves there in minutes under light sedation, so it's very low medical risk and also is really quite inexpensive.” He notes that the average cost for a proper, in-hospital liver transplant will set you back around a million dollars. Lygenesis’ outpatient procedure “is billed at a couple of thousand or so,” he said.

More importantly, the Lygenesis technique doesn’t require a full donated liver, or even a large fraction of one. In fact, each donated organ can be split among several dozen recipients. “Using our technology a single donated liver can reach 75 or more patients,” Hofford said. The process of converting a single donated liver into all those engraftable samples takes a team of three technicians more than six hours and 70 steps to complete. The process does not involve any gene manipulation, such as CRISPR editing.

This process is quite necessary as patients cannot donate culturable liver cells to themselves. “Once you have end-stage liver disease, you typically have a very fibrotic liver ,” Hofford noted. “It will bleed at the slightest sort of intervention.” Even the simple act of collecting cellular samples can quickly turn deadly if the wrong bit of organ is bisected.

And it’s not only the transplant recipients themselves who are unable to donate. Hofford estimates between 30 and 40 percent of donated livers are too worn to be successfully transplanted. “One of the benefits of our technology is we're using organs that have been donated but will otherwise be discarded,” he said.

Once engrafted into a lymph node, the liver organoid will grow and vascularize over the course of two to three months, until it is large enough to begin supporting the existing liver. Hufford points out that even with end-stage disease, a liver can retain up to 30 percent of its original functionality, so these organoids are designed to augment and support the existing organ rather than replace it outright.

Lygenesis is currently in Phase 2A of the FDA approval process , meaning that a small group of four patients have each received a single engraftment in a lymph node located in their central body cavity near the liver itself (the body has more than 500 lymph nodes and apparently this treatment can technically target any of them). Should this initial test prove successful subsequent study groups will receive increasing numbers of engraftment, up to a half dozen, to help the company and federal regulators figure out the optimal number of organoids to treat the disease."
43,"By subjecting a quantum computer’s qubits to quasi-rhythmic laser pulses based on the Fibonacci sequence, physicists demonstrated a way of storing quantum information that is less prone to errors

By shining a laser pulse sequence inspired by the Fibonacci numbers at atoms inside a quantum computer, physicists have created a remarkable, never-before-seen phase of matter. The phase has the benefits of two time dimensions despite there still being only one singular flow of time, the physicists report July 20 in Nature.

This mind-bending property offers a sought-after benefit: Information stored in the phase is far more protected against errors than with alternative setups currently used in quantum computers. As a result, the information can exist without getting garbled for much longer, an important milestone for making quantum computing viable, says study lead author Philipp Dumitrescu.

The approach’s use of an “extra” time dimension “is a completely different way of thinking about phases of matter,” says Dumitrescu, who worked on the project as a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Quantum Physics in New York City. “I’ve been working on these theory ideas for over five years, and seeing them come actually to be realized in experiments is exciting.”

Dumitrescu spearheaded the study’s theoretical component with Andrew Potter of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Romain Vasseur of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Ajesh Kumar of the University of Texas at Austin. The experiments were carried out on a quantum computer at Quantinuum in Broomfield, Colorado, by a team led by Brian Neyenhuis.

The workhorses of the team’s quantum computer are 10 atomic ions of an element called ytterbium. Each ion is individually held and controlled by electric fields produced by an ion trap, and can be manipulated or measured using laser pulses.

Each of those atomic ions serves as what scientists dub a quantum bit, or ‘qubit.’ Whereas traditional computers quantify information in bits (each representing a 0 or a 1), the qubits used by quantum computers leverage the strangeness of quantum mechanics to store even more information. Just as Schrödinger’s cat is both dead and alive in its box, a qubit can be a 0, a 1 or a mashup — or ‘superposition’ — of both. That extra information density and the way qubits interact with one another promise to allow quantum computers to tackle computational problems far beyond the reach of conventional computers.

There’s a big problem, though: Just as peeking in Schrödinger’s box seals the cat’s fate, so does interacting with a qubit. And that interaction doesn’t even have to be deliberate. “Even if you keep all the atoms under tight control, they can lose their quantumness by talking to their environment, heating up or interacting with things in ways you didn’t plan,” Dumitrescu says. “In practice, experimental devices have many sources of error that can degrade coherence after just a few laser pulses.”

The challenge, therefore, is to make qubits more robust. To do that, physicists can use ‘symmetries,’ essentially properties that hold up to change. (A snowflake, for instance, has rotational symmetry because it looks the same when rotated by 60 degrees.) One method is adding time symmetry by blasting the atoms with rhythmic laser pulses. This approach helps, but Dumitrescu and his collaborators wondered if they could go further. So instead of just one time symmetry, they aimed to add two by using ordered but non-repeating laser pulses.

The best way to understand their approach is by considering something else ordered yet non-repeating: ‘quasicrystals.’ A typical crystal has a regular, repeating structure, like the hexagons in a honeycomb. A quasicrystal still has order, but its patterns never repeat. (Penrose tiling is one example of this.) Even more mind-boggling is that quasicrystals are crystals from higher dimensions projected, or squished down, into lower dimensions. Those higher dimensions can even be beyond physical space’s three dimensions: A 2-D Penrose tiling, for instance, is a projected slice of a 5-D lattice.

For the qubits, Dumitrescu, Vasseur and Potter proposed in 2018 the creation of a quasicrystal in time rather than space. Whereas a periodic laser pulse would alternate (A, B, A, B, A, B, etc.), the researchers created a quasi-periodic laser-pulse regimen based on the Fibonacci sequence. In such a sequence, each part of the sequence is the sum of the two previous parts (A, AB, ABA, ABAAB, ABAABABA, etc.). This arrangement, just like a quasicrystal, is ordered without repeating. And, akin to a quasicrystal, it’s a 2D pattern squashed into a single dimension. That dimensional flattening theoretically results in two time symmetries instead of just one: The system essentially gets a bonus symmetry from a nonexistent extra time dimension.

Actual quantum computers are incredibly complex experimental systems, though, so whether the benefits promised by the theory would endure in real-world qubits remained unproven.

Using Quantinuum’s quantum computer, the experientialists put the theory to the test. They pulsed laser light at the computer’s qubits both periodically and using the sequence based on the Fibonacci numbers. The focus was on the qubits at either end of the 10-atom lineup; that’s where the researchers expected to see the new phase of matter experiencing two time symmetries at once. In the periodic test, the edge qubits stayed quantum for around 1.5 seconds — already an impressive length given that the qubits were interacting strongly with one another. With the quasi-periodic pattern, the qubits stayed quantum for the entire length of the experiment, about 5.5 seconds. That’s because the extra time symmetry provided more protection, Dumitrescu says.

“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” he says. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.”

Though the findings demonstrate that the new phase of matter can act as long-term quantum information storage, the researchers still need to functionally integrate the phase with the computational side of quantum computing. “We have this direct, tantalizing application, but we need to find a way to hook it into the calculations,” Dumitrescu says. “That’s an open problem we’re working on.”

44,"Renewable energy met all of Greece’s electricity needs for the first time ever last week, the country’s independent power transmission operator IPTO announced.

For at least five hours on Friday, renewables accounted for 100 per cent of Greece’s power generation, reaching a record high of 3,106 megawatt hours.

Solar, wind and hydro represented 46 per cent of the nation’s power mix in the eight months to August this year, up from 42 per cent in the same period in 2021, according to Greece-based environmental think-tank The Green Tank.

Green Tank called it, a ""record of optimism for the country's transition to clean energy, weaning off fossil fuels and ensuring our energy sufficiency.”

""European countries like Greece are rapidly accelerating away from fossil fuels and towards cheap renewable electricity. The milestone reached by Greece proves that a renewables-dominated electricity grid is within sight,” Elisabeth Cremona, an analyst at energy think tank Ember, told Euronews Green.

“This also clearly demonstrates that the electricity system can be powered by renewables without compromising reliability. But there remains more to do to ensure that renewables overtake fossil fuels in Greece's power sector across the whole year.""

What’s the big picture for Greece’s energy transition?

It’s a significant milestone in the history of the country's electricity system, and follows the bright news that renewables fully met the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of 2022.

But Greece’s transition to clean energy hasn’t been entirely straightforward.

Like other European countries, Greece has cut its reliance on Russian gas following the war in Ukraine by increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to meet its needs. It has also boosted coal mining, pushing back its decarbonisation plan.

Using IPTO data, The Green Tank finds that renewables - excluding large hydro sources - surpassed all other energy sources, leaving fossil gas in second place as it decreased slightly for the first time since 2018.

Greece aims to more than double its green energy capacity to account for at least 70 per cent of its energy mix by 2030. To help hit that target, the government is seeking to attract around €30 billion in European funds and private investments to upgrade its electricity grid.

It plans to have 25 gigawatt of installed renewable energy capacity from about 10 gigawatt now but analysts say Athens might reach that target sooner.

IPTO has been investing in expanding the country's power grid to boost power capacity and facilitate the penetration of solar, wind and hydro energy."

Drone deliveries have finally become a reality in parts of the United States, and for some users, they arrive in less than 15 minutes.

Several drone delivery services including Amazon, Alphabet-owned Wing and Israeli start-up Flytrex have started operating in the country after receiving a green light from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Wing says it delivers by drone in about 10 minutes and that its services can help reduce road congestion.

""It's more environmentally friendly. These are all electric drones that use very little power,"" said Jacob Demmitt, Wing's marketing and communication manager in the US.

""It's also significantly cheaper. You can have a pilot sitting in downtown Dallas, watching flights all over the entire metro (area) someday"".

Tiffany Bokhari lives in Frisco, Texas. She first tested Wing's drone delivery app out of curiosity, and she did it again when she needed a band-aid.

It's now the third time a drone brings her the light goods she ordered from her smartphone – in this case, snacks and that cold soda.

""I think it's better to be delivered by drone versus car because it's helpful for the environment, you know. It saves gas, and money, and saves the environment,"" she said.

For now, Wing’s 4.5 kg drone can load food and small products weighing up to 1 kg.

Supporters of airborne drop-offs claim that electric drones are more efficient and safer than conventional deliveries done by fossil fuel-powered cars.

Better than opiates: Researchers at FAU use adrenaline receptors for highly-effective analgesics

New substances that activate adrenalin receptors instead of opioid receptors have a similar pain relieving effect to opiates, but without the negative aspects such as respiratory depression and addiction. This is the result of research carried out by an international team of researchers led by the Chair of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at FAU. Their findings, which have now been published in the renowned scientific journal Science, are a milestone in the development of non-opioid pain relief.

Opiates cause addiction, new substances do not

They are a blessing for patients suffering from severe pain, but they also have serious side effects: Opioids, and above all morphine, can cause nausea, dizziness and constipation and can also often cause slowed breathing that can even result in respiratory failure. In addition, opiates are addictive – a high percentage of the drug problem in the USA is caused by pain medication, for example.

In order to tackle the unwanted medical and social effects of opioids, researchers all over the world are searching for alternative analgesics. Prof. Dr. Peter Gmeiner, Chair of Pharmaceutical Chemistry is one of these researchers. “We are focusing particularly on the molecular structures of the receptors that dock onto the pharmaceutical substances”, says Gmeiner. “It is only when we understand these on the atomic level that we can develop effective and safe active substances.” Collaborating with an international team of researchers, Prof. Gmeiner discovered an active substance in 2016 that bonds to known opioid receptors and that offers the same level of pain relief as morphine, even though it has no chemical similarity to opiates.

New approach: Adrenaline receptors instead of opioid receptors

Peter Gmeiner is currently following a lead that seems very promising: “Many non-opioid receptors are involved in pain processing, but only a small number of these alternatives have as yet been validated for use in therapies”, he explains. Gmeiner and a team of researchers from Erlangen, China, Canada and the USA have now turned their attention to a new receptor that is responsible for binding adrenaline – the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor. There are already some analgesics that target this receptor such as brimonidine, clonidine and dexmedetomidine. Gmeiner: “Dexmedetomidine relieves pain, but has a strong sedative effect, which means its use is restricted to intensive care in hospital settings and is not suitable for broader patient groups.”

The aim of the research consortium is to find a chemical compound that activates the receptor in the central nervous system without a sedative effect. In a virtual library of more than 300 million different and easily accessible molecules, the researchers looked for compounds that physically match the receptor but are not chemically related to known medication. After a series of complex virtual docking simulations, around 50 molecules were selected for synthesis and testing and two of these fulfilled the desired criteria. They had good bonding characteristics, activated only certain protein sub-types and thus a very selective set of cellular signal pathways, whereas dexmedetomidine responds to a significantly wider range of proteins.

Pain relief without sedation in animal models

By further optimizing the identified molecules, for which extremely high-resolution cryo-electron microscopic imaging was used, the researchers were able to synthesize agonists that produced high concentrations in the brain and reduced the sensation of pain effectively in investigations with animal models. “Various tests confirmed that docking on the receptor was responsible for the analgesic effect,” explains Gmeiner. “We are particularly pleased about the fact that none of the new compounds caused sedation, even at considerably higher doses than those that would be required for pain relief.”

The successful separation of analgesic properties and sedation is a milestone in the development of non-opioid pain medication, especially as the newly-identified agonists are comparatively easy to manufacture and administer orally to patients. However, Prof. Gmeiner has to dampen any hopes of rapid widespread use in human medicine: “We are currently still talking about basic research. The development of medication is subject to strict controls and in addition to significant amounts of funding, it takes a long time. However, these results still make us very optimistic.”

47,"A malaria vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford continues to impress, with a booster dose demonstrating up to 80% efficacy in children in a trial with over a year of follow-up.

The challenge: Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes. While it’s already eradicated in many parts of the world, it’s still a major threat in Africa, killing more than 600,000 people every year.

About half of all malaria deaths are children under the age of five, and even if a child survives their first malaria infection, they’re often reinfected. This repeated battle can take a toll on their immune systems and leave them vulnerable to other illnesses.

The only approved malaria vaccine is a shot made by British drugmaker GSK, and it’s only 40% effective. GSK is also only committed to supplying 15 million doses annually, but 25 million children are born in Africa alone every year, and each needs multiple doses.

About half of all malaria deaths are children under the age of five.

Oxford’s vaccine: In 2019, 450 children between the ages of 5 months and 17 months participated in a phase 2b trial of Oxford’s malaria vaccine (R21/Matrix-M) in the African nation of Burkina Faso.

The children were split into three groups. Two groups received a three-shot regimen of Oxford’s malaria vaccine, combined with either a high or low dose of an immunity-boosting adjuvant. The third group received a rabies vaccine as a control.

Oxford reported that the vaccine with the high dose of the adjuvant was up to 77% effective at preventing clinical malaria over 12 months of follow-up — making it the first malaria vaccine to reach the World Health Organization’s goal of 75% efficacy.

What’s new? In June 2020, 409 of the participants in Oxford’s trial were given booster shots of the same type of vaccine they received initially (i.e., if their primary vaccination was with the high dose of the adjuvant, so was their booster shot).

Oxford has now reported that the booster with the high adjuvant dose was 80% effective over 12 months of follow-up, while the lower dose was 70% effective, meaning the initial three-shot regimen plus a booster results in at least two years of robust protection.

“Without this investment, we risk losing the gains that have been made over the last decades.” Azra Ghani

Looking ahead: Results from a phase 3 trial involving 4,800 children — ranging in age from 5 months to 36 months and living in four African nations — are expected in another few months. Those will be key to getting Oxford’s malaria vaccine approved by regulators.

If the shot is approved, the Serum Institute of India, one of the world’s biggest vaccine makers, is ready to manufacture 200 million doses annually starting in 2023, and study co-author Adrian Hill told BBC News the vaccine should cost just “a few dollars” to produce.

The bottom line: Oxford’s malaria vaccine could be huge in the fight against this deadly disease — but only if health officials are able to secure the funding needed to get the shots into arms.

“Without this investment, we risk losing the gains that have been made over the last decades and witnessing a rising tide of malaria resurgence,” Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, who isn’t involved in Oxford’s vaccine, told BBC News.

48,"Pharma giant Merck has paid Moderna $250 million to co-develop and commercialize a promising personalized cancer vaccine based on its mRNA technology.

The background: In 2016, pharma giant Merck gave Moderna $200 million to research and develop personalized cancer vaccines based on mRNA. At the time, it was a big bet — mRNA technology had yet to be translated into any approved vaccine.

Part of the original agreement specified that if Moderna could complete proof-of-concept studies of mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccines in humans, Merck had the option to pay an undisclosed amount to co-develop and commercialize the shots with Moderna.

Since then, mRNA has proven itself with the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and many other vaccines are in development. And now, based on that success, they’re moving ahead with cancer vaccines, too.

Most vaccines are mass produced, but Moderna’s cancer vaccine is personalized for each patient.

What’s new? Merck is now exercising its option on mRNA-4157, a personalized cancer vaccine in a phase 2 clinical trial for skin cancer. It’s being studied in combination with Merck’s cancer treatment Keytruda, a humanized monoclonal antibody.

“This long-term collaboration combining Merck’s expertise in immuno-oncology with Moderna’s pioneering mRNA technology has yielded a novel tailored vaccine approach,” said Eliav Barr, head of global clinical development and CMO of Merck Research Laboratories.

A personalized cancer vaccine: Moderna’s cancer vaccine works differently than most vaccines because it’s designed to treat an existing disease rather than prevent it entirely. It’s also personalized for each patient, while other shots are typically mass produced and distributed to the population.

To create each vaccine, Moderna takes a sample of a patient’s tumor. It then uses genetic sequencing technology to identify proteins in the tissue called “neoantigens.” These proteins are found only on the surface of cancer cells, and they are unique to each person’s tumor.

Moderna then uses its mRNA technology to create a vaccine that instructs cells to make up to 34 of the cancer’s specific neoantigens, which are shown off to immune cells as potential targets. The idea is that this will trigger an immune response against the neoantigens, helping the immune system identify and attack cancerous cells.

Given Merck’s new investment in the vaccine, it seems reasonable to expect positive trial results.

Looking ahead: For Moderna’s ongoing phase 2 trial of mRNA-4157, 157 patients with high-risk melanoma had their tumors removed via surgery.

Some of the patients were then given nine doses of a personalized cancer vaccine and a dose of Keytruda every three weeks for approximately one year or until their melanoma came back. The rest were given just a dose of Keytruda every three weeks for one year.

The trial’s primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and given Merck’s new investment in the vaccine, it seems reasonable to expect positive results.

“With data expected this quarter on [personalized cancer vaccine], we continue to be excited about the future and the impact mRNA can have as a new treatment paradigm in the management of cancer,” said Moderna President Stephen Hoge.

MOSES LAKE, Wash. — After years of on-the-ground development, Eviation’s all-electric Alice airplane quietly took to the air here this morning for its first test flight.

Test pilot Steve Crane guided the nine-passenger aircraft, powered by two 640-kilowatt electric motors, through its takeoff from Grant County International Airport in Moses Lake, a facility in Eastern Washington’s high desert that’s often used for testing innovations in aviation.

When the motors revved up, they sounded like electric grass trimmers. And when the plane flew overhead, the noise was more like a hum than a roar.

Alice flew for eight minutes and reached a maximum altitude of 3,500 feet before landing safely back at the airport.

So how was the ride? “It was wonderful,” Crane said. “It handled just like we thought it would. Very responsive, very quick to the throttle, and it came on in for a wonderful landing. I couldn’t be happier.”

Crane explained that the relatively short flight was intended to be the first in a series of “baby steps” for the test program. “Today was just about the initial envelope,” he told reporters. “For future tests, we’ll expand that envelope.”

Arlington, Wash.-based Eviation is on a growing list of ventures that are aiming to make aviation more efficient and less expensive by taking advantage of advances in electric propulsion and battery technology.

“What we have just done is made aviation history,” Gregory Davis, Eviation’s president and CEO, said after the flight. “This is about changing the way that we fly. It’s about connecting communities in a sustainable way, and we are obviously beaming with pride on this beautiful sunny day here at Moses Lake.”

The Alice aircraft — whose name was inspired by the book “Alice in Wonderland” and the Jefferson Airplane song “White Rabbit” — will come in different variants for commuter, cargo and executive flights. Davis said the initial goal is to build a plane with a maximum range of 200 to 300 nautical miles. According to Eviation’s stats, Alice’s maximum useful load would be 2,500 to 2,600 pounds, and its maximum operating speed would be 260 knots (300 mph).

Davis acknowledged that the design specifications and capabilities of the production version of the plane may be something of a moving target, due to Eviation’s dependence on improvements in battery technology. “It’s going to be carbon fiber, it’s going to be fly-by-wire, it’s going to be electric — so in that respect, it’s the same plane,” Davis said. “As far as the actual design of the aircraft, I think everything’s going to be evolved.”

Eviation’s majority owner is the Clermont Group, a privately held conglomerate based in Singapore.

The plane’s electric propulsion system is provided by MagniX, a Clermont corporate cousin that has its headquarters in Everett, Wash. Eviation’s partner in the flight test program is AeroTEC, which operates the Moses Lake Flight Test Center. For what it’s worth, MagniX and AeroTEC have been working together since 2020 to conduct flight tests for a Cessna Grand Caravan airplane that was converted to use MagniX’s electric motors.

Alice’s inaugural flight test came more than three years after the first prototype was unveiled at the Paris Air Show. Since then, Eviation has moved its base of operations from Israel to Arlington, and has gone through a complicated executive transition that brought Davis in as CEO.

The company has been putting its flight-ready prototype through more than a year of assembly and ground testing — with some setbacks along the way.

If all goes according to plan, the airplane will win certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and hit the market by 2027 — which is later than the 2024 time frame that Eviation was listing a year ago.

“What we’ve learned is a lot, and one of the key things that’s driving the development of our program is the advancement of battery technology, right?” Davis told GeekWire. “So we’re being, I will say, entirely honest with ourselves about what we’re going to be able to achieve. … It’s all going to be based on getting the batteries to converge to the development cycle for the aircraft.”

Three years ago, Eviation said the list price for an Alice airplane would be $4 million — but today Davis declined to provide an updated price tag. “I wouldn’t rely on anything that was mentioned a few years ago,” he said.

In any case, the list price for an airplane doesn’t always reflect what customers pay. Actual pricing is typically decided privately on a deal-by-deal basis, and several deals have already been announced. DHL Express ordered 12 Alice eCargo planes last year, and Massachusetts-based Cape Air ordered 75 all-electric passenger planes in April. This month, the GlobalX charter airline said it intended to order 50 passenger planes, with deliveries due to begin in 2027.

Nasa has invented a new type of high-performance battery that researchers claim could be used to power fully electric airplanes.

The US space agency made the breakthrough following investigations into solid-state batteries, which hold more energy and are lighter than industry-standard lithium-ion batteries.

Solid-state batteries also perform better in stressful environments, as they are less prone to overheating, fire and loss of charge over time, however they typically cannot discharge energy at the same rate as li-ion batteries.

Until now, this has made them unsuitable for powering large electronics, such as electric vehicles, as they require batteries capable of discharging their energy an incredibly fast rate.

This issue was solved by researchers at Nasa’s Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety (SABERS) unit, who were able to increase the battery’s discharge rate by a factor of 10 using innovative new materials that have yet to be used in batteries.

A novel vertical-stack design also allowed SABERS researchers to create a solid-state battery capable of powering objects at a capacity of 500 watt-hours per kilogram – roughly double that of an electric car.

“The possibilities are pretty incredible,” said Rocco Viggiano, principal investigator for SABERS at Nasa’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.

“We’re starting to approach this new frontier of battery research that could do so much more than lithium-ion batteries can... Not only does this design eliminate 30 to 40 per cent of the battery’s weight, it also allows us to double or even triple the energy it can store, far exceeding the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries that are considered to be state of the art.”

The new battery has already generated interest from government, industry and academia, with SABERS researchers partnering with several organisations to continue developing the technology.

The ultimate aim is to use it to pioneer a new era of sustainable aviation that eliminates carbon emissions and noise from planes.

Nasa has already made significant progress in this area through its experimental X-57 aircraft, nicknamed Maxwell, which replaces fuel-powered propellers with an all-electric propulsion system."

Scientists have achieved a new efficiency record for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), opening up new commercial possibilities for transparent solar panels.

A team from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland made the breakthrough using specially designed photosensitizer dye molecules that when combined are capable of harvesting light from across the entire visible light spectrum.

The transparent properties of DSCs make them suitable for use in windows, greenhouses and glass facades, the researchers said, as well as in the screens of portable electronic devices.

They are also flexible, relatively low-cost and can be made using conventional roll-printing techniques. Theoretically, the price/performance ratio is also good enough to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation.

The first commercial applications are already being realised, with dye-sensitized solar windows installed in the SwissTech Convention Center, however their capacity for generating electricity has so far been restricted by their lack of efficiency compared to traditional solar cells.

The latest development pushes the power conversion efficiency to between 28.4-30.2 per cent, while still maintaining long-term operational stability over 500 hours of testing.

“Our findings pave the way for facile access to high performance DSCs and offer promising prospects for applications as power supply and battery replacement for low-power electronic devices that use ambient light as their energy source,” wrote the authors of a study detailing the technology.

The study, titled ‘Hydroxamic acid preadsorption raises efficiency of cosensitized solar cells’, was published in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday."

Researchers have passed the 30 per cent efficiency barrier with silicon solar cells for the first time by combining them with the so-called “miracle material” perovskite.

A team from various universities and institutes in the Netherlands made the breakthrough with a tandem solar cell that compliments traditional silicon-based cells – which have an energy conversion efficiency of around 22 per cent – with the widely-acclaimed properties of perovskite.

The researchers said that achieving greater than 30 per cent efficiency with the four-terminal tandem device marked “a big step in accelerating the energy transition” and would improve energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependency.

“This type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93 per cent of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device,” said Dr Mehrdad Najafi from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).

“This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.”

Perovskite has been hailed for its potential to transform an array of industries, ranging from ultra-high-speed communications to renewable energy production.

The researchers behind the latest solar cell record now hope to commercialise the technology to achieve a widespread roll-out.

“Now we know the ingredients and are able to control the layers that are needed to reach over 30 per cent efficiency,” said Professor Gianluca Coletti, program manager of Tandem PV.

“Once combined with the scalability expertise and knowledge gathered in the past years to bring material and processes to a large area, we can focus with our industrial partners to bring this technology efficiencies beyond 30 per cent into mass production.”

The results were presented at the World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion (WCPEC-8) in Milan."
54,"In the spring of 1933 , three scientists at the U.K.’s Medical Research Council received a treasure trove of vials containing human mucus from sick hospital patients. It was gross, yes, but not unwarranted: The culprit behind what had caused the 1918 influenza pandemic was still at large.

Months later, the trio of scientists published a paper that found that a virus, not a novel strain of bacteria like some within the scientific community originally thought, was to blame. Over the following decades, other scientists unfurled the gnarly branches of the large influenza family tree, gathering enough information to formulate a vaccine, which (hopefully) most of us get before every flu season.

But here’s the catch: Influenza is a master shapeshifter. Every year, strains of the virus that infect humans — influenza type A and B — evolve in ways that evade vaccines and, subsequently, our immune systems. This results in uneven vaccine effectiveness from year to year and also undermines efforts to pack a flu shot with a broad, long-lasting immune punch.

But we may have an ace in the hole thanks to mRNA, the same technology used for our Covid-19 vaccines. In a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and other institutions have cooked up an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that targets four viral proteins that tend to remain the same across different strains of influenza.

“[It’s] a nice study with significant clinical implications that uses the same strategy as for Covid vaccination to create a better flu vaccine with broader capabilities by targeting multiple conserved flu [viral proteins] antigens instead of the way we do it now, which is to grow candidate strains in eggs and then inactivate them,” Anne Davidson, a researcher at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York, who was not involved in the study, told Inverse in an email.

Here’s the background — Flu vaccines are updated every year based on influenza patterns most recently seen in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia; its flu season runs from April to October.

Scientists pay close attention to one sugar-covered protein called hemagglutinin that dots the surface of the influenza virus, Norbert Pardi, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who co-led the study, tells Inverse.

“Hemagglutinin has two major parts: the head domain, which is variable and immunodominant, [and a stalk domain],” explains Pardi. “The current seasonal vaccines that use three or four inactivated [influenza] viruses primarily target the immunodominant head domain… but the problem is that the virus can change that pretty easily and escape from protective immunity.”

A better option would be to target viral proteins that don’t switch up and stay pretty much the same regardless of which strain of influenza you’re infected with, says Pardi and Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who also co-led the study.

Those proteins include neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein 2, all of which help the virus make copies of itself.

Krammer says while there have been efforts over the years to include conserved influenza proteins, such studies have run up against failure and a whole host of hurdles. For example, to measure a potential shot’s effectiveness, scientists look to see whether it triggers an immune response, indicated via the presence of antibodies.

“The vaccines that we’re testing these proteins with, they don’t induce those types of antibodies that are used as correlates,” explains Krammer. “So there’s not a lot of confidence during clinical development.”

Of the four different types of influenza, A and B primarily infect humans. Shutterstock

How they did it — What has really made the dream of a potent flu shot come alive, says Pardi and Krammer, is messenger RNA (or mRNA) technology, the same used for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccines. It involves taking a piece of genetic code that isn’t capable of altering anyone’s DNA and instructing it to make a particular type of protein that the immune system can then learn to recognize and target.

For their influenza vaccine, the researchers created an mRNA cocktail encoding the four influenza proteins neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 2, and the stalk portion of hemagglutinin (which is conserved compared to its head domain).

The vaccine was then injected into a group of twenty or so naive mice who had never experienced influenza before. They either got a quadrivalent jab (meaning all four mRNA segments for each protein was present) or monovalent (the conventional flu vaccine or vaccines containing an individual mRNA for any one of the proteins). Some animals received one shot, while others lucked out with one shot plus a booster four weeks later. The mice were then challenged with an assortment of different influenza strains, both that infect humans and other animals like dogs.

What they found — There were two important phenomena the researchers noticed. First, while both the quadrivalent and monovalent jabs encouraged antibody production, only the quadrivalent shot protected the mice against the viral challenge, with exception of the monovalent vaccine containing nucleoprotein, which seemed to protect vaxxed mice from death.

While antibodies tend to hog the vaccine limelight, immune cells called T cells, which roam the body and kill infected cells, are also crucial in the fight against viruses. Pardi, Krammer, and their colleagues found that the nucleoprotein-specific jab encouraged a class of cytotoxic T cells that studies have found play an important role in protection against severe influenza infection in humans and animal models.

On average around five to 20 percent of Americans will get the flu every year. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp drop in the number of flu cases reported. bluecinema/E+/Getty Images

Krammer says this motley of immune responses to the four different influenza viral proteins suggests it's more powerful to have a colorful vaccine cocktail rather than a drab monotone.

“When we mix all of them together, we get the broadest immune response,” he says. “You get the engagement of T cells against the nucleoprotein, you get antibodies, and we get a pretty strong neuraminidase response. That’s kind of the beauty here that you’re flexible in what types of [viral proteins] you use… and you have a lot of possibilities to try [out].”

The researchers also expect it wouldn’t need to undergo annual updates as our current ones do. Instead, they might last for a few years.

What’s next — While mice studies are the launch point for future studies into other organisms like monkeys and eventually humans, Pardi and Krammer say it’s not clear whether what we see in mice will necessarily translate to us. For one, humans don’t have a naive immune system like the mice used in the study. Our pre-existing immunity against the flu may impact the quality of any potential vaccine’s antibody response, according to some studies.

“Clinical trials will be necessary to see how vaccines can overcome the issue with the shortfall from previous immunity,” says Pardi. “Pretty much all adults have antibodies against the flu, and we need to see how our vaccine can overcome this issue.”

It may take several years of research and clinical trials before their mRNA influenza vaccine sees the light of day, say Pardi and Krammer. In the meanwhile, there’s no point waiting: Go get your flu shot, dear reader."
55,"Every year around 2 million people die worldwide from hemorrhaging or blood loss. Uncontrolled hemorrhaging accounts for more than 30% of trauma deaths. To stop the bleeding, doctors often apply pressure to the wound and seal the site with medical glue. But what happens when applying pressure is difficult or could make things worse? Or the surface of the wound is too bloody for glue? Drawing inspiration from nature, researchers from McGill University have developed a medical adhesive that could save lives, modeled after structures found in marine animals like mussels and flatworms.

“When applied to the bleeding site, the new adhesive uses suction to absorb blood, clear the surface for adhesion, and bond to the tissue providing a physical seal. The entire application process is quick and pressure-free, which is suitable for non-compressible hemorrhage situations, which are often life-threatening,” says lead author Guangyu Bao, a recently graduated PhD student under the supervision of Professor Jianyu Li of Department of Mechanical Engineering.

In putting the new technology to the test, the researchers found that the adhesive promotes blood coagulation. The adhesive can also be removed without causing re-bleeding or even left inside the body to be absorbed. “Our material showed much better-improved safety and bleeding control efficiency than other commercial products. Beyond bleeding control, our material could one day replace wound sutures or deliver drugs to provide therapeutic effects,” says senior author Professor Jianyu Li.

56,"The rapid maturation of wind and solar power has been nothing short of astonishing. Not long ago, the development of new solar and wind farms was typically driven by small regional players, and the cost was significantly higher than that of a coal plant. Today, the cost of renewables has plummeted, and many solar and wind projects are undertaken by large multinational companies, which often also announce staggering development targets.

Over the past decade, the growth of renewable energy has consistently and dramatically outperformed nearly all expectations (Exhibit 1). Upward corrections of estimates have become something of a ritual.

Exhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

But this growth story is just getting started. As countries aim to reach ambitious decarbonization targets, renewable energy—led by wind and solar—is poised to become the backbone of the world’s power supply. Along with capacity additions from major energy providers, new types of players are entering the market (Exhibit 2). Today’s fast followers include major oil and gas companies, which aim to shift their business models to profit from the increased demand for renewables and the electrification of vehicles, and private-equity players and institutional investors that make renewable energy a central component of their investment strategy. Leaders in the shipping industry are investing in renewables to enable the production of hydrogen and ammonia as zero-emission fuel sources; steel manufacturers are eyeing green hydrogen to decarbonize their steel production, with renewables providing the green electricity for the process. Car manufacturing companies are also striking renewable-energy deals to help power their operations and manufacturing, as well as making investments in wind and solar projects.

McKinsey estimates that by 2026, global renewable-electricity capacity will rise more than 80 percent from 2020 levels (to more than 5,022 gigawatts). Of this growth, two-thirds will come from wind and solar, an increase of 150 percent (3,404 gigawatts). By 2035, renewables will generate 60 percent of the world’s electricity. But even these projections might be too low. Three years ago, we looked at advances made by renewable energy and asked, “How much faster can they grow?” The answer is: faster than you think they can.

Three core capabilities for wind and solar developers

This race to build additional solar and wind capacity increases the pressure on developers to execute efficiently and heightens competition for finite resources. Still, the three winning capabilities we identified three years ago as important for building or expanding a renewables business are even more critical now. They form the bedrock required to tackle upcoming challenges:

Value-chain excellence. As competition intensifies and government support for renewables subsides, strong capabilities across the entire value chain are the required cost of admission. For instance, gaining access to scarce amounts of attractive land will require differentiation in project origination and development. As margins squeeze and operators’ exposure to risk increases, ambitious companies will want to explore new, profitable offtake markets for their electricity, such as data centers or hydrogen electrolyzers for industrial production.

Economies of scale and skill. Driven by the rapid scaling of the renewables industry, many players have built efficient operating models. However, finding employees with the necessary skills and capabilities, particularly in high-demand areas such as project development and engineering, is becoming a bottleneck for growth ambitions.

Agile operating model. Agility and speed will be key in finding innovative ways to integrate partners and in establishing robust, high-performing supply chains. They will also enable businesses to shift resources quickly to the biggest value pools and respond to changes in the landscape, such as shifting regulations or price volatility.

Four challenges that will define the new era of renewable energy

Leveraging these capabilities as a strong foundation, successful renewables developers must navigate an increasingly complex and competitive landscape. Specifically, they will have to focus on and address four emerging challenges:

A scarcity of top-quality land. Developers are in a constant scramble to identify new sites with increasing speed. Our analysis in Germany, a country aiming to nearly double its share of electricity coming from renewables by 2030, offers a glimpse into the constraints. Of the 51 percent of the country’s land that is potentially suitable for onshore wind farms, regulatory, environmental, and technical constraints eliminate all but 9 percent. Meeting capacity targets will mean adding wind turbines to 4 to 6 percent of the country, giving developers very little room for error.

Meeting capacity targets will mean adding wind turbines to 4 to 6 percent of the country, giving developers very little room for error. A blue-collar and white-collar labor shortage. Across economies, the “Great Attrition” is making it difficult for companies to find and keep employees. Since April 2021, 20 million to 25 million US workers have quit their jobs, and 40 percent of employees globally say they are at least somewhat likely to leave their current position in the next three to six months. This environment presents a particularly acute challenge for industries such as renewable energy, where specific technical expertise and experience are crucial elements of success. For instance, our analysis suggests that between now and 2030, the global renewables industry will need an additional 1.1 million blue-collar workers to develop and construct wind and solar plants, and another 1.7 million to operate and maintain them. This includes construction laborers, electricians, truck and semitrailer drivers, and operating engineers.

This includes construction laborers, electricians, truck and semitrailer drivers, and operating engineers. Supply chain pressures. The soaring cost of steel, manufacturing disruptions caused by extended lockdowns in China, and transportation backlogs at ports are already making it difficult for wind and solar developers to complete projects in their pipeline on time and on budget. Some of these pressures will abate as others move to the forefront. For instance, many of the raw materials needed to manufacture solar panels and wind turbines are projected to be in short supply. This includes nickel, copper, and rare earth metals such as neodymium and praseodymium, which are indispensable for the creation of magnets used in wind turbine generators.

Pressure on profits and volatility of returns in the short term. The increasing number of players moving into the renewable-development space, combined with reduced levels of government support and higher costs of materials, technology, and financing, is putting pressure on returns. At the same time, an all-time-high price volatility creates uncertainty and market risk.

Renewables developers will need to act decisively to prepare for these upcoming challenges. In a series of future articles, we provide detailed insights on each of these pressures and share potential ways players can take action."
57,"Even with massive investment, there are very high hurdles still to overcome: technical challenges such as fuel performance and reactor maintenance; political challenges, too, although the Americans, the Europeans, the Russians, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Australians have all warmed to the idea.

As have Britons. In October 2021, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy published its strategy on nuclear fusion. This form of energy, it notes, will be abundant, efficient, carbon-free, safe, and will produce radioactive waste much shorter-lived than that of current nuclear power stations.

Arthur Turrell is a former plasma physicist at Imperial College London, and author of a 2021 book, The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion & the Race to Power the Planet. He says that “controlling fusion to produce energy is the biggest technological challenge we’ve ever taken on as a species”. He explains how fusion reactors, or “star machines”, are indescribably complex, with tens of millions of individual parts.

The science bit

So just how does nuclear fusion work? It is the fusing of light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, at the same time releasing huge amounts of energy. It’s what happens in the middle of stars like our Sun, providing the power that drives the universe. Crucially, it’s the opposite of nuclear fission, the process used in nuclear power stations whereby huge amounts of energy are released when nuclei are split apart to form smaller nuclei.

The Sun notwithstanding, humans are currently experimenting with two main methods of fusion. JET, for example, uses what’s known as magnetic confinement fusion: two isotopes of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – are heated to temperatures up to 150 million degrees Celsius, becoming an electrically-charged gas called plasma, which is confined in the doughnut-shaped tokamak, and controlled with strong magnetic fields. The deuterium and tritium fuses together to produce helium and high-speed neutrons, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process – 10 million times more energy per kg of fuel than that released by burning fossil fuels. As Turrell neatly explains, the mass of deuterium-tritium fuel equivalent to an Olympic swimming pool of water would contain more energy than the entire planet uses in a year."

In June, South Korean regulators authorized the first-ever medicine, a COVID-19 vaccine, to be made from a novel protein designed by humans. The vaccine is based on a spherical protein ‘nanoparticle’ that was created by researchers nearly a decade ago, through a labour-intensive trial-and error-process1.

Now, thanks to gargantuan advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a team led by David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, reports in Science2,3 that it can design such molecules in seconds instead of months.

‘The entire protein universe’: AI predicts shape of nearly every known protein

Such efforts are a part of a scientific sea change, as AI tools such as DeepMind’s protein-structure-prediction software AlphaFold are embraced by life scientists. In July, DeepMind revealed that the latest version of AlphaFold had predicted structures for every protein known to science. And recent months have seen an explosive growth in AI tools — some based on AlphaFold — that can quickly dream up completely new proteins. Previously, this had been a painstaking pursuit with high failure rates.

“Since AlphaFold, there’s been a shift in the way we work with protein design,” says Noelia Ferruz, a computational biologist at the University of Girona, Spain. “We are witnessing very exciting times.”

Most efforts are focused on tools that can help to make original proteins, shaped unlike anything in nature, without much focus on what these molecules can do. But researchers — and a growing number of companies that are applying AI to protein design — would like to design proteins that can do useful things, from cleaning up toxic waste to treating diseases. Among the companies that are working towards this goal are DeepMind in London and Meta (formerly Facebook) in Menlo Park, California.

“The methods are already really powerful. They’re going to get more powerful,” says Baker. “The question is what problems are you going to solve with them.”

From scratch

Baker’s laboratory has spent the past three decades making new proteins. Software called Rosetta, which his lab started developing in the 1990s, splits the process into steps. Initially, researchers conceived a shape for a novel protein — often by cobbling together bits of other proteins — and the software deduced a sequence of amino acids that corresponded to this shape.

But these ‘first draft’ proteins rarely folded into the desired shape when made in the lab, and instead ended up stuck in different confirmations. So another step was needed to tweak the protein sequence such that it folded only into a single desired structure. This step, which involved simulating all the ways in which different sequences might fold, was computationally expensive, says Sergey Ovchinnikov, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who used to work in Baker’s lab. “You would literally have, like, 10,000 computers running for weeks doing this.”

What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution

By tweaking AlphaFold and other AI programmes, that time-consuming step has become instantaneous, says Ovchinnikov. In one approach developed by Baker’s team, called hallucination, researchers feed random amino-acid sequences into a structure-prediction network; this alters the structure so that it becomes ever-more protein-like, as judged by the network’s predictions. In a 2021 paper, Baker’s team created more than 100 small, ‘hallucinated’ proteins in the lab and found signs that about one-fifth resembled the predicted shape4.

AlphaFold, and a similar tool developed by Baker’s lab called RoseTTAFold, were trained to predict the structure of individual protein chains. But researchers soon discovered that such networks could also model assemblies of multiple interacting proteins. On this basis, Baker and his team were confident they could hallucinate proteins that would self-assemble into nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes; these would be made up of numerous copies of a single protein and would be similar to those on which the COVID-19 vaccine is based.

Nik Spencer/Nature; Source: Adapted from N. Ferruz et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.31.505981 (2022); and J. Wang et al. Science 377, 387–394 (2022).

But when they instructed microorganisms to make their creations in the labs, none of the 150 designs worked. “They didn’t fold at all: they were just gunk at the bottom of the test tube,” says Baker.

Around the same time, another researcher in the lab, machine-learning scientist Justas Dauparas, was developing a deep-learning tool to address what is known as the inverse folding problem — determining a protein sequence that corresponds to a given protein’s overall shape3. The network, called ProteinMPNN, can act as a ‘spellcheck’ for designer proteins created using AlphaFold and other tools, says Ovchinnikov, by tweaking sequences while maintaining the molecules’ overall shape.

When Baker and his team applied this second network to their hallucinated protein nanoparticles, it had much greater success making the molecules experimentally. The researchers checked 30 of their new proteins using cryo-electron microscopy and other experimental techniques, and 27 of them matched the AI-led designs2. The team’s creations included giant rings with complex symmetries, unlike anything found in nature. In theory, the approach could be used to design nanoparticles corresponding to almost any symmetric shape, says Lukas Milles, a biophysicist who co-led the effort. “It is electrifying to see what these networks can do.”

Deep-learning revolution

Deep-learning tools such as proteinMPNN have been a game changer in protein design, says Arne Elofsson, a computational biologist at Stockholm University. “You draw your protein, push a button, and you get something that one in ten times works.” Even higher success rates can be achieved by combining multiple neural networks to tackle different parts of the design process, as Baker’s team did in designing the nanoparticles. “Now we have full control over the shape of the protein,” says Ovchinnikov.

Baker’s isn’t the only lab applying AI to protein design. In a review paper posted to the bioRxiv this month, Ferruz and her colleagues counted more than 40 AI protein-design tools that have been developed in recent years, using various approaches5 (see ‘How to design a protein’).

Many of these tools, including proteinMPNN, tackle the inverse folding problem: they specify a sequence that corresponds to a particular structure, often using approaches borrowed from image-recognition tools. Some others are based on an architecture similar to that of language neural networks such as GPT-3, which produces human-like text; but, instead, the tools are capable of producing novel protein sequences. “These networks are able to ‘speak’ proteins,” says Ferruz, who has co-developed one such network6.

With so many protein-design tools available, it’s not always clear how best to compare them, says Chloe Hsu, a machine-learning researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who developed an inverse folding network with researchers from Meta7.

Four examples of protein ‘hallucination’. In each case, AlphaFold is presented with a random amino-acid sequence, predicts the structure, and changes the sequence until the software confidently predicts that it will fold into a protein with a well-defined 3D shape. Colours show prediction confidence (from red for very low confidence, through yellow and light blue to dark blue for very high confidence). Initial frames have been slowed down for clarity.

Many teams gauge their network’s ability to accurately determine the sequence of an existing protein from its structure. But this doesn’t apply for all methods, and it’s not clear how this metric, known as recovery rate, applies to the design of novel proteins, say scientists. Ferruz would like to see a protein-design competition, analogous to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, in which AlphaFold first demonstrated its superiority over other networks. “It’s a dream. Something like CASP would really move the field forward,” she says.

To the wet lab

Baker and his colleagues are adamant that making a novel protein in the lab is the ultimate test of their methods. Their initial failure to make hallucinated protein assemblies shows this. “AlphaFold thought they were fantastic proteins, but they clearly didn’t work in the wet lab,” says Basile Wicky, a biophysicist in Baker’s lab who co-led the effort, along with Baker, Milles and UW biochemist Alexis Courbet.

But not all scientists developing AI tools for protein design have easy access to experimental set-ups, notes Jinbo Xu, a computational biologist at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in Illinois. Finding a lab to collaborate with can take time, so Xu is establishing his own wet lab to put his team’s creations to the test.

Experiments will also be essential when it comes to designing proteins with specific tasks in mind, says Baker. In July, his team described a pair of AI methods that allow researchers to embed a specific sequence or structure in a novel protein8. They used these approaches to design enzymes that catalyse particular reactions; proteins capable of binding to other molecules; and a protein that could be used in a vaccine against a respiratory virus that is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations.

Last year, DeepMind launched a spin-off company called Isomorphic Labs in London that intends to apply AI tools such as AlphaFold to drug discovery. DeepMind’s chief executive, Demis Hassabis, says that he sees protein design as an obvious and promising application for deep-learning technology, and for AlphaFold in particular. “We’re working quite a lot in the protein design space. It’s pretty early days.”"

A hair follicle generated from hair organoids – tiny, simple versions of an organ Yokohama National University

Mature hair follicles have been grown in a laboratory for the first time, in a move that could one day treat hair loss.

Artificially producing hair follicles has historically been very difficult, says Kairbaan Hodivala-Dilke at Queen Mary University of London, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Different types of cells need different sorts of nutrients and when they’re outside the body, they need different sorts of requirements compared to when they’re in the body.”

Among mammals, hair follicles are typically produced in embryos as a result of interactions between skin cells and connective tissue.

To better understand these interactions, Junji Fukuda at Yokohama National University in Japan and his colleagues studied hair follicle organoids – tiny, simple versions of an organ.

By controlling the organoids’ structure, the team was able to enhance hair follicle growth.

“We examined various conditions, including growth factors, activators and inhibitors of signalling pathways and essential culture medium components,” says Fukuda.

The team’s main breakthrough was culturing mice embryonic skin cells in a special type of gel, which allowed the cells to be reprogrammed into hair follicles.

“If you think of a hair follicle, it’s got the hair down the middle of it and then it’s got layers of epithelial cells around the follicle and other specialised cells,” says Hodivala-Dilke. The gel allows these cells to grow in a laboratory in a way that means they can climb over and around each other [like they do in the body], she says.

The hair follicles grew for up to one month, reaching up to 3 millimetres long. “This is probably related to the fact that the hair cycle of mice is about one month,” says Fukuda.

The team is now working to recreate the experiment using human cells.

According to Hodivala-Dilke, laboratory-grown human hair follicles could one day treat hair loss. “You might be able to take hair from someone whose hair is really lush and make it grow in the lab and then use those follicles to do a transplant,” she says. Existing hair transplants involve moving hair from one part of the body to an area that is thinning or bald, which can cause scarring.

“This discovery is not going to cure hair loss, but it lays the foundation for somebody to potentially do so,” says Hodivala-Dilke.

The world’s first bulk carrier to be partially powered by wind, the Shofu Maru, sailed into the Port of Newcastle this morning on its maiden voyage.

The 100, 422 dwt bulker, owned by Japanese shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), was delivered on October 7, 2022. The vessel is the first of its kind and it heralds a new era in modern shipping as wind propulsion marks its return as a sustainable power source.

Shofu Maru is fitted with the so-called Wind Challenger system, a telescoping hard sail that harnesses wind power to propel the vessel.

The system converts wind energy directly to a propulsive force. The installation of the sail on merchant ships has the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption, which in turn reduces GHG emissions by about 5-8%. The sail can be shortened and extended (55 meters in length) adapting automatically to the wind conditions on board as it can rotate 360 degrees.

The vessel was greeted in the Port of Newcastle by a delegation of port officials and diplomatic dignitaries, including Consul-General of Japan in Sydney Tokuda Shuichi, Deputy Secretary of Safety, Environment and Regulation at Transport for NSW Tara McCarthy and MOL Managing Executive Officer for East/South East Asia and Oceania Nobuo Shiotsu.

“Port of Newcastle is pleased to join Port Authority of New South Wales in welcoming the vessel to our beautiful (and rainy) city, alongside the Consul-General of Japan in Sydney Tokuda Shuichi, Deputy Secretary of Safety, Environment and Regulation at Transport for NSW Tara McCarthy and MOL Managing Executive Officer for East/South East Asia and Oceania Nobuo Shiotsu,” the port authority said.

The 235-metre-long Shofu Maru will transport coal mainly from Australia, Indonesia, and North America as a dedicated vessel for Japan’s electric services company Tohoku Electric Power.

The vessel will now be loaded with its coal shipment, before it departs Newcastle on Tuesday.

MOL plans to build a second bulk carrier equipped with the Wind Challenger hard sail system at Oshima Shipbuilding. Under the plan, MOL Drybulk will operate the 62,900 dwt vessel, slated for delivery in 2024. Once completed, the vessel is chartered to transport wood pellets for Enviva, which specializes in the production of sustainable wood bioenergy.

MOL is also looking into the feasibility of adopting rotor sails, an auxiliary wind propulsion system developed by UK’s Anemoi Marine Technologies on the bulker. The combined use of both the Wind Challenger and rotor sails is expected to slash GHG emissions by an average of 20%.

Exploration of the wind-assisted propulsion technology forms part of MOL’s overall decarbonization strategy. The MOL Group has set mid- to long-term targets to reduce GHG emissions intensity in marine transport by approximately 45% by 2035 (i.e. versus 2019) and achieve net zero by 2050."
64,"UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A breakthrough in electric vehicle battery design has enabled a 10-minute charge time for a typical EV battery. The record-breaking combination of a shorter charge time and more energy acquired for longer travel range was announced today (Oct. 12) in the journal Nature.

“The need for smaller, faster-charging batteries is greater than ever,” said Chao-Yang Wang, the William E. Diefenderfer Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State and lead author on the study. “There are simply not enough batteries and critical raw materials, especially those produced domestically, to meet anticipated demand.”

In August, California’s Air Resources Board passed an extensive plan to restrict and ultimately ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars within the state. By 2035, the largest auto market in the United States will effectively retire the internal combustion engine.

If new car sales are going to shift to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), Wang explained, they’ll need to overcome two major drawbacks: they are too slow to recharge and too large to be efficient and affordable. Instead of taking a few minutes at the gas pump, depending on the battery, some EVs can take all day to recharge.

“Our fast-charging technology works for most energy-dense batteries and will open a new possibility to downsize electric vehicle batteries from 150 to 50 kWh without causing drivers to feel range anxiety,” said Wang, whose lab partnered with State College-based startup EC Power to develop the technology. “The smaller, faster-charging batteries will dramatically cut down battery cost and usage of critical raw materials such as cobalt, graphite and lithium, enabling mass adoption of affordable electric cars.”

The technology relies on internal thermal modulation, an active method of temperature control to demand the best performance possible from the battery, Wang explained. Batteries operate most efficiently when they are hot, but not too hot. Keeping batteries consistently at just the right temperature has been major challenge for battery engineers. Historically, they have relied on external, bulky heating and cooling systems to regulate battery temperature, which respond slowly and waste a lot of energy, Wang said.

Wang and his team decided to instead regulate the temperature from inside the battery. The researchers developed a new battery structure that adds an ultrathin nickel foil as the fourth component besides anode, electrolyte and cathode. Acting as a stimulus, the nickel foil self-regulates the battery’s temperature and reactivity which allows for 10-minute fast charging on just about any EV battery, Wang explained.

“True fast-charging batteries would have immediate impact,” the researchers write. “Since there are not enough raw minerals for every internal combustion engine car to be replaced by a 150 kWh-equipped EV, fast charging is imperative for EVs to go mainstream.”

The study’s partner, EC Power, is working to manufacture and commercialize the fast-charging battery for an affordable and sustainable future of vehicle electrification, Wang said.

The other coauthors on the study are Teng Liu, Xiao-Guang Yang, Shanhai Ge and Yongjun Leng of Penn State and Nathaniel Stanley, Eric Rountree and Brian McCarthy of EC Power.

65,"A novel technique that uses a beta blocker to interfere with memory reconsolidation shows promise in the treatment of adjustment disorder following romantic betrayal, according to new research published in the Journal of Affective Disorders.

Adjustment disorder is a condition that can occur in response to a significant life event or change. While it is normal to feel some degree of anxiety or distress in such situations, people with adjustment disorder experience more intense and long-lasting symptoms that interfere with their ability to cope. These may include difficulty sleeping, depressed mood, social withdrawal, and difficulty concentrating. In severe cases, adjustment disorder can lead to self-harm or suicidal thoughts.

“There is no recognized empirically-based treatment for adjustment disorders,” said study author Alain Brunet, a clinical psychologist and psychiatry professor at McGill University. “This is an oddity. We were interested in determining if the good clinical results we had obtained in treating PTSD with Reconsolidation Therapy applied to a broader set of trauma-like conditions, hence our interest for adjustment disorder.”

“Romantic Betrayal (a form of adjustment disorder) seemed like an interesting topic to study because, first, it is very distressing. Second, it is one of the most common reason why individuals seek professional help. Finally, there is very little help available for romantically betrayed individuals who do not wish to return with their partner.”

Propranolol is a beta blocker that is often prescribed for high blood pressure, migraines, and certain anxiety disorders. But the drug has also been shown to weaken the emotional tone of memories by blocking adrenergic pathways.

“Reconsolidation Therapy consist in recalling a bad memory under the influence of propranolol with the help of a trained therapist,” Brunet explained. “This treatment approach is a translational treatment stemming from the research in neuroscience which stipulates that a recalled memory needs to be saved again to long-term memory storage in order to persist. Interfering with the storage process will yield a degraded (less emotional) memory.”

In the new study, Brunet and his colleagues recruited adults who met the DSM-5 criteria for adjustment disorder. The participants had all experienced a romantic betrayal event, such as infidelity, that occurred during a monogamous long-term relationship.

The researchers asked the participants to write a first-person narrative of their romantic betrayal/abandonment event. The participants were told to focus on the most emotionally provocative aspects of the event and to include stress-related reactions, such as feeling tense, trembling, and sweating. During treatment sessions, the participants ingested propranolol before reading their narrative out loud once. Fifty-five participants completed at least one treatment session, while 48 completed all five sessions.

To assess clinically significant symptoms, the participants completed a widely used questionnaire known as the Impact of Event Scale — Revised (IES-R) before, during, and after the treatment phase. The researchers observed a large drop in IES-R scores immediately following the first treatment. The declines in IES-R scores continued over the course of the treatment phase. Thirty-five participants who completed a follow-up survey provided evidence that the improvements in symptom endured up to 4 months.

“Our study suggests that Reconsolidation Therapy works with adjustment disorder, in that it is clearly superior to a wait-list group (subjects were their own control),” Brunet told PsyPost. “The magnitude of the pre-post treatment improvement compares to results we obtained in our PTSD research.”

Brunet said he was surprised by how high the IES-R scores were prior to treatment. “Looking at the severity of symptoms, were surprised at how painful adjustment disorder can be,” the researcher explained. “Adjustment disorder is no ‘wimpy’ disorder. This is clearly a misconception.”

The study utilized a within-subjects open-label design, which limits the ability to draw strong conclusions about causality. However, the findings provide an important foundation for future research. “In spite of its moderate size, the study is important in that it provides the treatment ‘effect sizes’ required to launch a placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial,” Brunet said.

The study, “Treatment of adjustment disorder stemming from romantic betrayal using memory reactivation under propranolol: A open-label interrupted time series trial“, was authored by Michelle Lonergan, Daniel Saumier, Sereena Pigeon, Pierre E. Etienne, and Alain Brunet."
66,"A research group led by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has proposed a new approach to utilize connective heat transfer for solar module cooling in large-scale solar power plants.

Their modeling considers factors such as row spacing, panel height, and tilt angle. It also uses a length scale input to characterize the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration.

“The convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,” the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production.



Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08.

“Increasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilized in agrivoltaic systems,” said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. “That could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.”

Through the modeling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelized cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters. With two-meter spacing, the LCOE was $0.33/kWh, and with 11 meters it was $0.36/kWh.

The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modeling in the study “Technoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,” recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.

Other recent proposals for using convective solar module cooling include packing PV panels in close proximity, and taking wind direction and module inclination into account."
67,"Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.

Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, astronomers report in the Oct. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it’s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.

Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (SN: 7/11/22). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.

For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.

“When we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called ‘the sparkles,’” says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (SN: 10/15/20).

“The outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?” Mowla says. Were they born at “cosmic noon,” 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at “cosmic dawn,” when stars were first able to form at all (SN: 3/4/22)?

Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.

Zooming into one part of JWST’s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler. Some of the dots may be globular clusters of same-age stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. L. Mowla et al/The Astrophysical Journal Letters 2022

Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.

“When we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,” says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.

That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, “there’s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,” he says.

In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.

Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe’s history. They could also help unravel galaxies’ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST’s first year that could do just that.

Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Adélaïde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster.

“It’s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,” Claeyssens says. “James Webb will be a game changer for this field.”"
68,"If you’ve ever played the claw game at an arcade, you know how hard it is to grab and hold onto objects using robotics grippers. Imagine how much more nerve-wracking that game would be if, instead of plush stuffed animals, you were trying to grab a fragile piece of endangered coral or a priceless artifact from a sunken ship.

Most of today’s robotic grippers rely on embedded sensors, complex feedback loops, or advanced machine learning algorithms, combined with the skill of the operator, to grasp fragile or irregularly shaped objects. But researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have demonstrated an easier way.

Taking inspiration from nature, they designed a new type of soft, robotic gripper that uses a collection of thin tentacles to entangle and ensnare objects, similar to how jellyfish collect stunned prey. Alone, individual tentacles, or filaments, are weak. But together, the collection of filaments can grasp and securely hold heavy and oddly shaped objects. The gripper relies on simple inflation to wrap around objects and doesn’t require sensing, planning, or feedback control.

The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

“With this research, we wanted to reimagine how we interact with objects,” said Kaitlyn Becker, former graduate student and postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and first author of the paper. “By taking advantage of the natural compliance of soft robotics and enhancing it with a compliant structure, we designed a gripper that is greater than the sum of its parts and a grasping strategy that can adapt to a range of complex objects with minimal planning and perception.”

Becker is currently an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.

The gripper’s strength and adaptability come from its ability to entangle itself with the object it is attempting to grasp. The foot-long filaments are hollow, rubber tubes. One side of the tube has thicker rubber than the other, so when the tube is pressurized, it curls like a pigtail or like straightened hair on a rainy day.

The curls knot and entangle with each other and the object, with each entanglement increasing the strength of the hold. While the collective hold is strong, each contact is individually weak and won’t damage even the most fragile object. To release the object, the filaments are simply depressurized."

70,"Questions remain about how to interpret MCED test results. Only some blood tests can pinpoint which organ the cancer is actually in. Lab tests must be run on potentially cancerous tissue to confirm a diagnosis, but you can’t biopsy someone’s entire body. False positives remain an issue for the entire field of cancer screening, which, by design, involves sifting through mounds of healthy tests to find cancer. Galleri—the MCED furthest along the path to widespread use—incorrectly flagged 57 healthy blood samples as cancerous in the aforementioned study.

There’s also a risk of jumping the gun—some cancers never become invasive or life-threatening, but early detection could prompt harsh treatment like chemotherapy. Some data suggests that less worrisome cancers actually show up in the bloodstream less, which could minimize that problem.

The NIC trial will help determine how blood test results for cancer should be interpreted, and it should provide a standard approach to launching cancer screening studies as companies flood the field with new tests.

“I don't think most companies tend to want to compare their tests head to head,” says Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard. “It's expensive and difficult. So somebody else, a neutral party like the NCI, needs to.”

Rebbeck thinks the blood tests the new trial will vet will prove most helpful in the cases of pancreatic, liver, and ovarian cancer, which kill often and have no other form of screening. Still, longer trials are needed to confirm whether the time bought by these blood tests saves lives.

But Rebbeck is optimistic about the Cancer Moonshot’s ultimate goal: “It seems very realistic to me to think that we could reduce death by half,” he says."
71,"In a non peer-reviewed paper published on arXiv, Humphreys claims to have provided the most complete characterization of Starlink’s signals to date. This information, he says, is the first step toward developing a new global navigation technology that would operate independently of GPS or its European, Russian, and Chinese equivalents.

“The Starlink system signal is a closely guarded secret,” says Humphreys. “Even in our early discussions, when SpaceX was being more cooperative, they didn’t reveal any of the signal structure to us. We had to start from scratch, building basically a little radio telescope to eavesdrop on their signals.”

To get the project started, UT Austin acquired a Starlink terminal and used it to stream high-definition tennis videos of Rafael Nadal from YouTube. This provided a constant source of Starlink signals that a separate nearby antenna could listen in on.

Humphreys quickly realized that Starlink relies on a technology called orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is an efficient method of encoding digital transmissions, originally developed at Bell Labs in the 1960s and now used in Wi-Fi and 5G. “OFDM is all the rage,” says Mark Psiaki, a GPS expert and aerospace professor at Virginia Tech. “It’s a way to pack the most bits per second into a given bandwidth.”

The UT Austin researchers did not try to break Starlink’s encryption or access any user data coming down from satellites. Instead, they sought out synchronization sequences—predictable, repeating signals beamed down by the satellites in orbit to help receivers coordinate with them. Not only did Humphreys find such sequences, but “we were pleasantly surprised to find that they [had] more synchronization sequences than is strictly required,” he says.

Each sequence also contains clues to the satellite’s distance and velocity. With the Starlink satellites transmitting about four sequences every millisecond “that’s just wonderful for dual use of their system for positioning,” says Humphreys.

If the terrestrial receiver has a good idea of the satellites’ movements—which SpaceX shares online to reduce the risk of orbital collisions—it can use the sequences’ regularity to work out which satellite they came from, and then calculate the distance to that satellite. By repeating this process for multiple satellites, a receiver can locate itself to within about 30 meters, says Humphreys."
72,"It is a long way from the romance of a sun-dappled Highland glen. Picture instead a white cube equipped with the computer-controlled automation you would sooner expect to see in an Amazon or Ikea warehouse.

Scotland’s state forestry agency believes this prefabricated structure, erected at an agricultural research centre near Dundee, could play a significant part in its quest to help combat climate heating by greatly expanding the country’s forest cover.

Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) wants to plant tens of millions of new trees in the coming years – conifers such as Norway and sitka spruce, douglas fir and Scots pine, and broadleaf varieties such as oak, alder and birch.

This white cube, held up by steel ribs and girders, can help it do so at a remarkable speed and efficiency, producing saplings six times faster than it takes to grow them naturally outdoors. In the open, it would take about 18 months to bring a tree seedling up to 40-50mm in height; in these units, that growing time is about 90 days.

“Essentially, this isn’t a building. It’s a machine; it’s a growing machine,” said Georgia Lea, a communications manager for Intelligent Growth Solutions (IGS), the Edinburgh-based firm that has designed the system.

The “vertical farm” uses hydroponics, where plants are grown indoors in very tightly controlled conditions. The type of light, temperature, humidity and nutrition can be tailored for each plant, far more so than in a greenhouse or polytunnel. “It’s better than a summer’s day. It’s totally an optimal environment,” Lea said.

In the IGS unit at the James Hutton Institute, an agricultural sciences research centre at Invergowrie, technicians use iPads to control stacks of tightly packed shelves held in a cluster of automated towers standing 9 metres tall. Robots deliver trays of seedlings to the shelves. On the underside of each shelf, rows of LED lights shine on the chillis, birch, alder, strawberries and basil on the shelf below, tuned to provide the exact spectrum of light each crop needs.

Plastic drainpipes feed in water that carries fertiliser, with doses controlled by computer. The water is harvested from Tayside’s copious rainfall, cleaned and reused in a closed-loop system. The building is entered through a pressurised airlock designed to protect its microclimate.

This particular unit covers 42 square metres and can hold eight towers, each carrying 52 trays of seedlings. In theory, that can allow FLS to grow 3m seedlings at a time, at a significantly faster pace and using a fraction of the area needed for conventional growing.

FLS, previously known as the Forestry Commission, believes Scotland would be the first country in the world where the state forester uses hydroponics for its tree stocks. It hopes the Scottish government will soon agree to approve the purchase of one of these multimillion-pound units.

After running three batches designed to prove the concept worked for trees, tweaking the “recipe” of light and nutrition to suit each species, FLS is on its sixth trial run. Many thousands of spruce, pine and broadleaves from earlier trials are now “hardening off” for years at its open-air nursery at Newton near Elgins, before being taken to the plantations carpeting parts of the Highlands.

“We came along, looked at the system and were blown away by it. It has real potential,” said Kenny Hay, FLS’s tree seed resource manager.

Until it began working with FLS, IGS had been growing pak choi, carrots, seed potatoes and herbs, alongside edible nasturtiums, marigolds and strawberry runners, as samples to show to potential buyers of its systems.

The tree trials threw up one problem: earlier batches grew too fast, leaving saplings too soft to withstand the wind once they were planted out at Newton. FLS and IGS have slowed things down, to ensure the saplings are stronger just above their roots. “We’re doing everything and anything to see what this system does,” Hay said.

These experiments have a much greater success rate than normal methods, he said. Traditionally, seeds would be scattered by machine across a nursery bed, known as broadcast sowing. Up to 50% of those seeds may fail to produce saplings. In these optimised towers, the survival rate is about 95%.

Hay predicts that if FLS buys and runs its own growing tower, it could produce up to 60% of the 24m new trees the agency needs each year – chiefly commercially planted conifers to meet the UK’s timber needs, of which 80% is currently imported.

In the Cairngorm mountains to the north of Invergowrie, conservation-minded landowners such as the National Trust for Scotland at Mar Lodge, or Anders Povlsen at Glenfeshie, are allowing their forests to regenerate slowly using naturally fallen seeds, a strategy that fits far more closely with the ethics of rewilding.

FLS feels a greater sense of urgency. The UK’s central and devolved governments have set a challenging target of planting 30,000 hectares (74,131 acres) of new forestry every year by 2025, to help meet their net zero ambitions.

The latest official data shows the UK is some way off meeting that target. Planting rates fell sharply 20 years ago, and the UK failed to restock the mature forests that had been felled.

With that in mind, Hay is delighted by the potential of vertical farming. “These are great-looking trees. I have no issues whatsoever that we can make these trees work,” he said."
73,"In 1931, Winston Churchill predicted the rise of animal-free food. Then an opposition MP in his wilderness years, Churchill wrote an essay that imagined life in 50 years’ time. “Synthetic food will, of course, be used in the future,” he wrote.

The artificial stuff would “be practically indistinguishable from the natural products, and any changes will be so gradual as to escape observation,” Churchill wrote. “Microbes, which at present convert the nitrogen of the air into proteins by which animals live, will be fostered and made to work under controlled conditions just as yeast is now.”

Though several decades later than envisaged, Churchill’s prediction has been borne out by the development of lab-grown meat and, more recently, animal-free dairy products.

Synthetic milk has emerged as a new potential alternative to cow’s milk, one that – unlike plant-based oat, nut and soy milks – purports to replicate its taste, appearance and mouthfeel. Described by experts as the future of milk, it has been touted as an environmentally friendly option that may shake up the dairy industry – and leave small-scale farmers in the lurch.

“Lab-grown milk is considered the next food frontier,” says Dr Diana Bogueva, of Curtin University’s Sustainability Policy Institute, citing the growing popularity of dairy alternatives. Compared with dairy production, synthetic milk is likely to have a smaller carbon footprint and cause less pollution, and obviously eliminates animal welfare concerns, she says.

The industry is expanding rapidly. In the US, cow-free dairy proteins produced by the firm Perfect Day are now widely used in products including ice-cream, cream cheese, chocolate and protein powders. Another American startup, New Culture, is commercialising a synthetic milk-based mozzarella, while the Israeli firm Remilk has set up a giant facility in Denmark to produce cheese, yoghurt and ice-cream.

It will be some time before cow-free milk arrives in Australian supermarkets, but startups such as All G Foods and the CSIRO spin-off company Eden Brew are racing to bring products to market within the next two years.

Yeast of Eden

Chemically, milk is mostly water – about 87%, to be precise. Milk solids comprise the rest: fats, proteins, sugars – primarily lactose – and minerals. By Australian law, at least 3.2% of the liquid in full-cream milk must be fat and another 3% protein.

Most synthetic dairy companies are focusing on producing milk proteins using a process known as precision fermentation. It involves genetically programming yeast or other microorganisms using synthetic DNA to produce a specific protein. Jim Fader, the co-founder of Eden Brew, compares the process to beer brewing.

“We use yeast to make a protein to make a drink. They use yeast to make alcohol to make a drink,” he says.

There are at least 20 proteins in cow’s milk, about 80% of which are casein proteins, found in the curds; the rest are whey proteins, perhaps most familiar as a component of powdered protein shakes.

Aggregates of casein, known as micelles, give milk its characteristic appearance and heat stability.

“The micelle plays a fundamental role in many parts of milk,” Fader says. “For example, when it binds with calcium, it makes the milk look white. If you want to froth your milk and put it in your cappuccino, the ability for the milk to withstand that heat and the bubbles to be able to form … is also down to the micelle.”

Synthetic milk technology is ‘less about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairy’ but ‘augmenting supply’, Jim Fader says. Photograph: Reuters

Eden Brew is producing six proteins that are most abundant in milk. Once brewed, these will be purified and dried.

A key investor in the firm is the New South Wales dairy cooperative Norco, which will be responsible for rehydrating and blending the proteins. At this stage, other components such as minerals and coconut-based fat will be added. The end product will be lactose-free, with a small quantity of table sugar used to approximate the sweetness of cow’s milk.

Fader says the firm will launch an ice-cream – simpler than milk because it can be made with just two proteins – around December next year. Milk will follow, likely in August 2024.

All G Foods is focusing its efforts on whey proteins. The firm’s plant-based meat products are already served in commercial burger chains and sold in some supermarkets.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Jared Raynes, says the ultimate goal is to produce yoghurts, cheese and fresh milk. But the firm’s focus for now is on beta-lactoglobulin, the main protein in whey.

“We are going to be applying for regulatory approval with our protein powder,” he says.

Parallels with synthetic fabrics

Milena Bojovic, who is completing a PhD at Macquarie University, says while the promise of cow-free fresh milk has been widely trumpeted, the impact of synthetic dairy is likely to be greater on products such as milk powder.

“Fresh milk consumption is on the decline,” she says and consumers may be wary of drinking a synthetic version of a natural product. She points out that traditional dairy production is also “very much technologically mitigated, from conception to the birth of calves to the milking process”.

“If synthetic milk really takes off, the biggest disruption I think will be if it can be powdered and used in the ingredients space … as an additive like milk solids, which is in a lot of processed foods,” Bojovic says. “I don’t think most consumers are questioning where the milk solids in their KitKat came from.”

“If and possibly when that happens, that will be one of the major disruptions for dairy industries that are producing exclusively for export in the form of powdered milk.”

Bojovic, who has analysed global dairy trends as part of her research, is concerned that technological advances may leave farmers behind. Large dairy players such as Norco and Fonterra, a New Zealand multinational cooperative, have begun to invest in synthetic protein production.

“Small-scale operations are really going to struggle in the context of global dairy consolidation,” she says. “There’s more pressure on farmers to innovate and also to invest in technology to make sure that they’re at the standard that bigger corporates are at.”

Bojovic sees parallels with the rise of synthetic fabrics. “When synthetic fibres hit the market, that decimated the wool industry in a lot of regions,” she says. “It’s not the first time that farmers have been faced with the threat of synthetics, but they’ve adapted, they’ve innovated.”

Melissa Cameron, Dairy Australia’s human health and nutrition policy manager, says it is yet to be seen how consumers will respond to a synthetic product. She points to statistics suggesting that 58% of Australian households exclusively buy fresh and long-life cow’s milk.

“People are not abandoning dairy,” she says. “The commercialisation of synthetic proteins and products to a scale that makes these products available widely to consumers is yet quite a while off. As our populations grow around the world, synthetic products will deliver complementary protein and products. There will be room for all.”

Dairy demand worldwide grew by 36% between 2007 and 2017 and is expected to keep rising as the world’s population increases and per-capita consumption grows.

Fader says the technology that companies such as Eden Brew are developing is “less about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairy”. Rather, “it’s about augmenting the current supply because demand is forecast to go up by so much”."
74,"Panama will be home to the world's first community of floating SeaPods, with the inaugural pod now in the water at Linton Bay Marina in Colon.

Ocean Builders, a company specialising in innovative marine technology, has officially launched what it says are the first floating eco-restorative pod homes in the world.

Perched three metres above sea level on the Caribbean coast of Panama, the futuristic units are designed to accommodate two people and are on sale now, with prices ranging from $295,000 to $1.5 million.

By December, the first overnight guests will be able to bed down in the pods, and 100 fully-owned units will be ready for full-time residents by summer next year.

A second batch of more than 1,000 of the pods will go into production next year.

Designed by Dutch architect Koen Olthuis, the futuristic SeaPods are geared toward climate-conscious travellers who want to live on the water, but don’t want to give up the luxuries of modern living.

Futuristic living on the water from $295,000

With minimalist decor, curved walls and an ultra-sleek design, the SeaPod flagship model looks like something from The Jetsons. It is spread over 77 square metres of space that's split across three levels.

There's a master bedroom with epic views, a living room and kitchen, a bathroom and an outdoor patio. Wraparound panoramic windows give residents 360-degree unobstructed ocean views.

Wooden teak flooring, colour-changing lights and wireless charging stations are available in each SeaPod, which also comes with automated black-out blinds and sliding panel windows.

Entirely customisable, there's the option to add climbing walls, greenhouses, skylights, hot tubs and patio gardens.

Cutting-edge technology is at the heart of Panama's newest waterfront destination, with each pod using software to control lighting, internal air temperature, water pressure and more.

Guests wear a smart ring that can be used to control technology settings, as well as being used to unlock doors, open windows and turn on music and mood lighting. Wireless charging stations are built into several of the pod's surfaces so that chargers and wires for phones become a thing of the past.

Daily drone delivery and new marine habitats

Daily essentials such as groceries and medicine are flown in by drones that have been designed to easily withstand open ocean conditions. Self-driving boats remove rubbish, compost and recycling and, when they're not on duty, work to clean up the surrounding ocean waters by expelling trash to help mitigate human impact on the ocean even beyond the community.

The SeaPods are designed so that each one can function as a new habitat for marine life. Photo: Ocean Builders

Sustainability is a key focus for Ocean Builders and pods are designed to be respectful of their surrounding environment.

The pods have been designed to become marine habitats for fish and other creatures, and artificial intelligence cameras will monitor what goes on beneath the waves. Marine detection technology is available to alert pod residents when dolphins, whales or their other favourite sea creatures are nearby.

Ocean Builders officially launched three models on Monday. They include the original SeaPod, the GreenPod for land living and the EcoPod, a more affordable option of each version.

The single-level SeaPod Eco is slightly smaller than the flagship version and laid out on a single floor, but includes the same principles, technology options and customisable design features.

75,"In the murky waters of Lake Ontario just off the Toronto harbor, a stream of trash inches toward a round, tubular-looking device floating in the water. A piece of white styrofoam bumps up against the device’s lip. Then, in one fluid motion, it tumbles over the edge. With tendrils of marine plants circling the waste, it looks like the styrofoam could have entered a portal to an undersea world. Instead, the device is a gateway to a less mystical — yet vital — destination: the garbage dump.

“It’s basically like a floating trash can,” says Chelsea Rochman, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto, who has worked with a team at the university to capture trash in Lake Ontario with bins like these since 2019. Powered from shore, the device, called a Seabin, uses a motor to create a vortex that gently pulls in floating waste from a 160-foot radius and then stores the trash in an attached basket.

Across the Great Lakes, which stretch from Duluth, Minnesota, to the border between the United States and Canada in northern New York, dozens of Seabins now work alongside stormwater filters in a cross-border project dubbed the Great Lakes Plastic Cleanup. In mid-September, they were also joined by aquatic waste-collection drones and beach-cleaning roving robots — all to remove some of the 22 million pounds of plastic that enter the lakes each year and help researchers like Rochman understand the Great Lakes waste problem.

People can’t remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can

“We know that the amount of litter we have out there needs more power than the people power that we have,” Rochman explains. Though local groups have organized beach cleanups for decades, people can’t remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can, nor can they pick up the tiny pieces that machines are able to capture.

Standing on the shore of Lake Ontario, with Toronto’s streetcars rattling by, Rochman points out the overflowing municipal trash bin along the sidewalk — one of several sources of the trash. Municipal sewage systems, industrial spills, stormwater runoff, recreational boating and beach waste, and agricultural debris all wind up in the lakes as well. In one bin, toothbrushes, tampon applicators, dental flossers, shoe strings, eyeglasses, food scraps, and syringes are entwined in the tendrils of marine plants. Between the leaves, tiny flecks of plastic poke out.

In the lakes, which 40 million people rely on as their primary drinking water source, this waste breaks down, turning into microscopic pieces of plastic and debris, which are then eaten by fish, sucked into surrounding water treatment plants, or pulled to shore or out into the ocean. When plastic is consumed by fish, it can release chemicals like dyes and flame retardants, irritating and potentially damaging their digestive systems. In big sport fish, like lake trout or salmon, Rochman expects to find hundreds of pieces of plastic. Microplastics have also been found in drinking water in the region, where many water treatment plants are ill-equipped to filter the tiny pieces out. (The risk of consuming microplastics for humans remains unclear, though researchers continue to investigate the potential problem.)

Once captured by researchers like Rochman, each piece of trash becomes another data point. Each day during the summer, students haul out the bins to count, classify, and dispose of their contents. “They know how many cigarette butts we collect, how many straws we collect, how many foam containers we collect,” Rochman says. Some days, the catch is more surprising — students have counted slices of deli meat, old shoes, and, once, a coconut in Seabins this summer.

The Seabins capture 28 grams of waste, on average, each day. “It’s going to sound like a small number because plastic is light,” says Rochman. That weight translates to a couple hundred to 2,000 pieces of microplastic, along with multiple pieces of larger waste. This summer, Rochman expects her team to remove the amount of plastic equivalent to 7,000 plastic water bottles — and that’s only in the 12 bins the university oversees, which make up just a fraction of the devices deployed at 45 marinas across the Great Lakes region.

From the northern shores of Lake Superior in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to the harbor of Buffalo, New York, just a short drive from Niagara Falls, Seabins like the ones in the Toronto harborfront are deployed at 44 other locations, typically in operation from May to November. These bins are monitored not by researchers but by marina owners or local organizations. Partners at the participating sites weigh and dispose of the bins’ contents as they fill up and perform full waste characterizing audits five to 10 times each year. Many marinas also have catch basin baskets installed, called LittaTraps, that sit inside stormwater drains to capture waste before it enters the lake system. Between 2020 and 2021, the project’s technology captured over 74,000 pieces of trash, a number that the team expects will increase as they continue outreach to marinas and municipalities in the region.

In September, a waste collecting drone and beach-cleaning robot also joined the project’s fleet of trash catching technology. The devices, built by French waste capture technology company The Searial Cleaners, collect waste from lakes and beaches, working both via remote control and autonomously. The roving robots are also key public engagement tools, says Claire Touvier, the company’s chief executive. “That’s why this robot needed to be sexy and cool and fun, and to also have a cool name — these are extremely efficient tools when it comes to raising awareness,” she says.

Still, the technology remains a reactive approach. Robots can help clean up the lakes, but human choices about how much plastic to produce, consume, and throw out are at the core of the Great Lakes trash problem. Changing them will be key to any long-term solution, says Melissa De Young, policy and programs director at the Canadian nonprofit Pollution Probe, one of the project’s main funders. “We’re doing what we can to remove plastic from the water, but we know that the technologies alone are not going to solve the problem,” she explains. “The data that we’re collecting is really critical because it provides, first, an understanding of the extent of the problem.”

If large macroplastics wind up in capture devices in a certain area, for example, that can indicate communities nearby may lack easy access to disposal facilities or may be uninformed on why proper waste disposal is important. Alternatively, if small plastic pieces used to build other products, called preproduction pellets, or nurdles, are more common, that can indicate that somewhere upstream, a manufacturer may be improperly disposing of its trash.

The captured waste then informs the group’s approach to local solutions, whether that means starting a new educational campaign, meeting with policymakers, or advocating for new industry mandates. Last year, the team consulted on a new Ontario law that requires the foam used to build floating docks for cottages and marinas to be fully enclosed so it does not break down into the water. The group has also contributed to proposed legislation to include mandates for filters on washing machines to prevent microfibers from entering the sewage system in Ontario and stronger laws regarding preproduction plastic disposal in Illinois.

“When we go to government policymakers, when we go to industry in the region, when we go to others to say, ‘Listen, we’ve got a problem here and we need to fix it,’ having that localized data, having that regional data, really aids us in those conversations in terms of capturing people’s attention and really motivating them to do something,” says Mark Fisher, head of the Council for the Great Lakes, a binational organization that also funds the project.

“We don’t want to have to have trash traps in the water forever.”

Other researchers in the region are hopeful about the new technology in the lakes, too. No initiative is going to be able to pick up 22 million pounds of plastic out of the Great Lakes every year, but a project that can motivate public and political action can have magnifying results, explains Timothy Hoellein, a biology professor at Loyola University Chicago who has worked on separate lake cleanup projects but is not involved in this one. When it comes to the Seabins, “Their individual footprint is pretty small,” Hoellein says. “But on a collective basis, it could really make a difference.”

As the strategy garners success in the region, its lessons have begun to reach far beyond the shores of the Great Lakes. Rochman and the team at the University of Toronto have partnered with the nonprofit environmental group Ocean Conservancy to found the International Trash Trap Network, which works with groups from Fiji to Florida to help create more trash trapping strategies. Wherever trash traps capture waste, data collection follows.

It’s all part of the goal of achieving a future where freshwater sources, like the Great Lakes, are no longer dumping zones for waste, Rochman says. “We don’t want to have to have trash traps in the water forever,” she adds."
76,"Software developed using machine learning can be used to predict someone’s risk of heart disease in less than a minute by analyzing the veins and arteries in their eye.

The new research, published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, paves the way for the development of quick and cheap cardiovascular screenings, if the findings are validated in future clinical trials. These screenings would let individuals know their risk of stroke and heart attack without the need for blood tests or even blood pressure measurements.

“This AI tool could let someone know in 60 seconds or less their level of risk,” the lead author of the study, Alicja Rudnicka, told The Guardian. The study found that the predictions were as accurate as those produced by current tests.

“The eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body.”

The software works by analyzing the web of blood vessels contained within the retina of the eye. It measures the total area covered by these arteries and veins, as well as their width and “tortuosity” (how bendy they are). All these factors are affected by an individual’s heart health, allowing the software to make predictions about a subject’s risk from heart disease just by looking at a non-invasive snapshot of their eye.

“The study adds to a growing body of knowledge that the eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body,” Pearse Keane, a researcher in ophthalmology and AI analysis not connected to the study, told The Verge. “Doctors have known for more than a hundred years that you could look in the eye and see signs of diabetes and high blood pressure. But the problem was manual assessment: the manual delineation of the vessels by human experts.” The use of machine learning, says Keane, can overcome this challenge.

Using AI to diagnose disease from eye scans has proven to be one of the fastest-developing fields of machine learning medicine. The first ever AI diagnostic device approved by the FDA was used to screen for eye disease, and research suggests AI can detect a range of ailments in this way, from diabetic retinopathy to Alzheimer’s (Keane’s own area of research). Tools applying these findings are in various stages of development, but questions do remain about the reliability and universality of their diagnoses.

The researcher named their software QUARTZ. Image: Rudnicka et al

This recent study, carried out by a team from St George’s, University of London, was only tested on the eye scans of white patients, for example. The team sourced their test data from the UK Biobank, a database that happens to be 94.6 percent white (reflecting the UK’s own demographics in age range of patients included in the BioBank). Such biases would have to be balanced in the future to ensure any diagnostic tool is equally accurate for different ethnicities.

The researchers compared the results from their software, named QUARTZ (an inventive acronym derived from the phrase “QUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessels Topology and siZe”) with 10-year risk predictions produced by the standard Framingham Risk Score test (FRS). They found the two methods had “comparable performance.”"
77,"An Israeli company has cloned hemp cells and used a bioreactor to grow them into a substance with all the active compounds of cannabis — and 12 times the potency.

BioHarvest Sciences says the breakthrough could make the medical benefits of cannabis available in cheaper, cleaner and greener form. It has started applying for the necessary licenses to manufacture and sell its product for medical use in Israel and the United States.

“We don’t grow the plant at all,” BioHarvest CEO Ilan Sobel told The Times of Israel. Instead, the process involves “replicating” cells taken from a hemp plant in big tanks called bioreactors to produce huge numbers of identical cells.

“We grow them in huge bioreactors in just three weeks — while regular cannabis takes 14 to 23 weeks,” Sobel said. “Our tech can also significantly increase the levels of active ingredients, as a percent of the weight, versus what is found normally in the plant.”

And so, every gram emerging from the bioreactor in Rehovot requires less water and other resources to grow than a gram from a cannabis plant— and will stretch considerably further in terms of treating patients, Sobel said.

He expects the impact of his innovation on the cannabis market to be “breathtaking.” He declined to detail the proprietary technology that is used, but said that the potency has been increased 12-fold purely by changing the environment inside the bioreactor.

Sobel said: “By adjusting specific conditions to which the cells are exposed, we can create different desired compositions of active ingredients, meaning we can dial up and down the various cannabinoids [compounds].”

The biomass that comes out of the bioreactor consists of cells that are identical to those found in cannabis derived from plants, and there is no genetic modification, Sobel said. Patients can receive it in smokable form or as pills, drops, chewing gum, and a range of other formats.

As well as containing high levels of the active compounds, the biomass is full-spectrum, which means it has the full variety of chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant, and not just some of them.

“Our composition has significant amounts of both major cannabinoids such as CBD and THC as well as significant amounts of what have been termed minor cannabinoids,” Sobel said.

The controlled environment of the bioreactor could overcome two challenges of cannabis farming: contamination and crops with varying levels of active compounds. Sobel said that the protected environment of the bioreactor keeps out contaminants like fungi, and the controlled nature of the method delivers a product that has consistent compound levels.

BioHarvest claims that if its biomass takes off, it will deliver the benefits of medical cannabis more cheaply and with less environmental impact. This is because, according to company calculations, each kilowatt of electricity produces eight times more material from the bioreactor than what is produced from plants. When it comes to water, each gallon produces 54 times more bioreactor material than plant material. Land requirements are reduced by more than 90%.

The company’s resource-saving growing techniques are already in use for growing grapes, olives and pomegranates.

“The bottom line is that we can make cannabis and hemp far more useful than before, at lower cost to our planetary resources,” Sober commented. “It is a wellness and sustainability solution from Israel that can provide a truly inspiring contribution to the world.”"
78,"Additionally, achieving high-power density will create more opportunities to integrate these solar cells into construction and building elements, so that more existing surface area can be covered with PV modules. Breaking the 30% barrier is therefore a big step in accelerating the energy transition and improving energy security by reducing the dependency on fossil fuels.

The best of both worlds

Tandem devices can reach higher efficiencies than single junction solar cells because of a better utilization of the solar spectrum. The currently emerging tandems combine commercial silicon technology for the bottom device with perovskite technology: the latter featuring highly efficient conversion of ultraviolet and visible light and excellent transparency to near infrared light. In four-terminal (4T) tandem devices the top and bottom cells operate independently of each other which makes it possible to apply different bottom cells in this kind of devices. Commercial PERC technology as well as premium technologies like heterojunction or TOPCon or thin-film technology such as CIGS can be implemented in a 4T tandem device with hardly any modifications to the solar cells. Furthermore, the four-terminal architecture makes it straight forward to implement bifacial tandems to further boost the energy yield.

Researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium have successfully improved the efficiency of the semi-transparent perovskite cells up to 19.7% with an area of 3x3 mm2 as certified by ESTI (Italy). “This type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93% of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device. This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.” says Dr Mehrdad Najafi of TNO. “The silicon device is a 20x20-mm2 wide, heterojunction solar cell featuring optimized surface passivation, transparent conductive oxides and Cu-plated front contacts for state-of-the-art carrier extraction” says Yifeng Zhao, PhD student at TU Delft, whose results have been recently peer-reviewed. The silicon device optically stacked under the perovskite contributes with 10.4% efficiency points to the total solar energy conversion.

Combined, 30.1% is the conversion efficiency of this non-area matched 4T tandem devices operating independently. This world’s best efficiency is measured according to generally accepted procedures."
79,"New Form Of Cotton Can Grab Nearly Three And A Half Times Its Own Weight Of Water Out Of Thin Air

A new treatment applied to cotton called PNIPAAm can make the material absorb up to 340% of its own weight in water from misty air and then release it as temperatures heat up. This makes it ideal for gathering water in desert and mountain environments. By comparison, untreated cotton can absorb only 18% of its weight in water.

Created by researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the coated cotton can grab water from misty air, store it, and then release it. The water remains pure and unadulterated by the cotton. The process is repeatable again and again and the polymer can be applied to any cotton material.

The process, sometimes called fog harvesting, mirrors the system used by some beetles that collect water on their shells which then roll into their mouths. At low temperatures, the cotton fiber remains wide open and receptive to moisture. Once the temperaure rises above 34 degrees Celius, the cotton contracts and becomes hydrophobic, thereby releasing the clean water. The creators expect this to work well in agricultural uses but could be useful to collect water overnight in hot environments or create wicking clothing for athletes.

According to a release on Eurekalert, the material isn’t expensive to produce and the researchers are working on ways to optimise the new material for everyday use. Perhaps the Stillsuit is closer than even the Bene Gesserit witch expected?"
80,"A team from the University of Cambridge, working with colleagues from Austria, found a new way to make a possible replacement for rare-earth magnets: tetrataenite, a ‘cosmic magnet’ that takes millions of years to develop naturally in meteorites.

Previous attempts to make tetrataenite in the laboratory have relied on impractical, extreme methods. But the addition of a common element – phosphorus – could mean that it’s possible to make tetrataenite artificially and at scale, without any specialised treatment or expensive techniques.

The results are reported in the journal Advanced Science. A patent application on the technology has been filed by Cambridge Enterprise, the University’s commercialisation arm, and the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

High-performance magnets are a vital technology for building a zero-carbon economy, and the best permanent magnets currently available contain rare earth elements. Despite their name, rare earths are plentiful in Earth’s crust. However, China has a near monopoly on global production: in 2017, 81% of rare earths worldwide were sourced from China. Other countries, such as Australia, also mine these elements, but as geopolitical tensions with China increase, there are concerns that rare earth supply could be at risk.

“Rare earth deposits exist elsewhere, but the mining operations are highly disruptive: you have to extract a huge amount of material to get a small volume of rare earths,” said Professor Lindsay Greer from Cambridge’s Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy, who led the research. “Between the environmental impacts, and the heavy reliance on China, there’s been an urgent search for alternative materials that do not require rare earths.”

Tetrataenite, an iron-nickel alloy with a particular ordered atomic structure, is one of the most promising of those alternatives. Tetrataenite forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools, giving the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, ultimately resulting in a material with magnetic properties approaching those of rare-earth magnets.

In the 1960s, scientists were able to artificially form tetrataenite by bombarding iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, enabling the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking, but this technique is not suitable for mass production.

“Since then, scientists have been fascinated with getting that ordered structure, but it’s always felt like something that was very far away,” said Greer. Despite many attempts over the years, it has not yet been possible to make tetrataenite on anything approaching an industrial scale.

Now, Greer and his colleagues from the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Montanuniversität in Leoben, have found a possible alternative that doesn’t require millions of years of cooling or neutron irradiation.

The team was studying the mechanical properties of iron-nickel alloys containing small amounts of phosphorus, an element that is also present in meteorites. The pattern of phases inside these materials showed the expected tree-like growth structure called dendrites.

“For most people, it would have ended there: nothing interesting to see in the dendrites, but when I looked closer, I saw an interesting diffraction pattern indicating an ordered atomic structure,” said first author Dr Yurii Ivanov, who completed the work while at Cambridge and is now based at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.

At first glance, the diffraction pattern of tetrataenite looks like that of the structure expected for iron-nickel alloys, namely a disordered crystal not of interest as a high-performance magnet. It took Ivanov’s closer look to identify the tetrataenite, but even so, Greer says it’s strange that no one noticed it before.

The researchers say that phosphorus, which is present in meteorites, allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years. By mixing iron, nickel and phosphorus in the right quantities, they were able to speed up tetrataenite formation by between 11 and 15 orders of magnitude, such that it forms over a few seconds in simple casting.

“What was so astonishing was that no special treatment was needed: we just melted the alloy, poured it into a mould, and we had tetrataenite,” said Greer. “The previous view in the field was that you couldn’t get tetrataenite unless you did something extreme, because otherwise, you’d have to wait millions of years for it to form. This result represents a total change in how we think about this material.”

While the researchers have found a promising method to produce tetrataenite, more work is needed to determine whether it will be suitable for high-performance magnets. The team are hoping to work on this with major magnet manufacturers.

The work may also force a revision of views on whether the formation of tetrataenite in meteorites really does take millions of years.

The research was supported in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and Seventh Framework Programme, and the Austrian Science Fund.

81,"A Russian institute is developing its own lithography scanner that could produce chips using 7nm-class fabrication technologies. The machine is under development, with the plan to build it by 2028. When it is ready, it should be more efficient than ASML's Twinscan NXT:2000i tool, whose development took over a decade.

After Russia unleashed its bloody war against Ukraine on February 24, Taiwan was quick to ban shipments of advanced chips to the nation. The U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. then followed up with sanctions that effectively prohibit virtually all contract chipmakers with advanced fabs from working with Russian entities. In addition, companies like Arm cannot license their technologies to Russia-based chip designers. As a result, the Russian government rolled out a national program to develop the country's own 28nm-class fabrication technology by 2030, reverse engineer as many foreign chips as possible, and educate local talent to work on domestic chips.

However, there is a problem with a 28nm-class production node by 2030. Russia's most advanced fab can produce chips using a 65nm fabrication technology. Meanwhile, American and European makers of fab tools cannot supply their equipment to Russia due to sanctions, so the country has to design and build domestic wafer production equipment if it wants to adopt a 28nm node. Essentially, what has taken companies like ASML and Applied Materials decades to develop and iterate has to be done in about eight years.

Apparently, the Russian Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences intends to beat all expectations and produce a 7nm-capable lithography scanner by 2028, according to its plans published on Nizhy Novgorod Strategy Development website (via CNews).

A modern lithography scanner capable of processing wafers using a 7nm-class process technology is a highly complex apparatus that involves a high-performance light source, sophisticated optics, and precise metrology, just to name a few critical parts. However, as a leading applied physics university in Russia, IAP believes that it can develop such a tool in a relatively short amount of time.

The tool will be somewhat different from scanners produced by companies like ASML or Nikon. For example, IAP plans to use a >600W light source (total power, not intermediate focus power) with an 11.3nm exposure wavelength (EUV wavelength is 13.5nm), which will require considerably more sophisticated optics than exists today. Because the light source of the device will be relatively low power, it will make the tool more compact and easier to build. Yet, it also means that its production of the scanner will be considerably lower than that of modern deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools. That might not be a problem, according to IAP.

When it comes to timing, IAP may be slightly too optimistic. For everything below 32nm, chipmakers use the so-called immersion lithography (which is essentially a booster to DUV tools). ASML introduced its first immersion lithography system — the Twinscan XT:1250i — in late 2003 with a plan to deliver one in Q3 2004 to produce 65nm logic chips and 70nm half-pitch DRAMs. It took the company about five years and another generation of tools to announce its 32nm-capable Twinscan NXT:1950i in late 2008, with customer deliveries starting in 2009.

Then, it took the market leader some nine years to deliver its 7nm and 5nm-capable Twinscan NXT:2000i DUV tool in 2018. TSMC used less advanced tools with multi-patterning for its first-generation N7 fabrication technology, but the timing of ASML’s introductions demonstrate how hard it is to transition from 65nm to 7nm. It took ASML 14 years to go from 65nm to 7nm. Now, IAP, which does not have any experience in chip production or ties with chipmakers, intends to build a 7nm-capable machine for volume production from scratch in about six years. While the plan does not sound feasible, it looks like IAP is full of enthusiasm.

""ASML, the global lithography leader, has been developing its EUV lithography system for almost 20 years and the technology has turned out to be incredibly complex,"" said Nikolai Chkhalo, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences for scientific and technological development. ""The main objective of ASML in this case was to maintain the extremely high productivity that is needed only at the world's largest factories. In Russia, no one needs such high productivity. In our work, we start from the needs and tasks faced by domestic microelectronics — and this is not so much about quantity, but about quality. First of all, we need to transit to our own fabrication processes, develop our own design standards, our own tools, engineering, materials, so our own path is inevitable here. In fact, we need to balance between simplicity and performance.""

IAP plans to build a fully functional alpha scanner by 2024. This one will not have to offer high productivity or maximum resolution but will have to work and be attractive to potential investors. IAP intends to build a beta version of the scanner with higher productivity and resolution by 2026. This machine should be mass production ready, but its productivity is not expected to be at its maximum. The final iteration of the litho scanner is said to emerge in 2028. It should get a high-performance light source (hence better productivity), better metrology and overall capabilities. There is no word how many of such machines IAP and/or its production partners will be able to produce by 2028.

It should be noted that fab equipment is not limited to lithography scanners. There are other types of machines performing etching, deposition, resist removal, metrology, and inspection operations that are not made in Russia. Furthermore, there is somewhat less advanced machinery like ultrapure air and water generators which also are not produced in Russia. Even if IAP RAS manages to build a lithography tool, Russia will still be a few hundred tools short of building a modern fab. Also, fabs need ultrapure raw materials produced in countries that will not supply to Russia."
