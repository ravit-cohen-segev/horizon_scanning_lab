Long-time tech pundit Robert X. Cringely predicted that Apple would first offer some limited satellite-based functionality, <br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " But he'd also called those services \"proxies for Apple entering — <a href=\"https://www.cringely.com/2022/06/03/apples-space-ambitions-are-real/\">and then dominating — the Internet of Things (IoT) business</a>.   \"After all, iPhones will give them 1.6 billion points of presence for AirTag detection even on sailboats in the middle of the ocean — or on the South Pole.... Ubiquity (being able to track anything in near real time anywhere on the planet) signals the maturity of IoT, turning it quickly into a $1 TRILLION business — in this case Apple's $1 TRILLION business.\"  And beyond that, \"in the longer run Cupertino plans to dis-intermediate the mobile carriers — becoming themselves a satellite-based global phone and data company [and] they will also compete with  satellite Internet providers like Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon's Kuiper.\"<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " So how did Cringely react last week when Apple <a href=\"https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/22/09/07/1812213/the-iphone-14-and-14-plus-are-official-with-satellite-based-emergency-sos\">announced  \"Emergency SOS\" messaging for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus</a> — via communication satellites — when their users are out of range of a cell signals? He began by <a href=\"https://www.cringely.com/2022/09/08/what-yesterdays-apple-satellite-announcement-really-means/\">wondering if Apple was intentionally downplaying the satellite features</a>:\n",
       " \n",
       " <i>They limited their usage case to emergency SOS texts in the USA and Canada, <em>sorta</em> said it would be just for iPhone 14s, and be free for only the first two years. They showed a satellite app and very deliberately tried to make it look difficult to use. They gave no technical details and there was no talk of industry partners.<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " Yet there were hints of what's to come. We (you and I, based on <a href=\"https://www.cringely.com/2022/06/03/apples-space-ambitions-are-real/\">my previous column</a>) already knew, for example, that ANY iPhone can be made to work with Globalstar. We also knew the deal was with <em>Globalstar</em>, which Apple never mentioned but Globalstar confirmed, more or less, later in the day in an SEC filing. But Apple DID mention Find My and Air Tags, notably saying they'd work through the satellites even without having to first beseech the sky with an app. So the app is less than it seems and Apple's satellite network will quickly find its use for the Internet of Things [Cringely predicts]....<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " Apple very specifically said nothing about the global reach of Find My and Air Tags. <em>There is no reason why those services can't have immediate global satellite support, given that the notification system is entirely within Apple's ecosystem and is not dependent on 911-type public safety agreements.</em> <br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " Maybe it will take a couple years to cover the world with SOS, but not for Find My, which means not for IoT — a business headed fast toward $1 trillion and will therefore [hypothetically] have a near-immediate impact on Apple's bottom line. </i> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " Speculating further, Cringely predicts that Globalstar — which has ended up with vast tracts of licensed spectrum — will eventually be purchased by a larger company.  (\"If not Apple, maybe Elon Musk.\")<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " And this leads Cringely to yet another prediction.  \"If Elon can't get Globalstar, he and his partners will push for the regulatory expansion into space of terrestrial 5G licenses, <em>which will probably be successful</em>.\"\n",
       " \n",
       " <i>This will happen, frankly, whether SpaceX and T-Mobile are successful or not, because <a href=\"https://ast-science.com/\">AST&amp;Science</a> and its investors AT&amp;T, Verizon and Zodafone need 5G in space, too, to compete with Apple. So there WILL eventually be satellite competition for Apple and I think the International Telecommunication Union  will eventually succumb to industry pressure.</i> <br/>\n",

He argues that GPT-3's 175 billion parameters give it interpretive power \"far beyond human understanding, far beyond what our little animal brains can comprehend. Machine learning has capacities that are real, but which transcend human understanding: the definition of magic.\"<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " But despite being a technology where inscrutability \"is an industrial by-product of the process,\" we may still not see what's coming, Marche argue — that AI is \"every bit as important and transformative as the other great tech disruptions, but more obscure, tucked largely out of view.\"\n",
       " <i>Science fiction, and our own imagination, add to the confusion. We just can't help thinking of AI in terms of the technologies depicted in Ex Machina, Her, or Blade Runner — people-machines that remain pure fantasy. Then there's the distortion of Silicon Valley hype, the general fake-it-'til-you-make-it atmosphere that gave the world WeWork and Theranos: People who want to sound cutting-edge end up calling any automated process \"artificial intelligence.\" And at the bottom of all of this bewilderment sits the mystery inherent to the technology itself, its direct thrust at the unfathomable. The most advanced NLP programs operate at a level that not even the engineers constructing them fully understand.<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " But the confusion surrounding the miracles of AI doesn't mean that the miracles aren't happening. It just means that they won't look how anybody has imagined them. Arthur C. Clarke famously said that \"technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.\" Magic is coming, and it's coming for all of us....<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       " And if AI harnesses the power promised by quantum computing, everything I'm describing here would be the first dulcet breezes of a hurricane. Ersatz humans are going to be one of the least interesting aspects of the new technology. This is not an inhuman intelligence but an inhuman capacity for digital intelligence. An artificial general intelligence will probably look more like a whole series of exponentially improving tools than a single thing. It will be a whole series of increasingly powerful and semi-invisible assistants, a whole series of increasingly powerful and semi-invisible surveillance states, a whole series of increasingly powerful and semi-invisible weapons systems.  The world would change; we shouldn't expect it to change in any kind of way that you would recognize.<br/> <br/>\n",

But we are shockingly bad at predicting the long-term effects of technology.

       " <strong>Perkins:</strong> I was actually in the floppy disk duplication business. Not in a million years did I think I would ever sell blank floppy disks. Duplicating disks in the 1980s and early 1990s was as good as printing money. It was unbelievably profitable. I only started selling blank copies organically over time. You could still go down to any office supply store, or any computer store to buy them. Why would you try to find me, when you could just buy disks off the shelf? But then these larger companies stopped carrying them or went out of business and people came to us. So here I am, a small company with a floppy disk inventory, and I find myself to be a worldwide supplier of this product. My business, which used to be 90% CD and DVD duplication, is now 90% selling blank floppy disks. It's shocking to me....<br/> <br/>\n",

       " <strong>Perkins:</strong> When people ask me: \"Why are you into floppy disks today?\" the answer is: \"Because I forgot to get out of the business.\"  Everybody else in the world looked at the future and came to the conclusion that this was a dying industry. Because I'd already bought all my equipment and inventory, I thought I'd just keep this revenue stream. I stuck with it and didn't try to expand. Over time, the total number of floppy users has gone down. However, the number of people who provided the product went down even faster. If you look at those two curves, you see that there is a growing market share for the last man standing in the business, and that man is me....<br/> <br/>\n",
       " \n",
       "  I made the decision to buy a large quantity, a couple of million disks, and we've basically been living off of that inventory ever since.  From time to time, we get very lucky. About two years ago a guy called me up and said: \"My grandfather has all this floppy junk in the garage and I want it out. Will you take it?\" Of course I wanted to take it off his hands. So, we went back and forth and negotiated a fair price. Without going into specifics, he ended up with two things that he wanted: an empty garage and a sum of money. I ended up with around 50,000 floppy disks and that's a good deal.</i> <br/>\n",

Another thing that happened organically was the start of our floppy disk recycling service. We give people the opportunity to send us floppy disks and we recycle them, rather than put them into a landfill. The sheer volume of floppy disks we get in has really surprised me, it's sometimes a 1,000 disks a day.\"<br/> <br/>\n",

Sid Shuman, senior director of content communications at Sony Interactive, asked Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at Sony, whether games for the original PSVR could be played on a PSVR2 kit on the <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/09/16/official-playstation-podcast-episode-439-virtual-impressions/\">Official PlayStation Podcast, episode 439</a> (his answer starts at 29:12). \"PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2 because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience,\" Nishino said. Nishino listed several \"much more advanced features\" in the VR2, including new controllers with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, advanced eye tracking, and 3D audio. \"That means developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR.\"\n",
       " <br/> <br/>\n",
       " While the answer was emphatic -- not compatible -- and closed off any hope fans might have harbored, Nishino's checklist of new VR2 features didn't clearly explain why the system would be incapable of running less-advanced VR1 games. Consider the Oculus Rift S, which touted an entirely different eye tracking system than its predecessor, the original Oculus Rift. The Rift S maintained compatibility with games built for any Rift system (along with some games for other headsets). It was a seamless transition for those who upgraded their Rift or bought into VR at a later stage. It's also a disappointing outcome for some great games that were available only on PlayStation VR. Those include the original Mario-caliber Astro Bot, brain-twisting puzzle-game Statik, the VR mode for Resident Evil 7 that never saw release on any other system, first-party VR exclusive Blood &amp; Truth, and a VR mode for WipEout that could only benefit from a VR2 headset.</i><br/>\n",

According to TechCrunch, all that's left is \"selecting a mobile network partner to bring it to market here in the States.\" From the report: <i> Lynk demonstrated a direct satellite-to-phone (and back) emergency connectivity service late last year with its test orbital cell tower. Far from an orbital broadband connection or a legacy satellite band that has you pointing your phone at an invisible dot in the sky, Lynk would provide intermittent (think every half hour or so) 2-way SMS service via ordinary cellular bands that just happen to reach orbit. It's intended for emergencies, check-ins from the back country, and spreading information in places where networks are down, such as disaster zones.\n",

That's not just because they have the best facilities -- the FCC approval process is also the de facto battleground where companies attempt to run interference on one another. [...] Today's order approves Lynk's satellite services to operate in general, having showed that they will not interfere with other services, radio bands, and so on.

TechCrunch reports: <i> The experiment was performed back in May by Nanoracks and its parent company Voyager Space, after getting to orbit aboard the SpaceX Transporter 5 launch. The company only recently released additional details on Friday. The goal of Outpost Mars Demo-1 mission was to cut a piece of corrosion-resistant metal, similar to the outer shell of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur and common in space debris, using a technique called friction milling. Welding and metal-cutting is a messy operation on Earth, but all of that dust and debris simply falls to the ground. But \"when you're in space, in the vacuum, it doesn't really do that. It doesn't just float away necessarily either,\" Marshall Smith, Nanoracks' senior VP of space systems, explained to TechCrunch back in May. \"What you want to do is to contain this debris, not necessarily because it might be a micrometeorites issue, which it could be as well, but mostly because you want to keep your work environment clean.\"\n",
       " <br/> <br/>\n",
       " The entire demonstration lasted around one minute. The main goal -- to cut a single small sample of the steel -- was successfully completed. Inside the spacecraft were two additional samples to cut as a \"reach goal,\" and Nanoracks is investigating why they weren't cut as well. It was conducted in partnership with Maxar Technologies, who developed the robotic arm that executed the cut. That arm used a commercially available friction milling end-effector, and the entire structure was contained in the Outpost spacecraft to ensure that no debris escaped. Indeed, one of the main goals of the demonstration was to produce no debris -- and it worked. Nanoracks used a type of metal similar to an upper stage of a rocket precisely because the company's long-term goal is to modify used upper stages and convert them into orbital platforms, or what it calls \"outposts.\" According to Smith, this is just the beginning. In the future, Nanoracks will attempt cuts on a larger scale in its quest to eventually conduct larger construction efforts. </i><br/>\n",

Alstom dubbed the new train \"the TGV of the future.\" TGV stands for Train a Grand Vitesse, meaning high-speed train. This swanky new design will premiere on the Paris rail network in 2024 and across the country over the following 10 years.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>\n",
       " TGV is one of the world's most famous high-speed train brands and has been a staple of European rail travel since the early 1980s. Back in 2018, SNCF, the state-owned French railway company which controls TGV, ordered 100 TGV M trains (also known as Avelia Horizon trains) at a cost of 2.7 billion euros (around $2.7 billion). An additional 15 trains were ordered in August 2022. The majority of the trains will operate within France, but Alstom has said 15 will ride the rails internationally. TGV M will operate at the same maximum speed as the previous generation of TGV trains -- 350 kilometers per hour (nearly 220 mph). \"In 2022, we don't want to go faster,\" said Alstom spokesperson Philippe Molitor told CNN Travel, explaining that the goal instead is high speed trains that accommodate more people while consuming less energy.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>\n",
       " TGV M trains don't just have 40.5-centimeter (15.9-inch) longer noses than their predecessors, they're bigger all round. Roomier carriage interiors can accommodate up to 740 seats, compared to the current maximum of 634. TGV Ms also got what manufacturer Alstom calls \"unprecedented modularity,\" meaning the train's interior configuration can be easily adjusted. A carriage can be converted from second class to first class and back again, or adapted to allow space for oversized luggage or bikes. There will also be dedicated on-board passenger social areas to offer variation and flexibility on longer journeys.\n",
       " According to Alstom, the design improves TGV's current energy efficiency and carbon footprint, with 97% of the train's components now recyclable. It also boasts better accessibility -- there will be a lifting platform to allow wheelchair users to independently board the train, and an on-board sound system to aid visually impaired travelers. Larger windows will make the most of views while the TGV's lighting will adapt depending on natural light outside.</i><br/>\n",

The Wall Street Journal reports: <i> Intellia said Friday that one of its treatments, code-named NTLA-2002, significantly reduced levels of a protein that causes periodic attacks of swelling in six patients with a rare genetic disease called hereditary angioedema, or HAE. In a separate study building on previously released trial data, Intellia's treatment NTLA-2001 reduced a disease-causing protein by more than 90% in 12 people with transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, a genetic disease that can lead to heart failure.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>\n",
       " Despite the positive results, questions remain about whether therapies based on Crispr will work safely and effectively, analysts said. Intellia's latest studies involved a small number of patients, and were disclosed in news releases and haven't been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The NTLA-2002 study results were presented at the Bradykinin Symposium in Berlin, a medical meeting focused on angioedema. The data came from small, so-called Phase 1 studies conducted in New Zealand and the U.K. that didn't include control groups. Results from such early studies can be unreliable predictors of a drug's safety and effectiveness once the compound is tested in larger numbers of patients. The findings, nevertheless, add to preliminary but promising evidence of the potential for drugs based on the gene-editing technology. Last year, Intellia said that NTLA-2001 reduced the disease-causing protein involved in ATTR patients. </i>\n",

Its trailer describes it as \"an illegal comic book movie,\" but its creators more seriously defend it as an unauthorized but legal parody of DC\\'s original character, to the point of (apparently) giving their lawyer a full-screen credit.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            I have no idea if\\n            <em>\\n             The People\\'s Joker\\n            </em>\\n            is a good movie — thanks to its cancelation, my colleague Andrew Webster couldn\\'t catch it at TIFF. The piece is clearly a provocation designed to thumb its nose at DC\\'s copyright, and DC parent company Warner Bros. hasn\\'t said whether it actually ordered TIFF to cancel showings — it\\'s possible the festival balked or even that Drew did it herself. But despite all that, one thing is very clear: outside a tiny number of corporate behemoths, virtually nobody benefits from shutting down\\n            <em>\\n             The People\\'s Joker\\n            </em>\\n            — not the filmmakers, not the public, and not the people who created Gotham City in the first place.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Writer-director Vera Drew\\n            <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/inside-the-peoples-joker-the-unauthorized-batman-movie-warner-bros-doesnt-want-you-to-see\">\\n             says she made\\n             <em>\\n              The People\\'s Joker\\n             </em>\\n            </a>\\n            partly to test a contemporary truism: that beloved fictional universes are a shared modern mythology, and people draw meaning from them the way that artists once reinterpreted Greek myths or painted Biblical figures. As Drew has put it, \"if the purpose of myth is to learn about the human experience and grow and also chart your progress — the hero\\'s journey and all that stuff — let\\'s actually do that earnestly with these characters.\"\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n           The essay delves into the argument that culture exists for the common good.  \"It\\'s useful to have a temporary period where artists can maintain control over their work because it helps support them financially and encourages them to make more of it. But the ultimate goal is that art should pass into the public domain and that it should be part of a conversation, with people repurposing it to create their own work....\"\\n           <br/>\\n           <br/>\\n           In\\n           <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/peoples-joker-director-dc-parody-promises-future-screenings/\">\\n            an interview with\\n            <em>\\n             Comic Book Resources\\n            </em>\\n           </a>\\n           , the filmmaker said the film was protected by both fair use and copyright law.  \"The only thing that makes it weird in both of those categories is nobody\\'s ever taken characters and IP and really personalized it in this way.

Long-time tech pundit Robert X. Cringely predicted that Apple would first offer some limited satellite-based functionality,\\n           <br/>\\n           <br/>\\n           But he\\'d also called those services \"proxies for Apple entering —\\n           <a href=\"https://www.cringely.com/2022/06/03/apples-space-ambitions-are-real/\">\\n            and then dominating — the Internet of Things (IoT) business\\n           </a>\\n           .   \"After all, iPhones will give them 1.6 billion points of presence for AirTag detection even on sailboats in the middle of the ocean — or on the South Pole.... Ubiquity (being able to track anything in near real time anywhere on the planet) signals the maturity of IoT, turning it quickly into a $1 TRILLION business — in this case Apple\\'s $1 TRILLION business.\"  And beyond that, \"in the longer run Cupertino plans to dis-intermediate the mobile carriers — becoming themselves a satellite-based global phone and data company [and] they will also compete with  satellite Internet providers like Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon\\'s Kuiper.\"\\n           <br/>\\n           <br/>\\n           So how did Cringely react last week when Apple\\n           <a href=\"https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/22/09/07/1812213/the-iphone-14-and-14-plus-are-official-with-satellite-based-emergency-sos\">\\n            announced  \"Emergency SOS\" messaging for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus\\n           </a>\\n           — via communication satellites — when their users are out of range of a cell signals? He began by\\n           <a href=\"https://www.cringely.com/2022/09/08/what-yesterdays-apple-satellite-announcement-really-means/\">\\n            wondering if Apple was intentionally downplaying the satellite features\\n           </a>\\n           :\\n           <i>\\n            They limited their usage case to emergency SOS texts in the USA and Canada,\\n            <em>\\n             sorta\\n            </em>\\n            said it would be just for iPhone 14s, and be free for only the first two years. They showed a satellite app and very deliberately tried to make it look difficult to use. They gave no technical details and there was no talk of industry partners.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Yet there were hints of what\\'s to come. We (you and I, based on\\n            <a href=\"https://www.cringely.com/2022/06/03/apples-space-ambitions-are-real/\">\\n             my previous column\\n            </a>\\n            ) already knew, for example, that ANY iPhone can be made to work with Globalstar. We also knew the deal was with\\n            <em>\\n             Globalstar\\n            </em>\\n            , which Apple never mentioned but Globalstar confirmed, more or less, later in the day in an SEC filing. But Apple DID mention Find My and Air Tags, notably saying they\\'d work through the satellites even without having to first beseech the sky with an app. So the app is less than it seems and Apple\\'s satellite network will quickly find its use for the Internet of Things [Cringely predicts]....\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Apple very specifically said nothing about the global reach of Find My and Air Tags.\\n            <em>\\n             There is no reason why those services can\\'t have immediate global satellite support, given that the notification system is entirely within Apple\\'s ecosystem and is not dependent on 911-type public safety agreements.\\n            </em>\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Maybe it will take a couple years to cover the world with SOS, but not for Find My, which means not for IoT — a business headed fast toward $1 trillion and will therefore [hypothetically] have a near-immediate impact on Apple\\'s bottom line.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n           Speculating further, Cringely predicts that Globalstar — which has ended up with vast tracts of licensed spectrum — will eventually be purchased by a larger company.  (\"If not Apple, maybe Elon Musk.\")\\n           <br/>\\n           <br/>\\n           And this leads Cringely to yet another prediction.  \"If Elon can\\'t get Globalstar, he and his partners will push for the regulatory expansion into space of terrestrial 5G licenses,\\n           <em>\\n            which will probably be successful\\n           </em>\\n           .\"\\n           <i>\\n            This will happen, frankly, whether SpaceX and T-Mobile are successful or not, because\\n            <a href=\"https://ast-science.com/\">\\n             AST&amp;Science\\n            </a>\\n            and its investors AT&amp;T, Verizon and Zodafone need 5G in space, too, to compete with Apple. So there WILL eventually be satellite competition for Apple and I think the International Telecommunication Union  will eventually succumb to industry pressure.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n           And by the end Cringely is also speculating about just how Apple will come up with innovative new satellite designs on a faster schedule...\\n           <br/>\\n          </div>\\n         </div>\\n         <aside class=\"novote\">\\n         </aside>\\n         <footer class=\"clearfix meta article-foot\">\\n          <div class=\"story-controls\">\\n          </div>\\n          <div class=\"story-tags\">\\n           <span class=\"tright tags\">\\n            <menu class=\"edit-bar\" type=\"toolbar\">\\n             <span class=\"tag-bar none\" id=\"tagbar-166234283\">\\n              <a class=\"topic tag\" href=\"//slashdot.org/tag/\" rel=\"statictag\" target=\"_blank\">\\n              </a>\\n             </span>\\n             <!--\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"edit-toggle\" href=\"/my/login/\" onclick=\"show_login_box();return false;\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\"icon-tag btn collapse\"></span>\\n\\t\\t\\t</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t-->\\n             <div class=\"tag-menu\">\\n              <input class=\"tag-entry default\" type=\"text\" value=\"apply tags\"/>\\n             </div>\\n            </menu>\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </footer>\\n        </article>\\n        <article class=\"fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24\" data-fhid=\"166245513\" data-fhtype=\"story\" id=\"firehose-166245513\">\\n         <span class=\"sd-info-block\" style=\"display: none\">\\n          <span class=\"sd-key-firehose-id\">\\n           166245513\\n          </span>\\n          <span class=\"type\">\\n           story\\n          </span>\\n         </span>\\n         <header>\\n          <span class=\"topic\" id=\"topic-166245513\">\\n           <a href=\"//slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=ai\" onclick=\"return addfhfilter(\\'ai\\');\">\\n            <img alt=\"AI\" height=\"64\" src=\"//a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/ai_64.png\" title=\"AI\" width=\"64\"/>\\n           </a>\\n          </span>\\n          <h2 class=\"story\">\\n           <span class=\"story-title\" id=\"title-166245513\">\\n            <a href=\"//slashdot.org/story/22/09/17/1917222/will-ai-really-perform-transformative-disruptive-miracles\" onclick=\"return toggle_fh_body_wrap_return(this);\">\\n             Will AI Really Perform Transformative, Disruptive Miracles?\\n            </a>\\n            <span class=\"no extlnk\">\\n             <a class=\"story-sourcelnk\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/artificial-intelligence-machine-learing-natural-language-processing/661401/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link -

He argues that GPT-3\\'s 175 billion parameters give it interpretive power \"far beyond human understanding, far beyond what our little animal brains can comprehend. Machine learning has capacities that are real, but which transcend human understanding: the definition of magic.\"\\n           <br/>\\n           <br/>\\n           But despite being a technology where inscrutability \"is an industrial by-product of the process,\" we may still not see what\\'s coming, Marche argue — that AI is \"every bit as important and transformative as the other great tech disruptions, but more obscure, tucked largely out of view.\"\\n           <i>\\n            Science fiction, and our own imagination, add to the confusion. We just can\\'t help thinking of AI in terms of the technologies depicted in Ex Machina, Her, or Blade Runner — people-machines that remain pure fantasy. Then there\\'s the distortion of Silicon Valley hype, the general fake-it-\\'til-you-make-it atmosphere that gave the world WeWork and Theranos: People who want to sound cutting-edge end up calling any automated process \"artificial intelligence.\" And at the bottom of all of this bewilderment sits the mystery inherent to the technology itself, its direct thrust at the unfathomable. The most advanced NLP programs operate at a level that not even the engineers constructing them fully understand.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            But the confusion surrounding the miracles of AI doesn\\'t mean that the miracles aren\\'t happening. It just means that they won\\'t look how anybody has imagined them. Arthur C. Clarke famously said that \"technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.\" Magic is coming, and it\\'s coming for all of us....\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            And if AI harnesses the power promised by quantum computing, everything I\\'m describing here would be the first dulcet breezes of a hurricane. Ersatz humans are going to be one of the least interesting aspects of the new technology. This is not an inhuman intelligence but an inhuman capacity for digital intelligence. An artificial general intelligence will probably look more like a whole series of exponentially improving tools than a single thing. It will be a whole series of increasingly powerful and semi-invisible assistants, a whole series of increasingly powerful and semi-invisible surveillance states, a whole series of increasingly powerful and semi-invisible weapons systems.  The world would change; we shouldn\\'t expect it to change in any kind of way that you would recognize.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Our AI future will be weird and sublime and perhaps we won\\'t even notice it happening to us. The paragraph above was composed by GPT-3. I wrote up to \"And if AI harnesses the power promised by quantum computing\"; machines did the rest.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Stephen Hawking once said that \"the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\" Experts in AI, even the men and women building it, commonly describe the technology as an existential threat.  But we are shockingly bad at predicting the long-term effects of technology. (Remember when everybody believed that the internet was going to\\n            <em>\\n             improve\\n            </em>\\n            the quality of information in the world?) So perhaps, in the case of artificial intelligence, fear is as misplaced as that earlier optimism was.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            AI is not the beginning of the world, nor the end. It\\'s a continuation. The imagination tends to be utopian or dystopian, but the future is human — an extension of what we already are....  Artificial intelligence is returning us, through the most advanced technology, to somewhere primitive, original: an encounter with the permanent incompleteness of consciousness....

Other services include disk transfers, a recycling program, and selling used and/or broken floppy disks to artists around the world. All of this makes floppydisk.com a key player in the small yet profitable contemporary floppy scene....\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            <strong>\\n             Perkins:\\n            </strong>\\n            I was actually in the floppy disk duplication business. Not in a million years did I think I would ever sell blank floppy disks. Duplicating disks in the 1980s and early 1990s was as good as printing money. It was unbelievably profitable. I only started selling blank copies organically over time. You could still go down to any office supply store, or any computer store to buy them. Why would you try to find me, when you could just buy disks off the shelf? But then these larger companies stopped carrying them or went out of business and people came to us. So here I am, a small company with a floppy disk inventory, and I find myself to be a worldwide supplier of this product. My business, which used to be 90% CD and DVD duplication, is now 90% selling blank floppy disks. It\\'s shocking to me....\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            <strong>\\n             Q:  Where does this focus on floppy disks come from? Why not work with another medium...?\\n            </strong>\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            <strong>\\n             Perkins:\\n            </strong>\\n            When people ask me: \"Why are you into floppy disks today?\" the answer is: \"Because I forgot to get out of the business.\"  Everybody else in the world looked at the future and came to the conclusion that this was a dying industry. Because I\\'d already bought all my equipment and inventory, I thought I\\'d just keep this revenue stream. I stuck with it and didn\\'t try to expand. Over time, the total number of floppy users has gone down. However, the number of people who provided the product went down even faster. If you look at those two curves, you see that there is a growing market share for the last man standing in the business, and that man is me....\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            I made the decision to buy a large quantity, a couple of million disks, and we\\'ve basically been living off of that inventory ever since.  From time to time, we get very lucky. About two years ago a guy called me up and said: \"My grandfather has all this floppy junk in the garage and I want it out. Will you take it?\" Of course I wanted to take it off his hands. So, we went back and forth and negotiated a fair price. Without going into specifics, he ended up with two things that he wanted: an empty garage and a sum of money. I ended up with around 50,000 floppy disks and that\\'s a good deal.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n           In the interview Perkins reveals he has around half a million floppy disks in stock — 3.5-inch, 5.25-inch, 8-inch, \"and some rather rare diskettes.   Another thing that happened organically was the start of our floppy disk recycling service. We give people the opportunity to send us floppy disks and we recycle them, rather than put them into a landfill. The sheer volume of floppy disks we get in has really surprised me, it\\'s sometimes a 1,000 disks a day.\"\\n           <br/>\\n           <br/>\\n           But he also estimates its use is more widespread than we realize.  \"Probably half of the air fleet in the world today is more than 20 years old and still uses floppy disks in some of the avionics.

It would be sad if this publication were not made simply because of the lack of funds (which some people would see as a lack of interest) necessary to complete it.\"  But that\\'s how things seemed to end up  — until Satchell suddenly reappeared to share this update from 2022:\\n           <i>\\n            When I was released from my last job, I tried retirement. Wasn\\'t for me. I started going crazy with nothing significant to do. So, going through old hard drives (that\\'s another story), I found the original manuscript files, plus the page proof files, for that two-decade-old book. Aha! Maybe it\\'s time for an update. But how to keep it fresh, as Torvalds continues to release new updates of the Linux kernel?\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Publish it on the Web. Carefully.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            After four months (and three job interviews) I have the beginnings of the second edition up and available for reading. At the moment it\\'s an updated, corrected, and expanded version of the \"gray matter\", the exposition portions of the first edition....\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            The URL for the alpha-beta version of this Web book is\\n            <a href=\"https://www.satchell.net/ipstacks/\">\\n             satchell.net/ipstacks\\n            </a>\\n            for your reading pleasure. The companion e-mail address is up and running for you to provide feedback. There is no paywall.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n           But there\\'s also an ingenious solution to the problem of updating the text as the code of the kernel keeps changing:\\n           <i>\\n            Thanks to the work of Professor Donald Knuth (thank you!) on his WEB and CWEB programming languages, I have made modifications, to devise a method for integrating code from the GIT repository of the Linux kernel without making any modifications (let alone submissions) to said kernel code. The proposed method is described in the About section of the Web book. I have scaffolded the process and it works. But that\\'s not the hard part.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            The hard part is to write the commentary itself, and crib some kind of Markup language to make the commentary publishing quality. The programs I write will integrate the kernel code with the commentary verbiage into a set of Web pages. Or two slightly different sets of web pages, if I want to support a mobile-friendly version of the commentary.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Another reason for making it a web book is that I can write it and publish it as it comes out of my virtual typewriter. No hard deadlines. No waiting for the printers. And while this can save trees, that\\'s not my intent.  The back-of-the-napkin schedule calls for me to to finish the expository text in September, start the Python coding for generating commentary pages at the same time, and start the writing the commentary on the Internet Control Message Protocol in October. By then, Linus should have version 6.0.0 of the Linux kernel released.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            I really, really, really don\\'t want to charge readers to view the web book. Especially as it\\'s still in the virtual typewriter. There isn\\'t any commentary (yet). One thing I have done is to make it as mobile-friendly as I can, because I suspect the target audience will want to read this on a smartphone or tablet, and not be forced to resort to a large-screen laptop or desktop. Also, the graphics are lightweight to minimize the cost for people who pay by the kilopacket. (Does anywhere in the world still do this? Inquiring minds want to know.)\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            I host this web site on a Protectli appliance in my apartment, so I don\\'t have that continuing expense. The power draw is around 20 watts.

Sid Shuman, senior director of content communications at Sony Interactive, asked Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at Sony, whether games for the original PSVR could be played on a PSVR2 kit on the\\n            <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/09/16/official-playstation-podcast-episode-439-virtual-impressions/\">\\n             Official PlayStation Podcast, episode 439\\n            </a>\\n            (his answer starts at 29:12). \"PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2 because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience,\" Nishino said. Nishino listed several \"much more advanced features\" in the VR2, including new controllers with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, advanced eye tracking, and 3D audio. \"That means developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR.\"\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            While the answer was emphatic -- not compatible -- and closed off any hope fans might have harbored, Nishino\\'s checklist of new VR2 features didn\\'t clearly explain why the system would be incapable of running less-advanced VR1 games. Consider the Oculus Rift S, which touted an entirely different eye tracking system than its predecessor, the original Oculus Rift. The Rift S maintained compatibility with games built for any Rift system (along with some games for other headsets). It was a seamless transition for those who upgraded their Rift or bought into VR at a later stage. It\\'s also a disappointing outcome for some great games that were available only on PlayStation VR.

According to TechCrunch, all that\\'s left is \"selecting a mobile network partner to bring it to market here in the States.\" From the report:\\n           <i>\\n            Lynk demonstrated a direct satellite-to-phone (and back) emergency connectivity service late last year with its test orbital cell tower. Far from an orbital broadband connection or a legacy satellite band that has you pointing your phone at an invisible dot in the sky, Lynk would provide intermittent (think every half hour or so) 2-way SMS service via ordinary cellular bands that just happen to reach orbit. It\\'s intended for emergencies, check-ins from the back country, and spreading information in places where networks are down, such as disaster zones.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            It\\'s not easy to send a text to or from an antenna moving several thousand miles per hour, and CEO Charles Miller confirmed that it took a few years for them to make it happen. So when major companies say they\\'re working on it, he doesn\\'t feel too much heat. \"That\\'s the benefit of having invented the tech five years ago: There\\'s a bunch of hard things that no one else has done yet. I\\'m not saying they can\\'t, just that they haven\\'t yet,\" he told me. \"We validated this and patented it in 2017. We did it from space yesterday and the day before -- we have the world\\'s only active cell tower in space.\"\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Of course, you could have a thousand of them and it wouldn\\'t matter unless you have regulatory approval and partners in the mobile space. That\\'s the next step for Lynk, and although they have 15 contracts spanning 36 countries around the world and are preparing for commercial launch, the United States FCC is the \"gold standard\" for this kind of testing and validation. That\\'s not just because they have the best facilities -- the FCC approval process is also the de facto battleground where companies attempt to run interference on one another. [...] Today\\'s order approves Lynk\\'s satellite services to operate in general, having showed that they will not interfere with other services, radio bands, and so on. A separate approval will be needed when Lynk finds a partner to go to market with -- but the more difficult and drawn out question of safety and interference is already answered.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n          </div>\\n         </div>\\n         <aside class=\"novote\">\\n         </aside>\\n         <footer class=\"clearfix meta article-foot\">\\n          <div class=\"story-controls\">\\n          </div>\\n          <div class=\"story-tags\">\\n           <span class=\"tright tags\">\\n            <menu class=\"edit-bar\" type=\"toolbar\">\\n             <span class=\"tag-bar none\" id=\"tagbar-166232129\">\\n              <a class=\"topic tag\" href=\"//slashdot.org/tag/\" rel=\"statictag\" target=\"_blank\">\\n              </a>\\n             </span>\\n             <!--\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"edit-toggle\" href=\"/my/login/\" onclick=\"show_login_box();return false;\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\"icon-tag btn collapse\"></span>\\n\\t\\t\\t</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t-->\\n             <div class=\"tag-menu\">\\n              <input class=\"tag-entry default\" type=\"text\" value=\"apply tags\"/>\\n             </div>\\n            </menu>\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </footer>\\n        </article>\\n        <article class=\"fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24\" data-fhid=\"166232055\" data-fhtype=\"story\" id=\"firehose-166232055\">\\n         <span class=\"sd-info-block\" style=\"display: none\">\\n          <span class=\"sd-key-firehose-id\">\\n           166232055\\n          </span>\\n          <span class=\"type\">\\n           story\\n          </span>\\n         </span>\\n         <header>\\n          <span class=\"topic\" id=\"topic-166232055\">\\n           <a href=\"//slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=space\" onclick=\"return addfhfilter(\\'space\\');\">\\n            <img alt=\"Space\" height=\"64\" src=\"//a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/space_64.png\" title=\"Space\" width=\"64\"/>\\n           </a>\\n          </span>\\n          <h2 class=\"story\">\\n           <span class=\"story-title\" id=\"title-166232055\">\\n            <a href=\"//science.slashdot.org/story/22/09/16/2226205/nanoracks-cut-a-piece-of-metal-in-space-for-the-first-time\" onclick=\"return toggle_fh_body_wrap_return(this);\">\\n             Nanoracks Cut a Piece of Metal In Space For the First Time\\n            </a>\\n            <span class=\"no extlnk\">\\n             <a class=\"story-sourcelnk\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/16/nanoracks-metal-cutting/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link - https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/16/nanoracks-metal-cutting/\">\\n              (techcrunch.com)\\n             </a>\\n            </span>\\n           </span>\\n           <!--<span class=\"comments commentcnt-166232055\" >17</span>-->\\n           <!-- comment bubble -->\\n           <span class=\"comment-bubble\">\\n            <a href=\"//science.slashdot.org/story/22/09/16/2226205/nanoracks-cut-a-piece-of-metal-in-space-for-the-first-time#comments\" title=\"\">\\n             17\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n          </h2>\\n          <div class=\"details\" id=\"details-166232055\">\\n           <span class=\"story-details\">\\n            <span class=\"story-views\">\\n             <span class=\"sodify\" onclick=\"firehose_set_options(\\'color\\', \\'red\\')\" title=\"Filter Firehose to entries rated red or better\">\\n             </span>\\n             <span alt=\"Popularity\" class=\"icon-beaker pop1\" onclick=\"firehose_set_options(\\'color\\', \\'red\\')\" title=\"Filter Firehose to entries rated red or better\">\\n              <span>\\n              </span>\\n             </span>\\n            </span>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"story-byline\">\\n            Posted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby\\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeauHD\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n             BeauHD\\n            </a>\\n            <time datetime=\"on Saturday September 17, 2022 @03:00AM\" id=\"fhtime-166232055\">\\n             on Saturday September 17, 2022 @03:00AM\\n            </time>\\n            from the\\n            <span class=\"dept-text\">\\n             space-construction\\n            </span>\\n            dept.\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </header>\\n         <div class=\"body\" id=\"fhbody-166232055\">\\n          <div class=\"p\" id=\"text-166232055\">\\n           Nanoracks just made space construction and manufacturing history with the\\n           <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/16/nanoracks-metal-cutting/\">\\n            first demonstration of cutting metal in orbit\\n           </a>\\n           . TechCrunch reports:\\n           <i>\\n            The experiment was performed back in May by Nanoracks and its parent company Voyager Space, after getting to orbit aboard the SpaceX Transporter 5 launch. The company only recently released additional details on Friday. The goal of Outpost Mars Demo-1 mission was to cut a piece of corrosion-resistant metal, similar to the outer shell of United Launch Alliance\\'s Vulcan Centaur and common in space debris, using a technique called friction milling. Welding and metal-cutting is a messy operation on Earth, but all of that dust and debris simply falls to the ground. But \"when you\\'re in space, in the vacuum, it doesn\\'t really do that. It doesn\\'t just float away necessarily either,\" Marshall Smith, Nanoracks\\' senior VP of space systems, explained to TechCrunch back in May. \"What you want to do is to contain this debris, not necessarily because it might be a micrometeorites issue, which it could be as well, but mostly because you want to keep your work environment clean.\"\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            The entire demonstration lasted around one minute. The main goal -- to cut a single small sample of the steel -- was successfully completed. Inside the spacecraft were two additional samples to cut as a \"reach goal,\" and Nanoracks is investigating why they weren\\'t cut as well. It was conducted in partnership with Maxar Technologies, who developed the robotic arm that executed the cut. That arm used a commercially available friction milling end-effector, and the entire structure was contained in the Outpost spacecraft to ensure that no debris escaped. Indeed, one of the main goals of the demonstration was to produce no debris -- and it worked. Nanoracks used a type of metal similar to an upper stage of a rocket precisely because the company\\'s long-term goal is to modify used upper stages and convert them into orbital platforms, or what it calls \"outposts.\" According to Smith, this is just the beginning. In the future, Nanoracks will attempt cuts on a larger scale in its quest to eventually conduct larger construction efforts.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n          </div>\\n         </div>\\n         <aside class=\"novote\">\\n         </aside>\\n         <footer class=\"clearfix meta article-foot\">\\n          <div class=\"story-controls\">\\n          </div>\\n          <div class=\"story-tags\">\\n           <span class=\"tright tags\">\\n            <menu class=\"edit-bar\" type=\"toolbar\">\\n             <span class=\"tag-bar none\" id=\"tagbar-166232055\">\\n             </span>\\n             <!--\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"edit-toggle\" href=\"/my/login/\" onclick=\"show_login_box();return false;\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\"icon-tag btn collapse\"></span>\\n\\t\\t\\t</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t-->\\n             <div class=\"tag-menu\">\\n              <input class=\"tag-entry default\" type=\"text\" value=\"apply tags\"/>\\n             </div>\\n            </menu>\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </footer>\\n        </article>\\n        <article class=\"fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24\" data-fhid=\"166231929\" data-fhtype=\"story\" id=\"firehose-166231929\">\\n         <span class=\"sd-info-block\" style=\"display: none\">\\n          <span class=\"sd-key-firehose-id\">\\n           166231929\\n          </span>\\n          <span class=\"type\">\\n           story\\n          </span>\\n         </span>\\n         <header>\\n          <span class=\"topic\" id=\"topic-166231929\">\\n           <a href=\"//slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=transportation\" onclick=\"return addfhfilter(\\'transportation\\');\">\\n            <img alt=\"Transportation\" height=\"64\" src=\"//a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/transportation_64.png\" title=\"Transportation\" width=\"64\"/>\\n           </a>\\n          </span>\\n          <h2 class=\"story\">\\n           <span class=\"story-title\" id=\"title-166231929\">\\n            <a href=\"//tech.slashdot.org/story/22/09/16/229208/tgv-unveils-high-speed-trains-of-the-future\" onclick=\"return toggle_fh_body_wrap_return(this);\">\\n             TGV Unveils High-Speed Trains of the Future\\n            </a>\\n            <span class=\"no extlnk\">\\n             <a class=\"story-sourcelnk\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/tgv-m-next-generation-high-speed-train-france/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link - https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/tgv-m-next-generation-high-speed-train-france/index.html\">\\n              (cnn.com)\\n             </a>\\n            </span>\\n           </span>\\n           <!--<span class=\"comments commentcnt-166231929\" >87</span>-->\\n           <!-- comment bubble -->\\n           <span class=\"comment-bubble\">\\n            <a href=\"//tech.slashdot.org/story/22/09/16/229208/tgv-unveils-high-speed-trains-of-the-future#comments\" title=\"\">\\n             87\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n          </h2>\\n          <div class=\"details\" id=\"details-166231929\">\\n           <span class=\"story-details\">\\n            <span class=\"story-views\">\\n             <span class=\"sodify\" onclick=\"firehose_set_options(\\'color\\', \\'red\\')\" title=\"Filter Firehose to entries rated red or better\">\\n             </span>\\n             <span alt=\"Popularity\" class=\"icon-beaker pop1\" onclick=\"firehose_set_options(\\'color\\', \\'red\\')\" title=\"Filter Firehose to entries rated red or better\">\\n              <span>\\n              </span>\\n             </span>\\n            </span>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"story-byline\">\\n            Posted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby\\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeauHD\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n             BeauHD\\n            </a>\\n            <time datetime=\"on Friday September 16, 2022 @11:30PM\" id=\"fhtime-166231929\">\\n             on Friday September 16, 2022 @11:30PM\\n            </time>\\n            from the\\n            <span class=\"dept-text\">\\n             bigger-and-better\\n            </span>\\n            dept.\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </header>\\n         <div class=\"body\" id=\"fhbody-166231929\">\\n          <div class=\"p\" id=\"text-166231929\">\\n           An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNN:\\n           <i>\\n            French railway company SNCF and train manufacturer Alstom have\\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/tgv-m-next-generation-high-speed-train-france/index.html\">\\n             unveiled the first completed TGV M\\n            </a>\\n            , a next-generation high-speed double-decker train that features a longer, more aerodynamic nose -- perfect for hurtling across the French countryside. Alstom dubbed the new train \"the TGV of the future.\" TGV stands for Train a Grand Vitesse, meaning high-speed train. This swanky new design will premiere on the Paris rail network in 2024 and across the country over the following 10 years.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            TGV is one of the world\\'s most famous high-speed train brands and has been a staple of European rail travel since the early 1980s. Back in 2018, SNCF, the state-owned French railway company which controls TGV, ordered 100 TGV M trains (also known as Avelia Horizon trains) at a cost of 2.7 billion euros (around $2.7 billion). An additional 15 trains were ordered in August 2022. The majority of the trains will operate within France, but Alstom has said 15 will ride the rails internationally. TGV M will operate at the same maximum speed as the previous generation of TGV trains -- 350 kilometers per hour (nearly 220 mph). \"In 2022, we don\\'t want to go faster,\" said Alstom spokesperson Philippe Molitor told CNN Travel, explaining that the goal instead is high speed trains that accommodate more people while consuming less energy.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            TGV M trains don\\'t just have 40.5-centimeter (15.9-inch) longer noses than their predecessors, they\\'re bigger all round. Roomier carriage interiors can accommodate up to 740 seats, compared to the current maximum of 634. TGV Ms also got what manufacturer Alstom calls \"unprecedented modularity,\" meaning the train\\'s interior configuration can be easily adjusted. A carriage can be converted from second class to first class and back again, or adapted to allow space for oversized luggage or bikes. There will also be dedicated on-board passenger social areas to offer variation and flexibility on longer journeys.\\nAccording to Alstom, the design improves TGV\\'s current energy efficiency and carbon footprint, with 97% of the train\\'s components now recyclable. It also boasts better accessibility -- there will be a lifting platform to allow wheelchair users to independently board the train, and an on-board sound system to aid visually impaired travelers. Larger windows will make the most of views while the TGV\\'s lighting will adapt depending on natural light outside.\\n           </i>\\n           <br/>\\n          </div>\\n         </div>\\n         <aside class=\"novote\">\\n         </aside>\\n         <footer class=\"clearfix meta article-foot\">\\n          <div class=\"story-controls\">\\n          </div>\\n          <div class=\"story-tags\">\\n           <span class=\"tright tags\">\\n            <menu class=\"edit-bar\" type=\"toolbar\">\\n             <span class=\"tag-bar none\" id=\"tagbar-166231929\">\\n             </span>\\n             <!--\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"edit-toggle\" href=\"/my/login/\" onclick=\"show_login_box();return false;\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\"icon-tag btn collapse\"></span>\\n\\t\\t\\t</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t-->\\n             <div class=\"tag-menu\">\\n              <input class=\"tag-entry default\" type=\"text\" value=\"apply tags\"/>\\n             </div>\\n            </menu>\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </footer>\\n        </article>\\n        <article class=\"fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24\" data-fhid=\"166231957\" data-fhtype=\"story\" id=\"firehose-166231957\">\\n         <span class=\"sd-info-block\" style=\"display: none\">\\n          <span class=\"sd-key-firehose-id\">\\n           166231957\\n          </span>\\n          <span class=\"type\">\\n           story\\n          </span>\\n         </span>\\n         <header>\\n          <span class=\"topic\" id=\"topic-166231957\">\\n           <a href=\"//slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=biotech\" onclick=\"return addfhfilter(\\'biotech\\');\">\\n            <img alt=\"Biotech\" height=\"64\" src=\"//a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/biotech_64.png\" title=\"Biotech\" width=\"64\"/>\\n           </a>\\n          </span>\\n          <h2 class=\"story\">\\n           <span class=\"story-title\" id=\"title-166231957\">\\n            <a href=\"//science.slashdot.org/story/22/09/16/2213212/crispr-gene-editing-drugs-show-promise-in-preliminary-study\" onclick=\"return toggle_fh_body_wrap_return(this);\">\\n             Crispr Gene-Editing Drugs Show Promise In Preliminary Study\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <!--<span class=\"comments commentcnt-166231957\" >23</span>-->\\n           <!-- comment bubble -->\\n           <span class=\"comment-bubble\">\\n            <a href=\"//science.slashdot.org/story/22/09/16/2213212/crispr-gene-editing-drugs-show-promise-in-preliminary-study#comments\" title=\"\">\\n             23\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n          </h2>\\n          <div class=\"details\" id=\"details-166231957\">\\n           <span class=\"story-details\">\\n            <span class=\"story-views\">\\n             <span class=\"sodify\" onclick=\"firehose_set_options(\\'color\\', \\'red\\')\" title=\"Filter Firehose to entries rated red or better\">\\n             </span>\\n             <span alt=\"Popularity\" class=\"icon-beaker pop1\" onclick=\"firehose_set_options(\\'color\\', \\'red\\')\" title=\"Filter Firehose to entries rated red or better\">\\n              <span>\\n              </span>\\n             </span>\\n            </span>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"story-byline\">\\n            Posted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby\\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeauHD\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n             BeauHD\\n            </a>\\n            <time datetime=\"on Friday September 16, 2022 @10:02PM\" id=\"fhtime-166231957\">\\n             on Friday September 16, 2022 @10:02PM\\n            </time>\\n            from the\\n            <span class=\"dept-text\">\\n             pathbreaking-technology\\n            </span>\\n            dept.\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </header>\\n         <div class=\"body\" id=\"fhbody-166231957\">\\n          <div class=\"p\" id=\"text-166231957\">\\n           Intellia Therapeutics\\n           <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/crispr-gene-editing-drugs-show-promise-in-preliminary-study-11663327063\">\\n            reported encouraging early-stage study results for its Crispr gene-editing treatments\\n           </a>\\n           , the latest sign that the pathbreaking technology could result in commercially available drugs in the coming years. The Wall Street Journal reports:\\n           <i>\\n            Intellia said Friday that one of its treatments, code-named NTLA-2002, significantly reduced levels of a protein that causes periodic attacks of swelling in six patients with a rare genetic disease called hereditary angioedema, or HAE. In a separate study building on previously released trial data, Intellia\\'s treatment NTLA-2001 reduced a disease-causing protein by more than 90% in 12 people with transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, a genetic disease that can lead to heart failure.\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            Despite the positive results, questions remain about whether therapies based on Crispr will work safely and effectively, analysts said. Intellia\\'s latest studies involved a small number of patients, and were disclosed in news releases and haven\\'t been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The NTLA-2002 study results were presented at the Bradykinin Symposium in Berlin, a medical meeting focused on angioedema. The data came from small, so-called Phase 1 studies conducted in New Zealand and the U.K. that didn\\'t include control groups. Results from such early studies can be unreliable predictors of a drug\\'s safety and effectiveness once the compound is tested in larger numbers of patients. The findings, nevertheless, add to preliminary but promising evidence of the potential for drugs based on the gene-editing technology. Last year, Intellia said that NTLA-2001 reduced the disease-causing protein involved in ATTR patients.\\n           </i>\\n          </div>\\n         </div>\\n         <aside class=\"novote\">\\n
