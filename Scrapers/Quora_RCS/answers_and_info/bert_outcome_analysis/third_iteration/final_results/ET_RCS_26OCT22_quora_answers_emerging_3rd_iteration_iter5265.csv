This board measures 112mm x 176mm. So why not use wireless connections rather than wires? Well, using wireless connections across a small board is so ridiculous, it’s hardly worth replying to… except, clearly, lots of people have no clue about how computer system work.

When somone has done a heroic deed they will be remebered for that deed, not for what happens after.

3,"I feel your pain, Robert. Hopefully that project of yours was very short. To add my 2 cents typical “enlightenment” when working with node looks like this…First you get most fashionable libs, that change twice a day, then you write this totally unreadable piece of garbage because you’re forced to use broken libs and callbacks everywhere … and then you realize that the thing is so f*-up that you did all of this for nothing because it can’t even utilize more than one CPU core. And because of bugs you’re not even able to make a simple microservice work good all of the time, and you’re not even abI feel your pain, Robert. Hopefully that project of yours was very short.

And because of bugs you’re not even able to make a simple microservice work good all of the time, and you’re not even able to read code you wrote yesterday…Then you realize that… you need to slice all your code and loops to put them into even more unnecessary and unreadable callbacks, because this piece of shit won’t even do preemption, nor provides a function to do it. So you end up “guessing” how much time the code will take and how “long” the callback needs to be :DThen you pick greatest, most recommended library just to hear that it’s greatest, because it takes “only 10ms” instead of 100ms to do something … but it still isn’t working as expected or isn’t working at all.And the community is so lazy and clueless, that programmers are forced to do this code-butchery and work with not-working libs, for the last 10 years! Because that’s obviously too little time to add a simple yeld and most basic MT functionality which will work as intended.I wouldn’t even deam of doing any kind of multithreading or concurrency support, but how many millions of working hours could be saved by just making a simple language construct which would return control to the f*ing event loop?","5,656 followers",Dave Voorhis,949,6.9K,21.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-wireless-network-and-broadband-technologies-not-used-inside-the-motherboard-of-laptops-desktops-and-mobile-phones-to-replace-wired-connections
4,Not ever. NodeJS is a dreadful backend technology utilizing the worst programming language on earth. Maintainability is awful. Concurrency is an issue. The code is really difficult to read and debug.Speaking as a very Sr. programmer here: I just came off a NodeJS project and I would never use it again and I would argue vehemently against its use on any new project.,168 followers,Vladimir Bozhinovski,607,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-Asgards-technology-is-that-far-ahead-of-Earths-why-havent-they-replaced-Odins-missing-eye

Yes, there are many that we’re actively working on changing, for various reasons.Does changing something a few years after it was done means it was a mistake? Not necessarily. The metrics you optimize for in a startup with 5 developers, one hundred customers, and six months of runway are very different than the metrics you optimize for in a profitable company with 100 developers and a million customers.To say something was a mistake, you would have to show how it hurt the business or at least got close to hurting the business, and I can’t find any technological choice guilty of that.Specifically, in regards to NodeJS, it works, and it works well. Just as well as any other server technology I ever used, and probably better than most (I had no experience with NodeJS prior to joining the company). I really don’t see how using a different language would have made a significant difference. Good code, good design, and good tests (specs!) are not language-specific. You can write great, horrible, and OK-ish software in any language.Lastly, startups aren’t people, they do not have regrets :)",420 followers,Rob Brown,908,7.8K,9.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-Asgards-technology-is-that-far-ahead-of-Earths-why-havent-they-replaced-Odins-missing-eye
